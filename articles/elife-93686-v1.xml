Connexin26 (Cx26) can be regulated directly by CO<sub>2</sub>. This is proposed to be mediated through carbamylation of K125. We show that mutating K125 to glutamate, mimicking the negative charge of carbamylation, causes Cx26 GJCs to be constitutively closed. Through cryo-EM we observe that the K125E mutation pushes a conformational equilibrium towards the channel having a constricted pore entrance, similar to effects seen on raising the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. In previous structures of connexins, the cytoplasmic loop, important in regulation and where K125 is located, is disordered. Through further cryo-EM studies we trap distinct states of Cx26 and observe density for the cytoplasmic loop. The interplay between the position of this loop, the conformations of the transmembrane helices and the position of the N-terminal helix, which controls the aperture to the pore, provides a mechanism for regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>connexin26</kwd><kwd>gap junction channel</kwd><kwd>carbamylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2015-090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brotherton</surname><given-names>Deborah H</given-names></name><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>Alexander David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P010393/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brotherton</surname><given-names>Deborah H</given-names></name><name><surname>Nijjar</surname><given-names>Sarbjit</given-names></name><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>Alexander David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_17136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savva</surname><given-names>Christos G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mutation of Lys125 in connexin26 to glutamate, a carbamylation mimetic, pushes the equilibrium of the gap junction channel seen in cryo-EM towards a more closed conformation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Connexins form hexameric channels in the plasma membrane known as hemichannels, which can either function as regulated passageways between the cell and its environment, or dock with a hemichannel from another cell to form a dodecameric intercellular channel, or gap junction channel (GJC). Connexins have been shown to be directly regulated by various stimuli such as voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valiunas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Young and Peracchia, 2004</xref>), pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bevans and Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2007</xref>) or indirectly via intracellular calcium ion concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peracchia, 2004</xref>). Recent reports based on structural data also suggest that lipids may be involved in regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>). We have shown, however, that connexin26 (Cx26) and other similar Î²-connexins (Cx30, Cx32) can be regulated by the direct action of physiological concentrations of carbon dioxide independently of pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). Mutants of Cx26 are a leading cause of congenital deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</xref>). While many of the mutations are non-syndromic, others lead to severe diseases such as keratitis ichthyosis deafness syndrome (KIDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</xref>). Hemichannels are known to have different properties to GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stout et al., 2004</xref>) and our previous results show that an increase in the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) will open Cx26 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>) but close Cx26 GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>), which are open under physiological conditions of PCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>There are 20 connexin genes in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abascal and Zardoya, 2013</xref>) and several structures have now been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>). The connexin subunit, which is common to all, consists of four transmembrane helices (TMs) with a cytoplasmic N-terminal helix that in the hexameric arrangement of the hemichannel points towards the central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>). In structures of the dodecameric GJC, the extracellular part involved in docking is well defined, whereas the cytoplasmic region is much more variable. A large cytoplasmic loop between TM2 and TM3, shown to be involved in regulation, has not been visible in any structure. Structures of the connexins either have the N-terminal helices tucked back against the wall of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers et al., 2018</xref>), in a raised position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>), in an intermediate position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>), or not well defined in the density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>). The position of the N-terminal helix is thought to be important in the regulation of channel permeability. We have shown previously for human Cx26 GJCs, that the position of the N-terminus is dependent on PCO<sub>2</sub> at constant pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>). By examining structures from protein vitrified at different levels of PCO<sub>2</sub>, we observed that under conditions of high PCO<sub>2</sub> the conformation of the protein was biased towards a conformation where the N-terminus protrudes radially into the pore to form a constriction at the centre (N<sub>Const</sub>). Two distinct conformations of the protein were seen with the predominant difference between them in the cytoplasmic portion of TM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>) where an anticlockwise rotation of TM2 correlated with more definition of the density for the N-terminus. On the other hand, under low PCO<sub>2</sub> conditions the conformation with the more defined N-terminus was not observed and the channel appeared more open (N<sub>Flex</sub>).</p><p>Based on a wealth of mutational data it has been hypothesised that the regulation of hemichannel opening by CO<sub>2</sub> is through a carbamylation reaction of a specific lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meigh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>). This post-translational modification is a reversible and highly labile reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lorimer, 1983</xref>) that effectively changes the charge of a neutral lysine residue to make it negative. A so-called âcarbamylation motifâ was identified in CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>) that when introduced into a related CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin rendered the protein CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). In Cx26 this motif has the sequence K<sub>125</sub>VRIEG<sub>130</sub>. In the crystal structure of the Cx26 GJC that was published in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>), Lys125, which is conserved amongst Î²-connexins that are known to be modulated by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>), is positioned near to the N-terminus of TM3 within ~6 Ã of Arg104 of TM2 of the neighbouring subunit, at either side of the disordered cytoplasmic loop. It was suggested that upon carbamylation, the negative charge of the modified lysine would attract Arg104 causing a conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). In hemichannels, mutation of Lys125 to glutamate, so mimicking the charge of the carbamylated lysine (K125E), results in constitutively open hemichannels consistent with elevated PCO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the corresponding K125R mutation results in hemichannels that cannot be opened by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). In GJCs, the K125R mutation results in the protein not closing in response to CO<sub>2</sub>, though importantly, this mutation does not prevent closure by acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While our previous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>) demonstrated an effect of PCO<sub>2</sub> on the conformation of the protein, neither Lys125 nor Arg104 were visible in the density. Here, we probe this further. By solubilising the protein in the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) rather than dodecyl Î²-D-maltoside (DDM), we obtain much improved density for the cytoplasmic region of the protein. We refine two conformationally diverse structures of the protein, where we see much more defined differences in the cytoplasmic region of the protein than we were able to observe previously. These data suggest a mechanism for closure involving the concerted movements of TM2 and the KVRIEG motif. We show that the structure with the K125E mutation matches the more closed conformation of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conformations of TMs 1, 2 and the KVRIEG motif correlate with position of the N-terminus</title><p>In an attempt to improve the resolution of the cytoplasmic region of the protein, we changed the method of solubilisation and purification by substituting DDM with LMNG and swapping from phosphate buffers to CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> buffers throughout the process. The switch from DDM to LMNG was intended to provide clarity on the provenance of density within the pore of the protein that was observed in our previous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>) and which was considered to be either DDM, as an artefact of solubilisation, or lipid. Lipids have been observed in the pore of other connexins and related large-pored channels and have been suggested to be part of the mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burendei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>). Our use of high CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> buffers throughout purification was intended to keep the gap junction in the closed state throughout, and hence reduce the chance of extraneous lipid or detergent entering the channel pore.</p><p>Data were collected from Cx26 vitrified at a PCO<sub>2</sub> corresponding to 90 mmHg.

However, improved definition of the density in the cytoplasmic region enabled us to model this region more accurately. As before, the position of the cytoplasmic region of TM2 in these maps correlated with the presence or absence of the N-terminus. Maps from two classifications based on the most extreme positions of TM2 and corresponding clarity of the N-terminus were taken forward for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These maps, both of which have a similar resolution of 2.3 Ã, have been respectively denoted by LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> (N-terminus defined and constricting the pore) and LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> (N-terminus not visible) following the nomenclature above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This new structure is an advance on the previous structure of the equivalent conformation obtained in DDM (PDB 7QEW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>). In addition to being able to assign more residues to the density in LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub>, there are two main regions which have been modelled differently. The first area that differs is in TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). Previously we noted variation between the Cx26 crystal structures and our cryo-EM structures in the position of the residues between Val37 and Glu42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>). In the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> structure, the N-terminal region of TM1, preceding this area and comprising residues Gly21 to Phe31, is rotated with respect to that modelled previously, changing the position of the Ï-helix in TM1 from residues Ile20-Leu25 to residues Phe29-Val38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). Thus, the conformation of TM1 in the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> structure differs from the crystal structures at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends through variations in the twist of the helical repeats.</p><p>The second difference is at the cytoplasmic side of TM3. In all structures of connexins solved to date, the cytoplasmic loop has been disordered. For Cx26 this region extends from approximately residue Arg104 at the C-terminus of TM2 to Glu129 at the N-terminus of TM3. In the crystal structure (Cx26-xtal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>) residues 125â129 have been modelled as part of TM3, whereas in our previous structures solved by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>) there was no evidence in the associated maps of the helix extending beyond Glu129. Instead, when analysing these maps it was noted that unassigned density protruded from near to the top of TM3 towards the loop between the N-terminus and TM1 in a manner that resembles models from AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). In the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> map this density is much more clearly defined as the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic loop as it joins onto TM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Residues Gln124 to Ile128, which form part of the K<sub>125</sub>VRIEG<sub>130</sub> motif, important for carbamylation, were modelled into it, with Val126 located just above the linking region between the N-terminal helix and TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Though the density for the side-chains is poor and there is no definitive interaction, Lys125 in this position is relatively close to the side-chain of Arg104 of the neighbouring subunit, with which it had been proposed to form a salt bridge following carbamylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, in the LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> map neither the N-terminus nor the KVRIEG motif are well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> map is reminiscent of the map derived from Cx26 particles vitrified under low PCO<sub>2</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>). In the associated structure the conformation of TM1 is the same as was modelled for the previous structures in DDM. A comparison between the two conformations derived from the new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2">Figure 2âvideos 1 and 2</xref>. The conformational change in TM1 results in the side-chain of Trp24 rotating by ~90Â° between the two extreme positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>). At one of these extremes, it faces the exterior of the protein, and nestles a detergent or lipid tail. At the other extreme, it is within the core of the protein next to Arg143 and Ala88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The conformation in the N<sub>Flex</sub> structure would not be compatible with the position adopted by TM2 in the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> structure because Thr86 and Leu89 would clash with Phe31 and Ile30 on TM1 of the neighbouring subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2">Figure 2âvideos 1 and 2</xref>). The rotation of TM1 changes not only how TM1 interacts with the N-terminus, but also the conformation of the linker between the N-terminal helix and TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This in turn would not be compatible with the conformation of the KVRIEG motif in LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Overall, therefore the constriction of the channel by the N-terminal helix is associated with changes in the positions of TMs 1, 2 and the KVRIEG motif of the cytoplasmic loop.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG)-N<sub>Const</sub> and LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> structures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overall superposition showing the movement of TM2 and the link between the N-terminus and TM1.

We, therefore, carried out another classification of the particles focussed on the cytoplasmic region of a single subunit (see Methods). As above, this resulted in a range of maps showing varying positions of the TMs and clarity of the N-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, in one case and where the N-terminus was clearly defined, extra density was also seen for the cytoplasmic loop, albeit at low resolution. The structure was tentatively built into the density with the cytoplasmic loop of the classified subunit in a conformation resembling models from AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and with a complete N-terminus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Only residues 109â114 were omitted in the final structure as the placement of these residues was ambiguous. In the maps associated with this structure there is density that we cannot assign, near to Lys125, between Ser19 in the TM1-N-term linker, Tyr212 of TM4, and Tyr97 on TM3 of the neighbouring subunit, which may be a small molecule that has bound. Overall, the conformation of the subunit is very similar to the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> structure from the classification based on the masked hemichannels, with an RMSD of 0.38 Ã for 198 CÎ± atoms. A second structure was also refined that had a conformation much more similar to the LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> structure (LMNG-N<sub>Flex-mon</sub>) (RMSD 0.45 for 176 CÎ± atoms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Rather surprisingly, given the success of the hemichannel mask-based classification, only the subunit upon which the focussed classification had been carried out had this conformation, with the density from the other subunits appearing more like the map before focussed classification. When hexameric symmetry was applied to the subunit, though the conformation of the N-terminus caused the aperture of the pore to appear closed, steric clashes involving the N-terminal residues suggested a symmetric arrangement of this conformation would not be possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

Based on our experience with mutations of Cx26 we hypothesised that, if K125E results in constitutively open hemichannels, the same mutation would result in constitutively closed GJCs. Thus, if it were to be true, we could investigate the structure of the proteins under identical buffer conditions where the channel was biased towards open or closed conformations. To verify the effect of mutating Lys125 to a glutamic acid, we used an established dye transfer assay between coupled cells to assess gap junction function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>).

Despite a number of recent high-resolution structural studies of connexins, the structural basis for pore closure or opening in response to a stimulus is still poorly understood. Cx26 is affected by PCO<sub>2</sub>. We have previously shown that there is a correlation in the closure of the Cx26 GJC with the level of PCO<sub>2</sub> and also with the position of TM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>). Our improved data show that, not only does pore closure and the position of the N-terminal helix correlate with TM2, but also with the conformation of TM1 and importantly, the KVRIEG motif on the regulatory cytoplasmic loop.</p><p>The conformation of the KVRIEG motif and the cytoplasmic loop is interesting. In the original low-resolution crystal structure of Cx26 (Cx26-xtal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>), the KVRIEG motif is modelled as part of TM3. However, in most other structures of connexin GJCs, the equivalent residues are not observed in the density, and it appears there is a breakdown in helical conformation at this point. In the N<sub>Const</sub> structures, the KVRIEG motif forms an extended conformation mimicking the conformations seen in AlphaFold2 structures. In fact, the conformation of the complete loop that we observe in the subunit focussed classification is similar to that seen in AlphaFold2 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). Essentially the KVRIEG motif can be described as a break in TM3 as the helix extends at either side of this extended motif. Although the low resolution of the density of the complete loop prevents the accurate positioning of the residues, the combination of our structure and the predicted models paves the way for further studies of the importance of particular interactions in the loop.</p><p>From a comparison of our structures with those of other connexins it is apparent that the position of TM2 seen in the N<sub>Const</sub> structures is an outlier, with a rotation of the cytoplasmic region of the helix compared to other structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). With respect to the N-terminus the various reported structures can be considered in three main categories: those with the N-terminus folded into the channel pore (N-down) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Myers et al., 2018</xref>); those where the N-terminus is lifted (N-up) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>); and those where the N-terminus is flexible (N-flex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>). The conformation of the Cx26-N<sub>Const</sub> structure most resembles the structures with N-down as these have similar conformations of TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, whereas the N-terminus in these latter structures folds flat against the pore of the channel to give an open aperture, in the Cx26-N<sub>Const</sub> structure, it would be prevented from doing so by the position of TM2 and so is forced outwards to form a much more constricted aperture. The conformation of TM1 in the Cx26-N<sub>Flex</sub> structures, which we consider to be open, is more similar to structures of other connexins in the N-flex or N-up conformations. For Cx36 and Cx43 these conformations have been suggested to represent the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>), though for Cx32 this has been described as an open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>). The apparent outlier amongst the Cx26 structures is the Cx26-xtal structure where the N-terminus points into the pore, but the overall conformation is more similar to the Cx26-N<sub>Flex</sub> conformation. However, relative to this latter structure the helix is pulled back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) so is more open than seen in the Cx26-N<sub>Const</sub> structure.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the two structures derived from the lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) classification with other structures of connexins.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Superposition of a single subunit from the LMNG-N<sub>Const</sub> (cyan) and LMNG-N<sub>Flex</sub> (yellow) structures on: connexin26 (Cx26) crystal structure (chartreuse, PDB ID 2ZW3); Cx32 (wheat, 7zxm) Cx50 (white, 7JJP); Cx43 in up (red, 7XQF), intermediate (chocolate, 7XQI), and down (salmon, 7F94) conformations; Cx36 in down (pink, 7XNH) and flexible (raspberry, 7XKT) conformations.

The fact that similar density remains when the protein is solubilised with LMNG rather than DDM strongly suggests that this molecule cannot be detergent and is more likely to be a lipid. Though the presence of the molecule may still be an artefact of either the solubilisation process or heterologous expression in insect cells, it is interesting to note that a lipid-like molecule in this position appears to be a constant feature of all the high-resolution cryo-EM maps associated with the structures of connexins where the N-terminus is not in the N-down position. This includes both GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>) and hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qi et al., 2023b</xref>) and is irrespective of the solubilisation method or whether the structure has been solved in the presence of detergent or nanodiscs. It seems that the lipid is only displaced when the N-terminus adopts the pore lining position. As this position is not possible in the Cx26-N<sub>Const</sub> structures due to the presence of TM2, the lipid remains.</p><p>It must be asked whether the N<sub>Const</sub> structures that we observe represent the closed state. It is difficult to model the first three residues of the N-terminus unambiguously, presumably due to the breakdown in sixfold symmetry at this point, but with minor changes to the side-chains, the centre of the pore could be closed. The presence of the lipid would seal any other apertures between the neighbouring N-termini. Rather surprisingly given that we can isolate a symmetrical conformation of the protein using C6 symmetry, reconstructions of the full dodecamer following the focussed classifications of the single subunit do not show an influence of the conformation of that subunit on its neighbours. While this is consistent with structural studies on Cx43 gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2023a</xref>) the stochastic nature of the subunit conformations contrasts with studies of Cx26 hemichannels in cell membranes where significant cooperativity has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Wolf et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There is a clear correlation between the results of the dye transfer assays and the structural results, supporting the interpretation that the N<sub>Const</sub> conformation is more like the closed state. The effect on the structure of Cx26 in changing K125 to a glutamate both in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and in HEPES buffer is consistent with the hypothesis that the CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated closure of the gap junctions is caused by the carbamylation of K125. It would also suggest that even under high PCO<sub>2</sub> conditions the WT protein is not completely carbamylated during vitrification. Given that the carbamylation reaction is highly labile, this is perhaps not surprising. The hypothesis has been that the negative charge introduced onto the lysine side-chain would enable it to form a salt bridge with Arg104 from the neighbouring subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, mutation of Arg104 to alanine abolishes CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in both GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>) and hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>), similar to the mutation of Lys125. In models from AlphaFold2, which differ in conformation from the structure upon which the hypothesis was based, it is also notable that the lysine is located next to the arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In the N<sub>Const</sub> structures the position of the Lys/Glu125 main chain is near to Arg104, even though TM2 moves further from TM3 in moving from the N<sub>Flex</sub> to the N<sub>Const</sub> conformations. Though there is no clear interaction between the two residues, with minor adjustments of the side-chains, the residues could be made to interact and the absence of a definite interaction may be due to distortions during the vitrification process or radiation damage to which acidic residues are more prone. Glutamate is also much shorter than the carbamylated lysine, so that while the charges would be equivalent, the two residues might not be able to make the same specific interactions. Our results here show that the negative charge at residue 125 is important for altering conformation. For hemichannels, a direct interaction between the two residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meigh et al., 2015</xref>) is strongly supported by a mutant in which both R104 and K125 are replaced by cysteines, allowing a potential cross-link through a disulphide bond. This mutant responds to a change in redox potential in a similar way to which the WT protein responds to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meigh et al., 2015</xref>). However, although both Lys125 and Arg104 are necessary for CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent gap junction closure, attributing the induction of the conformational change in the gap junction to a single salt bridge between Lys125 and Arg104 may be an over-simplification. For example, there may be other interactions involved and it is possible that multiple carbamylation events contribute to gap junction sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brotherton et al., 2020</xref>). Given that we observe some protein in the N<sub>Const</sub> conformation even when Arg125 is mutated to arginine, our data would be consistent with a conformationally flexible protein, in which the introduction of a negative charge would stabilise one particular conformation, rather than causing a conformational change per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of conformational changes.</title><p>Schematic view of the cytoplasmic region of two opposing subunits within one hemichannel of the gap junction. The open structure on the left and the constricted structure on the right are in a dynamic equilibrium.

While these mutations have been mapped on the structure previously, the position of Ala88, mutation of which to Val causes KIDS, is interesting with regard to the new conformations of TM1. This mutation, which is at the flexion point of TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), results in leaky hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mhaske et al., 2013</xref>) and has been shown to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity either to the gap junctions, in closing the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nijjar et al., 2021</xref>), or to the hemichannels in opening the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meigh et al., 2014</xref>). In the N<sub>const</sub> structures the C<sub>Î²</sub> of Ala88 lies within 4.2 Ã of Trp24, which moves during the conformational change of TM1. Replacement of the alanine with the bulkier valine would hinder this conformation from being adopted and therefore, would disfavour the closed conformation. Interestingly, the alanine and the tryptophan are located next to Arg143. Mutation of Arg143 to tryptophan is a very common mutation that leads to non-syndromic hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</xref>). Overall our data, summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, provide important mechanistic insight into the conformational changes behind pore closure in Cx26, which is useful for understanding how mutations in the protein can lead to disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Hexameric connexin26 (Cx26) hemichannels are closed under basal conditions and open in response to CO2. In contrast, when forming a dodecameric gap-junction, channels are open under basal conditions and close with increased CO2 levels. Previous experiments have implicated Cx26 residue K125 in the gating mechanism by CO2, which is thought to become carbamylated by CO2. Carbamylation is a labile post-translational modification that confers negative charge to the K125 side chain. How the introduction of a negative charge at K125 causes a change in gating is unclear, but it has been proposed that carbamylated K125 forms a salt bridge with the side chain at R104, causing a conformational change in the channel. It is also unclear how overall gating is controlled by changes in CO2, since there is significant variability between structures of gap-junction channels and the cytoplasmic domain is generally poorly resolved. Structures of WT Cx26 gap-junction channels determined in the presence of various concentrations of CO2 have suggested that the cytoplasmatic N-terminus changes conformation depending on the concentration of the gas, occluding the pore when CO2 levels are high.</p><p>In the present manuscript, Deborah H. Brotherton and collaborators use an intercellular dye-transfer assay to show that Cx26 gap-junction channels containing the K125E mutation, which mimics carbamylation caused by CO2, is constitutively closed even at CO2 concentrations where WT channels are open. Several cryo-EM structures of WT and mutant Cx26 gap junction channels were determined at various conditions and using classification procedures that extracted more than one structural class from some of the datasets. Together, the features on each of the different structures are generally consistent with previously obtained structures at different CO2 concentrations and support the mechanism that is proposed in the manuscript. The most populated class for K125E channels determined at high CO2 shows a pore that is constricted by the N-terminus, and a cytoplasmic region that was better resolved than in WT channels, suggesting increased stability. The K125E structure closely resembles one of the two major classes obtained for WT channels at high CO2. These findings support the hypothesis that the K125E mutation biases channels towards the closed state, while WT channels are in an equilibrium between open and closed states even in the presence of high CO2. Consistently, a structure of K125E obtained in the absence of CO2 appeared to also represent a closed state but at a lower resolution, suggesting that CO2 has other effects on the channel beyond carbamylation of K125 that also contribute to stabilizing the closed state. Structures determined for K125R channels, which are constitutively open because arginine cannot be carbamylated, and would be predicted to represent open states, yielded apparently inconclusive results.</p><p>A non-protein density was found to be trapped inside the pore in all structures obtained using both DDM and LMNG detergents, suggesting that the density represents a lipid rather than a detergent molecule. It is thought that the lipid could contribute to the process of gating, but this remains speculative. The cytoplasmic region in the tentatively closed structural class of the WT channel obtained using LMNG was better resolved. An additional portion of the cytoplasmic face could be resolved by focusing classification on a single subunit, which had a conformation that resembled the AlphaFold prediction. However, this single-subunit conformation was incompatible with a C6-symmetric arrangement. Together, the results suggest that the identified states of the channel represent open states and closed states resulting from interaction with CO2. Therefore, the observed conformational changes illuminate a possible structural mechanism for channel gating in response to CO2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93686.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Brotherton et al. describes a structural study of connexin-26 (Cx26) gap junction channel mutant K125E, which is designed to mimic the CO2-inhibited form of the channel.

We respond to the individual comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Brotherton et al. describes a structural study of connexin-26 (Cx26) gap junction channel mutant K125E, which is designed to mimic the CO2-inhibited form of the channel.

Lysine has a large side chain, and its carbamylation would make it even slightly larger. While the authors make a compelling case for E125-induced conformational changes focusing primarily on the negative charge, I wonder whether they considered the extent to which their observation with this mutant may translate to the carbamoylated lysine in the wild-type Cx26, considering not only the charge but also the size of the modified side-chain.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We agree that the difference in size will have a different effect on the structure. For kinases, aspartate or glutamate are often used as mimics of phosphorylated serine or threonine and these will have the same issues. The fact that we cannot resolve the relevant side-chains in the density may be indicative that the mutation doesnât give the whole story. It may be able to shift the equilibrium towards the closed conformation, but not stably trap the molecule in that conformation. We include a comment to this effect in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanism underlying the well-documented CO2-regulated activity of connexin 26 (Cx26) remains poorly understood.

Additionally, the cryo-EM maps were not effectively presented, making it difficult for readers to grasp the message.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised the manuscript so that the novelty of this study is more apparent.There are three major points</p><p>(1) The carbamylation mimetic pushes the conformation towards the closed conformation. Previously we just showed that CO2 pushes the conformation towards this conformation. Though we could show this was not due to pH, and could speculate this was due to carbamylation as suggested by previous mutagenesis studies, our data did not provide any mechanism whereby Lys125 was involved.</p><p>(2) In going from the open to closed conformations, not only is a conformational change in TM2 involved, as we saw previously, but also a conformational change in TM1, the linker to the N-terminus and the cytoplasmic loop. Thus there is a clear connection between Lys125 and the conformation of the pore-closing N-terminus.</p><p>(3) We observe for the first time in any connexin structure, density for the cytoplasmic loop. Since this loop is important in regulation, knowing how it might influence the positions of the transmembrane helices is important information if we are to understand how connexins can be regulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>The reviewers have agreed on a list of suggested revisions that would improve the eLife assessment if implemented, which are as follows:</p><p>(1) For completeness, Figure 1 could be supplied with an example of how the experiment would look like in the presence of CO2 - for the wild-type and for the K125E mutant. presumably for the wild-type this has been done previously in exactly this assay format, but this control would be an important part of characterization for the mutant. Page 4, lines 105106; &quot;unsurprisingly, Cx26K125E gap junctions remain closed at a PCO2 of 55 mmHg.&quot; The data should be presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the data with a PCO2 of 55mmH. This is now Figure 4 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Would AlphaFold predictions show any interpretable differences in the E125 mutant, compared to the K125 (the wild-type)?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried this in response to the reviewerâs suggestion. We did not see any interpretable differences. In general AlphaFold is not recognised as giving meaningful information around point mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The K125R mutant appears to be a more effective control for extracting significant features from the K125E maps. Given that the use of a buffer containing high PCO2 is essential for obtaining high-resolution maps, wildtype Cx26 is unsuitable as an appropriate control. The K125R map, obtained at a high resolution (2.1Ã), supports its suitability as a robust control.</p></disp-quote><p>Though we are unsure what the referee is referring to here, we have rewritten this section and compare against the K125R map (figure 5a) as well as that derived from the wild-type protein. The important point is that the K125E mutant, causes a structural change that is consistent with the closure of the gap junctions that we observe in the dye-transfer assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Likewise, the rationale for using wildtype Cx26 maps obtained in DDM is unclear. Wildtype Cx26 seems to yield much better cryo-EM maps in LMNG. We suggest focusing the manuscript on the higher-quality maps, and providing supporting information from the DDM maps to discuss consistency between observations and the likely possibility that the nonprotein density in the pore is lipid and not detergent.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for comparing the mutants against the wt Cx26 maps obtained in DDM was because the mutants were also solubilised in DDM. However, taking the lead from the refereesâ comments, we have now rewritten the manuscript so that we first focus on the data we obtain from protein solubilised in LMNG. We feel this makes our message much clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In general, the rationale for utilizing cryo-EM maps with the entire selected particles is unclear. Although the overall resolutions may slightly improve in this approach, the regions of interest, such as the N-terminus and the cytoplasmic loop, appear to be better ordered afer further classifications. The paper would be more comprehensible if it focuses solely on the classes representing the pore-constricting N-terminus (PCN) and the pore-open flexible Nterminus (POFN) conformations. Also, the nomenclatures used in the manuscript, such as &quot;WT90-Class1&quot;, &quot;K125E90-1&quot;, &quot;LMNG90-class1&quot;, &quot;LMNG90-mon-pcn&quot; are confusing.</p><p>LMNG90s are also wildtype; K125E-90-1 is in Class1 for this mutant and is similar to WT90Class2, which represents the PCN conformation. More consistent and intuitive nomenclatures would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the refereesâ comments. This should now be clearer with our rewritten manuscript where we have simplified this considerably. We now call the conformations NConst (N-terminus defined and constricting the pore) and NFlex (N-terminus not visible) and keep this consistent throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) A potential salt bridge between the carbamylated K125 and R104 is proposed to account for the prevalence of Class-1 (i.e., PCN) in the majority of cryo-EM particles. However, the side chain densities are not well-defined, suggesting that such an interaction may not be strong enough to trap Cx26 in a closed conformation. Furthermore, the absence of experimental data to support this mechanism makes it unclear how likely this mechanism may be. Combining simple mutagenesis, such as R104E, with a dye transfer assay could offer support for this mechanism. Are there any published experimental results that could help address this question without the need for additional experimental work? Alternatively, as acknowledged in the discussion, this mechanism may be deemed as an &quot;over-simplification.&quot; What is an alternative mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>R104 has been mutated to alanine in gap junctions and tested in a dye transfer assay as now mentioned in the text (Nijar et al, J Physiol 2021) supporting this role. In hemichannels R104 has been mutated to both alanine and glutamate and tested through dye loading assays Meigh et al, eLife 2013. Also in hemichannels R104 and K125 have been mutated to cysteines allowing them to be cross-linked through a disulphide bond. This mutant responds to a change in redox potential in a similar way to which the wild type protein responds to CO2 (Meigh et al, Open Biol 2015). Therefore, there is no doubt that the residues are important for the mechanism and the salt-bridge interaction seems a plausible mechanism to reconcile the mutagenesis data, however we cannot be sure that there are not other interactions involved that are necessary for closure. This information has now been included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The cryo-EM maps presented in the manuscript propose that gap junctions are constitutively open under normal PCO2 as the flexible N-terminus clears the solute permeation pathway in the middle of the channel. However, hemichannels appear to be closed under normal PCO2. It is puzzling how gap junctions can open when hemichannels are closed under normal PCO2 conditions. If this question has been addressed in previous studies, the underlying mechanism should be explicitly described in the introduction. If it remains an open question, differences in the opening mechanisms between hemichannels and gap junctions should be investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect this is due to the difference in flexibility of gap junctions relative to hemichannels. However, a discussion of this is beyond this paper and would be complete speculation based on hemichannel structures of other connexins, performed in different buffering systems. There are no high resolution structures of Cx26 hemichannels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) A mystery density likely representing a lipid is abruptly introduced, but the significance of this discovery is unclear. It is hard to place the lipid on Figure S6 in the wider context of everything else that is discussed in the text. It would be helpful for readers if a figure were provided to show where the density is located in relation to all the other regions that are extensively discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised text this section has been completely rewritten. We have now include a more informative view in a new figure (Figure 1 â figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Including and displaying even tentative pore-diameter measurements for the different states - this would be helpful for readers and provide a more direct visual cue as to the difference between open and closed states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have purposely avoided giving precise measurements to the pore-diameter, since this depends on how we model the N-terminus. The first three residues are difficult to model into the density without causing stearic clashes with the neighbouring subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Given that no additional experiments for channel function were carried out, it would be useful if to provide a more detailed discussion of additional mutagenesis results from the literature that are related to the experimental results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amplified this in the discussion (see answer to point 6).</p><p>The reviewers also agreed that improvements in the presentation of the data would strengthen the manuscript. Here is a summary list of suggestions by reviewers aimed at helping improve how the data is presented:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Why is the pipette bright green in the top image, but rather weakly green in the bottom image in Figure 1 - is this the case for all images?</p></disp-quote><p>(Now figure 4) This depends on whether the pipette was in the focal plane of view or not. The important point of these images is the difference in intensity of the donor vs the recipient cell. The graphs in figure 4c illustrate clearly the difference between the wild-type and the mutant gap junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In figures 2-5, labels would help a lot in understanding what is shown - while the legends do provide the information on what is presented, it would help the reader to see the models/maps with labels directly in the panel. For example, Figure 2a/b - just indicating &quot;WT90 Cx26&quot; in pink and &quot;K125E90&quot; in blue directly in the panel would reduce the work for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively modified the labels in the figures to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 4 - magenta and pink are fairly close, and to avoid confusion it might be useful to use a different color selection.

Also E129-R98/R99 interaction is hard to acknowledge from the figure. It seems that the side chain density of E129 is not strong enough to support the modeled orientation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now Figure 1c. While the density in this region is sufficient to be confident of the main chain, we agree that the side chain density for the E129-R98/R99 interaction is not sufficiently clear to draw attention to and have removed the associated comment from the figure legend. The density is focussed on the linker between TM1 and the N-terminus and the KVRIEG motif. We prefer to omit R104, in order to keep the focus on this region. As described in the manuscript, the density for the R104 side chain is poor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Fig. 3 c; Label the N-terminus and KVRIEG motif in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Now Figure 1b.

Perhaps would be useful to include an inset showing this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 2b slightly and added an explanation to highlight the clash. It is slightly confusing because the residues involved belong to neighbouring subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The discussion related to Figure 6 is very hard to follow for readers who are not familiar with the context of abbreviations included on the figure labels. This figure could be improved to allow a general readership to identify more clearly each of the features and structural differences that are discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively changed the text and updated the labels on the figure to make it much easier for the reader to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below, you can find the individual reviews by each of the three reviewers.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In Figure 2d-e, the text discusses differences between K125E 90-1 and WT 90-class2 (7QEW), yet the figure compares K125E with 7QEQ.
