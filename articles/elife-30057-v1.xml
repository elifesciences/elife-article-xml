Metabolomic, genetic, and pharmacological analyses confirm increased trehalose synthesis and further show that trehalose not only supports survival as a stress protectant but also serves as a glycolytic input. Furthermore, we provide evidence that metabolic cycling between trehalose and glucose is necessary for this dual function of trehalose.

Insulin is a hormone that travels throughout the body to signal when an animal is well fed. Insulin signaling inhibits the activity of a protein called FoxO, which otherwise switches on and off hundreds of genes to control the starvation response.</p><p>The roundworm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, has been well studied in the laboratory, and often has to cope with starvation in the wild. These worms can pause their development if no food is available, or divert to a different developmental path if they anticipate that food will be short in future. As with more complex animals, the worm responds to starvation by reducing insulin-like signaling, which in turn activates a FoxO protein called daf-16. When the worms stop feeding, daf-16 is switched on, which is crucial for survival.</p><p>It was known how daf-16 stops the roundworm’s development, but it was not known how it helps the worms to survive starvation. Now, Hibshman et al. have compared normal roundworm larvae to larvae that are missing the gene for daf-16 to determine how this protein influences the roundworm’s ability to survive starvation.</p><p>The worms were examined with and without food, to look for which genes were switched on and off by daf-16 during starvation. This revealed that daf-16 controls metabolism, activating a metabolic shortcut that makes the worms produce glucose and begin turning it into another type of sugar, called trehalose. This sugar usually promotes survival in conditions where water is limiting, like dehydration and high salt, but it can also be broken down to release energy. The levels of trehalose in the worms rose within hours of the onset of starvation.</p><p>To confirm the importance of trehalose in surviving starvation, roundworms with mutations in genes involved in glucose or trehalose production were examined, as was the effect of giving starving worms glucose or trehalose. Disrupting the production of sugars caused the worms to die sooner of starvation, while supplementing with sugar had the opposite effect meaning the worms survived for longer.</p><p>Taken together, these findings reveal that daf-16 protects against starvation by shifting metabolism towards the production of trehalose. This helps worms to survive by both protecting them from stress and providing them with a source of energy. These findings not only extend the current understanding of how animals respond to starvation, but could also lead to improved understanding of diseases where this response goes wrong, including diabetes and obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>starvation</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>gluconeogenesis</kwd><kwd>glyoxylate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1120206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baugh</surname><given-names>L Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117408-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baugh</surname><given-names>L Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO restructures metabolism during acute starvation to promote synthesis of trehalose, which supports survival as a stress protectant and energy source.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrient availability naturally fluctuates, and animals have a variety of physiological responses that allow them to cope with nutrient stress. Starvation resistance is critical to evolutionary fitness, and fasting is an important clinical intervention with broad-ranging effects on aging and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longo and Mattson, 2014</xref>). The roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> often faces starvation in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>), and it has developmental adaptations that facilitate starvation survival at multiple points in its lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelo and Van Gilst, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baugh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Golden and Riddle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindler et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, dauer larvae develop as an alternative to the third larval stage in response to high population density and limited food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Golden and Riddle, 1984</xref>). Notably, dauer larvae form in anticipation of starvation (food is actually required for dauer development), provisioning fat and developing morphological modifications that support survival. In contrast, worms that hatch in the absence of food (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in the laboratory) remain in a state of developmental arrest known as ‘L1 arrest’ (or ‘L1 diapause’) until they feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baugh, 2013</xref>). Unlike dauer larvae, arrested L1 larvae have no morphological modification and are provisioned maternally. <italic>C. elegans</italic> L1 arrest provides a powerful organismal model to investigate gene regulatory and metabolic mechanisms that enable animals to cope with acute starvation.</p><p>Insulin-like signaling is a critical regulator of starvation survival during L1 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muñoz and Riddle, 2003</xref>). Feeding promotes insulin-like signaling through the receptor <italic>daf-2</italic>/InsR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Baugh, 2014</xref>), which antagonizes the transcription factor <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ogg et al., 1997</xref>). In the absence of insulin-like signaling, <italic>daf-16</italic> is active and promotes developmental arrest and starvation survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>). <italic>daf-16</italic> promotes developmental arrest by inhibiting the <italic>dbl-1</italic>/TGF-β and <italic>daf-12</italic> steroid hormone receptor pathways, but these pathways do not affect starvation survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaplan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Ashrafi, 2008</xref>). That is, the effects of <italic>daf-16</italic> on developmental arrest and starvation resistance are distinct, and how <italic>daf-16</italic> promotes starvation resistance is unknown. <italic>daf-16</italic> also promotes longevity in fed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>), and understanding how it does so has received considerable attention. A variety of studies have identified <italic>daf-16</italic> target genes in the context of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>), resulting in identification of over 3000 genes affected directly or indirectly by <italic>daf-16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tepper et al., 2013</xref>). However, these experiments typically examined the effect of constitutive <italic>daf-16</italic> activation in fed <italic>daf-2</italic>/InsR mutant adults rather than conditional effects of <italic>daf-16</italic> in response to nutrient availability. We examined the effect of <italic>daf-16</italic> on gene expression in L1 larvae starved for ~12 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaplan et al., 2015</xref>), but this is well after the starvation response is mounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>), and this experiment did not include nutrient availability as a factor. Consequently, the immediate-early targets of <italic>daf-16</italic> involved in the conditional response to starvation have not been identified.</p><p>Metabolic adaptations in dauer larvae represent a ‘microaerobic’ metabolism, with reduced reliance on respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, instead oxidizing fatty acids as fuel for cellular maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braeckman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O'Riordan and Burnell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wadsworth and Riddle, 1989</xref>). Expression analysis suggests that dauer larvae are metabolically similar to long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic>/InsR mutant adults, with expression of enzymes involved in the glyoxylate shunt (a ‘shortcut’ through the TCA cycle), gluconeogenesis, and trehalose synthesis upregulated in both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Depuydt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McElwee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Penkov et al., 2015</xref>). However, the acute starvation response that occurs during L1 arrest or other non-dauer stages has not been compared to dauer larvae. Given the unique features of dauer larvae, it is unclear whether their metabolic adaptations represent a universal starvation response.</p><p>Trehalose is a disaccharide of glucose formed by an α–α, 1–1 glycosidic bond. Trehalose buffers unicellular and multicellular organisms from osmotic stress, desiccation, heat stress, and freezing, and it can improve proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Behm, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elbein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elliott et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">François et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain and Roy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamitina and Strange, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Page-Sharp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tapia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>). Trehalose is not synthesized in vertebrates, but it confers desiccation tolerance on human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, simultaneous disruption of both trehalose 6-phosphate synthase genes (<italic>tps-1</italic> and <italic>tps-2</italic>) reduces desiccation tolerance in dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>). The glyoxylate shunt also supports desiccation tolerance in dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>). However, regulation of these metabolic adaptations is not understood. Furthermore, it remains unclear what role trehalose or trehalose synthesis plays in mediating starvation resistance.</p><p>The protective role of trehalose in conditions where water is limiting is attributed to its function as a compatible solute and its ability to replace water molecules at the surface of proteins and lipid bilayers, stabilizing polar interactions and preserving membrane organization and protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leekumjorn and Sum, 2008</xref>). We refer to this biochemical mechanism of trehalose function as that of a ‘stress protectant’. However, trehalose can also be used as an energy source to fuel glycolysis. For example, trehalose is the primary circulating sugar in insects, satisfying the high-energy demands of flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clegg and Evans, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wyatt and Kale, 1957</xref>). Given multiple reported physiological roles of trehalose and variation across taxa, there is debate over the relative importance of the different roles of trehalose in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hohmann et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We used a combination of genome-wide expression analysis and metabolomics to determine the nutrient-dependent effects of <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO in recently hatched L1-stage larvae of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> We report that during acute starvation, <italic>daf-16</italic> promotes carbon flux through the glyoxylate shunt and gluconeogenesis towards trehalose synthesis, similar to the metabolic adaptations that occur in dauer larvae. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this metabolic shift is physiologically significant and supports starvation resistance. Multiple lines of evidence show that trehalose promotes starvation survival through two distinct mechanisms: as a stress protectant without being catabolized and as an energy source for glycolysis. We also show that trehalose and glucose interconvert and that interconversion is necessary for the dual function of trehalose. This work elucidates how <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO promotes starvation resistance, and it reveals a central role of trehalose metabolism in maintaining organismal energy homeostasis and stress resistance during acute starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>daf-16/</italic>FoxO promotes the glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and trehalose synthesis</title><p>We performed genome-wide expression analysis to determine the immediate effects of <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO activity in L1-stage larvae upon starvation. We used a ‘double-bleach’ procedure to ensure synchronized hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baugh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>). We measured expression in wild-type (WT) and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant larvae shortly after hatching with and without food (<italic>E. coli</italic> HB101, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data compare favorably with a published time series of WT gene expression using the same staging procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>), confirming a robust effect of nutrient availability and that the samples represent recently hatched larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Nutrient availability had a substantially larger effect on mRNA expression than genotype, with ~4000 genes displaying differential expression between fed and starved conditions in both WT and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; false-discovery rate [FDR]&lt;0.05). Given the <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant phenotypes during L1 starvation (starvation-sensitive and arrest-defective), it was surprising that <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants did not have a larger effect on the starvation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with only 650 genes affected in starved larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). That is, the starvation response was largely intact in <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This result demonstrates that other pathways are critical for the starvation response, and it is consistent with capturing relatively early, direct effects of <italic>daf-16</italic>. Indeed, DAF-16 binds approximately half of the genes affected by it during starvation based on modENCODE ChIP-seq results (hypergeometric enrichment p=3.3E-8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niu et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting direct regulation of these genes. Notably, <italic>daf-16</italic> had much less of an effect on fed larvae, affecting only 17 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is consistent with <italic>daf-16</italic> functioning in starved but not fed larvae, where it is localized to the cytoplasm due to antagonism from insulin-like signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weinkove et al., 2006</xref>).

This analysis addresses our experimental design explicitly, but it has less statistical power than a pairwise test, and it identified only 103 genes that are regulated by nutrient availability in <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent fashion (FDR &lt; 0.05).

Many glycolysis enzymes are bidirectional and also catalyze the reverse gluconeogenic reactions, but several genes are exclusive to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, allowing us to infer how gene expression changes affect carbon flux. Hexokinase and pyruvate kinase catalyze unidirectional glycolytic reactions, and none of the five genes encoding these two enzymes were affected by <italic>daf-16</italic>. In contrast, the gluconeogenic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>pyc-1</italic>) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, <italic>pck-1</italic> and <italic>pck-2</italic>) were upregulated during starvation in WT, but not in <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants.

We conducted targeted metabolomics for panels of amino acids, organic acids, and acyl carnitines using the same experimental design as for expression analysis.

However, none of the individual metabolites targeted for analysis was significantly affected by genotype during starvation after correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We suspect our inability to detect significant individual differences is due to lack of statistical power since an apparent effect on the overall metabolic profile was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

It is possible that trehalose functions similarly as a stress protectant during starvation, preserving integrity of proteins, membranes or other cellular components to support survival.

Notably, these two hypothetical roles of trehalose are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Catabolism of trehalose and use as an energy source requires trehalase activity.

We confirmed that the biochemical assay we use to measure trehalose levels does not detect α–β trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In contrast to α–α trehalose, supplementation with 50 mM α–β trehalose did not significantly increase internal α–α trehalose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that α–β trehalose is not substantially converted to α–α trehalose in vivo.

Indeed, trehalose levels decreased over time during extended L1 starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with it being used as an energy source.

We show that enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and trehalose synthesis are transcriptionally upregulated during L1 starvation. These findings corroborate expression analysis of dauer larvae, suggesting a conserved starvation response across developmental stages despite unique features of dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braeckman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McElwee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and Kim, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, we show that changes in expression have physiological consequence, affecting trehalose levels and starvation resistance. We provide evidence that starved larvae are sensitive to disruption of the glyoxylate shunt, which feeds into gluconeogenesis, in contrast to fed larvae. Conversely, starved larvae are relatively insensitive to disruption of glycolysis, in contrast to fed larvae. Thus, metabolic flux shifts from the TCA cycle and electron transport chain to the glyoxylate shunt and from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis during starvation. We show that this metabolic shift culminates in increased levels of trehalose, and that trehalose supports starvation survival. Expression of <italic>icl-1</italic>, the isocitrate lyase/malate synthase enzyme central to the glyoxylate shunt, is upregulated by starvation at other developmental stages as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting the metabolic shift we describe is part of a general starvation response rather than being specific to L1 or dauer larvae. Critically, we show that this metabolic shift is under direct regulation of insulin-like signaling via DAF-16/FoxO. That is, DAF-16 binds directly to the <italic>tps-1</italic> promoter and the 14 other metabolic enzymes whose transcription is activated by <italic>daf-16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schuster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Mammals do not synthesize trehalose, but mammalian FOXO1 also upregulates gluconeogenesis during nutrient stress, suggesting broad conservation of the effects of insulin-like signaling on metabolic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Puigserver et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Intermediary metabolism is subject to extensive post-translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arif et al., 2017</xref>), and such regulation likely reinforces the patterns of transcriptional regulation we describe for L1 starvation. Although the changes in mRNA abundance we report are statistically significant with concerted effects on carbon metabolism, in many cases the fold-changes are relatively modest. It is likely that these patterns of transcriptional regulation are reinforced by post-translational control, possibly even under the control of insulin-like signaling. Indeed, enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are known to be subject to post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tripodi et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the expression patterns we report are consistent with the changes in metabolic flux observed during starvation, but transcription is unlikely to be the sole cause for these physiological changes. The integration of transcriptional and post-translational regulation of metabolism during starvation is an exciting area for further research.</p><p>We show that trehalose synthesis is an effector mechanism by which reduced insulin-like signaling and <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO activity promote starvation resistance. Disruption of trehalose synthesis reduces starvation survival, and supplementation of otherwise starved worms with trehalose increases survival. We also show that trehalose synthesis is required for heat resistance during L1 starvation, and that supplemental trehalose increases resistance. Extended starvation survival of a <italic>daf-2</italic>/InsR mutant depends on trehalose synthesis, indicating that <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO-dependent induction of the three enzymes that mediate trehalose synthesis (<italic>tps-1</italic>, <italic>tps-2,</italic> and <italic>gob-1</italic>) contributes to starvation resistance and likely cross-tolerance to other stressors such as heat, high salt, and freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baugh, 2013</xref>). However, disruption of trehalose synthesis does not completely eliminate increased survival of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. Likewise, trehalose supplementation of a <italic>daf-16</italic> mutant increases survival, but not to the level of WT worms supplemented with trehalose. We believe supplementation of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants with trehalose does not have more of an effect on survival because induction of <italic>tps-1</italic> and <italic>tps-2</italic> is abrogated by disruption of <italic>daf-16</italic>, and trehalose synthesis is necessary for the full physiological effect of supplementation. Furthermore, these results imply that trehalose synthesis is not the only effector of reduced insulin-like signaling and DAF-16 activation, suggesting functional contribution of other DAF-16 targets to starvation resistance. Nonetheless, trehalose synthesis is a potent target of DAF-16 with substantial effects on starvation physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dual function of trehalose to support starvation survival</title><p>Genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches reveal dual function of trehalose as a glycolytic input and stress protectant. The glyoxylate shunt and trehalose synthesis are required for desiccation tolerance in dauer larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, mutants with reduced insulin-like signaling are resistant to osmotic stress, and disruption of <italic>tps-1</italic> and <italic>tps-2</italic> suppresses this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamitina and Strange, 2005</xref>). In addition, trehalose supplementation improves viability during cryopreservation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Kevin O'Connell, personal communication; see Worm Breeder's Gazette). These results suggest that trehalose supports viability in conditions where water is limiting, as in other organisms. Trehalose functions as such a stress protectant by preserving membrane organization and protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leekumjorn and Sum, 2008</xref>). Supplementation of starved L1 larvae with non-hydrolyzable α–β trehalose increases survival, suggesting similar function as a stress protectant during starvation, despite ample water. However, supplementation with α–β trehalose does not increase survival to the extent that hydrolyzable α–α trehalose does, suggesting catabolism of trehalose and use as a glycolytic input also contributes to starvation survival. Likewise, trehalose supplementation in worms with all five trehalase genes mutated extends survival, providing additional evidence of trehalose function as a stress protectant. However, extension of survival is limited in the quintuple mutant compared to WT, further showing that catabolism of trehalose is necessary for its full effect. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis limits the increase in survival provided with trehalose supplementation in WT, consistent with the glucose produced by catabolism being used for glycolysis. By uncoupling the effects of trehalose, these results provide multiple lines of evidence that supplemental trehalose supports starvation survival by functioning as an input for glycolysis as well as a stress protectant. These results also indicate that starvation survival requires maintenance of molecular and cellular integrity as well as adequate energy. Furthermore, analysis of the trehalose synthase double mutant and trehalase quintuple mutant show that cycling of glucose and trehalose is necessary for the dual function and complete physiological effects of trehalose.</p><p>The relative physiological significance of endogenous trehalose as an energy source and a stress protectant is difficult to discern. The trehalose synthase double mutant, which lacks trehalose entirely, is starvation sensitive, but it is unclear if its lack of function as a stress protectant, an energy source, or both is responsible. In contrast, the trehalase quintuple mutant, which maintains abnormally high levels of trehalose (higher than those observed in WT with supplementation) but cannot catabolize it for energy, survives starvation similar to WT. This result suggests that abnormally high levels of trehalose and the inability to catabolize it offset each other in their effects on survival. We did observe a reduction in endogenous trehalose levels relative to protein content during long-term starvation, consistent with depletion of it as an energy source. Furthermore, endogenous trehalose (inferred from the <italic>tps-1; tps-2</italic> mutant) promotes cell division in a permissive background, presumably reflecting function as an energy source. However, disruption of glycolysis had a relatively minor effect on starvation survival. Notably, we assessed survival in laboratory conditions, without examination of other organismal properties, like movement or foraging behavior, that could be supported by glycolysis and contribute to survival in the wild.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A paradox of sugar synthesis during starvation</title><p>It is somewhat surprising that gluconeogenesis is upregulated during starvation. One might naively imagine that sugars are catabolized for energy during starvation and that fat and other nutrient stores are more directly utilized for energy than by fueling synthesis of sugar. That is, a cycle of sugar synthesis and catabolism during starvation is seemingly futile. Function of trehalose as a stress protectant during starvation provides some resolution to this paradox, but upregulation of gluconeogenesis during starvation also occurs in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Puigserver et al., 2003</xref>), though they do not produce trehalose. In humans, fasting and starvation induce hepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rothman et al., 1991</xref>), and dysregulation of hepatic glucose production is a hallmark of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consoli, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin and Accili, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Titchenell et al., 2017</xref>). Glucose produced in the liver is circulated to other organs with high-energy demand such as skeletal muscle and the brain. Thus, in mammals, glucose transport between organs resolves the paradox of sugar synthesis during starvation.</p><p>We speculate that in nematodes trehalose is synthesized in the hypodermis and intestine during starvation and transported to other organs to satisfy energy demand. Indeed, insects transport trehalose instead of glucose: trehalose synthesized in the fat body is circulated through the hemolymph to fuel flight and other metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Candy and Kilby, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clegg and Evans, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saito, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Treherne, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wyatt and Kale, 1957</xref>). Given the apparent absence of a glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there has been speculation that trehalose is the primary transport sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McElwee et al., 2006</xref>). We observe expression of <italic>tps-1</italic> and <italic>tps-2</italic> in the intestine and hypodermis, which are also fat depots and primary sites of energy storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mullaney and Ashrafi, 2009</xref>). The phosphatase <italic>gob-1</italic>, which converts trehalose 6-phosphate to trehalose, is also expressed in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kormish and McGhee, 2005</xref>). In addition, catabolism of trehalose in neurons may support glycolysis and neuronal function during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jang et al., 2016</xref>), which may be required for appropriate foraging behavior and adaptation to starvation in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kniazeva et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, we propose conservation of an integrated organismal response to starvation among nematodes, insects, and mammals that is defined by FoxO transcription factors promoting carbon flux from fatty acids through gluconeogenesis to produce sugar that is transported throughout the animal to support glycolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources table</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2 (Bristol)</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>N2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>daf-16(mgDf50)</italic></td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:GR1307">WB-STRAIN: GR1307</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>daf-16(mgDf47)</italic></td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>PS5150</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>dpy-5(e907)</italic>; sEx14885</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:BC14885">WB-STRAIN: BC14885</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>dpy-5(e907)</italic>; sEx14876</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAINBC14876">WB-STRAIN: BC14876</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>ayIs7[Phlh-8::GFP]</italic></td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:PD4667">WB-STRAIN: PD4667</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>daf-16(mgDf50); ayIs7[Phlh-8::GFP]</italic></td><td>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh and Sternberg (2006)</xref> DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaplan et al.

Normalized log2 GCRMA values were used to assess significance of expression changes with the LIMMA/GCRMA empirical Bayes test. Genes significantly different between conditions were hierarchically clustered with Euclidian distances using Gene Cluster 3.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This same group of genes was used for principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Metabolomics</title><p>To measure metabolites in WT and <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO mutant worms, both strains were grown on 10 cm NGM plates with OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic>. These populations were bleached to isolate embryos. Embryos were arrested in S-complete and were either maintained in S-complete (starvation) or had 25 mg/mL HB101 <italic>E. coli</italic> added to culture upon hatching (fed). Worms were washed in S-basal and flash frozen in 0.6% formic acid. Worms were lysed by sonication with a Bioruptor at 4°C for 15 min with 30 s on, 30 s off at high power. Sonicated samples were stored at −80°C.</p><p>To extract metabolites, all samples were thawed on ice and then sonicated on ice, using ten 30 s on–off pulses at 30% power using a Series 60 Sonic Dismembrator (Model F60, Fisher Scientific). An aliquot was saved for total protein analysis via bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Remaining sample was mixed with acetonitrile (1:1 ratio), vortexed, and divided into five parts. Three parts of the sample was used for the quantification of amino acid and acyl carnitine, one part for organic acids, and from the remaining one part sample equivalent to 500 µg of protein was used for non-targeted metabolomics analysis. Amino acids and acylcarnitines were analyzed using MS/MS as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2004</xref>) and organic acids were quantified using GC/MS as described in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jensen et al. (2006</xref>). Non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed using GC/MS metabolomics as described in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al.

Tubes were kept on a roller drum at 21–22°C. For survival experiments with 2-DG, 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, trehalose, glucose, and maltose, these compounds were added to virgin S-basal before addition of embryos. To score survival, 100 μL samples of each culture were plated next to a lawn of OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> on 6 cm NGM plates. The total number of worms plated (T<sub>p</sub>) was counted after plating and 2 d later the number of worms alive and able to move to the bacterial lawn (T<sub>a</sub>) was scored. Survival was calculated as T<sub>a</sub>/T<sub>p</sub>, logistic survival curves were fit to the data, and median survival time was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artyukhin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hibshman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaplan et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Trehalose measurement</title><p>We used the Megazyme Trehalose Assay Kit (K-Treh) to measure the levels of trehalose in worms. Briefly, washed worms were flash frozen in 100 μL of 0.6% formic acid. Worms were sonicated for lysis, as with metabolomics analysis. Samples were split for protein analysis and trehalose analysis. Trehalose was measured according to the protocol provided with the Megazyme kit. Absorbances were measured on a Nanodrop. Protein concentration was quantified with a Qubit protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Levels of trehalose were normalized to protein. Normalizing trehalose content by worm number instead of protein concentration provided qualitatively similar results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Worm size measurements</title><p>The Wormsizer plugin for FIJI was used to measure the length of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Length after 48 hr of development was measured in several genotypes and in the presence of a range of 2-DG and 3-mercaptopicolinic acid concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Length of starved L1 larvae was similarly measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Worms were washed in S-basal, plated on unseeded 10 cm NGM plates and imaged on a Zeiss Discovery.V20 stereomicroscope.

Analysis was conducted in Fiji by outlining worms and calculating the average pixel intensity per worm. Background was subtracted from these measurements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,G</xref> show the distribution of relative intensities of individual worms from three independent biological replicates.

Cultures were bleached to isolate embryos, which were suspended 1/μL in virgin S-basal or virgin S-basal with 50 mM trehalose. Samples were flash frozen on liquid nitrogen 24 hr after bleach. RNA was extracted with trizol and chloroform. Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7530) with 500 ng of RNA per library and 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq4000, acquiring single end 50 bp reads. Bowtie was used to map reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). EdgeR was used to assess differential expression from count tables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). An ANOVA-like test in EdgeR identified 750 genes with variability across conditions (FDR &lt; 0.05). These were hierarchically clustered with Euclidian distances using Gene Cluster 3.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work is of high quality and important to the field, but the authors should put their valuable data in a broader perspective, as suggested by the reviewers. They should carry out the following actions, and address all remaining points raised by the reviewers, though further experimentation will not be necessary to prove their main claims.</p><p>• Comparison of their starvation model with the already established dauer starvation physiology and with mammalian physiology, highlighting what is new in their findings.</p><p>• Provide a more precise definition of the 'macromolecular buffer' concept or switch to a more appropriate terminology throughout the manuscript.</p><p>• Discuss the role of post-translational modifications in the metabolic changes that may support starvation survival.</p><p>• Shorten the discussion on trehalose transport among tissues as no direct evidence is presented in the manuscript. However, the authors may want to refer in that context to the PhD of Y. Feng (University of Bath), not published in a regular journal, but publicly available (http://opus.bath.ac.uk/25409/). They have characterized the <italic>C. elegans</italic> glucose/trehalose transporter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Manuscript by Hibshman et al. presents data that DAF-16 promotes gluconeogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis during L1 arrest. This is based on a comparison of transcriptional activities in WT or <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants that are fed or starved. In addition, metabolomic analysis under these conditions is conducted. According to authors, synthesized trehalose plays dual function: As a source of glucose for glycolysis and as macromolecular buffer (see discussion later). Experimental part of the manuscript is of a high standard. I have, however, a strong concern about two conceptual issues that build the major core of the manuscript.</p><p>1) According to definition, starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric intake needed to maintain an organism's life. Thus, an organism in order to survive starvation should mobilize internal energy sources. It must be mentioned that <italic>C. elegans</italic> delivered already an excellent model for starvation response: Dauer larva. Because they do not feed, dauers are &quot;starving&quot; and use internal lipid deposits for survival. It is well established that dauer larva rearrange their metabolism so that triacylglycerols are used as source for gluconeogenesis that finally produces trehalose. Hereby, the major hub, diverting isocitrate from TCA cycle to malate and then to oxaloacetate in cytosol, is the glyoxylate shunt. It is also shown that dauer larva decrease OXPHOS and oxygen consumption, reducing it to 20% of growing L3 larva. In this manuscript, the authors investigate a starvation response of another model for starvation: Arrested L1 larva. It appears that latter is very similar to that of the dauer. On itself, a comparison of these responses could be interesting. It would be good, however, if authors state clearly that this is a comparative study and do not present transition of L1 metabolism to gluconeogenesis and the involvement of glyoxylate shunt hereby as a big surprise.</p><p>2) Another issue is the function of trehalose. The authors state that trehalose has a dual role: It is a macromolecular buffer and secondly an energy source. First of all, what is a macromolecular buffer? If authors introduce a novel notion, then they should define it more precisely. Is it the requirement of trehalose for osmotic or desiccation tolerance? I think the assignment of two functions to trehalose is rather trivial: It is only an issue of concentration.

We have elaborated on our discussion of similarities and differences between dauer larvae and L1 starvation in the Introduction, including reasons why metabolism may not be the same, and setting up our investigation as a comparative analysis. We have also added to the Discussion to suggest broad conservation of the up-regulation of gluconeogenesis by FoxO transcription factors given our results for L1 starvation as well as what was known for dauer larvae and mammals. The key difference between our system and mammalian physiology is the terminal production of trehalose rather than glucose. In both systems, however, it is paradoxical to synthesize sugar during nutrient scarcity. We suggest that this paradox is resolved by transporting glucose/trehalose produced by gluconeogenesis in one organ to other organs to fuel glycolysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Provide a more precise definition of the 'macromolecular buffer' concept or switch to a more appropriate terminology throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>It was not our intention to introduce a new concept regarding biochemical function of trehalose, and we welcome the opportunity to clarify this. Our intention was to acknowledge the rich body of research showing that trehalose can buffer a variety of organisms from a variety of environmental stress including desiccation, freezing, heat, and osmotic stress. We have revised the Introduction to elaborate on research in this area, describing the association of trehalose with macromolecules to preserve membrane organization and protein structure. We have done our best to use similar language to that used in seminal papers. We have changed our terminology to &quot;stress protectant&quot;, which we have explicitly defined in the Introduction (Introduction, fifth paragraph). We also briefly restate what we mean in the appropriate portion of the Results section and again in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Discuss the role of post-translational modifications in the metabolic changes that may support starvation survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret overlooking the role of post-translational modifications in our previous submission. We have added an entire paragraph to the Discussion (subsection “<italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO shifts central carbon metabolism during starvation”, second paragraph) to emphasize that metabolism in general and starvation responses in particular are regulated on many levels, and that post-translational modifications play a central role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. We state that transcriptional regulation is most likely not the sole source of regulation, and we speculate that the patterns of transcriptional regulation we describe are reinforced by post-translational regulation. We agree that the integration of transcriptional and post-translational regulation of metabolic adaptation to nutrient stress is an important avenue of research but unfortunately beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Shorten the discussion on trehalose transport among tissues as no direct evidence is presented in the manuscript. However, the authors may want to refer in that context to the PhD of Y. Feng (University of Bath), not published in a regular journal, but publicly available (http://opus.bath.ac.uk/25409/). They have characterized the C. elegans glucose/trehalose transporter.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that we have not provided direct support for a trehalose transport model. We have removed mention of transport from the Abstract and other summaries. We have also shortened discussion of trehalose transport in the Discussion and removed it from the sub-heading that mentioned it. In particular, we have removed any statements suggesting we provide direct evidence for this claim. We have kept a brief discussion of trehalose transport at the end of the Discussion, clearly stating it as speculation. We have clarified our reasoning to argue that trehalose transport is a possible solution to the paradox of sugar synthesis during starvation. That is, it is counterintuitive to synthesize trehalose via gluconeogenesis during starvation only to catabolize it via glycolysis. Mammalian liver cells also use gluconeogenesis to produce glucose during starvation, though they do not produce trehalose. Glucose produced by the liver is transported to the brain and muscle to support metabolism, and we suggest something similar for trehalose in insects and nematodes. Though speculative, we believe this strengthens the relationship with mammalian starvation metabolism and offers an explanation for a seemingly futile metabolic cycle. We appreciate the reference to the PhD thesis of Y. Feng, but we elected not to cite it here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Manuscript by Hibshman et al. presents data that DAF-16 promotes gluconeogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis during L1 arrest. This is based on a comparison of transcriptional activities in WT or daf-16 mutants that are fed or starved. In addition, metabolomic analysis under these conditions is conducted. According to authors, synthesized trehalose plays dual function: As a source of glucose for glycolysis and as macromolecular buffer (see discussion later). Experimental part of the manuscript is of a high standard. I have, however, a strong concern about two conceptual issues that build the major core of the manuscript.</p><p>1) According to definition, starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric intake needed to maintain an organism's life. Thus, an organism in order to survive starvation should mobilize internal energy sources. It must be mentioned that C. elegans delivered already an excellent model for starvation response: Dauer larva. Because they do not feed, dauers are &quot;starving&quot; and use internal lipid deposits for survival. It is well established that dauer larva rearrange their metabolism so that triacylglycerols are used as source for gluconeogenesis that finally produces trehalose. Hereby, the major hub, diverting isocitrate from TCA cycle to malate and then to oxaloacetate in cytosol, is the glyoxylate shunt. It is also shown that dauer larva decrease OXPHOS and oxygen consumption, reducing it to 20% of growing L3 larva. In this manuscript, the authors investigate a starvation response of another model for starvation: Arrested L1 larva. It appears that latter is very similar to that of the dauer. On itself, a comparison of these responses could be interesting. It would be good, however, if authors state clearly that this is a comparative study and do not present transition of L1 metabolism to gluconeogenesis and the involvement of glyoxylate shunt hereby as a big surprise.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our results are more informative through the comparative lens of dauer metabolism. We have revised the Introduction to compare and contrast L1 starvation and dauer arrest. Specifically, we have added more background and citations of dauer metabolism to the Introduction, and we have pointed out unique features of dauer larvae that have made us hesitant to assume dauer metabolism reflects a universal starvation response. In the Discussion we conclude that metabolic adaptation to L1 starvation is similar to dauer larvae, avoiding any suggestion that the metabolic shift we describe is a big surprise. That said, we do emphasize the physiological significance of that shift revealed through our genetic and pharmacological analyses, which had not been performed in dauer larvae or other whole animals, as well as the critical role of <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO in directly regulating that shift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another issue is the function of trehalose. The authors state that trehalose has a dual role: It is a macromolecular buffer and secondly an energy source. First of all, what is a macromolecular buffer? If authors introduce a novel notion, then they should define it more precisely. Is it the requirement of trehalose for osmotic or desiccation tolerance? I think the assignment of two functions to trehalose is rather trivial: It is only an issue of concentration. Obviously, during starvation trehalose is used as a source for glycolysis and here low/basal amounts suffice. In order to provide resistance to osmotic or desiccation stress, trehalose for instance in dauers is produced in amounts that are several (about 4 to 5) fold higher than the basal level. Because L1 is not resistant either to osmotic or desiccation stress, trehalose in this response might have obviously only an energetic role.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have revised the Introduction to better describe the biochemical mechanism of trehalose in promoting resistance to osmotic stress and desiccation. We have opted to use the term “stress protectant” in an attempt to capture its function in maintaining protein and membrane structure during such stress. Although both roles as a stress protectant and an energy source have been described for trehalose, they have been evoked in different organisms and different contexts. Consequently, we do not believe it is trivial that it can simultaneously function in both capacities during starvation. Because we did not deem it trivial, we went to great lengths to show by multiple independent approaches that trehalose does support starvation survival as both a stress protectant and an energy source. Given the fat provisions dauer larvae are endowed with, their critical role as a dispersal stage, and their extreme resistance to a variety of stressors, it is not a surprise they rely on trehalose for these remarkable properties. However, it was unclear if survival of acute starvation as L1 larvae would be supported by trehalose other than as an energy source. Our results suggest that survival of starvation requires not only adequate calories but also preservation of macromolecular structure. We believe a fair number of readers will find this insight surprising. Finally, there is some evidence that starved L1 larvae have increased stress resistance compared to fed larvae (reviewed in Baugh, 2013). For example, it is routine to freeze starved but not fed larvae for long-term storage. Trehalose may contribute to increased stress resistance during L1 starvation, as suggested by our demonstration that it contributes to heat resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Hibshman et al. approaches the unsolved mystery of how the daf-16/FOXO transcription factor promotes starvation resistance.

Given lack of direct supporting evidence of transport, we have removed any suggestions that we provide data to support this conclusion, while also removing mention of it from the Abstract and other summaries. We have kept discussion of this possibility as speculation in the Discussion, potentially spurring future research of this compelling hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
