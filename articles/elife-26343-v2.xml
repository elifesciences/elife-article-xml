If nutrients become limited, proliferation ceases, because growth factor and/or PI3-kinase activity levels become attenuated. Here, we report an exception to this generality within a subpopulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells (neuroblasts). We find that most neuroblasts enter and exit cell cycle in a nutrient-dependent manner that is reversible and regulated by PI3-kinase. However, a small subset, the mushroom body neuroblasts, which generate neurons important for memory and learning, divide independent of dietary nutrient conditions and PI3-kinase activity. This nutrient-independent proliferation is regulated by Eyeless, a Pax-6 orthologue, expressed in mushroom body neuroblasts. When Eyeless is knocked down, mushroom body neuroblasts exit cell cycle when nutrients are withdrawn. Conversely, when Eyeless is ectopically expressed, some non-mushroom body neuroblasts divide independent of dietary nutrient conditions. Therefore, Eyeless uncouples MB neuroblast proliferation from nutrient availability, allowing preferential neurogenesis in brain subregions during nutrient poor conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PI3-kinase</kwd><kwd>Pax-6</kwd><kwd>eyeless</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-NS096919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sipe</surname><given-names>Conor W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-HD067293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM120421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model organism shows that neural stem cell proliferation decisions in response to dietary nutrient conditions can be regulated by cell-autonomous lineage factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quiescence versus proliferation decisions require coordination of stem cell-intrinsic factors with extrinsic factors, local and systemic, that vary in response to changing animal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Orford and Scadden, 2008</xref>). Nutrient availability is an important extrinsic factor as nutrients provide the building blocks for macromolecular biosynthesis that drives cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chantranupong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>).

NBs enter quiescence at the end of embryogenesis and reactivate soon after freshly hatched larva consume their first complete meal. Developmental quiescence is ‘pre-programmed’ and all NBs (~100) enter quiescence except for a small subset, which includes the four mushroom body NBs (MB NBs) and one lateral NB in each brain hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>). NB reactivation from quiescence is regulated by a nutritional checkpoint that requires dietary amino acids and is coupled to larval growth by the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). In response to animal feeding, the fat body releases a systemic signal, which induces synthesis and secretion of Dilp-6 (insulin-like peptide 6) from brain glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Dilp-6 in turn activates the insulin-like tyrosine kinase receptor (InR) in nearby NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). InR activates PI3-kinase, a highly conserved regulator of cell growth, which stimulates cellular nutrient uptake via regulation of transmembrane transporters, regulates key metabolic enzymes necessary for macromolecular biosynthesis, and leads to downstream activation of anabolic growth signaling pathways, most notably TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While amino acids are required to reactivate quiescent NBs, it is unclear whether further dietary amino acid intake is required. MB NBs continue proliferating during the embryonic to larval transition and in the absence of the food-derived systemic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report that NB subtypes have different dietary nutrient requirements for proliferation and that these differences are regulated by cell autonomous, lineage factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Freshly hatched larvae were fed a complete nutrient diet and then switched to a sucrose-only diet (hereafter referred to as dietary nutrient withdrawal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). EdU, a thymidine analogue, was added to the diet for the final 24 hr to assay NB proliferation in the absence of dietary amino acids. After 24 hr of complete feeding, 84% of central brain NBs, identified based on expression of the transcription factor Deadpan (Dpn) and large cell size, were EdU-positive, indicating NB reactivation from developmental quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Animals were then switched to a sucrose-only diet, and a reduction in EdU-positive NBs was observed over time, from 77% at 1 day AFW (after food withdrawal) to 3% at 7 days AFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F,H</xref>). This reduction was not due to a change in NB number, suggesting that NBs require dietary amino acids to maintain proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Animals at 7 d AFW were reintroduced to a complete diet and after 3 days of refeeding, essentially all NBs were EdU-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,G,H</xref>). We conclude that during early larval stages, most NBs enter and exit cell cycle in a nutrient-dependent manner and, like developmental quiescence, this process is reversible. However, we found that nutrient-arrested NBs in animals at 7 day AFW were larger than quiescent NBs in freshly hatched larvae, and re-enter S phase without subsequent cell size increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that nutrient-arrest and quiescence are distinct. Nevertheless, both nutrient-arrested and quiescent NBs re-enter cell cycle in response to nutrition, suggesting that common signaling pathways regulate both processes.</p><p>Next, to fully reactivate all NBs, freshly hatched larvae were fed a complete diet for 48 hr, and then switched to a sucrose-only diet. Again, a reduction in EdU-positive NBs was observed over time, which was not due to a change in NB number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). At 7 days AFW, 52% of NBs were EdU-positive, while at 14 days AFW, 23% of NBs were EdU-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Compared to 24 hr fed animals, more NBs remained EdU-positive after dietary nutrient withdrawal, which could be due to increased levels in stored nutrients or to intrinsic differences among NBs between 24 and 48 hr fed animals. Nevertheless, many NBs resumed proliferation after animal refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To better understand regulation of NB proliferation during dietary nutrient withdrawal, we asked whether PI3-kinase is required. PI3-kinase is active during nutrient-rich conditions and is required to reactivate quiescent NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Puig and Tjian, 2006</xref>). During dietary nutrient withdrawal, when PI3-kinase was constitutively activated in NBs (<italic>worGAL4,UASdp110<sup>CAAX</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>), NBs were found to incorporate EdU longer, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E,K,M</xref>). Conversely, when PI3-kinase activity was reduced (<italic>worGAL4,UASdp60</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weinkove et al., 1999</xref>), a reduction in EdU-positive NBs was observed over time compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J,L,M</xref>). Therefore, during early larval stages, NBs exit cell cycle in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner and levels of PI3-kinase activity in response to dietary nutrients are required to maintain NB proliferation.</p><p>Unlike other central brain NBs, MB NBs remain large in size and divide continuously during the embryonic to larval transition, suggesting that NB subtypes have different dietary nutrient requirements for proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). We found that unlike other central brain NBs, the four MB NBs divide continuously after dietary nutrient withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we found that MB NB proliferation during dietary nutrient withdrawal is also PI3-kinase independent. PI3-kinase is typically regulated in a nutrient-dependent manner, through Dilp binding to InR, but PI3-kinase can also be regulated independently of dietary nutrient conditions via binding of the low-density lipoprotein-like Jelly Belly to Alk, a tyrosine kinase receptor similar to InR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). At 7 days AFW, when levels of PI3-kinase activity (<italic>worGAL4,UAS-dp60</italic>) or Alk (<italic>worGAL4,UAS-AlkRNAi</italic>) were reduced in NBs, no difference in the number of EdU-positive MB NBs or their EdU-positive progeny was observed compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This suggests that MB NBs utilize a PI3-kinase-independent mechanism to maintain proliferation during dietary nutrient withdrawal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26343.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NB subtypes respond differently to dietary amino acid withdrawal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol to assay NB proliferation during dietary amino acid withdrawal.

During complete feeding and following dietary nutrient withdrawal, all MB NBs and some non-MB NBs express Ey at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurusu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noveen et al., 2000</xref>). Ey is also expressed at higher levels in some neurons and glia. However, most non-MB NBs do not express Ey, which led us to ask whether Ey is required for MB NB proliferation during dietary nutrient withdrawal.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26343.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Eyeless is expressed in MB NBs.</title><p>(<bold>A,E,I,M</bold>) Maximum intensity projections of single brain hemispheres, single-channel greyscale image in top panel with colored overlay below.

We expressed a wild-type version of Ey in NBs (<italic>worGAL4, UAS-ey<sup>WT</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G–T</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G–N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halder et al., 1995</xref>).

Nonetheless, at 3 days AFW, the number of EdU-positive NBs remained relatively unchanged, whereas in controls, EdU-positive NBs declined by 31% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,L,M</xref>).

While ectopic Ey expression allows some non-MB NBs to proliferate longer during the initial phase of nutrient withdrawal, ectopic Ey is not sufficient to convert NB proliferation from nutrient-dependent to nutrient-independent. This could be due to technical reasons; in 24 hr fed animals overexpressing <italic>ey<sup>W</sup></italic><sup>T</sup>, 70% of non-MB NBs express relatively high levels of Ey, whereas at 7 days AFW, 49% of non-MB NBs express relatively low levels of Ey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,M–T</xref>).

We found that during early larval stages, most NBs exit cell cycle when dietary amino acids are withdrawn, yet a small subset, the MB NBs, continue dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). We also showed that the transcription factor Eyeless (Ey), a Pax-6 orthologue, expressed in MB NBs is required for MB NB nutrient-independent proliferation. Important future work will include the identification of Ey target genes in MB NBs. A preliminary bioinformatic analysis has revealed a number of putative Ey DNA-binding sites in regulatory regions of genes involved in metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition, the source of the amino acids that support MB NB proliferation decisions remains an open question. Amino acids must come from either extracellular sources or through catabolic recovery of amino acids within MB NBs themselves. Finally, it will be essential to determine whether other stem cell types also regulate proliferation decisions in response to nutrient availability in a lineage-dependent, cell-autonomous manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Stocks used in this study were: <italic>Oregon R, worGal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>), <italic>UAS-dp60</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weinkove et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>UAS-dp110<sup>CAAX</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>), <italic>UAS-ey</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halder et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>UAS-eyRNAi</italic> (Bloomington Stock Center, FBst0032486), <italic>UAS-alkRNAi</italic> (Bloomington Stock Center, FBst0027518), <italic>pcna:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thacker et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>UAS-N-Venus-PH-GRP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>UAS-C-Venus-PH-GRP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Eyeless uncouples neuroblast proliferation from dietary amino acids in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Three peer reviewers, one of whom, Bruce Edgar is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report Sipe and Siegrist revisit earlier observations that <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s mushroom body neuroblasts (MB NB) cycle independently of larval feeding, extending this observation to show that this behavior is determined by the eyeless (ey) transcription factor and is Pi3K-independent, whereas other NB are both nutrition and Pi3K dependent for their proliferation. The demonstration that loss of eyeless in MB NBs renders them nutrition-dependent is convincing and significant. They also show that a small subset of non MB NBs can be transformed into a nutrition-insensitive state by ectopic ey, suggesting that the difference in cell cycle behavior in these neuroblasts is ey dependent. No insight is give as to why this subset of NBs are ey-dependent, and the critical target genes of ey for these cell cycle effects are not determined.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers agreed that the demonstration of ey functions in MB NBs to make them nutrition independent is an interesting insight worthy of publication. However, the reviewers agreed that the conclusion that ey mediates this function in other NB is over-sold, as only a few NB are affected. Moreover, the reviewers agreed that the paper could be improved considerably by additional data relating to how eyeless mediates these functions, and that without such data the results don't fully warrant publication as a full-format paper. We therefore invite you to revise the manuscript as a short report (~1500 words main text, 3-4 figures) that addresses the points listed below, which are summarized from the reviews. For a full format paper, we would expect a somewhat more in-depth analysis that delved into the targets of eyeless in NBs, and how they control cell identities and these different cell cycle behaviors.</p><p>1) The main claim of the paper is that Ey is both necessary and sufficient to maintain neuroblast proliferation under nutrient restriction. The authors claim that &quot;ectopic ey is sufficient to switch non-MB NB proliferation from nutrient-dependent to nutrient-independent&quot; and &quot;ey is sufficient to maintain non-MB NB proliferation in the absence of dietary amino acids&quot; (subsection “Ectopic Ey is sufficient to switch non-MB NB proliferation from nutrient-dependent to nutrient-independent”). However, after ectopic expression of Ey in non-MB neuroblasts only a very low proportion (~4% per brain lobe) become amino acid independent. Thus, the authors cannot conclude that &quot;Ey and PI3K are sufficient to drive non-MB NB proliferation in the absence of dietary amino acids&quot;. Furthermore, some non-MB neuroblasts express Ey endogenously. Could these neuroblasts be the ~4% that respond? Since it seems that Ey has much less effect on non MB NBs as compared to MB NBs, it would be good for the authors to try to determine what subset of non-MB NBs are affected by the ectopic Ey. In summary, the conclusion that ey is sufficient to maintain nutrient-independent cycling is not accurate, and needs to be re-stated in a more qualified form.</p><p>2) The authors over-interpret the results of some of their experiments. They only do 24hr feeding/starvation which means that they have analysed solely L1 larvae (even though 7 or 8 days old they are still at L1 stages) and from these state that non MB neuroblasts are nutrient dependent. This contradicts Britton and Edgar, 1998 and Cheng et al., 2011 who showed that after full initial neuroblast reactivation (the initial analysis were performed at 48hrs ALH=end L2; and at 60hrs ALH=early L3, respectively) non MB neuroblasts become nutrient independent. So, unless the authors test the effect of starvation in neuroblast cycling at these later time points and collect data that contradicts the earlier reports they cannot generally claim that &quot;non-MB NBs require dietary amino acids for proliferation.&quot;</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> addresses Eyeless expression, but it's confusing and doesn't support the conclusions in the text. The signals in WT are very weak, and not quantified, so the conclusion that Ey is expressed in MB NB but not non-MB NBs is not well supported. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> doesn't show whether Ey is expressed in Non-MBs after nutrient activation. This information would be helpful. Overall, better data on Ey expression should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26343.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The main claim of the paper is that Ey is both necessary and sufficient to maintain neuroblast proliferation under nutrient restriction.

Compared to control animals, EdU-positive non-MB NBs are never observed at 7 days AFW. Although 4.2 +- 1.69 EdU-positive non-MB NBs is a relatively small number, it does equal close to 10% of reactivated non-MB NBs (43.2 on average) in Ey<sup>wt</sup>-overexpressing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). This relatively modest effect could be due to the inability to maintain Ey expression in non-MB NBs over the course of nutrient withdrawal. This is supported by quantitative Ey expression data now included in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Alternatively, other intrinsic factors, as yet unknown, could also be required.</p><p>2) Perhaps more striking is the observation that the percent of EdU-positive NBs in Ey<sup>wt</sup>-overexpressing animals at 3 d AFW remains relatively constant compared to 24 hour fed animals, which in controls shows a marked decrease. The sustained proliferation of non-MB NBs in Ey<sup>wt</sup>-overexpressing animals during early nutrient withdrawal correlates with increases in numbers of non-MB NBs expressing Ey and higher levels of Ey in non-MB NBs.</p><p>In light of reviewer comments and additional data we provide, the text has been modified as following:</p><p>&quot;While ectopic Ey may keep some non-MB NBs proliferating longer during early nutrient withdrawal, ectopic Ey is not sufficient to convert NB proliferation from nutrient-dependent to nutrient-independent. This could be due to technical reasons; in 24 hour fed <italic>ey<sup>W</sup></italic><sup>T</sup>-overexpressing animals, 70% of non-MB NBs express relatively high levels of Ey, whereas at 7 days AFW, only 48% of non-MB NBs express relatively low levels of Ey. Alternatively, there could be lineage specific-effects that account for the difference, which at the moment, can not be discerned.&quot;</p><p><italic>it would be good for the authors to try to determine what subset of non-MB NBs are affected by the ectopic Ey.</italic></p><p>This is a great idea, and one we have been thinking about as well. Unfortunately, we do not have the genetic tools to identify a specific population of non-MB NBs that may be affected by ectopic Ey expression. EdU-incorporating neuroblasts are spread throughout the brain lobe, and we are unable to detect a pattern based on their positioning. We hope to follow up on this interesting and important question in future investigations.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors over-interpret the results of some of their experiments. They only do 24hr feeding/starvation which means that they have analysed solely L1 larvae (even though 7 or 8 days old they are still at L1 stages) and from these state that non MB neuroblasts are nutrient dependent. This contradicts Britton and Edgar, 1998 and Cheng et al., 2011 who showed that after full initial neuroblast reactivation (the initial analysis were performed at 48hrs ALH=end L2; and at 60hrs ALH=early L3, respectively) non MB neuroblasts become nutrient independent. So, unless the authors test the effect of starvation in neuroblast cycling at these later time points and collect data that contradicts the earlier reports they cannot generally claim that &quot;non-MB NBs require dietary amino acids for proliferation.&quot;</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this important point. We have now clarified the language to include &quot;during early larval stages&quot;. As an example, &quot;We conclude that during early larval stages, most NBs enter and exit cell cycle in a nutrient-dependent manner and, like developmental quiescence, this process is reversible.&quot;</p><p>In addition, we have carried out amino acid withdrawal experiments in animals after 48 hours of feeding, which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Finally, at no point do we compare our results with that of Cheng et al., (2011). In their experiments, larvae were nutrient restricted after animals reached critical weight, a developmental checkpoint regulated by ecdysone which commits animals to metamorphosis regardless of further nutrient intake. Thus, the physiology of NBs after the critical weight transition is likely quite different.</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> addresses Eyeless expression, but it's confusing and doesn't support the conclusions in the text. The signals in WT are very weak, and not quantified, so the conclusion that Ey is expressed in MB NB but not non-MB NBs is not well supported. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> doesn't show whether Ey is expressed in Non-MBs after nutrient activation. This information would be helpful. Overall, better data on Ey expression should be provided.</italic></p><p>Eyeless expression in MB NBs and in non-MB NBs is now quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
