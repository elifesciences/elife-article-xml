trimming of <italic>N</italic>-glycan, from M9 to M8B and then to oligosaccharides exposing the α1,6-linked mannosyl residue (M7A, M6, and M5), facilitates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (gpERAD). We previously showed that EDEM2 stably disulfide-bonded to the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11 is responsible for the first step (George et al., 2020). Here, we show that EDEM3 and EDEM1 are responsible for the second step. Incubation of pyridylamine-labeled M8B with purified EDEM3 alone produced M7 (M7A and M7C), M6, and M5. EDEM1 showed a similar tendency, although much lower amounts of M6 and M5 were produced. Thus, EDEM3 is a major α1,2-mannosidase for the second step from M8B. Both EDEM3 and EDEM1 trimmed M8B from a glycoprotein efficiently. Our confirmation of the Golgi localization of MAN1B indicates that no other α1,2-mannosidase is required for gpERAD. Accordingly, we have established the entire route of oligosaccharide processing and the enzymes responsible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein

system to handle proteins which are unfolded or misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where newly synthesized secretory and transmembrane proteins destined for the secretory pathway gain their own three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>). These functionally inappropriate proteins are somehow detected in the ER lumen and then transferred to the retrotranslocational channel embedded within the ER membrane, termed the retrotranslocon, followed by ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome in the cytoplasm. This series of processes is collectively referred to as ER-associated degradation (ERAD-L; L for lumen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ninagawa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Extensive analysis of the mechanism of glycoprotein ERAD-L (gpERAD) has revealed that particular structures of the carbohydrate moiety become a signal for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ninagawa et al., 2021</xref>). An oligosaccharide of 14 sugar units, consisting of 3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine molecules (Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, abbreviated as G3M9 hereafter), is transferred to an Asn residue in the consensus sequence (Asn-X-Ser/Thr; X: any amino acid except Pro) present in newly synthesized protein in yeast and mammalian cells. G3M9 is converted to M9 by the sequential actions of Gls1 and Gls2-Gtb1 in yeast and glucosidases I and II in mammalian cells. Productive folding of the protein moiety is facilitated during this period by the calnexin/calreticulin cycle in mammalian cells, which relies on G1M9-specific lectin-type chaperones (calnexin and calreticulin) associated with the oxidoreductase ERp57, and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferases 1 and 2, which are capable of re-adding glucose to M9 if the protein moiety is not yet folded. It should be noted that the Cne1 (an orthologue of calnexin and calreticulin) cycle is not effective in yeast because a functional orthologue of UGGTs is not present in yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>). After completion of folding, the glycoprotein is transported to the next compartment in the secretory pathway, the Golgi apparatus. However, if the protein moiety is not folded within a certain threshold time, the glycoprotein undergoes gpERAD via the conversion of M9 to M8B and then to oligosaccharides exposing the α1,6-linked mannosyl residue, namely M7A, M6, and M5. α1,6-Linked mannosyl residue-specific lectins OS9 and XTP3B transfer the glycoprotein to the retrotranslocon for subsequent degradation in the cytoplasm in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ninagawa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the α1,2-mannosidases Mns1 and Htm1 carry out the first and second mannose trimming steps, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ninagawa et al., 2021</xref>). We have constructed knockout (KO) cells for α1,2-mannosidase candidate genes, namely EDEM1, EDEM2, and EDEM3 (Htm1 orthologues), in human HCT116 diploid cells, and have shown that EDEM2 is required for the conversion of M9 to M8B and that EDEM3 (mainly) and EDEM1 (partly) are required for the conversion of M8B to oligosaccharides, which exposes the α1,6-linked mannosyl residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Further, our recent biochemical analysis has clarified that although EDEM2 alone exhibits no mannosidase activity toward M9, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mast et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shenkman et al., 2018</xref>), EDEM2 stably disulfide-bonded to the thioredoxin domain-containing protein TXNDC11 catalyzes the first mannose trimming step from M9 to M8B in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Intramolecular disulfide bond formation in the mannosidase homology domain (MHD) is considered essential for EDEM2 to exhibit α1,2-mannosidase activity because mutation of either C65 or C408 inactivated EDEM2 in gpERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined whether the disulfide bonding between C65 and C408 is indeed formed only in the presence of TXNDC11. We then examined whether disulfide bond formation in the MHD is essential for EDEM1 or EDEM3 to exhibit α1,2-mannosidase activity, and whether TXNDC11 is disulfide-bonded to EDEM1 or EDEM3. Finally, we examined whether purified EDEM3 or purified EDEM1 can catalyze the second mannose trimming step from M8B to oligosaccharides exposing the α1,6-linked mannosyl residue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of essential disulfide bonding in EDEM2 in the presence of TXNDC11</title><p>As we reported previously, analysis by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting showed that introduction of 3xFlag-tagged EDEM2 into EDEM2-KO cells produced its monomer, and probably dimer and aggregated forms, whereas simultaneous introduction of 3xFlag-tagged TXNDC11 and 3xFlag-tagged EDEM2 into EDEM2-KO cells produced a high molecular weight complex of EDEM2 and TXNDC11, designated EDEM2<sup>§</sup>–3xFlag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Our previous genetic and biochemical analyses have determined that EDEM2 stably disulfide-bonded to TXNDC11 is responsible for the first mannose trimming step from M9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Our biochemical analysis in the present paper together with our previous genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>) has determined that EDEM3 alone (mainly) or EDEM1 alone (partly) is responsible for the second mannose trimming step from M8B.</p><p>Our current results with another α1,2-mannosidase MAN1B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) are well consistent with a previous report showing the Golgi localization of endogenous MAN1B1 by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, however, we are unable to reconcile our results with findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benyair et al., 2015</xref>) claiming that MAN1B1 is localized in quality control vesicles to which ERAD substrates are transported and in which they interact with the enzyme. Nonetheless, it is not clear at all whether such vesicles contain molecules downstream of the exposure of α1,6-linked mannosyl residue, such as OS9 and XTP3B, as well as the retrotranslocon for efficient degradation of substrates already destined for gpERAD via mannose trimming. The system becomes effective if all components of gpERAD exist in the same compartment, namely in the ER.</p><p>Importantly, EDEM3 produced not only M7A but also M6 and M5 from M8B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). EDEM1 exhibited a similar tendency, albeit weakly; potential disulfide bonding between C410 and C457 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lamriben et al., 2018</xref>) might stabilize the MHD of EDEM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) but might instead decrease the α1,2-mannosidase activity of EDEM1. The resulting M5 has no α1,2-linked mannosyl residue, which in turn means that no other α1,2-mannosidase is necessary for the mammalian gpERAD. In addition, both EDEM3 and EDEM1 nearly equally produced M7A and M7C from M8B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D (a)</xref>), which explains the presence of a small amount of M7C on glycoproteins in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ninagawa et al., 2014</xref>). M7C is likely converted to M6 and then to M5 by EDEM3 and EDEM1, because they have no preference for the mannose residue in the A branch or C branch of M8B. Furthermore, both EDEM3 and EDEM1 efficiently trimmed mannose from M8B on a glycoprotein, such as mCD3-δ-ΔTM-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and ATF6α(C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the entire route of oligosaccharide processing and the enzymes responsible for it have been established for mammalian gpERAD for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>It was previously shown that the MHD of EDEM3 is transiently disulfide-bonded to the thioredoxin domain-containing protein ERp46, and that coexpression of EDEM3 and ERp46 enhances EDEM3 activity in gpERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our current results, coexpression of EDEM3 and ERp46 is likely to facilitate the formation of disulfide bonding between C82 and C441 of human EDEM3 (C83 and C442 of mouse EDEM3) in the MHD, which is required for EDEM3 to exhibit α1,2-mannosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Once fully folded with correct disulfide bonding in the MHD, EDEM3 requires no partner protein to exhibit α1,2-mannosidase activity in vitro, in contrast to EDEM2. One question which remains is why only EDEM2 requires TXNDC11 for formation of the disulfide bond in the MHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), even though such disulfide bonding is also essential for the function of EDEM1 and EDEM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>A second remaining question concerns how the specificity of EDEM2 toward M9 is achieved; although the MHD of EDEM1, EDEM2, and EDEM3 is homologous, EDEM2 effectively converted PA-M9 to PA-M8B (little PA-M9 was present after 24 hr incubation with purified EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2020</xref>), whereas EDEM2 poorly converted M8B to M7 in both PA-bound M8B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and protein-bound M8B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), in contrast to EDEM3. We previously showed that the conformation of noncomplexed and complexed EDEM2 with TXNDC11 differs, using sensitivity to trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that the structure of the catalytic site of EDEM2 becomes significantly different to that of EDEM1 or EDEM3 following intramolecular disulfide bond formation in the MHD plus intermolecular disulfide bonding between EDEM2 and TXNDC11; this may explain not only the specificity of EDEM2 toward M9 but also the requirement for TXNDC11 as a stable partner of EDEM2. Structural determination is expected to answer these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Colorectal carcinoma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HCT116</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This cell line has been authenticated and tested negative for mycoplasma.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">p3xFlag-CMV-14</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pmCherry-N1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAKARA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pSecTag2/Hygro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pEGFP-C1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CLONTECH</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-TXNDC11(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: ab188329</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-EDEM1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: E8406</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-EDEM2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novusbio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: NBP2-37921</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-EDEM3 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: E0409</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-GRP78 antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: PA1-014A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-HA (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recenttec</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: R4-TP1411100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Flag (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: F3165</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000) IP (2.5 μl)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Myc-direct-HRP antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MBL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: M047-7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using Student’s t-test, with probability expressed as *p &lt; 0.05 and **p &lt; 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Construction of plasmids</title><p>Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sambrook et al., 1989</xref>) and the integrity of all constructed plasmids was confirmed by extensive sequencing analyses.

Approximately 1.0 pmol of purified EDEM1, EDEM2-TXNDC11 complex, EDEM3(Q543N), or MAN1B1(Δ105) was incubated with 150 pmol PA-M8B in a total volume of 45 μl of assay buffer (50 mM MES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at 37°C for 24 hr. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The samples were evaporated, dissolved in 20 μl of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, and analyzed using a TSK-gel Amide-80 column (Tosoh) for mannose contents. Identification of <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures was based on their elution positions on the column and their molecular mass values compared with those of PA-glycans in the GALAXY database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glycoanalysis.info/galaxy2/ENG/index.jsp">http://www.glycoanalysis.info/galaxy2/ENG/index.jsp</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Takahashi and Kato, 2003</xref>).

The released <italic>N</italic>-glycans were captured and labeled with aminooxy-functionalized tryptophanyl arginine methyl ester (aoWR) by BlotGlyco beads (Sumitomo Bakelite) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furukawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uematsu et al., 2005</xref>). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses of aoWR-labeled glycans were performed on Autoflex Speed (Bruker Daltonics) operated in positive-ion reflector mode. For MS acquisition, aoWR-labeled glycans in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with dihydrobenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile) and spotted on the target plate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70357-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

N-glycans acts as sorting signals in the secretory pathway. Mannose trimming marks proteins for turnover through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by exposing the alpha1,6-linked mannose residues on the C-antennary of the N-glycan. The ER possesses a number of mannosidase or mannosidase-like family members including EDEM1-3. The Mori lab has previously used knockout human cell lines to explore the order that the mannosidases act on the glycan (Ninagawa et al., JCB 2014). They also showed that EDEM2-TXNDC11 performs the initial trimming step from Man9 to Man8B (George et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). The current study provides a continuation of this study that provides biochemical support that EDEM2 trimming is followed by EDEM1 and EDEM3 exposing the key alpha1,6-linked mannose ERAD signal (as well as performing further trimming). EDEM1 and EDEM3 are shown to possess a key large conserved intramolecular disulfide in their mannosidase homology domain, as they have seen previously for EDEM2 (George et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). This intramolecular disulfide is required for their mannosidase activity. The most significant finding is the demonstration that purified EDEM1 and EDEM3 further trim Man8B (created by EDEM2-TXNDC11). This was shown both for isolated glycans (pyridylamine labeled M8B, Figure 4) and glycans linked to ERAD substrates (mCD3 (Figure 5); and ATF6alpha (Figure 6)). Overall, this study demonstrates the details of mannose trimming in the ER by EDEM1 and EDEM3, filling an important gap in how mannose trimming creates an ERAD signal and shunts glycoproteins to the ERAD pathway.</p><p>The major strength of the study is the identification of the mannosidase activities of EDEM1 and EDEM3. They show they these two ER mannosidases are responsibility for generating the ERAD signal, Man7C using glycomics and purified components. While this has been hypothesized, direct demonstration of the mannosidase activity with glycomics has been missing.</p><p>Figure 2C involves the isolation of total cellular glycosidase (Pngase F?) liberated glycans (details on the experimental procedure are sparse). As EDEMs are expected to act specifically on non-native clients for ERAD targeting, wouldn't most glycans be expected to be inert to the presence of the EDEMs? Or do the EDEMs act on native substrates too? Would mannose trimming be accentuated by chemical folding disruptors? Or can glycans on ERAD substrates specifically be analyzed?</p><p>The EDEMs are expected to have some querying abilities to help mark non-native proteins rather than acting as promiscuous mannosidases, yet this is not discussed in the manuscript. Is it due to localization within ER subdomains or the selectivity of the mannosidases?</p><p>Why isn't there mannosidase trimming in WT Figure 4C? Shouldn't there be endogenous mannosidase activity in the WT cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides a biochemical evidence intramolecular formation of S-S bond in EDEM2, which is possibly catalyzed by TXNDC11, a binding partner for EDEM2. Then they also characterize the activity of EDEM1 and EDEM3, and showed that both EDEM3 and EDEM1 is capable of processing oligosaccharides to expose alpha1,6-mannose, a key residue for recognition by OS-9 lectins.</p><p>While it has been assumed that both EDEM1 and 3 have an alpha1,2-mannosidase activity, whether there are additional factor(s), such as oxidoreductase, required for its enzyme activity or not remain unclarified. This reviewer therefore likes their biochemical approaches to show that, at least for EDEM3, it looks like that the S-S bond formation with another protein is not likely to be involved in its enzymatic activity (Figure 3A(b)). They also clearly showed that EDEM1 or EDEM3 can exhibit alpha1,2-mannosidase activity in vitro, towards both PA-labeled glycans and N-glycans on ERAD model substrates.</p><p>The reviewer feels, however, that their conclusion that EDEM1 and EDEM3 is THE mannosidase responsible for trimming from M8B to M5-7 in the ER are not sufficiently supported. It is clear that their activities in vitro do not necessarily lead to this conclusion (as MAN1B1 can also clearly exert the similar activity in vitro (ex Figure 4C)). Their conclusion, the reviewer believes, is mainly coming from their previous observation that, MAN1B1-KO did not result in drastic change of N-glycan isomers of total cellular glycoproteins (similar analysis with Figure 2C of current study).</p><p>While the reviewer acknowledges that the authors mentioned about that in the text (Page 4, lines 15-16), as the current form their logic on drawing conclusion of Figure 4E is not clear. The reviewer thus urges the authors to clearly spell out this point in the text (i.e. why they think Man1B1 is not involved in this process). Otherwise the readers who are not familiar with the authors' previous studies may not understand their logic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70357.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>N-glycans act as sorting signals in the secretory pathway with mannose trimming marking proteins for turnover through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by exposing the alpha1,6-linked mannose residues on the C-antennary of the N-glycan.
