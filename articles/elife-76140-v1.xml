Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined four structures of <italic>At</italic>Atm3 in three different conformational states: two inward-facing conformations (with and without bound oxidized glutathione (GSSG)), together with closed and outward-facing states stabilized by MgADP-VO<sub>4</sub>. These structures not only provide a structural framework for defining the alternating access transport cycle, but also reveal the paucity of cysteine residues in the glutathione binding site that could potentially form inhibitory mixed disulfides with GSSG. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to prepare the ternary complex of <italic>At</italic>Atm3 containing both GSSG and MgATP. A survey of structurally characterized type IV ABC transporters that includes <italic>At</italic>Atm3 establishes that while nucleotides are found associated with all conformational states, they are effectively required to stabilize occluded, closed, and outward-facing conformations. In contrast, transport substrates have only been observed associated with inward-facing conformations. The absence of structures with dimerized nucleotide binding domains containing both nucleotide and transport substrate suggests that this form of the ternary complex exists only transiently during the transport cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Douglas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The atomic coordinates for inward-facing, inward-facing with GSSG bound, closed and outward-facing conformations were separately deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with accession codes: PDB 7N58, 7N59, 7N5A and 7N5B; EMDB EMD-24182, EMD-24183, EMD-24184 and EMD-24185.
