the synthetic IL6:IL6ST fusion protein (HyperIL6) promotes liver regeneration. Recently, autocrine IL11 activity that also acts via IL6ST but uses ERK rather than STAT3 to signal, was found to be hepatotoxic. Here we examined whether the beneficial effects of HyperIL6 could reflect unappreciated competitive inhibition of IL11-dependent IL6ST signaling. In human and mouse hepatocytes, HyperIL6 reduced N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)-induced cell death independent of STAT3 activation and instead, dose-dependently, inhibited IL11-related signaling and toxicities. In mice, expression of HyperIl6 reduced ERK activation and promoted STAT3-independent hepatic regeneration (PCNA, Cyclin D1, Ki67) following administration of either IL11 or APAP. Inhibition of putative intrinsic IL6 trans-signaling had no effect on liver regeneration in mice. Following APAP, mice deleted for <italic>Il11</italic> exhibited spontaneous liver repair but HyperIl6, despite robustly activating STAT3, had no effect on liver regeneration in this strain. These data show that synthetic IL6ST binding proteins such as HyperIL6 can have unexpected, on-target effects and suggest IL11, not IL6, as important for liver regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IL11</kwd><kwd>liver injury</kwd><kwd>IL6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/STaR/0029/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC Centre Grant to the NHCS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOH‐CIRG18nov‐0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC-LMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Goh Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tanoto Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Stuart A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFYIRG/0053/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Widjaja</surname><given-names>Anissa A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL6ST (gp130) binding proteins, such as HyperIL6, promote liver regrowth in a STAT3-indpependent manner through competitive inhibition of anti-regenerative IL11 signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The liver has an extraordinary capacity to regenerate in response to injury. Replication of hepatocytes in midlobular zone two underlies liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wei et al., 2021</xref>), with a large number of cytokines and growth factors implicated as mitogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Michalopoulos and Bhushan, 2021</xref>). Interleukin 6 (IL6), a member of the larger IL6 family of cytokines, binds with high affinity to its alpha receptor (IL6R) to signal in cis via glycoprotein 130 (gp130; IL6ST) and STAT3. Of all the cytokines implicated in liver regeneration, <italic>IL6</italic> is believed to be a predominant auxiliary mitogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Michalopoulos and Bhushan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schmidt-Arras and Rose-John, 2016</xref>). This belief is anchored on a seminal study performed in mice globally deleted for <italic>Il6</italic>, which exhibit reduced STAT3 activity and lesser liver regeneration following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cressman et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>It is thought that IL6 can bind to a soluble form of its receptor (sIL6R) to signal in trans to activate IL6 signaling in cells that express IL6ST but low/or no IL6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schmidt-Arras and Rose-John, 2016</xref>). This led to the design of an artificial fusion protein composed of a truncated form of human IL6R linked to human IL6 (HyperIL6). HyperIL6 stimulates STAT3 signaling up to 1000-fold stronger than the respective separate molecules with high affinity for IL6ST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fischer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 1998</xref>). The HyperIL6 superagonist can reverse fulminant liver failure due to toxin-induced liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Galun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hecht et al., 2001</xref>) and stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peters et al., 2000</xref>). The pro-regenerative activity of HyperIL6 has also been observed in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leibinger et al., 2021</xref>), optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fischer, 2017</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nechemia-Arbely et al., 2008</xref>), and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Matsushita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We recently found that IL11, a little studied IL6 family protein, is hepatotoxic and important for NASH pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Widjaja et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in a recent study of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)-induced liver injury, IL11 was shown to activate NOX4, ERK and JNK and impede liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Widjaja et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this study demonstrated that synthetic, IL6ST-binding proteins can compete with endogenous IL11 for binding to IL6ST and reduce APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. In light of this new data, it is possible that HyperIL6 could compete with IL11:IL11RA complexes for binding to IL6ST and thus inhibit maladaptive IL11 signaling. Here we investigated whether the mechanism of action of HyperIL6 in liver regeneration is due to inhibition of IL11 signaling and, in contrast to the accepted paradigm, independent of STAT3 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>STAT-independent HyperIL6 activity inhibits APAP- and IL11-induced hepatocyte cell death</title><p>To test our hypothesis, we studied APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.

Furthermore, S3I-201 had no effect on HyperIL6-induced cell death, ROS induction, or GSH depletion.

These experiments suggest that the beneficial effects of HyperIL6 are unrelated to STAT3 activity but instead reflect competitive inhibition of IL11 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>We then examined whether HyperIL6 could directly inhibit IL11 signaling in hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatocytes with IL11 resulted in ERK, JNK, and NOX4 activation and cell death, as expected and similar to that seen with APAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Widjaja et al., 2021</xref>). HyperIL6 dose-dependently inhibited IL11 signaling and toxicity that was independent of STAT3 phosphorylation and could be titrated away by the addition of soluble IL6ST (sIL6ST) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). We went on to show that the protective effects of HyperIL6 on APAP toxicity in human hepatocytes could be dose-dependently inhibited by the addition of sIL6ST. We confirmed again that the protective effects of HyperIL6 were STAT3 independent and instead related to inhibition of IL11 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>).</p><p>In binding assays, HyperIL6 bound to IL6ST with a similar dissociation constant as an IL11:IL11RA construct (HyperIL11) (K<sub>D</sub> = 1 nM and 0.95 nM, respectively), whereas IL6 alone did not bind to IL6ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). These data would be consistent with competitive inhibition of endogenous IL11:IL11RA binding to IL6ST by exogenous HyperIL6 and may explain why IL6 alone is ineffective for liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nechemia-Arbely et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hepatocyte-specific expression of HyperIL6 prevents APAP-induced liver injury</title><p>We next studied the effects of HyperIL6 on APAP-induced liver injury in vivo.

While some early reports questioned this assertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sakamoto et al., 1999</xref>), it is now generally accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schmidt-Arras and Rose-John, 2016</xref>).

We postulate that competition of HyperIL6 with IL11:IL11RA complexes for binding to IL6ST could explain why injection of HyperIL6, but not IL6 itself, promotes liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nechemia-Arbely et al., 2011</xref>). Our study suggests that caution is needed when interpreting assumed gain-of-function, on-target effects of synthetic IL6ST-interacting molecules such as HyperIL6, N<sub>T</sub>-3N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nishina et al., 2012</xref>) or the recently described IC7Fc fusion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Findeisen et al., 2019</xref>). IL6ST-related ligand, interacting alpha receptor, and signaling pleiotropy is large, and mechanism of effect is hard to decipher using overexpression of synthetic and alien factors. We end by suggesting IL11 instead of IL6 as a focus for regenerative studies of the liver and perhaps nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fischer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Leibinger et al., 2021</xref>) and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nechemia-Arbely et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hossein Ardehali as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) This manuscript can be significantly improved by limiting conclusions of the study to APAP-induced liver injury rather than broad and general conclusions about liver regeneration.

The techniques and methodology are also sound and multiple approaches are utilized to answer the main question of the paper.</p><p>1) The major limitation of this study is that the broad conclusion about &quot;overturning the paradigm that Il6 promotes liver regeneration&quot; is not convincingly supported by the presented data. The manuscript is mostly focused on the injury phase of APAP hepatotoxicity (6 and 24 hr post-APAP) and provides limited information on the peak regeneration phase (i.e. later time points – e.g. 48 and 72 hr post-APAP). Further, this is complicated by the fact that liver regeneration in APAP model is a compensatory phenomenon secondary to liver injury. Thus, any effect on liver injury (as observed in this manuscript) will indirectly alter liver regeneration response. Thus, it is hard to interpret about direct role of Il6 in liver regeneration in the current study. Overall, it is incorrect to interpret in general about role of Il6 in regeneration based on the limited data in the APAP model presented in this study. Cleaner model such as partial hepatectomy can be utilized for such interpretations. Further, it will be incorrect to interpret physiological role of Il6 solely based on experiments utilizing HyperIL6 overexpression. In this regard authors should discuss important previous study by James et al. utilizing Il6 KO mice in APAP model which showed that despite no effect on initial APAP-induced liver injury, Il6 KO mice displayed reduced liver regeneration and slower recovery (PMID: 13679052).</p><p>2) In Figure 3, in order to demonstrate that protective effects of HyperIL6 are independent of STAT3, authors used STAT3 inhibitor (iSTAT3). Authors investigated only single time point (6 hour post-APAP), which does not provide information if stimulation of liver regeneration by hyperIL6 is independent of STAT3. In order to study liver regeneration, authors should study later time points such as 48 hr post-APAP or at least 24 hr time point as done for other figures in the paper. Further, it is not clear from the manuscript if vehicle control group for iSTAT3 was utilized in this experiment. From in-vitro experiments presented earlier in the manuscript, I assume DMSO was the vehicle for iSTAT3. If that's the case, proper vehicle control is required as DMSO is known to inhibit Cyp2e1 and APAP metabolism to toxic metabolite and thus show protective effects against APAP toxicity.</p><p>3) This study does provide interesting data on the role of IL11 in APAP-induced liver injury but with limited mechanistic details. Based on these findings, more comprehensive and mechanistic studies in future will be helpful to delineate how IL11 regulate APAP-induced liver injury. It will also be important to rule out any impact of Il11 deletion on metabolic activation of APAP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68843.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript can be significantly improved by limiting conclusions of the study to APAP-induced liver injury rather than broad and general conclusions about liver regeneration.

The molecular and cellular markers of regeneration are apparent earlier (e.g. at 24 hours), as we showed, but it is true that effects may be more pronounced at later time points (e.g. 48 hours). To extend our findings further, we have carried out new experiments at a 48 hour time point and show the data in the revision. In addition we have now added staining for Ki67, as another marker of proliferation, as requested. Staining for Ki67 mirrors the previous data, with a marked increase following APAP seen with anti-IL11RA (X209), HyperIL6 or HyperIL6+iSTAT3 (i.e., the HyperIL6 effect remains STAT3-independent at 48 h). See revised Figure 3 and revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The findings that protective effects of HyperIL6 against APAP toxicity are Il11 dependent can be substantiated by studies examining if Il11 downstream signaling pathway is activated during APAP toxicity and if it is inhibited by hyperIL6 treatment in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision of the current manuscript we published a study on the pathomechanisms underlying IL11 effect in APAP-induced liver injury (Widjaja et al. 2021). In brief, the maladaptive signaling pathways downstream of IL11 following APAP injury are ERK and <italic>JNK</italic> mediated and related, in part, to IL11-dependent NOX4 upregulation. In the current study, we show across multiple figure panels that these pathways are consistently inhibited by HyperIL6 (in a STAT3-independent fashion) both in vitro and in vivo following either APAP injury or IL11 administration (revised Figures 1G and J; 2E and L; 3D, I and N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 shows effects of HyperIL6 on APAP toxicity in Il11 KO mice, which can be strengthened by examining if Il11 overexpression can overcome hyperIl6 competition and reverse protective effect of HyperIL6 on APAP hepatotoxicity in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe our experimental approach of gain-of-function (HyperIL6 expression) on the background of loss-of-function (IL11 KO) in the context of APAP is the most informative experimental design to address our hypothesis, in this context. We do not think the proposed approach of gain-of-function (HyperIL6 expression) combined with further gain-of-function (IL11 expression) in APAP would be insightful. The liver produces vast amounts of IL11 when damaged by APAP, indeed systemic levels go up from low pM amounts to up to 4ng/ml, and it is unlikely that systemically administered recombinant IL11 would have any effect on top of already extremely high endogenous IL11 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further similar to data in Figure 1i on IL11 toxicity, manuscript can be bolstered by data showing that protective effect of HyperIL6 on APAP toxicity can by titrated away by the addition of soluble gp130.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. In response, we have performed new experiments to examine whether or not the protective effect of HyperIL6 on APAP toxicity can be titrated away by the addition of soluble gp130 (sIL6ST). We also went one step further to determine if effects are influenced by HyperIL6-induced STAT3 activation, or not. The data from these experiments, Western blotting and GSH assessment, are presented in the revised manuscript in revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1. In short, we show that the protective effects of HyperIL6 can indeed be titrated away by sIL6ST. We also show, once again, that STAT3 activation is unrelated to the protective effects of HyperIL6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j4) Reference for generation and validation of important mouse strain (Il11 ko) is missing, which should be added.

We have now performed additional experiments that provide further confirmatory data at the 48 h time point (revised Figure 3). Indeed, markers of regeneration are more pronounced at the 48 h time point and complement the 24 h data. This is particularly noticeable for Ki67 (new data) where limited Ki67 staining is apparent in X209-treated or HyperIl6-expressing livers at 24 h (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), whereas robust staining (again STAT3-independent) is seen at 48 h (revised Figure 3K). Cyclin D1 expression is also more apparent at the 48 h time point (revised Figure 3I). In these new experiments we also included additional DMSO controls, to rule out any putative confounding vehicle effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, this is complicated by the fact that liver regeneration in APAP model is a compensatory phenomenon secondary to liver injury.

In general the degree of liver regeneration is proportional to the degree of liver injury until such a time as regeneration cannot restore liver mass / repair the liver damage. Our manuscript addresses the published and accepted role of HyperIl6 on liver regeneration from which multiple investigators have made the extension to IL6 itself. As an example see the manuscript entitled “<italic>The regenerative activity of interleukin-6</italic>” (Galun and Rose-John 2013). We have been careful in the revision not to overstate our findings and also to focus on effects of HyperIL6, not IL6 (as per the revised title), but do discuss our findings in the context of the published literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cleaner model such as partial hepatectomy can be utilized for such interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>This manuscript concerns HyperIL6 effects in APAP-induced liver injury. The study of drug-induced liver injury is made clear in the revised title and text and we thank the Reviewer for helping us sharpen our focus. After our initial discovery of the unexpected effects of HyperIL6 on IL11 signaling we think it possible that additional studies of the liver (e.g. in partial hepatectomy or CCl4 toxicity) and of other organs where HyperIL6 has a regenerative effect (e.g. kidney, optic nerve or spinal cord), may be performed. However, this does not impact the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, it will be incorrect to interpret physiological role of Il6 solely based on experiments utilizing HyperIL6 overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and make this point in the manuscript. In the revision we have made it clear that the study is of HyperIL6. Indeed, IL6 administration to mice with liver injury does not promote liver regeneration whereas HyperIL6 does (Nechemia-Arbely et al., 2011), which we now discuss (see revised conclusion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this regard authors should discuss important previous study by James et al., utilizing Il6 KO mice in APAP model which showed that despite no effect on initial APAP-induced liver injury, Il6 KO mice displayed reduced liver regeneration and slower recovery (PMID: 13679052).</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad to include this manuscript (James et al., 2003) in our revision. We had already cited the seminal paper from Science showing that IL6 KO mice had impaired regeneration (Cressman et al., 1996) and also a contradictory manuscript (Sakamoto et al., 1999), which showed otherwise. The revised manuscript has a fuller discussion of these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3, in order to demonstrate that protective effects of HyperIL6 are independent of STAT3, authors used STAT3 inhibitor (iSTAT3).

In order to study liver regeneration, authors should study later time points such as 48 hr post-APAP or at least 24 hr time point as done for other figures in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In revised manuscript we studied the effects of iSTAT3 in APAP-damaged hepatocytes and livers across a range of timepoints. in vitro, we show effects at 24 h post APAP (revised Figure 1G, I and J) and in vivo, we show effects at 6 h (revised Figure 3A-E), and at 48 h (revised Figure 3F-N). We believe this, in particular the new 48 h time point in vivo, addresses the Reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, it is not clear from the manuscript if vehicle control group for iSTAT3 was utilized in this experiment. From in-vitro experiments presented earlier in the manuscript, I assume DMSO was the vehicle for iSTAT3. If that's the case, proper vehicle control is required as DMSO is known to inhibit Cyp2e1 and APAP metabolism to toxic metabolite and thus show protective effects against APAP toxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that DMSO was used as control in the in vitro experiments and we saw no effect, as shown in the original manuscript. In our in vivo experiments, S31-201 was dissolved in DMSO as a stock solution and this was further diluted in saline (1:10) prior to injection 16 h prior to APAP. In earlier studies, which we now cite (Park et al., 1988), DMSO injected at a dose of 1ml/kg, 4 h prior to APAP was shown to reduce liver damage.</p><p>To address the Reviewer’s point, we have performed new experiments comparing DMSO only to a variety of experimental conditions (baseline, HyperIl6 expression ± iSTAT, anti-IL11RA) at a 48 h time point (revised Figure 3). This shows that DMSO has no effect on APAP-induced liver damage at any level of assessment in our model. This might reflect the lower amount of DMSO we administer (0.2ml/kg as compared to 1ml/kg used by Park et al.,), the time of administration (16 h prior to APAP, as compared to 4 h), the amount of APAP given (400mg/kg, as compared to 250mg/kg) or strain effects (we use C57BL/6NTac, as compared to BALB/c) (Widjaja et al., 2021).</p><p>For completeness, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we also examined the effects of DMSO on APAP-induced liver damage at 24 h in our model.
