Of great interest is the identification of the chemical signals that control visually guided ocular growth. Here, we provide evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), may play a pivotal role in the control of ocular growth using a chicken model of myopia. Microarray, real-time RT-qPCR, and ELISA analyses identified IL-6 upregulation in the choroids of chick eyes under two visual conditions that introduce myopic defocus and slow the rate of ocular elongation (recovery from induced myopia and compensation for positive lenses). Intraocular administration of atropine, an agent known to slow ocular elongation, also resulted in an increase in choroidal IL-6 gene expression. Nitric oxide appears to directly or indirectly upregulate choroidal IL-6 gene expression, as administration of the non-specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, inhibited choroidal IL-6 gene expression, and application of a nitric oxide donor stimulated IL-6 gene and protein expression in isolated chick choroids. Considering the pleiotropic nature of IL-6 and its involvement in many biological processes, these results suggest that IL-6 may mediate many aspects of the choroidal response in the control of ocular growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>emmetropization</kwd><kwd>choroid</kwd><kwd>myopia</kwd><kwd>IL-6</kwd><kwd>recovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY09391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>Jody Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30GM122744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>Jody Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY09391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>Jody A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL-6 gene and protein expression are rapidly and transiently upregulated in the choroid in response to myopic defocus, as a result of prior form deprivation or treatment with +15 D lenses in a nitric oxide-dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>High myopia is a significant risk factor for several blinding eye diseases including glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration, and therefore represents a leading cause of blindness worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buch et al., 2001</xref>). The prevalence of myopia is continuing to increase and is predicted to affect nearly half of the global population by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holden et al., 2016</xref>). Although clinical and experimental studies indicate that normal eye growth (emmetropization) is controlled by visual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallman and Winawer, 2004</xref>), the molecular mechanisms underlying myopia development in humans is not understood.</p><p>Animal models have provided valuable insights into the role of the visual environment in ocular growth control. Deprivation of form vision, through the use of visual ‘occluders’ or ‘goggles’ results in accelerated ocular growth and the development of myopia within a matter of days in many vertebrate species, including fish, chicks, mice, tree shrews, guinea pigs, and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howlett and McFadden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaeffel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tejedor and de la Villa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Troilo and Judge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wallman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sherman et al., 1977</xref>). Upon removal of the occluder, the elongated eye now experiences myopic defocus, which results in a rapid deceleration in ocular elongation and eventual return to emmetropia (recovery) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wallman and Adams, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Postnatal ocular growth can also be manipulated through the application of positive or negative lenses, as the eye has been shown to compensate for the imposed defocus in many vertebrates, including fish, chicks, mice, mammals, and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tkatchenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen and Sivak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Norton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham and Judge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schaeffel et al., 1988</xref>). Application of positive lenses results in images forming in front of the retina (myopic defocus). This imposed myopic defocus causes slowing of the rate of ocular elongation and thickening of the choroid, which effectively pushes the retina toward the image plane, thereby minimizing the imposed refractive error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wallman et al., 1995</xref>). Conversely, application of negative lenses moves the image plane behind the retina (hyperopic defocus) and results in an increased rate of axial elongation and thinning of the choroid to pull the retina back toward the image plane.</p><p>It is well established that visually induced changes in ocular growth are the result of a locally driven ‘retina-to-choroid-to-scleral molecular signaling cascade’ that is initiated by a visual stimulus, followed by biochemical and structural changes in the retina and choroid, ultimately resulting in altered extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling of the scleral shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Troilo and Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tkatchenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer and Reh, 2000</xref>). The choroid, a highly vascularized layer located immediately adjacent to the sclera, has been shown to undergo changes in thickness, permeability, and blood flow during periods of visually guided eye growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rada and Palmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzgerald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pendrak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wallman et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, due to its proximity to the sclera, the choroid is suspected to synthesize and/or release scleral growth regulators to control the rate of ocular elongation in response to visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rada and Palmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marzani and Wallman, 1997</xref>).

Of much interest, therefore, is the identification of genes causally involved in the regulation of the choroidal response during visually guided eye growth.</p><p>Here, we report rapid and significant changes in choroidal gene expression of the cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to myopic defocus and in response to chemical compounds known to modulate eye growth.

No significant differences were detected in IL-6 gene expression following 6 hr of +15 D lens wear. Treatment with –15 D lenses had no statistically significant effect on choroidal IL-6 gene expression, although a trend toward decreased expression was noted. Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was also assessed following 24 hr of lens treatment to confirm that the +15 D and –15 D lenses were inducing compensatory ocular growth responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, treatment with +15 D lenses resulted in a significant decrease in scleral proteoglycan synthesis (p=0.00047, paired t-test) and treatment with –15 D lenses resulted in a significant increase in scleral proteoglycan synthesis (p=0.0403, paired t-test).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effect of imposed defocus on choroidal IL-6 gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

We therefore investigated the role of nitric oxide on choroidal IL-6 transcription using several approaches. First, L-NAME, or vehicle, was administered via intravitreal injection to chick eyes following 10 days of form deprivation. Chicks were then given unrestricted vision for 6 hr and choroidal IL-6 mRNA was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Choroidal upregulation of IL-6 is rapid and transient; significant increases in gene expression were observed after only 90 min of unrestricted vision. IL-6 gene expression reaches a maximum level of expression following 6 hr of recovery, and then begins to decline, returning to control levels by 4 days of recovery. The visual stimulus for choroidal IL-6 gene expression is myopic defocus, as a similar rise in IL-6 is observed after 6 hr of positive (+15 D) lens wear. Finally, nitric oxide appears to directly or indirectly upregulate choroidal IL-6 gene expression. We and others have previously shown that changes in the visual environment can cause rapid changes in ocular growth and refraction as evidenced by changes in scleral proteoglycan synthesis, choroidal retinoic acid synthesis, and choroidal thickness (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Troilo and Smith, 2019</xref>). The chemical mediators that translate visual signals to scleral ECM remodeling to effect changes in eye size have been only partly identified. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine synthesized by a variety of cell types that plays key roles in immune responses, inflammatory reactions, as well as the growth and differentiation of many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kishimoto, 2006</xref>). For these reasons, choroidally derived IL-6 could play an important role in the retina-to-sclera signaling cascade. Here, we demonstrate that myopic defocus, as a result of prior form vision deprivation, or due to application of +15 D lenses, stimulates choroidal IL-6 gene expression. In contrast, induction of hyperopic defocus through the application of –15 D lenses resulted in a slight decrease in choroidal IL-6 gene expression, that did not reach statistical significance in the present study.</p><p>The observed increase in choroidal IL-6 mRNA was transient; choroidal IL-6 mRNA concentrations peaked at 6 hr following removal of the occluder (myopic defocus), and returned to control levels by 4 days. This transient increase in choroidal IL-6 mRNA is similar to that observed for plasma IL-6 following strenuous exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ostrowski et al., 1998</xref>), following ischemic brain injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fassbender et al., 1994</xref>), surgical trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishimoto et al., 1989</xref>), and in a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis following treatment with interferon-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakatsuji et al., 2006</xref>). It is thought that IL-6 synthesis and release from contracting muscle cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and/or other cell types initiates a cytokine cascade, inducing the expression of other cytokines, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist, to provide a negative feedback loop to reduce the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 1995</xref>). It is unclear as to whether the 6 hr peak in choroidal IL-6 observed in the present study is related to the duration of myopic defocus needed to initiate the maximal IL-6 response, or due to the minimum time required for choroidal IL-6 gene transcription to be upregulated in response to the initial visual stimulus. Our finding of elevated choroidal IL-6 mRNA in treated eyes following only 45 min of myopic defocus together with the previous observation that compensation for positive lenses can occur with as little as 10 min of myopic defocus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), lead us to favor the latter possibility—that is, a very brief period of myopic defocus would likely stimulate a transient increase in choroidal IL-6 transcription, that reaches a peak 6 hr later.</p><p>Choroidal IL-6 gene expression was not significantly affected by rearing chicks in varying light intensities (5–3150 lux), or rearing for 6 hrs in red or blue LED light (58 and 111 lux, respectively), but was significantly lower in choroids from chicks reared in constant darkness for 6 hr, compared with birds reared in any other light conditions examined. It should be noted that the light intensities of the red and blue LED lights used in the present study were relatively low, compared with that of the medium and high intensities of the white LED lights, due to limitations of the maximum light intensity of the red LED lights. It is therefore possible that choroidal IL-6 gene expression might be differentially affected under higher intensity red and blue LED lighting conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2018</xref> previously reported that continuous exposure to blue LED light (435 lux) for 5 days caused a significant hyperopic shift in refraction in both control and form deprived eyes, but had no significant effect on axial length in either control or form deprived eyes (although a trend toward a decrease in axial length was observed in both control and form deprived eyes). Since refraction was significantly affected in blue LED light-reared chicks, but axial length was only minimally affected, we suspect that continual exposure to blue light may have affected other ocular parameters (such as corneal curvature) that would have a significant impact on refraction. We predict that choroidal IL-6 expression is involved in the choroidal and scleral remodeling processes at the posterior pole of the eye that result in changes in vitreous chamber elongation, as opposed to having effects on the anterior segment of the eye. Since IL-6 gene expression was not affected by short-term exposure to red or blue LED light, we predict that exposure to red or blue LED light would have no effect on scleral remodeling, vitreous chamber depth, or axial length, under the conditions used in the present study. Further studies, using higher intensity LED lights, together with additional ocular growth measurements (such as corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth, and lens thickness) are necessary to fully elucidate the role of red and blue LED light on choroidal IL-6 expression, ocular growth, and refraction.</p><p>Protein levels of IL-6 were also significantly increased in choroids of recovering eyes following 6 hr of recovery, but were not significantly different following 24 hr of recovery. We suspect that IL‐6 protein is released from choroids and either enters the circulation or adjacent ocular tissues shortly after its synthesis as has been described for IL-6 in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steensberg et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Clinical studies have previously suggested an association between inflammation and the progression of myopia. A higher incidence of myopia has been reported among patients with inflammatory diseases such as type 1 diabetes, uveitis, juvenile chronic arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus compared to those without inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fledelius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamath et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbort et al., 2011</xref> hypothesized that anatomic changes of the eye due to myopia lead to fragility of the choriocapillaris and RPE, predisposing myopic eyes to inflammatory ocular conditions, thereby suggesting that ocular inflammation is a consequence, rather than a cause of myopia. However, our observed elevation in choroidal IL-6 gene and protein expression in response to recovery/myopic defocus does not appear to be due to a general inflammatory response, as other pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, were unaffected by visual manipulations. IL-1B was significantly elevated following 6 hr of recovery, but was unaffected at 1.5 and 3 hr of recovery, suggesting that changes in IL-1B gene expression are downstream to that of IL-6, as has been demonstrated for Il-6 and other plasma cytokines following strenuous exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ostrowski et al., 1999</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tilg et al., 1994</xref>), and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The finding that myopic defocus significantly upregulated choroidal IL-6 transcription, but hyperopic defocus had only a modest effect at downregulating choroidal IL-6, may be related to the observation that myopic defocus is a more potent stimulus than hyperopic defocus at causing changes in choroid thickness, with regard to the duration of lens wear needed to elicit changes in choroidal thickness, as well as the duration of the response to lens wear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>). If IL-6 is involved in mediating changes in choroidal thickness, we would predict that myopic defocus-induced increases in choroidal IL-6 gene and protein expression would induce changes in choroidal thickness that would outweigh and outlast the minor reduction in IL-6 expression induced by brief periods of hyperopic defocus.</p><p>If choroidal IL-6 gene expression is causally related to ocular changes associated with recovery from myopia, then agents known to block recovery should also block choroidal IL-6 upregulation. To test this, we evaluated choroidal IL-6 gene expression in recovering eyes following intravitreal application of the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. L-NAME has previously been shown to prevent choroidal thickening and disinhibit scleral proteoglycan synthesis during recovery from induced myopia and in response to positive lens wear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nickla et al., 2006</xref>). We found that intravitreal treatment with L-NAME significantly attenuated the recovery-induced increase in choroidal IL-6 gene expression, indicating that nitric oxide either directly or indirectly regulates choroidal IL-6 gene expression. Treatment of isolated choroids with the NO donor, PAPA-NONOate stimulated IL-6 gene, and protein expression, confirming that choroidal IL-6 is upregulated by NO. NO has been reported to stimulate IL-6 production in skeletal myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makris et al., 2010</xref>), human blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siednienko et al., 2011</xref>), and kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demirel et al., 2012</xref>) by activating ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK-signaling pathways. We also found that p38 MAPK signaling was crucial for the PAPA-NONOate-mediated activation of IL-6 in chick choroids as incubation with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, abolished PAPA-NONOate-stimulation of IL-6 gene expression.</p><p>The concentration of retinal dopamine has been implicated in the regulation of eye growth. Daytime levels of retinal dopamine were shown to be reduced in form deprived chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stone et al., 1989</xref>) and monkey eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iuvone et al., 1989</xref>). Furthermore, intravitreal injections of apomorphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stone et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iuvone et al., 1991</xref>) or dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2006</xref>) prevented the development of deprivation myopia. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nickla et al., 2013</xref> demonstrated that the dopamine agonist, quinpirole, prevented the development of myopia via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism, indicating that dopamine acts upstream of NO in the signal cascade mediating ocular growth inhibition. In view of our results demonstrating a role for nitric oxide in the regulation of choroidal IL-6 expression, we suspect that dopamine and nitric oxide are located upstream of choroidal IL-6 in the retina-to-scleral signaling cascade.</p><p>In the present study, since L-NAME was delivered intravitreally and NO was delivered directly to the choroid (via PAPA-NONOate), it is unclear as to the cellular source of NO generated in response to myopic defocus that is responsible for IL-6 upregulation. NO and nNOS (NOS1) have been detected in virtually all types of retinal neurons, in the RPE, and in several cell types in the chick choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer and Stell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eldred, 2000</xref>). Our finding suggests that treatment of isolated choroids with the NOS substrate, L-arginine, in the presence of 50 mM KCl can similarly upregulate choroidal IL-6 transcription that suggests the endogenous sources of nitric oxide within the choroid have the potential to regulate IL-6 mRNA and protein synthesis. It is also unclear as to the cellular source of choroidal IL-6 in response to myopic defocus. Our immunohistochemical evaluation of IL-6 protein distribution indicated that IL-6 was present as discrete puncta in the RPE, choroidal vascular endothelial cells, and extravascular stromal cells. Any of these cells, as well as myeloid and lymphoid cells, could be the source of visually induced IL-6. However, IL-6-positive choroidal cells identified in the present study may indicate internalization of IL-6 following synthesis and secretion by neighboring cells via a paracrine signaling mechanism, and not necessarily the site of IL-6 synthesis.</p><p>Atropine has been shown to prevent experimentally induced myopia in chicks and inhibits myopia development in some children when applied topically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chia et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore evaluated choroidal IL-6 gene expression following in vivo and in vitro treatment with atropine. We found that a single intravitreal injection of atropine to chicks undergoing form deprivation-induced myopia stimulated choroidal IL-6 gene expression. Moreover, incubation of isolated choroids with 0.1% atropine also stimulated choroidal IL-6 gene and protein expression, suggesting that atropine acts directly on the choroid to stimulate IL-6 synthesis.</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that choroidal IL-6 is a likely player in the retina-to-sclera signaling cascade underpinning visually guided ocular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Of great interest, therefore, are the upstream regulators of choroidal IL-6 gene transcription that relay visual signals, initiated in the retina, to the choroid to bring about changes in IL-6 protein synthesis. IL-6 transcription has been shown to be regulated by a number of factors, including steroid hormones, glucocorticoids, TNF-α, interferon-γ, Il-1b, epidermal growth factor, and amphiregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo and Zheng, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bersinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisi et al., 2010</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahtouk et al., 2005</xref>), and some of these mediators have been implicated in myopia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2015</xref>).

Nitric oxide, synthesized in the retina and/or in the choroid by NOS from L-arginine (L-arg), stimulates choroidal expression of IL-6 via a p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. Choroidal IL-6, in turn, potentially coordinates many of the features of the choroidal response to myopic defocus including: (1) increased synthesis of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and hyaluronic acid (HA), (2) increased synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and (3) increased cell proliferation, which result in choroidal thickening, increased vascular permeability, and increased retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), respectively. These choroidal changes lead to the production of scleral growth regulators, such as all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (atRA), that regulate scleral remodeling, such as decreased scleral proteoglycan (PG) synthesis (in chicks) to result in a slowing of ocular growth and recovery from myopia.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70608-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, we report that myopic defocus, either in eyes recovering from induced myopia, or in eyes treated with +15 D spectacle lenses, stimulates IL-6 mRNA and protein synthesis in the chick choroid. The ramifications of increased choroidal IL-6 synthesis are unclear. In the context of ocular growth control, it appears that choroidal IL-6 is associated with a slowing of eye growth, as it is upregulated in recovering eyes (when eyes are decelerating their rate of elongation) and in myopic eyes treated with atropine, an agent known to inhibit vitreous chamber elongation and myopia. Moreover, IL-6 mRNA is downregulated in recovering eyes treated with L-NAME, a compound known to inhibit recovery and increase scleral proteoglycan synthesis and ocular elongation. Treatment of isolated sclera with IL-6 had no effect on scleral proteoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that additional downstream mediators, most likely derived from the choroid, are responsible for regulating the scleral changes associated with recovery.</p><p>On the other hand, studies have shown that IL-6 has a major role in the pathology of uveitis, glaucoma, retinal vein occlusion, macula edema, and diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zahir-Jouzdani et al., 2017</xref>). IL-6 induces ocular inflammatory responses often leading to the breakdown of the blood ocular barrier, angiogenesis, increased vascular permeability, and choroidal neovascularization. Based on the results of the present study, it is possible that myopic defocus in humans, as a result of uncorrected myopia, may cause elevated choroidal IL-6 which could predispose individuals to one or more of the above serious ocular complications.</p><p>The identification of small molecule or biological approaches to manipulate choroidal IL-6 concentrations will elucidate the role of choroidal IL-6 in postnatal ocular growth, as well as in a variety of ocular conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type(species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-chick IL-6(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-RadLaboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: AHP942ZRRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2127753">AB_2127753</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:20)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken IL-6Taqman GeneExpression Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo FisherScientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gg03337980_m1unlabeled PCR primers andFAM-labeled TaqMan probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken interferon γTaqMan GeneExpression Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ThermoFisherScientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gg03348618_m1unlabeled PCR primers andFAM-labeled TaqMan probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken IL-1βTaqMan GeneExpression Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo FisherScientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gg03347154_g1unlabeled PCR primers andFAM-labeled TaqMan probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken TNF-α(LITAF) TaqMan GeneExpression Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo FisherScientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gg03364359_m1 unlabeled PCR primers andFAM-labeled TaqMan probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken GAPDHTaqMan GeneExpression Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo FisherScientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gg03346982_m1unlabeled PCR primers andFAM-labeled TaqMan probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken IL-6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-RadLaboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: PAP003</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High capacityRNA-to-cDNA kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AppliedBiosystems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 4388950</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DNase treatment&amp;

Usually it is due to excessive elongation of the optic axis of the eye during the ages of most rapid growth, causing images of distant objects to be blurred at the retinal photoreceptors. Despite extensive epidemiological and animal studies in the past several decades, the underlying causal mechanisms remain poorly known, and therapeutic options are limited. Therefore, further discovery of new candidate mechanisms, drug targets and drugs for inhibiting the onset and progression of myopia is urgently needed. This paper links the upregulation of IL-6 expression to axial elongation and myopic defocus experienced by the retina. This manuscript is an important contribution to the elucidation of the mechanistic underpinnings of myopia.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Visually Induced Changes in Cytokine Production in the Chick Choroid&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William K. Stell (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers were excited about the novel finding connecting in juvenile chicken models, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) – synthesized and released in the choroid – to the regulation of axial elongation and refraction of the eye.</p><p>1) Most of the issues revolved around the connection between NO signaling and IL-6. The reviewers would like either new experiments to better substatiate this connection or perhaps consider removing this concept altogether. The reviewers did not come to a consensus on this point but overall, they all agreed that with changes, publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is warranted. Therefore, please consider both options.</p><p>2) There are significant changes to the writing required. Please see each point of all three reviews. In addition, higher magnification microscopy is required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be extraordinarily helpful for you to create a schematic representation of your concluding hypothesis – that is, how you think IL-6 fits into the signalling system or network that transforms visual information from the retina into regulation of scleral 'growth' and axial elongation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a solid experimental study of the role of IL-6 in the control of the response of chicken eyes to myopic defocus in two paradigms – that in which, after the removal of the diffusers, in eyes made myopic through form-deprivation, the rate of axial elongation slows, and in the paradigm in which myopic defocus imposed with positive lenses similarly slows axial elongation.</p><p>There is, however, a general issue in the terminology used in the presentation of the results that causes confusion. For example, in Figure 1, it is not clear to me what treated eyes are. The authors need to carefully distinguish between untreated but age-matched control eyes, contralateral control eyes, and eyes that have developed myopia and the are baseline for looking at the recovery process.</p><p>Figure 1 shows IL-6 immunolocalisation in treated and recovering eyes. I am afraid that the magnifications are too low to clearly see localisation to the structures mentioned, or to see any changes. An image of general cell staining would help in for orientation.</p><p>Figure 2 shows that IL-6 mRNA expression increases during recovery by over 10-fold. I cannot see any evidence of a corresponding change in the immunohistochemistry in Figure 1. Why?</p><p>Figure 3 shows a transient (around 4 day) increase in IL-6 mRNA expression during the recovery process, and major changes in expression of TNF-α.</p><p>Figure 4 confirms that IL-6 gene expression is down-regulated in the dark, and shows that a range of lighting conditions restores expression.</p><p>Figure 5 shows that IL-6 gene expression is increased by imposed myopic defocus, but that imposed hyperopic defocus has much smaller, possibly insignificant effects. Partially corresponding changes were seen in scleral proteoglycan synthesis.</p><p>Figure 6 shows that L-NAME reduces the changes in expression during recovery, implicating NO in the pathway. Figure 7 uses an NO-donor on isolated choroids to confirm this effect.It also shows that MAPK pathways may be involved.</p><p>Figure 8 shows that atropine, which is known to slow axial elongation, also increases IL-6 expression in the choroid.</p><p>One of the intriguing findings of the study is that atropine stimulates IL-6 expression in isolated choroids, suggesting a direct effect. Since the site and mode of action remains controversial despite its now wide-spread use in controlling myopia progression, this is an important lead for future experimentation.</p><p>There are also some excessive statements made in the Introduction that need correction.</p><p>Line 39: The estimates of the future prevalence of myopia made by Holden et al., are only predictions. They might become &quot;expectations&quot; if there was general acceptance of the underlying methodology, but I believe that the model on which the predictions are based is fundamentally flawed. Unless the authors have carefully considered the methodology, and find it convincing, the authors should reword this section. This problem can be fixed by changing the word &quot;expected&quot; to &quot;predicted.&quot;</p><p>Line 41-42: The statement that &quot;the cause of human myopia is not understood&quot; cannot be justified. This statement does not reflect the current state of the literature, although it may be that the authors are not familiar with the literature on human myopia. The simplest way to solve this problem is simply to drop the statement. Otherwise, the authors will need to become more familiar with the literature, which suggests that at least two major causes have been identified, namely intensive education, perhaps captured by nearwork, and deprivation of time outdoors. Both are particularly common in East and Southeast Asia where it is well-known that there is an epidemic of myopia.</p><p>While I do not want to dispute the next statement, that work on animal models has provided valuable insights into the role that the visual environment plays in control of eye growth, it is not clear how the defocus controls studied in this paper are involved in the effects of nearwork, if they in fact are. The situation is clearer with deprivation of time outdoors, because it links to a well-described role of decreased dopamine release in the development of myopia in the animal models. This is important for the current paper because Nickla and colleagues have shown that dopaminergic agents affect choroidal thickness, suggesting a rather obvious set of further experiments.</p><p>Line 45: Normal visual input is not restored by removal of the occluder. Rather, a myopically defocused image is imposed. This would still lack much of the high spatial frequency content eliminated by the occlude, but it is clearly sufficient to restore some normality to control of eye growth.</p><p>The authors raise the potentially interesting possibility that since myopic defocus increases IL-6 expression, that there is over-expression in myopia eyes, presumably even in adult eyes that no longer respond actively to growth signals. They imply that this could contribute to at least some of the long-term consequences of high myopia in particular. The qualification that needs to be added is that it does not seem that correction reduces the pathological consequences of myopia, but given the long-term nature of the processes in humans, and the fact that correction is rarely constant, it remains an interesting suggestion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Several deficiencies must be addressed before the paper is published:</p><p>1.

It is well-established that visually induced changes in ocular length are the result of a locally driven &quot;retina-to-choroid-to-scleral chemical signaling cascade&quot; that is initiated by a visual stimulus, followed by chemical changes in the retina and choroid, ultimately resulting in altered extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling of the scleral shell (Troilo, Smith et al., 2019).</p><p>I would not call this signaling cascade &quot;chemical&quot;. I would suggest the term &quot;biochemical&quot; or &quot;molecular&quot;. Moreover, this cascade leads not only to the scleral ECM remodeling, but also influences neurogenesis in the peripheral retina. See ref [10, 11].</p><p>8. Lines 74-75.

I am not sure I agree with the interpretation of results. Your data clearly show that the increase in IL-6 expression is transient – the expression quickly increases and then rapidly drops. This suggests that IL-6 may play a role of the early response gene. It is very difficult to interpret these results though because there are no data on how refractions were changing during this period. I suggest adding refractive error data to this section, and please reflect the fact that the increase in IL-6 expression is transient. This should also be discussed in the Discussion.</p><p>17. Lines 136-144 and Figure 4. Your data suggest a light-intensity/wave-length-dependent response, with maximum at 700 lux. Do you have an explanation for this phenomenon?

Please, consider discussing existing literature on choroidal signaling in myopia. For example, reviews of the choroidal signaling can be found in refs [12, 13].</p><p>27. Discussion. This section would also benefit from a review of existing literature on the role interleukins in eye physiology and refractive eye development. For example, two recent studies implicated several interleukins in emmetropization; see refs [14, 15]. The paper by Tkatchenko et al., [14] in fact found that interleukin signaling was activated in the retina of monkeys exposed to positive lenses and not in monkeys exposed to negative lenses, which is very relevant to the current study and suggests that there is a continues cascade between the retina and choroid.</p><p>28. Line 279-280. I think it is important to discuss the transient nature of IL-6 upregulation and possible implications of this finding.</p><p>29. Lines 286-287. &quot;The identification of a chemical mediator of these visually induced changes in ocular growth has been elusive.&quot; Literature suggests that there are multiple mediators and it is very unlikely that IL-6 is THE mediator of visually induced changes in eye growth.</p><p>30. Line 287. The use of the term &quot;pleiotropic&quot; is not appropriate in this context. Please, consider replacing.</p><p>31. Line 289-290. &quot;For these reasons, choroidally derived IL-6 is an attractive candidate as a potential mediator in the retina-to-sclera signaling cascade.&quot;</p><p>It is unlikely that IL-6 is THE mediator of visually induced changes in eye growth. The cascade regulating emmetropization is much more complicated that a single gene. While IL-6 is up-regulated in response to positive lenses, it does not exhibit a sign-of-defocus-specific expression pattern. Conversely, several other genes exhibiting sign-of-defocus-dependent expression have been identified.</p><p>32.

The animal models we used in the present study; form deprivation, recovery from form deprivation, and lens induced myopia and hyperopia, are all well characterized visual manipulations that induce pronounced changes in eye growth in a variety of animal models. The association between near work and myopia is anecdotal; to my knowledge there are no prospective studies demonstrating a causal relationship between near work and myopia. Studies demonstrating a role for time outdoors and protection from myopia are very exciting and interesting, and the link with retinal dopamine is substantiated. However, it is still unclear as to how time outdoors is protective for myopia development. Retinal dopamine may be involved, but it is unknown as to how retinal dopamine may regulate scleral remodeling and axial elongation. Nickla et al., 2013, demonstrated that the dopamine agonist, quinpirole, prevented the development of myopia via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. In the present study, we observe that choroidal Il-6 is also regulated by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Taken together, we suspect that dopamine and nitric oxide are both involved in the retina-to-scleral chemical cascade and are located upstream of Il-6.

Line 109-126 and Figure 3. I am not sure I agree with the interpretation of results. Your data clearly show that the increase in IL-6 expression is transient – the expression quickly increases and then rapidly drops. This suggests that IL-6 may play a role of the early response gene. It is very difficult to interpret these results though because there are no data on how refractions were changing during this period. I suggest adding refractive error data to this section, and please reflect the fact that the increase in IL-6 expression is transient. This should also be discussed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the increase in IL-6 is transient and suspect that the rapid, transient increase in IL-6 triggers a variety of other choroidal changes. We have added additional discussion on this point (lines 313 – 329). Since we demonstrate significant changes in Il-6 following short period of recovery or lens wear (1.5 hr – 24 hr), we don’t expect to be able to measure any changes in refraction in that brief period of time, with the equipment that we have. To attempt to address this concern, we did include refractions of chick eyes following 10 days of form deprivation (at the time of recovery, Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) as well as the refractions of chick eyes while wearing the +15D and -15D lenses (Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.
