The canonical function of connexins is to form gap junctions in which two hexameric connexons, or hemichannels, in closely apposed membranes dock together to form an intercellular channel. However connexins can also function as hemichannels, thereby providing large conductance channels, which allow passage of small molecules such as ATP into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We have recently shown that Cx26 hemichannels are directly sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). When CO<sub>2</sub> binds to Cx26, it carbamylates K125, forms a salt bridge to R104 and opens the hemichannel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). Cx26 hemichannels are thus a source of CO<sub>2</sub>-gated ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Mutations of Cx26 are the commonest cause of non-syndromic hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cohn and Kelley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kelley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</xref>). Some of these mutations cause loss of functional protein, while other mutations result in gap junctions and hemichannels with altered properties. However the effect of these mutations on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26 has never been examined. Some missense mutations of Cx26 cause serious pathologies in humans, such as the very rare ectodermal disorder, Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness (KID) syndrome. KID syndrome involves a combination of deafness, visual impairment, and dermatological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caceres-Rios et al., 1996</xref>). About 100 cases have been reported in the literature, and of these around 70% are caused by de novo mutations in Cx26, with the remainder being inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or via germ line mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sbidian et al., 2010</xref>). To date there are nine missense mutations that can cause KID syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</xref>). The severity of the symptoms of KID syndrome depends on the particular mutation in Cx26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jonard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The mutation, Cx26<sup>A88V</sup>, is linked to a very severe form of KID syndrome, which is fatal in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haruna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koppelhus et al., 2010</xref>). In one of the original reports linking Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> to KID syndrome, the patient required mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koppelhus et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting a possible effect of the mutation on the neural control of breathing. In KID syndrome caused by a different missense mutation (G45E), which is fatal within the first year of life, there are also reports of breathing problems. One patient required mechanical ventilation immediately after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janecke et al., 2005</xref>) and a second died from breathing failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sbidian et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, without detailed recordings of cardiorespiratory activity, it is not possible to know whether these patients experienced inadequate central respiratory drive. For other mutations linked to KID syndrome there are no reports of abnormal breathing in the literature.</p><p>The reason why the A88V and G45E mutations should cause such pervasive and severe pathology remains unclear as subunits of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> and Cx26<sup>G45E</sup> form both functional gap junctions and hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gerido et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mhaske et al., 2013</xref>). Expression of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> in HeLa cells gives rise to enhanced hemichannel-mediated currents (compared to wild type Cx26, Cx26<sup>WT</sup>) at positive transmembrane potentials and in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to the suggestion that this mutation represents a gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mhaske et al., 2013</xref>). The G45E mutation, also causes enhanced hemichannel activity in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and increased permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gerido et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>). A gain of function has therefore been suggested as underlying the actions of this mutation too. Although the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> opens connexin hemichannels, this condition is unlikely to occur in physiological systems. Thus the consequences of the A88V and G45E mutations on physiologically relevant gating of Cx26 remain unclear.</p><p>We identified a patient with KID syndrome caused by a heterozygous Cx26 A88V mutation. This patient failed to breathe spontaneously at birth and initially required mechanical ventilation. Later when he started to breathe spontaneously, he continued to demonstrate periods of apnea and bradycardia. A pneumogram performed at a post-menstrual age of 40 weeks showed abnormal persistence of central apnea lasting â¥20 s and accompanied by periods of bradycardia and prolonged oxygen desaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This respiratory pattern is abnormal for the age of the infant and is suggestive of blunted chemosensory control of breathing. Given the previously described role of Cx26 in mediating the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent drive to breathe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huckstepp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>), we considered whether the mutation A88V might alter the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of Cx26.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04249.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Incidence of central sleep apnea in a patient with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup>.</title><p>Recording of cardiorespiratory activity during sleep from an infant at a post-menstrual age of 40 weeks diagnosed with KID syndrome. Traces of nasal air flow, thoracic movement, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR) and arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation show that this patient exhibited a prolonged period during which no effort was made to breathe and this was followed by pronounced bradycardia and arterial O<sub>2</sub> desaturation, all of which are characteristic of central sleep apnea. Unfortunately, at 2 months of age this patient died from overwhelming sepsis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04249.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04249.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04249-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We introduced the A88V mutation into Cx26 and then tested the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> hemichannels expressed in HeLa cells via an established and sensitive dye-loading protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). Under conditions of normal extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, HeLa cells expressing wild type Cx26 hemichannels readily load with carboxyfluorescein when exposed to a moderately hypercapnic saline (PCO<sub>2</sub> 55 mmHg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>). However HeLa cells expressing Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> showed no such CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading even when exposed to higher levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> (70 mmHg, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The failure to exhibit CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading was not due to a lack of functional hemichannels as the positive control of removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which opens all connexin hemichannels, caused robust dye loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). HeLa cells transfected with an empty vector do not show any dye loading in response to a CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus or removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly therefore, the conservative mutation A88V caused Cx26 hemichannels to lose their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>. As this mutation is far from the residues involved in CO<sub>2</sub> binding (K125 and R104), the mechanism for the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is unclear.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04249.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> hemichannels are no longer sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(Top) Images of HeLa cells expressing Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> under control, hypercapnic and zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions.

We transfected HeLa cells that stably expressed Cx26<sup>WT</sup> with the Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> subunit and documented their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> following transfection. 4 days after transfection with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup>, the HeLa cells still exhibited sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but this was reduced compared to the Cx26<sup>WT</sup> HeLa cells that had not been transfected with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). 5 and 6 days after transfection, the HeLa cells showed no sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This in turn suggests that Cx26-mediated CO<sub>2</sub> sensing may be important for human physiology in the range of contexts that are associated with the diverse pathologies linked to this mutation. In the closely related Î² connexin, connexin30 (Cx30), the mutation A88V connected to Clouston's Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bosen et al., 2014</xref>), may result in constitutively open Cx30 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Essenfelder et al., 2004</xref>). However Cx30 is also opened by CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</xref>) and the effect of this mutation on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx30 has not yet been investigated. There are no reports in the literature of disordered breathing in patients with Clouston's syndrome.</p><p>Previous studies suggesting that the A88V mutation gave a gain of function in Cx26, examined hemichannel function in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mhaske et al., 2013</xref>). As the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of the mutated hemichannel was not specifically examined in this previous study, it is likely that both sets of findings are correctâan enhancement of macroscopic hemichannel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mhaske et al., 2013</xref>), and a loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. However under physiological conditions of normal extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and in the presence of physiological CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>â</sup> buffering, we suggest that A88V should be considered as a loss-of-function mutation that effectively removes the capacity for CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked ATP release via Cx26 hemichannels.</p><p>Our report is the first to document altered central respiratory drive in a KID syndrome patient. In rodents, CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of Cx26 contributes to the chemosensory control of breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huckstepp et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>). Although we do not know if the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in Cx26 contributed to the aberrant respiratory drive exhibited by this patient, these results are consistent with this possibility, and represent the first evidence to suggest that Cx26 hemichannels are a requisite component of the drive to breathe in humans. Overall the ability of physiological levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> to permit ATP release via Cx26 hemichannels may be important in the epidermis, cochlea and brain. Investigation of whether the absence of this mechanism of ATP release in patients with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> contributes to the serious pathological abnormalities that they suffer would seem to be warranted.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Case study</title><p>The Institutional Review Board of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center considered this under the category of a case report and thus exempt from formal review.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Mutant connexin production</title><p>Puc19 Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> was produced from wild type Cx26 via the Quikchange protocol using the following primers: forward 5â² TGT CCA CGC CGG TCC TCC TGG TAG C 3â² reverse 5â² GCT ACC AGG AGG ACC GGC GTG GAC A 3â².

Using ImageJ, the extent of dye loading was measured by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around individual cells and calculating the mean pixel intensity for the ROI. The mean pixel intensity of the background fluorescence was also measured in a representative ROI, and this value was subtracted from the measures obtained from the cells. All of the images displayed in the figures reflect this procedure in that the mean intensity of the pixels in a representative background ROI has been subtracted from every pixel of the image. The analysis of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> was performed as five independent repetitions in which at least 40 cells were measured in each condition, and the mean pixel intensities plotted as cumulative probability distributions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>LM, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>NH, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>DKM, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>ND, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The Institutional Review Board of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center considered this under the category of a case report and thus exempt from formal review.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bosen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schutz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Beinhauer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Strenzke</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Franz</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Willecke</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><year>2014</year><article-title>The Clouston syndrome mutation connexin30 A88V leads to hyperproliferation of sebaceous glands and hearing impairments in mice</article-title><source>FEBS Letters</source><volume>588</volume><fpage>1795</fpage><lpage>1801</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.febslet.2014.03.040</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caceres-Rios</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamayo-Sanchez</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Duran-Mckinster</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>de la Luz Orozco</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruiz-Maldonado</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year>1996</year><article-title>Keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness (KID syndrome): review of the literature and proposal of a new terminology</article-title><source>Pediatric Dermatology</source><volume>13</volume><fpage>105</fpage><lpage>113</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1525-1470.1996.tb01414.x</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cohn</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name></person-group><year>1999</year><article-title>Clinical phenotype and mutations in connexin 26 (DFNB1/GJB2), the most common cause of childhood hearing loss</article-title><source>American Journal of Medical Genetics</source><volume>89</volume><fpage>130</fpage><lpage>136</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19990924)89:3&lt;130::AID-AJMG3&gt;3.0.CO;2-M</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cruciani</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikalsen</surname><given-names>SO</given-names></name></person-group><year>2006</year><article-title>The vertebrate connexin family</article-title><source>Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences</source><volume>63</volume><fpage>1125</fpage><lpage>1140</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00018-005-5571-8</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Curran-Everett</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>Multiple comparisons: philosophies and illustrations</article-title><source>American Journal of Physiology.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Juan Saez, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your findings reported here are very interesting; however, you have no direct evidence that there are carbamylation changes in the A88V mutant. Hence, speculation regarding specific mechanism should be removed from the manuscript, since we all agree that your observations may not be the result of changes in carbamylation. We had an active discussion about the value of asking you to include expanded information on the patient and particularly about familial history of the disease in order to link the mutation to the respiratory phenotype.

This is a complex area as different mutations in Cx26 give forms of the syndrome that differ in their severity. The mutation A88V causes a highly severe form that is fatal in early childhood. In the first report linking A88V to KID syndrome, a requirement for mechanical ventilation was noted; a second report on A88V did not note any respiratory problems. A different mutation, G45E, also caused a severe form of KID syndrome, which was fatal in the first year of life. There are two reports of abnormal breathing in these patients. However no detailed cardiorespiratory recordings were presented in these prior descriptions of KID syndrome, and thus we cannot assess whether the abnormalities in breathing resulted from a loss of central respiratory drive.</p><p>For other mutations linked to KID syndrome such as D50N, which generally give a less severe form of the disease, there are no reports of breathing abnormalities in the literature. However we would be cautious in concluding from this that such abnormalities do not exist. It is possible that they were not sufficiently severe to be a clinical problem or were not actively investigated.</p><p>To address this issue in the paper, we have summarized the reported incidence of respiratory problems in A88V and G45E patients, and have simply stated that there are no reports of any such problems in KID syndrome patients with other Cx26 mutations.</p><p>An interesting feature of the missense mutations that underlie KID syndrome is that they are dominant. The Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> subunit should therefore act in a dominant negative fashion to remove CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity from cells expressing wild type Cx26 hemichannels. We have now had an opportunity to test this idea, and now present this evidence in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We believe that this additional evidence strengthens the potential link between the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> and the pathologies evident in these patients.</p></body></sub-article></article>
