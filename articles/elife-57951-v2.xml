This process, known as cytokinesis, is a conserved mechanism that relies on the formation of a ring made of actin filaments and class II myosins (contractile actomyosin ring or ‘CAR’), which constricts and allows daughter cell separation by plasma membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerien and Wu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangione and Gould, 2019</xref>). Cytokinesis is a strictly fine-tuned biological process whose failure may lead to aneuploidy or multi-nucleate cells, resulting in cell death or tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sagona and Stenmark, 2010</xref>). The rod-shaped fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a popular model organism for the study of cytokinesis due to its small size, a relatively simple actin-based cytoskeletal network (actin patches, actin cables, and the CAR), and an easily tractable small genome with little gene redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rincon and Paoletti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2004</xref>). These features have allowed the identification of a large number of evolutionary conserved cytokinesis proteins and the precise spatiotemporal analysis of cytokinetic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> the development of a mature CAR takes place early after cytokinetic factors assemble into medial precursor nodes during the mitotic onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> starts to assemble the CAR in metaphase when chromosomes are not yet fully segregated, and unlike most animal and fungal cells including those of <italic>S. japonicus,</italic> another fission yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu and Oliferenko, 2015</xref>). Once the nuclear division is completed, the CAR constricts and drives plasma membrane closure, and the concomitant deposition of a cell wall septum whose degradation results in the physical separation of daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rincon and Paoletti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2004</xref>). The activity of the septation initiation network (SIN), a GTPase-protein kinase signaling cascade, secures the precise coordination between mitosis and cytokinesis, and prevents the later to occur before chromosomes have safely segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simanis, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The formin Cdc12 is essential for the nucleation and elongation of actin filaments from free actin monomers during CAR assembly in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kovar et al., 2003</xref>), and its activity is tightly regulated post-translationally through phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Willet et al., 2018</xref>). Later, and upon full activation, the SIN terminal efector kinase Sid2 phosphorylates Cdc12 to inhibit its multimerization and facilitate mature CAR assembly and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnert et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, Cdc12 phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1/Cdc2) during mitosis antagonizes Cdc12 localization at the CAR and delays its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Willet et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For3 is a non-essential diaphanous-like <italic>S. pombe</italic> formin that assembles actin cables for cellular transport and has established roles in polarized secretion and growth during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feierbach and Chang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Chang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of For3 cells maintain a polarized growth, but show altered morphology and present a defect in NETO (‘New End Take Off’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2005</xref>). For3 neither localizes to the cell poles nor binds to its cortical tethers when found in an autoinhibited (closed) state, which is mediated by an intramolecular interaction between the autoregulatory (DAD) and inhibitory (DID) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). The switch of For3 from an autoinhibited to an active (open) conformation and its localization is triggered by the active form of the essential Rho-GTPase Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Although not essential for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Chang, 2006</xref>), For3 also localizes to the division site, arriving shortly after SPB separation during CAR assembly and before the spindle begins to elongate during anaphase B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). The later stages of CAR constriction and disassembly are delayed in <italic>for3Δ</italic> cells as compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, For3-nucleated actin cables are critical for efficient delivery of secretory vesicles by myosin-V Myo52 to the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lo Presti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). While For3 function is only required during CAR constriction in wild-type cells, it becomes essential during ring assembly for node movement and cell survival in mutants with lower Cdc12 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that For3 cooperates with Cdc12 to nucleate actin filaments for CAR assembly and disassembly during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanism/s involved in such function has yet to be fully disclosed.</p><p>The conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 class, play a key role in higher eukaryotes to elicit adaptive responses to changes in the external and internal cellular environment that include the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for cell motility and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pullikuth and Catling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pullikuth and Catling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuenda, 1773</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanimura and Takeda, 2017</xref>). However, the cellular targets and multiple mechanisms employed by MAPKs to modulate actin organization are far from being clarified. The stress-activated protein kinase pathway (SAPK) and its central element, the MAPK Sty1 (a p38 ortholog), plays a critical role in <italic>S. pombe</italic> by controlling cell cycle progression and the general response to adverse situations including hyperosmotic stress, heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, or nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pérez and Cansado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gacto et al., 2003</xref>). The SAPK pathway is also activated when cells are treated with the sponge-derived macrolide Latrunculin A (LatA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutavchiev et al., 2016</xref>), which sequesters actin monomers to prevent F-actin cytoskeleton assembly and also accelerates actin filament depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>). Activated Sty1 causes the dispersal of active Cdc42 from the cell poles and the cessation of polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutavchiev et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we show that the SAPK pathway negatively controls CAR assembly in <italic>S. pombe</italic> by promoting a specific reduction in For3 levels in response to actin cytoskeleton damage induced with LatA. Remarkably, SAPK signaling instead contributes positively to CAR assembly during actin stress in <italic>S. japonicus.</italic> The opposite role played by the SAPK pathway during control of CAR integrity likely reflects the evolutionary adaptation of this signaling cascade to the marked differences in the execution of cytokinesis in both fission yeast species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SAPK pathway becomes activated and negatively regulates fission yeast growth in the presence of latrunculin A</title><p>LatA prevents F-actin cytoskeleton assembly in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morton et al., 2000</xref>).

Unexpectedly, mutant cells lacking Sty1 grew in these low LatA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The magnitude and dynamics of MAPK activation during LatA treatment were enhanced (~2 to 5X times) and accelerated, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The maximal ratio of Sty1 phosphorylation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is achieved in response to a saline osmotic stress, and results in a ~ 20X increase in activation units with respect to the basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prieto-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the lower activation threshold reached after LatA treatment may represent a relatively small fraction of Sty1 being phosphorylated (~10% to 25%). Sty1 activation induced with LatA was absent in cells expressing a LatA-resistant actin mutant allele (<italic>Act1-LQ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagiannis et al., 2005</xref>), confirming that MAPK activation is due to its specific deleterious effects on actin and/or actin-based networks. Cells expressing a mutant allele Mcs4(<italic>D512N</italic>) that does not activate the SAPK pathway upon stimulation with hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shieh et al., 1997</xref>), displayed Sty1 activation during LatA treatment, while this response was absent in a <italic>mcs4∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Hence, like other environmental cues, the signal induced by LatA treatment is transduced to the SAPK MAPK module via Mcs4 response regulator, and is independent on the function of the two-component system that functions explicitly in response to hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pérez and Cansado, 2010</xref>). <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells expressing the dually phosphorylated (wild type) MAPK at tyrosine and threonine, but not the monophosphorylated versions, were growth-sensitive to LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, as for other biological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vázquez et al., 2015</xref>), modulation of LatA growth by Sty1 requires a fully activated MAPK. Growth in plates with LatA of cells expressing a nuclear-excluded, constitutive plasma membrane-targeted version of Sty1 (Sty1-GFP-CAAX) was quite similar than in control cells (Sty1-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that Sty1-negative control of cell growth in the presence of LatA is mainly exerted in a transcription-independent fashion. Indeed, the transcription factor Atf1, which becomes phosphorylated by Sty1 during stress to induce the expression of the Core Environmental Stress Response genes (CESR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pérez and Cansado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shiozaki and Russell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilkinson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), became activated also in response to LatA, as shown by its mobility shift during western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but, opposite to <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells, <italic>atf1∆</italic> cells showed lower tolerance to LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Although high concentrations of LatA (&gt;10 µM) induce dispersal from the cell poles of the activated Rho GTPase Cdc42 in a SAPK-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutavchiev et al., 2016</xref>), low drug concentrations (0.2 µM) did not elicit such response, as determined by monitoring the subcellular localization of a GFP–tagged Cdc42/Rac interactive-binding peptide probe (CRIB-3xGFP) that specifically detects the activated state of the GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tatebe et al., 2008</xref>).

In exponentially growing wild-type cells, a genomic For3-3GFP fusion migrates in SDS-PAGE as three bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Lambda phosphatase treatment of cell extracts with or without specific phosphatase inhibitor revealed that the two bands with lower mobilities are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We did not observe a significant decrease of For3-3GFP levels at early incubation times (0–60 min) in wild-type cells treated with low LatA concentrations (0.150–0.200 µM), even though a high percentage of cells (~80%) showed damaged CAR under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

By performing ubiquitin pull-down assays ubiquitinated For3-3GFP species were recovered from wild-type cells during unperturbed growth at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Considering that the decrease in total For3 levels at high temperature is Sty1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), these findings suggest that a SAPK-mediated mechanism enhances For3 in vivo ubiquitination and degradation in response to stress.</p><p>The actin-binding proteins profilin (Cdc3) and tropomyosin (Cdc8) localize to the contractile ring and play essential roles in the formation, stabilization, and maintenance of actin filaments for the CAR during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanian et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian et al., 1994</xref>).

However, as opposed to this shared vision, we show in this work that fission yeast activation of the SAPK Sty1, a p38 MAPK ortholog, negatively regulates CAR assembly and integrity in response to actin polymerization inhibition induced with LatA. We found that Sty1 becomes activated by low concentrations of this drug that specifically depolymerize actin cables and the CAR in wild-type cells. Strikingly, mutants lacking Sty1 or upstream activators of the SAPK pathway were more resistant to LatA than wild-type cells, and Sty1-hyperactive <italic>wis1DD</italic> cells failed to condense functional rings in the presence of LatA concentrations that were permissive for CAR assembly in wild-type cells.</p><p>Of the two <italic>S. pombe</italic> formins that function in the vegetative cycle, Cdc12 seemed a suitable candidate target for SAPK control of CAR integrity considering its essential role in the nucleation of actin filaments for ring assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kovar et al., 2003</xref>). However, several evidences, which include comparative analysis of Cdc12 levels and phosphorylation status with LatA, plus growth assays of kinase-specific phospho-mutants with lack or gain of function in Sty1 signaling, suggested that the SAPK pathway does not target this formin. The other <italic>S. pombe</italic> vegetative formin, For3, is required for the assembly of actin cables that participate in polarized secretion and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feierbach and Chang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Chang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, For3 function becomes essential in genetic backgrounds with severely impaired Cdc12 activity, suggesting that it cooperates with Cdc12 to nucleate actin filaments for CAR assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>). We found that SAPK (Sty1) negative control of CAR integrity in response to stress is mainly exerted through For3, since deletion of this formin completely suppressed the enhanced CAR assembly and growth of <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells with LatA. In vitro studies have shown that, as compared to Cdc12, For3 is a very poor nucleator of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2011</xref>), which suggests that sequestering of actin monomers induced by LatA might impair For3 nucleation activity more severely. Moreover, For3 inhibits actin assembly at low concentrations, while stimulating filaments assembly only at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, from a biological perspective, precise control of For3 levels by the SAPK pathway might represent a suitable regulatory mechanism to fine tune its actin nucleation ability depending on the environmental conditions.</p><p>SAPK signaling elicits essential adaptive responses to ensure cell survival in response to environmental cues, like changes in osmolarity, redox status, temperature, or nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pérez and Cansado, 2010</xref>). Studies mostly performed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have shown that in response to the above stimuli, the actin cytoskeleton is targeted by signaling pathways including PKA, TOR and MAPKs, and that cellular adaptation to environmental changes often leads to its disassembly and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smethurst et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in <italic>S. pombe</italic> SAPK-mediated downregulation of CAR integrity might become biologically relevant when considered as part of a multifaceted adaptive response to environmental stress. This is sustained by our finding that reduction of For3 levels in response to stress is Sty1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). In this context, recent work has shown that the presence of 0.6 M KCl does not prevent de novo formation of Myosin-II (Myo2) rings in <italic>S. pombe</italic> wild-type cells, but decreases the rate of constriction of the newly formed rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2019</xref>).

Thus, SAPK-mediated downregulation of For3 levels might be an underlying factor involved in such outcome.</p><p>How does the SAPK pathway targets For3 to negatively modulate CAR integrity? This control may not be related with changes in Cdc42 activity, since low LatA concentrations (0.2 µM), which prompt Sty1 activation and inhibit CAR assembly and growth in wild-type cells, did not elicited the dispersal of active Cdc42 from the cell poles observed with higher doses of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutavchiev et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, our results suggest that specific reduction of the formin protein levels is involved, thus representing an additional regulatory layer that limits cell growth and division in response to environmental stress. For3 levels doubled in <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells, and in those expressing Sty1-T97A in the presence of a specific kinase inhibitor. Conversely, constitutive Sty1 hyperactivation (<italic>wis1DD</italic> or <italic>pyp1∆</italic> cells) lowered the levels of For3. Increased LatA concentrations also prompted a graded decrease of For3 levels in wild-type cells, but not in <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells. Moreover, actin cable and CAR perturbation induced by temperature-sensitive alleles of profilin and tropomyosin, without LatA treatment, were accompanied by downregulation of For3 levels that once more was not observed in the absence of Sty1, thus reinforcing the biological relevance of the SAPK pathway as a negative regulator of this formin in response to CAR damage. Sty1-negative regulation of For3 does not occur at the transcriptional level. On the contrary, Sty1 and its downstream target transcription factor Atf1 may elicit <italic>for3+</italic> transcription, since its basal mRNA levels are lower both in <italic>sty1∆</italic> and <italic>atf1∆</italic> cells as compared to wild-type cells, and become induced in response LatA. Enhanced expression of the <italic>for3+</italic> gene by Sty1-Atf1 may thus function as a positive feedback mechanism to compensate for the drop in formin levels that follows Sty1 activation.</p><p>Ubiquitin pull-down assays performed in wild type and proteasome mutant cells suggest that Sty1 might enhance For3 degradation in response to stress through ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, cycloheximide-chase experiments show that For3 has a long half-life (&gt;20 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), which is very similar to a value reported in a previous study (t1/2 = 21.3 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Sty1 deletion did not alter For3 half-life as compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Then, how the levels of a ‘long-lived’ protein like For3 become quickly reduced during stress? The switch of For3 from an autoinhibited (closed) to an active (open) conformation depends on the relieving of the intramolecular interaction between its functional DAD and DID domains, and is essential for its stabilization and localization at the CAR and the cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that during vegetative growth, most For3 is active (open) and highly stable, while in response to stress SAPK activation might trigger its rapid ubiquitination and degradation. The mechanism/s responsible for this modification might include the switch of the formin to a closed and unstable conformation, and/or the activation of specific ubiquitin ligase/s either at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. For3 is heavily phosphorylated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>), but its phosphorylation status did not change along the cell cycle. The kinase/s responsible for such modification/s is/are currently unknown, but the possibility that Sty1 phosphorylates For3 seems unlikely, since it was not phosphorylated by Sty1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>), and its phosphorylation pattern remained unaffected in vivo independently of the kinase activation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further work will be necessary to depict the precise mechanism/s by which the SAPK pathway negatively modulates For3 levels.</p><p>In mammalian cells, formin (mDIA)-induced nuclear actin polymerization promotes activation of the serum response factor (SRF), a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>). SRF elicits transcriptional activation of multiple genes involved in actin cytoskeleton homeostasis by the myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), whose nuclear accumulation is positively regulated upon release from G-actin binding during filamentous actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miano et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to the SAPK-For3 branch described here, a putative stress-mediated inhibition of mDIA availability and/or function could play a role to inhibit SRF transcriptional activity by favoring binding of MRTFs to G-actin. It would also be interesting to analyze if the increase in the levels of monomeric G-actin resulting from For3 inhibition by SAPK during environmental stress downregulates the transcriptional activity of SRF orthologs (Mbx1, Map1) in fission yeast.</p><p>Our preliminary data suggest that the activation of the SAPK pathway fosters CAR assembly in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> during cytoskeletal damage with LatA. The reason for the opposite effect of SAPK signaling on CAR assembly in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> might be related to the marked differences in the timely coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis in both fission yeast species. In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> cortical actin nucleation closely follows myosin recruitment to the medial nodes at the onset of mitosis, whereas in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> actin filaments appear at the cortex late during exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu and Oliferenko, 2015</xref>). SAPK-mediated downregulation of CAR integrity through For3 may represent in <italic>S. pombe</italic> an alternative mechanism to prompt cytokinesis delay until precise chromosome segregation has been secured. Nonetheless, the opposite effect of SAPK pathway activation on CAR assembly and integrity within the fission yeast clade likely illustrates how a strongly conserved signaling cascade may adopt different strategies to cope with the distinctive cell cycle and division characteristics in evolutionarily related species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Phospho-p38 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">Cat# 9211, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331641">AB_331641</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 11 583 816 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514505">AB_514505</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 11 814 460 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390913">AB_390913</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody (rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 12 013 819 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390917">AB_390917</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cdk1/Cdc2 (PSTAIR)(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 06–923;

Time-lapse images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 63X/1.40 Plan Apo objective and controlled by the LAS X software. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> the time for node condensation and ring maturation includes the time from SPB separation until the start of CR constriction. The time for ring constriction and disassembly includes the time from the first frame of ring constriction until the last frame where it becomes completely constricted and disassembled. The extent of ring damage during LatA treatment was determined in time-lapse experiments by quantifying the percentage of cells in which CAR condensation from cytokinetic nodes is strongly compromised or blocked. In asynchronous culture experiments, CAR damage was expressed as the percentage of total cells with rings showing morphologically altered, and/or aberrantly condensed rings.</p><p>Graphs and statistical analysis were done using Graphpad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Unless otherwise stated, graphs represent the mean, and error bars represent SD. <italic>n</italic> is the total number of cells scored from at least three independent experiments.

interesting manuscript from Cansado and colleagues on the negative regulation of actomyosin ring integrity upon actin stress. The message is that upon actin stress, formin-for3 levels drop in a ubiquitination and stress activated protein kinase dependent pathway, which leads to a cytokinesis delay and growth advantage following actin stress removal. The work has potential to open up new lines of regulation of formin and actin cytoskeleton by stress-activated signalling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stress-activated MAPK signalling controls fission yeast actomyosin ring integrity by modulating formin For3 levels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas D Pollard (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>The reviewers and the editor found the work and the new insights into the regulation of formin for3 stability and cytokinesis by the Stress Activated MAPK pathway upon LatA stress very interesting. A large number of issues have been raised, which are being relayed to you verbatim, so that you may be able to investigate them for subsequent work (due to the COVID19 policy).</p><p>Essential revisions for this paper:</p><p>We see three experiments as essential before publication.</p><p>1) Mechanisms: The big question is why cells treated with LatA reduce the level of For3 protein in 2 hours in spite of a parallel increase in For3 mRNA levels? The mechanisms are not addressed. The authors should consider a pulse-chase experiment to measure the turnover of For3 protein. The Discussion suggests that &quot;Sty1-Atf1 branch or Sty1 alone might favor For3 degradation via ubiquitination&quot; but the gels do not show higher molecular weight bands.</p><p>2) The over-reliance on using low doses of LatA as the sole source of actin-cable stress is of significant concern. Perhaps the authors can investigate the effects of other mutants that affect actin cable integrity (<italic>cdc8</italic> tropomyosin, <italic>cdc3</italic> profilin etc) on for3 levels as well as estimate for3 levels in <italic>cdc8sty1Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc3sty1Δ</italic> mutants. This will be a nice addition to the paper.</p><p>3) The resistance of <italic>sty1</italic> mutants to low doses of LatA raises a simple possibility that LatA does not enter the s<italic>ty1Δ</italic> cell as readily as in WT cells. This could, for instance, be due to potential differences in the cell wall. If true, it would be a major caveat. One suggested test may be to assay dose dependent responses of LatA on actin patches, for instance.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) A number of quantitation experiments have been done with asynchronously growing cells (Figures 2B, 3E for example, and there are more). Some are backed up by time-lapse imaging with SPB markers, and others not. This needs to be looked at carefully throughout the work to make sure the phenotypes are neither a overestimate or underestimate.</p><p>2) It is not clear how the authors explain the fact that the drop in <italic>for3</italic> levels happens very slowly, whereas the phenotypic defects happen in minute timescales. It will be informative to hold the cell cycle using a <italic>cdc25-22</italic> or <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> and investigate the reduction and increase of <italic>for3</italic> levels upon LatA treatment. It is important to know whether the cytokinesis phenotype is a comorbidity or the main effect of LatA induced reduction in <italic>for3</italic> levels.</p><p>3) This work would gain in significance if it explored more about the mechanism of how Sty1 pathway affects For3 proteins levels. Could it be regulating translation or stability of the protein? For instance, the authors could test whether Sty1 affects For3 stability using a cycloheximide experiment and/or measure For3 translation.</p><p>4) For3 is best known for its role in actin cable assembly. Given that Sty1 affects For3 levels even in interphase cells, the authors should investigate how stress and Sty1 affect actin cables as well. The images of actin shown in Figure 2 suggest that actin cables in <italic>sty1Δ</italic> cells look brighter; effects on actin cables could be quantitated. Do other stresses and the Sty1 pathway impact actin cable assembly, and could this also be suppressed by formin activation or overexpression. Is there a reason why stress pathway should inhibit actin cables?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57951.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions for this paper:</p><p>We see three experiments as essential before publication.</p><p>1) Mechanisms: The big question is why cells treated with LatA reduce the level of For3 protein in 2 hours in spite of a parallel increase in For3 mRNA levels?

As can be seen in the Figure 5—figure supplement 5 in the revised manuscript, cyclohexymide treatment doubled For3 levels in wild type cells during the first 12 h of incubation, which started to decrease gradually at longer incubation times. The estimated half-life of For3 was long (&gt;20 hours), which fairly agrees with that obtained from a global analysis of proteome turnover in fission yeast that categorized For3 as a stable “class III” protein (t<sub>1/2</sub>&gt;8h; For3 t<sub>1/2</sub> =21.3h) (Christiano et al., 2014). However, Sty1 deletion did not have an evident effect on For3 half-life, which was quite similar to that of wild type cells:</p><p>Next, we analyzed the possibility that For3 becomes ubiquitinated in vivo. To this end we performed ubiquitin pull-down assays with the pREP-Ubi-His plasmid in wild type cells and the temperature-sensitive mutant of the proteasome subunit Mts3/Rpn12 (<italic>mts3-1</italic> cells), expressing a genomic For3-3GFP fusion. As it can be seen in the panel A in Figure 5—figure supplement 4 in the revised manuscript, ubiquitinated For3 species were specifically recovered from wild type cells during unperturbed growth (28ºC).</p><p>Importantly, as compared to wild type cells, the For3 ubiquitination ratio increased significantly in <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells incubated at the restrictive temperature of 36ºC (panel B). New text and the corresponding supplementary figures describing these findings have been included in the Results section of the revised manuscript to read as follows:</p><p>“mDia2 formin, a key nucleator of actin filaments during cell migration in mammalian cells, is degraded at the end of mitosis through ubiquitination, and this modification is essential for the completion of cell division [DeWard and Alberts, 2009]. […] Considering that the decrease in total For3 levels at high temperature is Sty1-dependent (Figure 5—figure supplement 3), these findings suggest that a SAPK-mediated mechanism enhances For3 in vivo ubiquitination and degradation in response to stress.”</p><p>Previous work (Martin et al., 2007), showed that the switch of For3 from an autoinhibited (closed) to an active (open) conformation, which depends on the relieving of the intramolecular interaction between its functional DAD and DID domains, is essential for For3 stabilization and localization at the CAR and cell poles. Based on this precedents and our novel findings, we propose that during vegetative growth For3 is mainly active (open) and stable (long half-life), while SAPK activation may trigger its rapid ubiquitination and degradation (short half-life). Several mechanisms, including hampering of For3 activation or the activation of the ubiquitination machinery, might be involved in the Sty1-induced formin destabilization. This reasoning has been included in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Ubiquitin pull-down assays performed in wild type and proteasome mutant cells suggest that Sty1 might enhance For3 degradation in response to stress through ubiquitination (Figure 5—figure supplement 4). […] The mechanism/s responsible for this modification might include the switch of the formin to a closed and unstable conformation, and/or the activation of specific ubiquitin ligase/s either at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.”</p><p>Although the specific mechanism responsible for the Sty1-dependent decrease in For3 levels is not depicted, we honestly believe that the establishment of a putative link between the SAPK pathway and For3 ubiquitination status improves the quality of the results in the current work, and opens new lines of research for a full understanding of the nature of this complex functional interplay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The over-reliance on using low doses of LatA as the sole source of actin-cable stress is of significant concern. Perhaps the authors can investigate the effects of other mutants that affect actin cable integrity (cdc8 tropomyosin, cdc3 profilin etc) on for3 levels as well as estimate for3 levels in cdc8 sty1Δ and cdc3 sty1Δ mutants. This will be a nice addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the recommendation of the editor and reviewers, we have investigated the biological effects on For3 levels of hypomorphic mutations in profilin (<italic>cdc3-124</italic>) and tropomyosin (<italic>cdc8-110</italic>), which play a positive role in maintenance of actin filaments for the CAR during cytokinesis.</p><p>As compared to wild type cells, For3 levels were reduced in <italic>cdc3-124</italic> and <italic>cdc8-110</italic> mutants incubated at the restrictive temperature (Figure 6B). Moreover, Sty1 deletion partially suppressed the thermosensitivity of <italic>cdc3-124</italic> cells while enhancing For3 levels in both mutants. These findings reveal the general significance of the SAPK-For3 branch during control of actin cables and CAR integrity in response to stress (Figure 6A and B). In addition, text and references have been included in the Results section to read:</p><p>“The actin-binding proteins profilin (Cdc3) and tropomyosin (Cdc8) localize to the contractile ring and play essential roles in the formation, stabilization, and maintenance of actin filaments for the CAR during cytokinesis [Balasubramanian, Helfman and Hemmingsen, 1992; Balasubramanian et al., 1994]. a[…] Hence, a reduction in profilin or tropomyosin function decreases For3 levels in a Sty1-dependent fashion (i.e. in the absence of LatA treatment), further revealing the general significance of the SAPK-For3 branch during the control of actin cables and CAR integrity in response to stress.”</p><p>The modified Discussion section also reads:</p><p>“Moreover, actin cable and CAR perturbation induced by temperature-sensitive alleles of profilin and tropomyosin, without LatA treatment, were accompanied by downregulation of For3 levels that once more was not observed in the absence of Sty1, thus reinforcing the biological relevance of the SAPK pathway as a negative regulator of this formin in response to CAR damage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The resistance of sty1 mutants to low doses of LatA raises a simple possibility that LatA does not enter the sty1Δ cell as readily as in WT cells. This could, for instance, be due to potential differences in the cell wall. If true, it would be a major caveat. One suggested test may be to assay dose dependent responses of LatA on actin patches, for instance.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells have not been described in the databases and literature (https://www.pombase.org/gene/SPAC24B11.06c), or isolated in genome-wide screens as showing altered cell wall composition and/or integrity (see, for instance Zhou et al. (2013). PLoS ONE 8(5):e65904). Most important, our finding that increased LatA resistance in <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells is suppressed by deletion of a formin (For3), whose assigned biological role is essentially limited to actin cable formation for growth polarity and cytokinesis, and does not have a noticeable role in cell wall integrity, further reinforces this view.</p><p>Nevertheless, following the editor and reviewer´s recommendations, we have analyzed the integrity of F-actin patches in wild type versus <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells in the presence of 20 µM LatA. As can now be seen as novel Figure 2—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript, the dynamics of disappearance of actin patches with LatA was very similar in wild type vs. <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells, suggesting that LatA-resistance in this mutant is not related to differences in drug entry induced by MAPK deletion.</p><p>We have changed the text describing this experiment in the Results section of the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“The time taken for complete depolymerization of F-actin patches with high concentrations of LatA (20µM) was very similar in wild type and <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), suggesting that LatA-resistance in this mutant is not related to differences in drug entry induced by MAPK deletion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) A number of quantitation experiments have been done with asynchronously growing cells (Figures 2B, 3E for example, and there are more). Some are backed up by time-lapse imaging with SPB markers, and others not. This needs to be looked at carefully throughout the work to make sure the phenotypes are neither a overestimate or underestimate.</p></disp-quote><p>During time-lapse experiments the extent of ring damage during LatA treatment was determined by quantifying the percentage of cells where condensation of cytokinetic nodes after SPB separation is partially or totally blocked, because we observed that ring constriction proceeds normally, even with LatA present, in cells were a mature CAR is already formed. In asynchronous culture experiments ring damage was scored from multiple micrographs taken at different time points after LatA treatment, and is expressed as the percentage of cells with rings showing morphologically altered, and/or aberrantly condensed rings. These criteria have been strictly followed in all the experiments throughout the work. This information, together with a detailed description of the observed phenotypes is included in the revised manuscript in the “Microscopy analysis” section in Materials and methods:</p><p>“The extent of ring damage during LatA treatment was determined in time-lapse experiments by quantifying the percentage of cells in which CAR condensation from cytokinetic nodes is strongly compromised or blocked. In asynchronous culture experiments CAR damage was expressed as the percentage of total cells with rings showing morphologically altered, and/or aberrantly condensed rings. “</p><p>We believe that a sum of factors, including variations in strains genotypes, the possible soaking up of LatA by the Ibidi chambers, and the mode of scoring CAR damage, might be behind the differences in the quantification of LatA-induced CAR damage in asynchronous vs. time-lapse experiments. We measured the CAR damage in wild type cells treated with 0.2 µM LatA by using either polymer- (employed through this work) or glass-made ibidi chambers, but did not find significant differences in the percentage of damaged rings. However, the possibility that the soybean lectin used to coat the chambers is responsible for soaking up some of the added LatA cannot be ruled out. Moreover, since the CAR status is estimated in asynchronous cultures from micrographs taken at specific time points, it is possible that in some cells the seemingly damaged CARs might still be able to assemble and constrict. The possible explanations have been included in the Results section of the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“The higher percentages of cells with damaged CAR found during LatA treatment in asynchronous cultures as compared to the time-lapse experiments may be due to a combination of factors, including genotypic differences among strains, soaking up of small LatA concentrations by the chambers during time-lapse observations, and the different scoring method, since in asynchronous cultures cells with seemingly damaged CARs might still be able to assemble and constrict.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear how the authors explain the fact that the drop in for3 levels happens very slowly, whereas the phenotypic defects happen in minute timescales. It will be informative to hold the cell cycle using a cdc25-22 or nda3-KM311 and investigate the reduction and increase of for3 levels upon LatA treatment. It is important to know whether the cytokinesis phenotype is a comorbidity or the main effect of LatA induced reduction in for3 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly explored the effect of low LatA concentrations (0.2 µM) on For3 levels in wild type cells within a shorter time-scale (up to 1 hour of incubation). In these conditions, only in two out of eight biological replicates we observed a reduction in For3 levels after 40-60 min of treatment (not shown). However, when the LatA concentration was raised to 1 µM, the reduction in For3 levels became statistically significant after 60 min of treatment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>S. pombe</italic> wild type cells expressing genomic For3-3GFP fusion were grown in YES medium to mid-log phase, and treated with 1μM LatA for the indicated times.</title><p>Total For3 levels were detected with anti-GFP antibody, Anti-Cdc2 was used as a loading control.

(2014) Open Biology 4(7):140063. doi: 10.1098/rsob.140063). Cells from exponentially growing cultures were treated with 1 µM 3-MB-PP1 for 3 h to hold the cycle at G2, and For3 levels were followed at different times after ATP-analog washout in the presence of 0.2 µM LatA that was added 10 min after release from the G2 arrest, when cells are quickly entering into mitosis (~20% binucleated cells) and the CAR is already assembling. As can be seen in the Figure 5G, in these conditions we observed a significant drop in For3 levels as soon as 30 min after treatment, that fairly agree with the high percentage of cells (~80%) that show damaged CAR under these conditions (Figure 2G in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Considering the above results as a whole, we believe that the possible decline in For3 protein levels at early times in asynchronic cultures treated with low LatA concentrations lies at the limit of detection of the Western blot assay. Moreover, while this method detects total For3 levels, it does not give information about the specific pools of the formin, which may undergo subtle reductions at defined sub-cellular locations (i.e. in CAR vs. cell poles). The quick decrease in For3 levels observed in synchronized cells at the anaphase onset with the CAR already assembling is in agreement with this prediction. These observations reinforce the notion that reduction of For3 levels is a main factor responsible for the CAR integrity defects observed in the presence of LatA.</p><p>We have included new panel G within the Figure 5 of the revised manuscript, together with the following text:</p><p>“We did not observe a significant decrease of For3-3GFP levels at early incubation times (0-60 min) in wild type cells treated with low LatA concentrations (0.150-0.200 µM), even though a high percentage of cells (~80%) showed damaged CAR under these conditions (Figure 2G). […] This observation suggests that reduction of For3 levels is an essential factor responsible for the CAR integrity defects in the presence of LatA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This work would gain in significance if it explored more about the mechanism of how Sty1 pathway affects For3 proteins levels. Could it be regulating translation or stability of the protein? For instance, the authors could test whether Sty1 affects For3 stability using a cycloheximide experiment and/or measure For3 translation.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to Essential revisions for this paper point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For3 is best known for its role in actin cable assembly. Given that Sty1 affects For3 levels even in interphase cells, the authors should investigate how stress and Sty1 affect actin cables as well. Do other stresses and the Sty1 pathway impact actin cable assembly, and could this also be suppressed by formin activation or overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the putative negative effect of SAPK signalling on cable assembly and/or integrity in fission yeast will surely deserve further insight considering the main role of For3 as a nucleator of actin cables. To this end we have comparatively examined and quantified the percentage of cells with remaining actin cables in wild type versus <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells during unperturbed growth and after treatment with several known stimuli which strongly activate Sty1, including osmotic saline, heat and oxidative stresses. Notably, all of the above stressors prompted a clear reduction in the percentage of cells with remaining cables in wild type cells but not in <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells, suggesting that Sty1-dependent downregulation of actin cable integrity is a general feature in response to environmental changes:</p><p>These experiments have been included as a new Figure 2—figure supplement 4 in the revised manuscript, and the corresponding modified text in the Results section now reads as follows:</p><p>“Moreover, the percentage of cells with remaining cables became reduced in wild type cells in response to environmental stimuli that activate Sty1, like osmotic saline stress (0.6 M KCl), heat shock (40ºC), or oxidative stress (1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) [Perez and Cansado, 2010], but not in <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). This suggests that Sty1 activity downregulates actin cable integrity in response to environmental stimuli and actin perturbations induced with LatA. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The images of actin shown in Figure 2 suggest that actin cables in sty1D cells look brighter; effects on actin cables could be quantitated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored this possibility by measuring the maximal fluorescence of individual cables (n=100) obtained from maximum projection images of exponentially growing wild type and <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells expressing LifeAct-GFP.

This is sustained by previous observations showing that actin cables are required for the transport of Scd1 (Kelly and Nurse (2011). Mol. Biol. Cell. 22(20):3801-11), which is the main GEF that locally activates Cdc42 GTPase for polarized growth (Tay et al. (2018). J. Cell Sci. 131(14):jcs216580). However, we currently lack experimental evidence to support this hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
