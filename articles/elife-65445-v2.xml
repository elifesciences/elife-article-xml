Morphological and physiological studies have highlighted functional heterogeneity, yet no molecular markers have been described that delineate PN subtypes. Here, we used viral injections into olfactory cortex and fluorescent nucleus sorting to enrich PNs for high-throughput single nucleus and bulk RNA deep sequencing. Transcriptome analysis and RNA in situ hybridization identified distinct mitral and tufted cell populations with characteristic transcription factor network topology, cell adhesion, and excitability-related gene expression. Finally, we describe a new computational approach for integrating bulk and snRNA-seq data and provide evidence that different mitral cell populations preferentially project to different target regions. Together, we have identified potential molecular and gene regulatory mechanisms underlying PN diversity and provide new molecular entry points into studying the diverse functional roles of mitral and tufted cell subtypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd><kwd>projection neuron</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>transcription factor network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AC 304/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ackels</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DC017437-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U19NS112953-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD025181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110174/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different subtypes of projection neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb are defined by distinct gene expression patterns and transcription factor networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian olfactory system is unique among sensory systems in that it bypasses the thalamus: olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the nose project to the olfactory bulb (OB), a forebrain structure containing – in the mouse – approximately 500,000 neurons per hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parrish-Aungst et al., 2007</xref>). There, they synapse onto various interneurons and projection neurons. The latter directly project to a variety of cortical structures, including the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and the lateral entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haberly and Price, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). This places OB projection neurons at a pivotal position to distribute processed olfactory information broadly across the brain.</p><p>Each ORN in the mouse expresses only one of approximately 1000 olfactory receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yoshihito, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang and Firestein, 2002</xref>). ORNs expressing the same receptor project axons onto defined spherical structures, glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mori and Sakano, 2011</xref>), containing a variety of neuropil including the apical dendrites of 10–50 projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwarz et al., 2018</xref>). Historically, OB projection neurons have been divided into mitral and tufted cells (MCs, TCs), largely based on their soma location and dendritic and axonal projection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haberly and Price, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imamura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mori et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Orona et al., 1984</xref>): MC somata are located predominantly in a thin layer with their dendrites covering the deeper part of the OB external plexiform layer. Their axons project to a wide range of structures including posterior piriform cortex. TC axons, on the other hand, are restricted to more anterior forebrain structures and their cell bodies are distributed across the external plexiform layer, with dendrites largely restricted to superficial layers. Within the TC population, subdivisions have been made into deep, middle, superficial, and external TCs, largely based on soma position. MCs on the other hand are often morphologically described as a largely homogeneous population. However, branching patterns of lateral dendrites as well as soma size and apical dendrite length might allow for further subdivision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mouradian and Scott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Orona et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwarz et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, projection patterns might differ based on soma position along the dorsomedial–ventrolateral axis of the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inokuchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In parallel to this morphological diversity, numerous studies have described physiological heterogeneity both as a result of differential inputs from granule cells onto TCs and MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ezeh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geramita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>) as well as intrinsic excitability and glomerular wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gire et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, TCs respond more readily, with higher peak firing rates, and to lower odor concentration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kikuta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nagayama et al., 2014</xref>), and earlier in the respiration cycle compared to MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Within the TC and MC populations, biophysical heterogeneity has been more difficult to tie to specific cell types or subtypes. MCs show diversity in biophysical properties that is thought to aid efficient encoding of stimulus-specific information and is, at least in part, experience dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tripathy et al., 2013</xref>). Both in vivo and in vitro recordings suggest that a subset of MCs show regular firing, while others show ‘stuttering’ behavior characterized by irregular action potential clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buonviso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey and Wachowiak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desmaisons et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadool et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedman and Strowbridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>). While TCs are heterogeneous, with, for example, external TCs displaying prominent rhythmic bursting, driving the glomerular circuitry into long-lasting depolarizations in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Saint Jan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gire and Schoppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Najac et al., 2011</xref>), a systematic assessment of biophysical variety is lacking so far. Moreover, differential centrifugal input from cortical and subcortical structures might further amplify this overall heterogeneity both between MCs and TCs as well as potentially within those different classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kapoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Niedworok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Otazu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Thus, anatomical projection patterns, in vivo odor responses, and intrinsic properties are known to show substantial variability across different projection neurons. Systematic investigation of different projection neurons, however, has been hampered by a scarcity of specific molecular tools. Interneuron diversity, on the other hand, in general has received considerable attention with numerous studies including in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parrish-Aungst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tavakoli et al., 2018</xref>), aiming to provide a systematic assessment of morphology, physiology, chemotype and the basis for genetic targeting of distinct types of interneurons. For OB projection neurons, however, only little information about chemotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiyokage et al., 2010</xref>) is available at this point: <italic>Cdhr1 and Tbx21</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haddad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nagai et al., 2005</xref> have been shown to be selectively expressed in a subset of OB projection neurons. CCK distinguishes a subset of TCs (superficial TCs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu and Shipley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seroogy et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Short and Wachowiak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sun et al., 2020</xref>]). Vasopressin-expressing cells might constitute a further subset of superficial TCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lukas et al., 2019</xref>), and recently, the <italic>Lbhd2</italic> gene has been used to obtain more specific genetic access to MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koldaeva et al., 2021</xref>). Heterogeneous expression of both the GABAa receptor and voltage-gated potassium channel subunits have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Panzanelli et al., 2005</xref>), albeit not linked to specific cell types. Expression of axon guidance molecules such as <italic>Nrp2</italic> might further allow subdivision of projection neurons across the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inokuchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Hence, while some molecular markers can be used to define specific subsets of projection neurons, this description is far from complete. A comprehensive molecular definition of projection neuron types would help to classify and collate existing biophysical, morphological, and physiological data and delineate the distinct output streams of the OB. Moreover, it would provide a platform upon which further focused experimental approaches could be tied.</p><p>Single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing has been used effectively to map out cell types across a variety of brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>), including inhibitory interneurons in the mouse OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tepe et al., 2018</xref>). As M/TCs constitute only ~10% of all OB neurons, we decided to enrich for projection neurons for single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq. We then combined snRNA-seq with bulk RNA deep seq as well as additional snRNA-seq for OB neurons projecting to different cortical areas, thereby allowing us to disentangle different projection neuron classes by target area. We found that indeed both MCs and TCs fall into several, separable types, defined by expression of both common and overlapping gene regulatory networks. This work will therefore provide a molecular entry point into disentangling the diversity of OB projection neurons and defining the functional roles of different MC/TC types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb projection neurons distinguishes mitral and tufted cell types</title><p>To characterize the molecular diversity of OB projection neurons, we used viral targeting and fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) to enrich for OB projection neurons and characterized their transcriptomes using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive molecular profiling of olfactory bulb projection neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of experimental design.

We therefore set out to characterize cell types by their TF activity. To do so, we predicted regulatory relationships between TFs and target genes (that can be also TFs), taking into account independent genomic information about TF binding sites around the target gene-specific promoter. These gene regulatory networks are more robust against technical artifacts than the expression of individual genes, providing a complementary set of axes along which to cluster MCs and TCs. Ultimately, gene regulatory network analysis can yield more detail for classifying cell types and for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie their transcriptional differences.</p><p>To infer the regulatory networks of each type of projection neuron, we used the Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering pipeline (SCENIC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van de Sande et al., 2020</xref>).

This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the data from &gt;30,000 genes to 86 regulons, defining a new low-dimensional space in which to analyze relationships between nuclei. Using the regulon activity matrix, we computed a UMAP space and performed a Louvain clustering on the putative projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Traag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>).

Indeed, several clusters in transcriptome space are clearly identifiable as clusters in GRN-space, and vice versa (e.g. ET2, ET4, M1+M3). However, we also noted significant differences between other clusters (ET1, T1, and M2). This disagreement suggests that network analysis provides orthogonal information relative to transcriptome analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Combinations of regulon modules characterize mitral and tufted cell subtypes</title><p>TFs activity is thought to be organized into coordinated network modules that determine cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Irons and Monk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suo et al., 2018</xref>). To characterize how TFs are organized into such modules in OB projection neurons, we searched for combinatorial patterns of regulon activity. We used the Connection Specificity Index (CSI) to this end, which is an association index known to be suited for the detection of modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuxman Bass et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suo et al., 2018</xref>). By computing the CSI on the basis of pairwise comparisons of regulon activity patterns across cells, we found that the 86 regulons grouped into seven modules (mod1–7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, regulon and module activity were not uniform within cell types. Rather, regulon activity suggested the existence of distinct subtypes within mitral and tufted cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We used hierarchical clustering to further subdivide cell types, finding four subtypes of M1, three subtypes each of M2, T1, and ET2, and two subtypes of ET1 and ET4. To further investigate these subtypes, we used the modules to describe how the combined regulatory logic of distinct TFs contributes to the diversity of MC and TC subtypes. We asked if combinations of modules could uniquely describe the subtypes. To do so, we calculated the average module activity score per cell subtype. Next, we performed a hierarchical clustering on the subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that, when grouped by module activity, subtypes do not strictly group by type; rather, subtypes of different cell types tend to share similar module activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is a consequence of the differences between transcriptome- and GRN-based analysis: transcriptome clusters (cell types) are subdivided along the boundaries of GRN-based clusters. As we observed the grouping of subtypes along three neighboring clusters – ET1, T1, and M2 – we set out to better understand how module activity changes along these cell types. To this end, we used PAGA (PArtition-based Graph Abstraction) for trajectory analysis along the sequence of ET4, ET1, T1, M2, M3, M1, ET2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, and for the corresponding UMAPs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We observed clear module activity gradients between ET4-ET1-T1, where modules 1, 3, 4, and 7 are high at the ET4 end of the cluster and low at T1. Module two forms an antagonistic gradient across ET1, high at T1 and low at ET4. Similarly, activity of module five changes in a gradient fashion from T1 to M2. Importantly, trajectory analysis not only detects gradients, but also discrete changes between cell types. For instance, the activity of module six shows a step-wise dynamic: high activity at ET2, medium at M1, and low for the other cell types. And module two has no activity in M3, while it is clearly present in its neighboring cell types M1 and M2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Regulon-based transcription factor networks reveal overlapping features of cell type identity</title><p>While TFs regulate a large number of target genes, central to cell identity are the interactions between them: TFs can regulate their own expression as well as the expression of other TFs, generating a TF network thought to be a core determinant of cell type identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Becskei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Thieffry, 2007</xref>).

All M2 and M3 MCs were classified as PCx-simPN by 100% of classifiers, suggesting that these mitral types preferentially project to posterior targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, 73.5% of M1 MCs were classified as AON-simPN by at least 80% of classifiers, suggesting that M1 MCs preferentially project to anterior targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings suggest that the molecular subcategorization of MCs may delineate differences in connectivity. The types M1, M2, and M3 were defined by gene expression and regulon activity, but these results suggest that they also describe projection target specificity. This correspondence between molecular identity and projection target is further demonstrated by the segregation of MCs by predicted projection target in a UMAP space defined by gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Targeted snRNA-seq validates predictions of preferential connectivity for molecularly defined mitral cell types</title><p>To validate our prediction that M2 MCs preferentially project to posterior targets and M1 MCs preferentially project to anterior targets, we performed a small volume rAAV-retro-CAG-H2B-GFP injection into the pPCx.

We dissected the olfactory bulbs, generated single nuclei, enriched for GFP expression using FANS, and performed snRNA-seq using 10x Genomics technology (sn-PCx dataset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

To quantify this comparison, we used LDA classifiers, trained on the original mitral cells, to predict the cell type of these new projection neurons based on regulon activity scores.

This allowed us to analyze the transcriptomes of over 7500 putative projection neurons that could in turn be grouped into eight molecularly distinct mitral and tufted cell types. We validated neuronal identity using smFISH with multiple type-specific marker genes, and we determined the localization of identified neuronal types within the mitral cell, external plexiform, and glomerular layers of the main olfactory bulb. Finally, we used retrograde viral tracing combined with marker genes to confirm that the molecularly distinct neuronal types we describe indeed project to the olfactory cortex. Based on our analysis, we define three molecularly distinct types of MCs and five distinct types of TCs.</p><p>The neuronal cell types we have characterized here likely represent the major categories of OB projection neurons. More extensive sampling might reveal additional rare cell types, and more fine-grained clustering could further subdivide subtypes of neurons. However, our samples contained 7504 putative projection neurons compared to current estimates of 10,000–30,000 projection neurons overall per OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nagayama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richard et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, we sorted nuclei rather than whole cells, which is thought to more accurately reflect relative cell-type abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Habib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lake et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether we are therefore confident that our analysis captures the key biologically relevant types of projection neurons. Independent from the number of molecularly distinct neuronal cell types, the gene expression profiles we have described here provide critical new tools for refining projection neuron cell type identities by aligning a cell’s molecular features with its functional properties. Previous experiments have highlighted the heterogeneity of odor responses of MCs and TCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey and Wachowiak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desmaisons et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedman and Strowbridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>).

Earlier studies have shown that TCs project to anterior regions of the olfactory cortex only, while MCs project to both anterior and posterior olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imamura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nagayama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scott et al., 1980</xref>). Furthermore, and in contrast to the organization of neuronal projections to sensory cortexes for vision, hearing, or touch, projections from the OB to the piriform cortex appear to lack apparent topographical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We have analyzed, using bulk RNA deep sequencing, gene expression profiles of cells projecting to anterior versus posterior olfactory cortex (AON versus PCx). Using simulations based on gene regulatory network analysis, we have then mapped the bulk RNA sequencing data onto MC types defined by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Interestingly, our analysis suggested that cells of the M1 MC type preferentially target the AON, while M2 and M3 cells preferentially target the pPCx. A targeted snRNA-seq experiment of posterior-projecting MCs supported this prediction. Our findings that MC types preferentially target anterior or posterior cortical areas is consistent with recent observations using MAP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).

Here, we describe cell-type-specific modules of gene regulation, defined by the interactions of transcription factors and their target genes. One intriguing result of this analysis is that cell subtypes do not fall into clearly delineated MC and TC classes. For example, module activity of M2b and M2c MC subtypes is more similar to that of T1c TCs than other M1 and M2 MC subtypes. We obtained similar results from analyzing the TF-TF network that is thought to be closely linked to maintenance of cell identity. This demonstrated that while some MC subtypes indeed share key TFs with each other, regulon activity and network features in MC subtypes and TC subtypes are highly overlapping. For example, the most prominent hub, <italic>Pbx3,</italic> is predominantly expressed in M1 and ET2 types. More generally, projection neurons are characterized by a variety of TFs, often closely linked through feedback cycles, that are used by both MC and TC types in a combinatorial manner. The prominent hub and cycle-related genes we have identified here may act as candidate master regulators of neuronal function, which can be targeted for experimental validation. Together, these results suggest that subtypes of MCs and TCs may share important functional properties, possibly blurring at the transcriptional level the traditional division into tufted and mitral cells as the two major classes of OB projection neurons. Moreover, the gradients of module activity that we observed over the MC and TC subtypes theoretically provide a mechanism for generating multiple distinct cellular phenotypes, similar to how morphogenetic gradients allow for spatial patterning and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). Through non-linear regulatory interactions, gradual differences at the transcriptomic level can be translated into selective expression of functional genes.</p><p>For example, we found that the <italic>Kcng1</italic> gene was selectively expressed in M1 MCs. The <italic>Kcng1</italic> gene encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, which forms heterotetrameric channels with the ubiquitously expressed delayed rectifying Kv2.1 potassium channel (indeed also expressed in the M1 cluster) and modifies the kinetics of channel activation and deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>). Other voltage-gated potassium channels exhibiting prominent differential expression levels in MC and TC subtypes include <italic>Kcnd3, Kcng1, Kcnh5, Kcnq3, Kcnj2</italic> and 6, and <italic>Hcn1</italic> (for details see accompanying website link in Materials and methods). These channels represent intriguing candidates for controlling the differential excitability of different MC and TC types.</p><p>We also found that a large number of cell adhesion and axon guidance genes known to control the formation and maintenance of neuronal connectivity were differentially expressed in OB projection neuron types. Examples include members of the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion glycoproteins (<italic>Cdh6</italic>, <italic>7</italic>, <italic>8 c</italic>, <italic>9</italic>, <italic>13</italic>, and <italic>20</italic>) and components of the Semaphorin/Neuropilin/Plexin complexes, including <italic>Nrp1</italic>, <italic>Nrp2</italic>, <italic>Plexna3</italic>, <italic>Sema3e</italic>, and <italic>Sema5b.</italic> Semaphorin/Neuropilin/Plexin complexes are known to play critical roles in the development and maintenance of neuronal connections, including in OB MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inokuchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saha et al., 2007</xref>).

Clustering was performed using the default method (Louvain) from the Seurat package, with the resolution parameter of the FindClusters function set to 0.3.</p><p>Subclustering of projection neurons was carried out by selecting clusters M1, M2/M3, T1, ET1 and ET2 from the initial single-nuclei analysis based on the combinatorial expression patterns of glutamatergic and previously characterized mitral/tufted cell markers (<italic>Tbx21</italic>, <italic>Pcdh21</italic>, <italic>Thy1</italic>, <italic>Vglut1</italic>, <italic>Vglut2</italic>, and <italic>Vglut3).</italic> For subclustered nuclei, we again performed the above steps of highly variable genes selection, principal component analysis, and clustering, this time with the Louvain resolution parameter set to 0.5.</p><p>Differential gene expression analysis on single-nuclei data was performed using the glmGamPoi R-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlmann-Eltze and Huber, 2021</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the resulting log-fold changes was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Network inference</title><p>Gene regulatory networks were inferred using the pySCENIC pipeline (Single-Cell rEgulatory Network InferenCe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van de Sande et al., 2020</xref>) and visualized using Jupyter notebooks and Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). We used pySCENIC on the projection neuron subcluster data after removal of nuclei assigned the PG cell type. pySCENIC is a three-step approach: (1) predict TF-target gene pairs using Arboreto; (2) filter TF-target gene associations for false positives using TF binding site enrichment in a window of 5 kb around a target’s transcription start site (TSS) and group TFs with their target genes into so-called regulons; (3) calculate the activity of regulons in each cell in terms of the area under the recovery curve (AUC). Step one depends on a stochastic search algorithm and is therefore performed n = 100 times. Only TFs that are found &gt;80 times and with TF-target gene interactions that occur &gt;80 times are considered. To avoid technical issues in the analysis, regulons with fewer than eight target genes are removed from the final list. Subsequent analysis in Step three involves a stochastic downsampling to speed up computation; hence, we verified that the chosen sample size was sufficient for accurate AUC approximations. We calculated n = 25 AUC matrices and confirmed that they contained few zeros and the variance of each matrix entry (i.e. approximated regulon activity in a given cell) was low.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification along cell type trajectories</title><p>Gradual and sudden changes between cell types are studied using pseudotime trajectory analysis. We used the partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) functionality offered by the Python package Scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). Given a set of clusters, PAGA computes a graph as a condensed representation of how the clusters are distributed in transcriptomic/PCA space. It then uses a diffusion map to smoothly travel along the paths in the graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We focused on a single path, namely ET4, ET1, T1, M2, M3, M1, ET2 (ignoring ET3, as it has few neurons). We then computed trajectories of module and regulon activity levels, and TF expression levels using a running average with window size of 100 nuclei to smoothen the signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bulk RNA deep sequencing analysis</title><p>The ‘Trim Galore!’ utility version 0.4.2 was used to remove sequencing adaptors and to quality trim individual reads with the q-parameter set to 20. Sequencing reads were then aligned to the mouse genome and transcriptome (Ensembl GRCm38 release-89) using RSEM version 1.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) in conjunction with the STAR aligner version 2.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Sequencing quality of individual samples was assessed using FASTQC version 0.11.5 and RNA-SeQC version 1.1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeLuca et al., 2012</xref>). Differential gene expression was determined using the R-bioconductor package DESeq2 version 1.24.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Love et al., 2014</xref>). GSEA was conducted as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integration of single-nucleus and bulk RNA deep sequencing data using regulon-based simulations</title><p>Nuclei were simulated from bulk RNA deep sequencing data using a weighted random sampling of regulons with replacement. A regulon’s relative weight corresponded to the prevalence of its transcription factor in the given bulk RNA-seq sample. Each time a regulon was selected, the counts for its transcription factor and all its target genes increased by one. This weighted random sampling of regulons maintains key information from the starting bulk RNA-seq data (in the form of weights) while also maintaining key co-expression patterns of single nuclei (in the form of regulons), creating a population of biologically-realistic simulated transcriptomes that reflect the starting bulk RNA-seq data. The number of regulons expressed in each simulated nucleus was randomly selected from a list of how many unique transcription factors each nucleus from snRNA-seq expressed (normalized expression &gt; 2). Simulated nuclei were treated as raw count matrices and integrated with snRNA-seq nuclei using the sctransform package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). Briefly, this integration algorithm normalizes counts as the Pearson residuals from a regularized negative binomial regression model with sequencing depth as a covariate. The main result is the removal of batch effects related to sequencing depth, which facilitates pooling of our snRNA-seq replicates and makes the results of the simulation pipeline invariant to the number of regulons chosen for each nucleus, keeping results driven by proportions in the starting bulk RNA-seq data rather than absolute numbers.</p><p>To filter simulated nuclei, we trained 1000 LDA classifiers with the python package scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>). For each classifier, snRNA-seq nuclei were split into test and train datasets, with 75% of nuclei used for training and the other 25% used for testing. This train-test split was unique to each classifier. Each classifier was trained to predict whether a nucleus was a projection neuron (i.e. whether it was selected for subclustering in the initial transcriptome-based Seurat analysis) based on values for the 30 top principal components from the sctransform integration. Principal component analysis projects all data points into the same space and reduces the number of features, enabling better classification performance. Each classifier was applied to the remaining snRNA-seq nuclei for testing, and accuracy was evaluated using the Jaccard index calculated by scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>). The classifiers were then applied to the simulated nuclei. Simulated nuclei predicted to be projection neurons by all 1000 classifiers were designated as putative simulated projection neurons and selected for further analysis. Similarly, these putative simulated projection neurons were integrated with snRNA-seq mitral cells using sctransform. One thousand LDA classifiers were trained to classify simulated nuclei as AON-projecting or PCx-projecting based on values for the 30 top principal components from the sctransform integration. Each classifier was trained on 75% of the simulated projection neurons and tested on the other 25%, with accuracy evaluated using the Jaccard index. Each classifier was then applied to snRNA-seq mitral cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Validation of regulon-based simulations</title><p>To assign the cell type identity in the sn-PCx dataset, we first identified projection neurons by transforming the expression matrix into the space of 30 principal components defined on the larger sn-R1/R2/R3 dataset. One thousand LDA classifiers were trained to classify cells as projection neurons or not based on the values for these 30 principal components. Each classifier was trained on 75% of the original sn-R1/R2/R3 dataset and tested on the other 25%. sn-PCx cells were considered projection neurons if they were predicted to be such by all 1000 classifiers.</p><p>Sn-PCx projection neurons were then transformed into a low-dimensional space defined by their expression of the 86 regulons from our SCENIC analysis on the original sn-R1/R2/R3 projection neurons. These regulons create a low-dimensional space in which to compare this new, targeted sn-PCx dataset to our original, larger sn-R1/R2/R3 dataset. To quantify this comparison, we used LDA classifiers, trained on the original mitral cells, to predict the cell type of the new projection neurons. Each of 1000 LDA classifiers was trained on 75% of the original data and tested on the other 25% to predict cell type identity based on regulon activity scores. These classifiers were then applied to the regulon activity scores of the new projection neurons. Statistics were performed on the results using binomial distributions. To calculate a p-value for the abundance of M2 cells in the sn-PCx dataset, we used the R command pbinom(44,57,1241/2114, lower.tail=F) to quantify the probability of observing that many or more M2 cells in a population of that size were the probability of sampling M2 as opposed to a different MC equal to that of sampling M2 from our sn-R1/R2/R3 dataset. With similar logic, to calculate a p-value for the scarcity of M1 cells in the sn-PCx data, we used the R command pbinom(6,57,711/2114) to calculate the probability of observing that many or fewer M1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>smFISH in tracing experiments and quantification</title><p>Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics [ACD]) for fresh frozen tissue. Briefly, a total of six mice were injected into the AON and PCx with the rAAVretro-CAG-H2B-GFP. After 15 days post-injection, mice were deeply anaesthetized with 2.5% of 250 mg/kg Avertin and transcardially perfused with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brains were dissected out from the skull, immediately embedded in Tissue Plus O.C.T. compound (Fisher Healthcare) and snap-frozen in a bath of 2-methylbutane on dry ice. Brains were cryo-sectioned coronally at 20 µm thickness, mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific), and stored at −80 °C until use. In situ probes against the following mouse genes were ordered from ACD and multiplexed in the same permutations across sections: <italic>Foxo1</italic> (#485761-C2 and 485761), <italic>Kcng1</italic> (#514181-C2), <italic>Lxh1</italic> (#488581), <italic>Sertm1</italic> (#505401-C2), <italic>Ebf3</italic>(#576871-C3), <italic>Sgcg</italic> (#488051-C3), <italic>Cadps2</italic> (#529361-C3 and 529361), <italic>Coch</italic> (#530911-C3), <italic>Ly6g6e</italic> (#506391-C2), <italic>Wnt5b</italic> (#405051), <italic>Fst</italic> (#454331), <italic>Barhl2</italic> (#492331-C2), <italic>Vdr</italic> (524511-C3), <italic>Gfp</italic> (#409011, #409011-C2 and #409011-C3), <italic>Piezo2</italic> (#500501), <italic>Olfr110/111</italic> (#590641), <italic>Calca</italic> (#578771), <italic>Lhx5</italic> (#885621-C3), and <italic>Vgll2</italic> (#885631-C2). Following smFISH, high-resolution images of a single z-plane were obtained using a 60× oil immersion objective on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope and a 40× oil immersion objective on a Nikon A1R-HD confocal microscope.</p><p>For each image, we first counted the number of cells positive for the less abundant probe (probe A), on average 60 cells for each probe. We then counted amongst probe A-positive cells how many cells also expressed the second probe (probe B). We report overlap as the percentage of probe A-positive cells also expressing probe B. For mitral cell markers we only considered cells along the mitral cell and internal plexiform layers. For tufted cell markers, we only considered cells in the external plexiform and glomerular layers. We considered a cell positive for a given smFISH probe if more than five dots/cell were present, and if the dots were located within the nucleus and perinuclear compartment of the cell, visualized by DAPI counterstain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Crick Advanced Sequencing Facility, especially Robert Goldstone and Amelia Edwards for their excellent support.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Zeppilli et al. addresses the question whether the projection neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) are different in their molecular identity. This is one of the major open questions in the olfaction field. The authors enriched the projection neuron population through retrograde tracing from the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and piriform cortex (PCX), and performed single nucleus RNA-Seq. They identified 3 mitral cell clusters and 5 tuft cell clusters. They further leveraged regulon analysis (Single-Cell Regulartory Network Inference and Clustering, SCENIC) and found more subtypes based on the transcription factor activities. They developed a simulation method and used bulk RNA-seq data traced from AON and PCX separately to infer that projection neurons of different molecular identity project differently to the targets (however, see Essential revision #1 below).</p><p>For the most part our understanding of these projection neurons from a molecular perspective rounds to nearly zero, and their diversity is likely critical for region-specific functions of the higher olfactory brain. The data will be a useful resource to the community, and we commend the authors on releasing the data along with interactive tools for exploring it. In addition, this paper appears to be a useful proof-of-concept for the use of single cell data to deconvolute bulk sequencing data.</p><p>Overall, all the reviewers thought that the data are presented clearly and the results are important. However, the reviewers raised several important concerns to which we hope the authors can address with additional experiments and analyses. Most importantly, the reviewers were concerned that the projection specificity predicted with simulated cells (Figure 6) is not validated with real data although projection patterns are one of the major subjects of the study. We hope that the authors can validate the results with additional experiments.</p><p>1) The AAVretro labeling strategy is supposed to enrich sequencing of OB projection neurons, which account for only a few percent of OB neurons. However, for unknown reason, only &lt;24% of single nuclei are from projection neurons (mitral and tufted cells). The rest are all kinds including non-neuronal cells. While this does not affect the single-nucleus RNA-Seq analysis, as the authors can identify projection neurons based on known markers and only focus on those 24% cells, they also used the same AAVretro method to perform bulk RNA-Seq, which presumably has the same contamination issues. And in bulk RNA-Seq, RNAs from the other three-quarter cells cannot be distinguished from RNAs from projection neurons. No matter how sophisticated analysis they are doing, I just don't see how the authors could conclude projection patterns from two different retrograde AAV experiments given the above contamination. To make matters worse, the contamination is most likely due to AAV spread, and therefore the AON injection would have more contaminations of OB cells than PCX contaminations so these two bulk RNA-Seq samples contain (unknown) different amount of OB cells. To validate their conclusions of Figure 6, the authors need to either perform classical retrograde labeling together with RNAscope detection of cell-type-specific marker, or better yet to perform AAVretro-based single-nucleus RNA-Seq using separate AAVretro injection (perhaps a smaller volume) into AON and PCX (not sure why they injected two sites in the same animal for their main experiment). Alternatively, the authors could potentially use cell-type specific genetic labeling approaches using novel markers identified in the profiling and mapping target fields. As projection patterns are a framing question for this study, we would like to see at least one experimental verification on this.</p><p>2) The computational approach for sorting the contributions of projection neuron populations to the bulk sequencing data is novel and interesting, but not entirely convincing or well-validated. In addition to the issues discussed above, the extent to which simulated nuclei capture the diversity of the original single nucleus RNA-Seq data remains ambiguous since the simulated and actual data seem to form separate clusters in the shared UMAP space. It would be useful to see a simpler complimentary analysis of the bulk RNA-Seq data, perhaps via approaches that evaluate how much of the difference between the AON-projecting and PCX-projecting could be explained by over/under representation of certain clusters in each dataset.</p><p>3) In comparing the SCENIC data and analysis shown herein with the Seurat based analysis, there seem to be differences both at the gene level and at the cell type level. Can the authors more extensively characterize similarities and differences in these orthogonal modes of analysis? What explains the observed differences (for example, several of the marker genes shown in Figure 3 are not identified in regulons or TF networks in Figures 4 and 5)?</p><p>4) Given that SCENIC is a bioinformatic method, all of the conclusions about regulatory relationships are inferred; the authors should be careful not to assert mechanistic causality from these sorts of analyses (e.g., &quot;continuous activity gradient of TFs is transformed in a non-linear manner into distinct transcriptome differences between mitral and tufted cell types&quot;), which will ultimately require additional experiment. Some tempering of language is likely called for here.</p><p>5) A previous single cell RNA-Seq study (Tepe et al., 2018, Cell Report) from OB has identified 3 projection neuron types; those authors' approach resulted in significant labeling of non-projection neurons, about 78% of the data. Since the current method also does not strictly label projection neurons, the authors identified projection neurons from the data using known molecular markers. Therefore, the current method only offered moderate advantage over the previous study. How are the projection neuron cell types correlate with the previously identified 3 types? We note that the quality of the single-cell transcriptomes appears to be superior than the Tepe et al. based on genes detected per cell. Incidentally, it will be useful to plot parameters of snRNA-seq as supplement figure panels rather than bury them in Methods.</p><p>6) What is the rationale of using Seurat 0.3 resolution rather than higher or lower? Did the authors try higher or lower resolutions? What would happen to cell-type-specific marker expression? To the regulon analysis? It will be more reassuring, if variations of cluster resolution does not change the major conclusions.</p><p>7) It is unclear how the transcription factors identified in the regulon analysis specify these cell types. Their expression patterns do not seem to be cell type specific. Some of them are generic transcription factors and regulate functions in other cells. Examples are Sox10, Sp1, Fos, Jun, Egr1. The authors should examine the hub transcription factors using in situ or at least plot their expressions in their own dataset to make sure they do express in the projection neurons. In addition, the previously identified transcription factors, such as Tbr1, Tbr2 and Tbx21 genes are not in the analysis. The authors should discuss the relationship of the transcription factors identified here and the previously known projection neuron transcription factors.</p><p>8) The sub clustering of projection neurons from single nucleus RNA-Seq data is elegant and well-validated with convincing fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data. However, some sort of quantification of overall labeling and overlap between different FISH probes would be useful. Related, it would be broadly beneficial to the field to provide such quantification, particularly for choosing cell-type specific markers in the future.</p><p>9) Although compelling, the authors may be somewhat stretching the extent to which the gene regulatory network (GRN) clustering recapitulates the transcriptomic clustering. To strengthen this, it may be useful to include some sort of quality measure for GRN clustering to evaluate if class changes are truly meaningful. This might be achieved by clustering based only on the GRN analysis which is not constrained by the originally identified cell classes. This seems important given that the authors use the rationale that there is heterogeneity of active GRNs within transcriptomically identified clusters to justify the sub clustering, and point out that gradual transitions may exist in active GRNs between clusters. This seems to be a fundamental distinction – whether the GRNs functionally define cell types or whether they are a separate axis along which to evaluate cell identity.</p><p>10) The methods and description of the simulated nuclei approach are somewhat under-described. There are multiple manipulations to the bulk sequencing gene expression (expanding the bulk sequencing data into many simulated nuclei by resampling the counts for regulon/target genes, transforming the simulated counts into Pearson residuals before performing PCA and multiple rounds of classification), but the rationale for and the effects of each of these transformations are relatively unclear. Comparisons to existing algorithms that can deconvolve bulk RNA sequencing data (e.g. Frishberg 2019 Nat Methods, Newman 2019 Nat Biotechnology), would also be useful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular characterization of projection neuron subtypes in the mouse olfactory bulb&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The data provide some support of their previous predictions that specific mitral types have preference for specific target sites.</p><p>While I applaud the authors' effort to perform additional single nucleus RNAseq of mitral cells based on their projection to either PCx or AON, the numbers of recovered cells are quite small-they did not report any data on AON-projecting ones because the cell number is too small. Of the 57 cells from the sn-PCx data as projection neurons 44 were classified as M2 cells while 6 were classified as M1 cells. Thus, the heading &quot;Targeted snRNA-seq validates predictions of selective connectivity for molecularly defined mitral cell types&quot; is an overstatement: either the prediction is not completely accurate, or the selectivity is not absolute, or both.

This paper will serve as an important catalog of molecular diversity in the bulb. I have one experimental request and two minor comments. The experimental request was made in our initial review but was not addressed – unless I missed it (and I may indeed have done so), the authors did not validate the expression of their three key hub genes in MT cells (Taf1, Bclaf1, Pbx3) by either in situ or by showing a UMAP plot describing their expression in the relevant cell types – this is really critical for believing the analysis shown in Figure 5 and should be provided. The two minor comments are 1. maybe consider not using the word &quot;direct&quot; in the abstract to describe OSN inputs onto projection neurons, given the complexity and 2.

This is one of the major open questions in the olfaction field. The authors enriched the projection neuron population through retrograde tracing from the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and piriform cortex (PCX), and performed single nucleus RNA-Seq. They identified 3 mitral cell clusters and 5 tuft cell clusters. They further leveraged regulon analysis (Single-Cell Regulartory Network Inference and Clustering, SCENIC) and found more subtypes based on the transcription factor activities. They developed a simulation method and used bulk RNA-seq data traced from AON and PCX separately to infer that projection neurons of different molecular identity project differently to the targets (however, see Essential revision #1 below).</p><p>For the most part our understanding of these projection neurons from a molecular perspective rounds to nearly zero, and their diversity is likely critical for region-specific functions of the higher olfactory brain. The data will be a useful resource to the community, and we commend the authors on releasing the data along with interactive tools for exploring it. In addition, this paper appears to be a useful proof-of-concept for the use of single cell data to deconvolute bulk sequencing data.</p><p>Overall, all the reviewers thought that the data are presented clearly and the results are important. However, the reviewers raised several important concerns to which we hope the authors can address with additional experiments and analyses. Most importantly, the reviewers were concerned that the projection specificity predicted with simulated cells (Figure 6) is not validated with real data although projection patterns are one of the major subjects of the study. We hope that the authors can validate the results with additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the support and the important and helpful suggestions, criticism and comments. As a consequence, we have re-done both the Seurat and pySCENIC analyses and regenerated the relevant parts of manuscript Figures 2-6. This also allowed us to iron out a few minor inconsistencies in the analysis, which have altered some results in a minor way but have not changed any of the conclusions. Regarding the small changes in results, these are essentially restricted to the pySCENIC analysis (Figures 4 and 5). One should think of, for example, some regulons no longer meeting the 0.8 confidence cutoff, whilst others now do. In other words, some regulons will be found missing and some newcomers are seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The AAVretro labeling strategy is supposed to enrich sequencing of OB projection neurons, which account for only a few percent of OB neurons. However, for unknown reason, only &lt;24% of single nuclei are from projection neurons (mitral and tufted cells). The rest are all kinds including non-neuronal cells. While this does not affect the single-nucleus RNA-Seq analysis, as the authors can identify projection neurons based on known markers and only focus on those 24% cells, they also used the same AAVretro method to perform bulk RNA-Seq, which presumably has the same contamination issues. And in bulk RNA-Seq, RNAs from the other three-quarter cells cannot be distinguished from RNAs from projection neurons. No matter how sophisticated analysis they are doing, I just don't see how the authors could conclude projection patterns from two different retrograde AAV experiments given the above contamination. To make matters worse, the contamination is most likely due to AAV spread, and therefore the AON injection would have more contaminations of OB cells than PCX contaminations so these two bulk RNA-Seq samples contain (unknown) different amount of OB cells. To validate their conclusions of Figure 6, the authors need to either perform classical retrograde labeling together with RNAscope detection of cell-type-specific marker, or better yet to perform AAVretro-based single-nucleus RNA-Seq using separate AAVretro injection (perhaps a smaller volume) into AON and PCX (not sure why they injected two sites in the same animal for their main experiment). Alternatively, the authors could potentially use cell-type specific genetic labeling approaches using novel markers identified in the profiling and mapping target fields. As projection patterns are a framing question for this study, we would like to see at least one experimental verification on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important suggestion. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now performed small volume AAV-retro injections, separately into the AON and the pPCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Analysis of these new experiments validate our predictions, based on regulon-based simulations, that mitral cell subtypes project to distinct target areas.</p><p>In detail, we injected a retrogradely transported Adeno-Associated Virus expressing nuclear GFP (rAAV-retro-CAG-H2B-GFP (Tervo et al., 2016)) into the AON (n=1 animal) or in the pPCx (n=1 animal). Injection coordinates were the same as for the main experiment, we only reduced the volume of each injection site and eliminated the most lateral injection point of AON coordinates to avoid as much LOT contamination as possible. We dissected the olfactory bulbs of the two AON- and pPCx-injected mice, the bulbs were dissociated into single nuclei and enriched for GFP expression using FANS (ipsilateral bulb for enrichment, contralateral bulb as control). We then performed snRNA-seq using 10X Genomics technology. The remaining part of the brain was postfixed in 4 % PFA at 4 °C and used for histological validation of the injection points.</p><p>We have now included this new data as Figure 7 and describe the results in detail in the new revised Results section (page 17, line 424-454).

In addition to the issues discussed above, the extent to which simulated nuclei capture the diversity of the original single nucleus RNA-Seq data remains ambiguous since the simulated and actual data seem to form separate clusters in the shared UMAP space. It would be useful to see a simpler complimentary analysis of the bulk RNA-Seq data, perhaps via approaches that evaluate how much of the difference between the AON-projecting and PCX-projecting could be explained by over/under representation of certain clusters in each dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this comment. As discussed above, we now have independently validated our computational approach with new, targeted snRNA-seq experiments. The distribution of cell types observed in this new data corroborates the predictions made according to the simulation pipeline. We have considered alternate computational approaches (see also our reply to point 10 below), however, we are not convinced that these would resolve the ambiguities mentioned above, considering that most other methods (such as Zhu et al., Sci Rep 6:38350, Cobos et al. Bioinformatics, 34:1969) tend to take less information into account. We are, however, convinced that the new experimental data provides a significantly stronger validation.</p><p>To assign the cell type identity of new snRNA-seq cells, we first identified projection neurons by transforming the expression matrix into the space of 30 principal components defined on the original, larger snRNA-seq dataset. 1000 Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), each trained on 75% of the original snRNA-seq dataset and validated on the other 25% (mean jaccard index = 0.96) designated 57 out of 62 cells from the sn-PCx dataset as projection neurons and 14 out of 118 cells from the sn-AON dataset (consistent with the sn-R1/R2/R3 data presented originally that contained “contaminations” from non-projection neurons as well). Given the paucity of sn-AON projection neurons, we chose to focus on only sn-PCx neurons for further analysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Each row represents one cell in the new, targeted snRNA-seq data.</title><p>Each column represents one of 1000 linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers trained to discriminate projection neurons from other cell types (analogously to the analysis in the original manuscript Figure 7B). The color indicates the prediction made by each classifier (dark: projection neuron, light: rest).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65445-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To assign cell type to these projection neurons, these projection neurons were then transformed into a low-dimensional space defined by their expression of the 86 regulons from our SCENIC analysis on the original sn-R1/R2/R3 projection neurons. These regulons create a lowdimensional space in which to compare this new, targeted sn-PCx dataset to our original, larger sn-R1/R2/R3 dataset. To quantify this comparison, we used LDA classifiers, trained on the original mitral cells, to predict the cell type of these new projection neurons. Each of 1000 LDA classifiers was trained on 75% of the original data and validated on the other 25% to predict cell type identity based on regulon activity scores. These classifiers were then applied to the regulon activity scores of the new projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Out of 57 sn-PCx mitral cells, only 6 were classified as M1 by at least 80% of classifiers. This scarcity of M1 neurons would be very unlikely if M1 cells were present in the sn-PCx mitral population at the same rate as the general mitral population observed in our original sn-R1/R2/R3 sample, as modeled with a binomial distribution (p=5.57e-05). Therefore, the new data suggest that M1 mitral cells preferentially project to the AON, as predicted by the analyses using simulated transcriptomes. Additionally, 44 of 57 sn-PCx mitral cells were classified as M2 cells by at least 80% of classifiers. Were M2 cells present in the sn-PCx population at the same rate as in the general mitral population, observing this many or more M2 cells would be unlikely, as modeled with a binomial distribution (p=0.001). Therefore, the new data suggest that M2 mitral cells preferentially project to the PCx, as predicted by the analyses using simulated transcriptomes.</p><p>We now include this new data, analysis and description as Figure 7 in the revised manuscript.

Can the authors more extensively characterize similarities and differences in these orthogonal modes of analysis? What explains the observed differences (for example, several of the marker genes shown in Figure 3 are not identified in regulons or TF networks in Figures 4 and 5)?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed a more comprehensive comparison between the SCENIC and Seurat-based analyses.</p><p>First, we revised the mapping of Seurat’s clusters on SCENIC’s and vice versa . We now compare in a straightforward manner Louvain clustering in Seurat’s PCAspace against Louvain clustering in SCENIC’s regulon activity space. In summary, even if the two analysis modes are orthogonal, neurons considered similar according to one method remain close to each other (i.e., are considered similar) also in the other method.</p><p>The comparison resulted in a new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript. One can appreciate that the mapping of regulon-based clusters on Seurat’s UMAP shows both consistent clusters (ET4), grouped clusters (M1 and M3) and gradient-like overlapping clusters (mostly ET1, T1, M2).</p><p>While overall comparable, the mapping between Seurat and SCENIC clusters also reveals some differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>; Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) = 0.326, in the revised manuscript as the new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C). When we do the reverse exercise of mapping Seurat’s clusters onto the UMAP computed for pySCENIC, we find that each of Seurat’s clusters occupies a distinct region of the UMAP. This means clustering results have remained consistent, even if the Louvain algorithm in SCENIC-space partitions the data differently (in the revised manuscript as the new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D-F).</p><p>Second, we now studied how marker genes identified in the Seurat analysis manifest in the SCENIC analysis (see also Comment 7). We have taken marker genes from manuscript Figure 3 and checked at which confidence level they were present as regulons and/or as target genes. The tables below provide a simplified overview, we have incorporated a regulon module-oriented version in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript. In addition, we now provide a supplementary figure to Figure 5A (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1) to show what the network looks like with marker genes added and highlighted by confidence level and highlight the new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 describing differentially active TF networks on p. 14 (l. 356).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Seurat marker genes identified as regulons in pySCENIC.</title><p>Columns are cell type, marker gene, and the marker gene as regulon with its max confidence cutoff.

Some tempering of language is likely called for here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important point here and we are glad to be given the opportunity to avoid such confusion. Specifically, they refer to a phrase in the Results section that is better placed in the Discussion section. Indeed, we now discuss gradients on p. 22, l. 550, where we offer a potential explanation of how a gradient of module activity (average activity of group of TFs and their target genes) may result in distinct phenotypic outcomes, namely distinct mitral and tufted cell types. We did not intend to assert mechanistic causality from our bioinformatic analysis, but to offer a hypothesis that can direct future experiments.</p><p>In addition, we kindly refer to comment 32 for an in-depth revision of the quantification of activity gradients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A previous single cell RNA-Seq study (Tepe et al., 2018, Cell Report) from OB has identified 3 projection neuron types; those authors' approach resulted in significant labeling of non-projection neurons, about 78% of the data. Since the current method also does not strictly label projection neurons, the authors identified projection neurons from the data using known molecular markers. Therefore, the current method only offered moderate advantage over the previous study. How are the projection neuron cell types correlate with the previously identified 3 types? We note that the quality of the single-cell transcriptomes appears to be superior than the Tepe et al. based on genes detected per cell.

We have now repeated the clustering for a variety of different parameters (different Seurat resolutions as well as number of neighbors; Author response image 8). Our original clustering parameters were tuned to get as close as possible to biologically-relevant cell types. We initially looked at cross-correlation matrices for distinct resolution parameters, that were computed on the top highly differentially expressed genes between the clusters. We then looked for specific/unique marker genes for each cluster to make sure that at least a few marker genes could differentiate one cluster from another. Finally, we selected the specific marker genes for in situ validation that corroborated our first-level clustering. We are confident that here we are describing the main classification of mitral and tufted cells, in line with the projection-neuronconnectivity axis as well. Our main groups could be further split into subtypes based on additional biological axes taken into consideration, nonetheless our classification will serve as a general roadmap to better investigate functional differences between main subclasses projecting to different areas of the brain.</p><p>Finally, cell types as defined by Seurat clustering influence regulon analysis in the sense that we decided to remove the PG cluster for the pySCENIC analysis (i.e., we wanted to only study M/T neurons). As the PG cluster is very stable across neighborhood and resolution changes (see central cluster in UMAPs of Author response image 8) this influence is “constant” and does not affect the major conclusions of our study.

The authors should examine the hub transcription factors using in situ or at least plot their expressions in their own dataset to make sure they do express in the projection neurons.

We have now quantified the overlap of the expression of marker genes detected by smFISH in mitral and tufted cell types. We report the results in the revised Figure 3 —figure supplements 1R and 2L. For each image, we first counted the number of cells positive for the less abundant probe (probe A), on average 60 cells for each probe. We then counted amongst probe A-positive cells how many cells also expressed the second probe (probe B). We report overlap as the percentage of probe Apositive cells also expressing probe B. For mitral cell markers we only considered cells along the mitral cell and internal plexiform layers. For tufted cell markers we only considered cells in the external plexiform and glomerular layers. We considered a cell positive for a given smFISH probe if more than 5 dots/cell were present, and if the dots were located within the nucleus and perinuclear compartment of the cell, visualized by DAPI counterstain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Although compelling, the authors may be somewhat stretching the extent to which the gene regulatory network (GRN) clustering recapitulates the transcriptomic clustering. To strengthen this, it may be useful to include some sort of quality measure for GRN clustering to evaluate if class changes are truly meaningful. This might be achieved by clustering based only on the GRN analysis which is not constrained by the originally identified cell classes. This seems important given that the authors use the rationale that there is heterogeneity of active GRNs within transcriptomically identified clusters to justify the sub clustering, and point out that gradual transitions may exist in active GRNs between clusters. This seems to be a fundamental distinction – whether the GRNs functionally define cell types or whether they are a separate axis along which to evaluate cell identity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this source of confusion. Triggered by this suggestion, we have substantially revised the comparison between transcriptomic and GRN clustering and we refer to comment 3 for the detailed answer. Indeed we have followed the advice of the reviewer and performed Louvain clustering in both transcriptomic and GRN space, and then compared these clusters. Summarizing, results are consistent: cells that are close to each other (i.e. similar) in one space remain similar in the other. Moreover, the mismatches between transcriptomic and GRN clusters occur where we had previously identified heterogeneity and gradual transitions (see Comment 32 for details on gradients).</p><p>Regarding the last statement, whether GRNs define cell types or are a separate axis along which one may evaluate cell identity, a mixed picture emerges. Some of our cell types are rather welldefined in both transcriptomic and GRN space, e.g. ET4 and ET2. Contrastingly, while the cell types ET1, T1, and M2 are distinct in transcriptomic space, in GRN space they form a single heterogeneous collective with gradual transitions (see Comment 3, Figure 3.1). On top of that, one may even argue that in GRN space ET1 splits into two regions, one captured by ET4 and the other by T1.</p><p>If we speculate on how a GRN is translated into distinct phenotypic outcomes in the context of M/T projection neurons, we might propose (i) that ET1 is a cell type originating from two distinct GRNs, and that (ii) T1 and M2 translate gradients into distinct cell types akin to Wolpert’s French flag (Wolpert 1969, J. Theor. Biol.).</p><p>We now discuss this new analysis and its implications on p. 11 l. 274-281 and p. 12 /13 of the revised manuscript, relating to the Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The methods and description of the simulated nuclei approach are somewhat under-described. There are multiple manipulations to the bulk sequencing gene expression (expanding the bulk sequencing data into many simulated nuclei by resampling the counts for regulon/target genes, transforming the simulated counts into Pearson residuals before performing PCA and multiple rounds of classification), but the rationale for and the effects of each of these transformations are relatively unclear. Comparisons to existing algorithms that can deconvolve bulk RNA sequencing data (e.g. Frishberg 2019 Nat Methods, Newman 2019 Nat Biotechnology), would also be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The simulated nuclei approach described here is similar to existing deconvolution methods in its combined use of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq ( e.g. Frishberg Nat Meth 2019). However, our method is unique in its deployment of outside biological information about transcription factor binding sites and gene regulatory networks to harness the relationships between genes to aid the deconvolution. The Methods section has been updated (p. 29-30 in the revised manuscript) with more detailed explanation, relevant portions of which we present below:</p><p>“Integration of single nucleus and bulk RNA deep sequencing data using regulon-based simulations</p><p>Nuclei were simulated from bulk RNA deep sequencing data using a weighted random sampling of regulons with replacement. A regulon’s relative weight corresponded to the prevalence of its transcription factor in the given bulk RNA-seq sample. Each time a regulon was selected, the counts for its transcription factor and all its target genes increased by one. […]Simulated nuclei predicted to be projection neurons by all 1000 classifiers were designated as putative simulated projection neurons and selected for further analysis. Similarly, these putative simulated projection neurons were integrated with snRNA-seq mitral cells using sctransform. 1000 LDA classifiers were trained to classify simulated nuclei as AON-projecting or PCx-projecting based on values for the 30 top principal components from the sctransform integration. Each classifier was trained on 75% of the simulated projection neurons and tested on the other 25%, with accuracy evaluated using the Jaccard index. Each classifier was then applied to snRNA-seq mitral cells.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers commend the authors' thorough and thoughtful revisions. There are, however, some points that we would like you to address before publication of this work. You can find these points in the individual reviewers' comments. We expect that modifications of text will be sufficient to address these points. We hope that you can address these points within two weeks.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed many critiques of the reviewers quite thoroughly. Furthermore, they have performed new single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of mitral cells based on their projections into specific sites. The data provide some support of their previous predictions that specific mitral types have preference for specific target sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the support and encouragement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I applaud the authors' effort to perform additional single nucleus RNAseq of mitral cells based on their projection to either PCx or AON, the numbers of recovered cells are quite small-they did not report any data on AON-projecting ones because the cell number is too small. Of the 57 cells from the sn-PCx data as projection neurons 44 were classified as M2 cells while 6 were classified as M1 cells. Thus, the heading &quot;Targeted snRNA-seq validates predictions of selective connectivity for molecularly defined mitral cell types&quot; is an overstatement: either the prediction is not completely accurate, or the selectivity is not absolute, or both. This heading and similar statements throughout the text need to be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now toned down the corresponding heading on p17 of the revised manuscript (to “preferential connectivity”) as well as abstract, and p19 and p21 of the discussion to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This a thoughtful response to all previous reviewers with extensive new data analyses, figure modifications, and clarifications to the text. This is a vastly improved manuscript, and a timely contribution to the field. I commend the authors on a nice revision and fully endorse publication at eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your support and encouragement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I commend the authors for performing a thorough revision of the paper that addressed our main concerns, especially for the validation data shown in Figure 7 and for the additional details regarding both clustering and the imputation of single nucleus transcriptomes. This paper will serve as an important catalog of molecular diversity in the bulb. I have one experimental request.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions and support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental request was made in our initial review but was not addressed – unless I missed it (and I may indeed have done so), the authors did not validate the expression of their three key hub genes in MT cells (Taf1, Bclaf1, Pbx3) by either in situ or by showing a UMAP plot describing their expression in the relevant cell types – this is really critical for believing the analysis shown in Figure 5 and should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for not more clearly addressing this point in the revision. We now provide UMAP plots as suggested in the revised Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and describe these on p14 and discuss them on p21.</p></body></sub-article></article>
