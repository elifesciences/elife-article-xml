AR splice variants (ARVs) limit the effectiveness of second-generation antiandrogens (SGAs). Several strategies have been implemented to develop novel antiandrogens to circumvent the occurring resistance. Here, we found and identified a bifunctional small molecule Z15, which is both an effective AR antagonist and a selective AR degrader. Z15 could directly interact with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and activation function-1 region of AR, and promote AR degradation through the proteasome pathway. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Z15 efficiently suppressed AR, AR mutants and ARVs transcription activity, downregulated mRNA and protein levels of AR downstream target genes, thereby overcoming AR LBD mutations, AR amplification, and ARVs-induced SGAs resistance in CRPC. In conclusion, our data illustrate the synergistic importance of AR antagonism and degradation in advanced prostate cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>androgen receptor</kwd><kwd>degrader</kwd><kwd>antiandrogen</kwd><kwd>enzalutamide resistance</kwd><kwd>castration-resistant prostate cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22077115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jinming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82104231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M700504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81672559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jinming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81311120299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jinming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The rational drug design combining the bioassay identified a novel selective androgen receptor (AR) degrader for both AR and AR-VRs and illustrated the synergistic importance of AR antagonism and degradation in advanced prostate cancer treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death for men in western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Advanced PCa initially responds to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but invariably fails and recurs as lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desai et al., 2021</xref>). Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a crucial role in the progress and survival of CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). Second-generation antiandrogens (SGAs), such as enzalutamide (ENZa), abiraterone, apalutamide, and darolutamide, improve the overall survival time and decline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sternberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bono et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the initial benefit of these agents, their success in treating CRPC has been eliminated by the emergence of drug resistance. Multiple possible mechanisms for the development of drug resistance have thus far been identified, including mutations in the AR LBD, amplification of AR, expression of AR splice variants (ARVs), and intra-tumoral de novo androgen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buttigliero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karantanos et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, more effective therapies are urgently required to conquer the SGAs drug resistance.</p><p>Several strategies have been implemented to develop novel antiandrogens to circumvent the occurring resistance. The first strategy is to develop new competitive antiandrogens targeting the AR hormone-binding pocket (HBP) site, such as darolutamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Another strategy is to target the AR signaling axis beyond the HBP site, which includes activation function-1 (AF1), activation function-2, binding function 3, and the DNA binding site through active compounds, such as EPI-001, VPC-14449 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caboni and Lloyd, 2013</xref>). Recently, down-regulating both AR protein and AR mRNA levels has attracted attention due to their potential in the discovery and development of new antiandrogens. The most exciting progress is AR degradation based on the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) concept, with various of these AR PROTACs developed with a DC<sub>50</sub> (drug concentration that results in 50% protein degradation) potency up to 1 nM. However, low cell permeability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and complex chemical structures may restrict the clinical application of PROTAC drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2020</xref>). What’s more, LBD-targeted AR PROTACs cannot degrade ARVs which were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fettke et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant approved by the FDA in 2002 expanded treatment choices for advanced breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bross et al., 2003</xref>), which gave rise to next-generation novel degraders with promising antitumor activity in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nardone et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradbury et al., 2011</xref> suggested that similar specific downregulation or degradation of AR might be proved beneficial in the treatment of CRPC. Therefore, selective AR degraders (SARDs) which could synthetically degrade and antagonize AR may be an efficient strategy to overcome the drug resistance in the antiandrogen therapy of CRPC. Based on structural modification of the AR antagonists and the tissue-selective AR agonist enobosarm, Miller et al. designed a series of SARDs, namely UT-155, UT-69, and UT-34, which could induce AR ubiquitin-proteasome degradation <italic>via</italic> binding to AF-1 of the AR to reduce its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ponnusamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ponnusamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the degradation potency of these compounds for ARVs is quite limited. In the present study, we determined that Z15 screened by rational drug design as an AR antagonist and degrader via direct binding to the AR LBD and AR AF1, could overcome AR LBD mutations, AR amplification, and ARVs-induced SGAs resistance of CRPC in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying Z15 as an AR inhibitor</title><p>To develop novel AR inhibitors and overcome antiandrogen resistance, we previously constructed a common molecular characteristic pharmacophore model, and screened ~7.5 million compounds from the ZINC lead-like database and ChemDiv database. About 47,202 compounds matched more than four features of the filtering model. Next, these compounds were docked into the HBP of the antagonistic AR. Then, compounds with the top 1000 docking scores were chosen for ADMET prediction by Discovery Studio v3.5. Finally, 80 hits with high drug-likeness were selected and purchased for further bioactivity evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>To preliminarily evaluate the influences for AR transcriptional activity of these 80 candidates, human prostate cancer cells PC-3 co-transfected with wild-type AR (wt-AR) and PSA-luc were incubated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 10 μM candidate compounds for 24 h.

The AR competitive binding assay was performed to demonstrate the direct interaction between Z15 and AR, whereby compounds in competition with the radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H] DHT in cytosolic lysates from LNCaP cells were measured. Synthetic androgen R1881 displayed strong binding potency to AR with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.45 nM, which indicated the feasibility of this assay system.

Interestingly, Z15 showed a comparable binding affinity to ENZa, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 63.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, our fluorescence polarization assay demonstrated Z15 could compete with androgen binding to AR LBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since Z15 could degrade both AR and ARV7, we wondered if Z15 could also bind to other regions of AR to induce ARV7 degradation. Hence, we investigated the binding affinity between Z15 and AR AF1, as AF1 is an important drug target region of AR. The surface plasmon resonance assay indicated that Z15 could directly bind to AR AF1 with a KD value of 0.93 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

However, drug resistance caused by AR mutation, AR amplification, and ARVs, has been widely reported to restrict the clinical benefits of these therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buttigliero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). AR remains a crucial target for CRPC therapeutic development because of its key function in the progress of CRPC. In this study, we identified a compound Z15 that selectively inhibited AR transcriptional activity and significantly downregulated AR target genes at the mRNA and protein levels. Further studies proved that Z15 could bind directly to both AR LBD and AR AF1, so as to decrease androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation, which confirmed Z15 as an AR antagonist. Moreover, Z15 could also degrade AR and ARV7 through the proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Importantly, several Z15 analogs exhibited stronger AR inhibition and downregulation potency than Z15, suggesting that Z15 is a promising lead compound for further chemical structure optimization.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The mechanism of Z15 inhibits the AR pathway and overcomes antiandrogen resistance.</title><p>Z15 binds to both AR LBD and AR AF1, decreases AR nuclear translocation, antagonizes AR function, promotes AR and ARVs degradation through the proteasome pathway, so as to overcome AR mutation, AR overexpression, and ARVs-induced antiandrogen resistance.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-70700-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>AR amplification is a common phenomenon in CRPC patients undergoing antiandrogens treatment. Our data showed that ENZa could hardly downregulate DHT-induced PSA levels in AR-overexpressed VCaP cells, which means that AR antagonizing method is too faint to overcome the drug resistance caused by AR amplification. A rational way to solve this problem would be to directly downregulate AR. For example, AR degrader ARV-110 developed based on PROTAC technology could inhibit the growth activity of AR amplification CRPC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cleveland, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kregel et al., 2020</xref>). Another strategy to promote AR degradation would be to interfere with the AR protein complex stability. For example, Hu et al. discovered a p23 inhibitor named ailanthone, which could degrade AR through interfering with AR-HSP90-p23 protein complex stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lv et al., 2021</xref> reported a competitive AR antagonist CPPI was capable of enhancing AR interaction with its E3 ligase MDM2 and then promoting AR degradation in CRPC cells. Here, we proved that Z15 not only antagonizes AR function, but also promotes AR degradation through the proteasome pathway to overcome AR amplification-induced antiandrogen resistance.</p><p>ARVs (especially ARV7) not only correlate with antiandrogen resistance but also relate to poorer prognosis of patients with CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonarakis et al., 2014</xref>). Efforts have been made to develop ARVs-targeted therapies. For instance, niclosamide has been reported to specifically downregulate ARV7 protein levels. In vitro and in vivo bioassays both indicate that niclosamide significantly inhibits the growth of CRPC driving <italic>via</italic> ARV7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, a phase I study of niclosamide in combination with ENZa in men with CRPC reveals that oral niclosamide is not viable for repurposing as a CRPC treatment agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schweizer et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, through targeting the AR N-terminal domain, some novel AR down regulators, such as UT-34, UT-69, EPI, TAS3681, and 26 f have been shown to block the transcriptional activity of both the full-length AR and ARVs. These compounds significantly inhibit the proliferation activity of ARVs-induced antiandrogen resistance CRPC cells both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ponnusamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ponnusamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Seki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2021</xref>). However, these compounds still need further clinical research. Our studies indicated that Z15 binds directly to both AR LBD and AR AF1, as a result, Z15 could inhibit AR and ARV7-driving CRPC cells such as 22Rv1 cells growth activity in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our data illustrate the synergistic importance of AR antagonism and degradation in advanced PCa treatment.</p><p>However, we notice that the AR degradation potency of Z15 is not as stronger as AR-targeted PROTAC molecule ARV-110, suggesting that Z15 is a less specific AR degrader compared to ARV-110. We acknowledge that while Z15 suppresses CRPC progress mainly through targeting AR and ARV7, Z15 may have other mechanisms of action which contribute to its anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, Z15 is a novel selective AR and ARV7 degrader that warrants further structure optimization and anti-CRPC mechanisms investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The LNCaP, PC-3, 22Rv1, VCaP, and DU-145 human prostate cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

The protein A/G beads were pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The precipitates were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and subjected to Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>4D-label free proteomic analysis</title><p>LNCaP Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells in T25 culture flask. After 48 hr incubation, 5 µL test compounds were added to each flask at the designated concentrations. After another 8 hr incubation, the cell samples were lysed and the proteins were digested according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>The tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile/in water), and directly loaded onto a homemade reversed-phase analytical column (25 cm length, 75/100 μm i.d.). Peptides were separated with a gradient from 6% to 24% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 70 min, 24% to 35% in 14 min and climbing to 80% in 3 min then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 450 nL/min on a nanoElute UHPLC system (Bruker Daltonics).</p><p>The peptides were subjected to capillary source followed by the timsTOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometry. The electrospray voltage applied was 1.60 kV. Precursors and fragments were analyzed at the TOF detector, with a MS/MS scan range from 100 to 1700 m/z. The timsTOF Pro was operated in parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode. Precursors with charge states 0–5 were selected for fragmentation, and 10 PASEF-MS/MS scans were acquired per cycle. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s.</p><p>The resulting MS/MS data were processed using MaxQuant search engine (v.1.6.15.0). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the human SwissProt database (20422 entries) concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in first search and 5 ppm in main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification, and acetylation on protein N-terminal and oxidation on Met were specified as variable modifications. FDR was adjusted to &lt;1%. The cut-off values for identification of potential hits were set at Fold Change &lt;0.67 or Fold Change &gt;1.5 and p-value &lt;0.05.</p><p>Enrichment of pathway analysis: Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to identify enriched pathways by a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test to test the enrichment of the differentially expressed protein against all identified proteins. The pathway with a corrected p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. These pathways were classified into hierarchical categories according to the KEGG website. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD035721.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In silico screening</title><p>The AR antagonist common molecular characteristic pharmacophore model and the antagonistic form AR-LBD were constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). About 7.5 million compounds were downloaded from the ZINC drug-like database and ChemDiv database. Then, these 2D molecules were generated into 3D structures using the ‘prepare ligands’ module by Discovery Studio v3.5. Next, pharmacophore-based virtual screening was performed by Discovery Studio v3.5. Molecules with a Fit-value &gt;4 were chosen for further screening. The left molecules were then docked into the HBP of the antagonistic form AR-LBD using the GOLD software and ranked by fitness score. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of compounds were evaluated by the ‘General Descriptors’ module in Discovery Studio v3.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Chemistry</title><sec id="s4-17-1"><title>2-romo-1-(2-thienyl)-ethanone (2)</title><p>Add a solution of 2-Acetylthiophene (10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) dropwise to a solution of N-bromosuccinimide (12 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and <italic>p</italic>-TsOH (1 mmol, 0.1 equiv) in DCM (10 mL) at 0 °C.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor.

The manuscript requires extensive proofreading for english language.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite having the ability to grow in the presence of low concentrations of androgens, most cases of castration resistant prostate cancer retain activity of signaling through the androgen receptor (AR) and employ one or more of several resistance mechanisms including amplification of the AR gene, point mutations in the AR gene, or splice variants such as ARv7 which lack the AR ligand binding domain and signal in a ligand independent fashion. Therefore, a key therapeutic approach in the field is to develop methods of inhibiting these mutant or amplified forms of AR. A particularly active area of work is the development of selective androgen receptor degraders, which not only inhibit AR, but cause its destruction. Some molecules are in clinical trials, but more are needed. Here the authors discovered a new molecule, named Z15, which they propose binds to the AR ligand binding domain and causes AR destruction by way of the proteasome; therefore acting as a selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD). ;</p><p>Strengths: The discovery of Z15 and its efficacy are quite promising:</p><p>1. Z15 is effective against AR expressing cell lines in vitro including cell lines expressing mutant forms of AR. In support of the specificity of the molecule, it has minimal activity against prostate cancer cell lines which do not express AR.</p><p>2. Z15 is active in a mouse xenograft prostate cancer model and is tolerable to the mice, as it does not cause weight loss.</p><p>3. IC50 and Kd values are similar to the commonly used anti-androgen, enzalutamide.</p><p>Weaknesses: The proposed mechanism of action of Z15 is not supported by the data. Therefore, Z15 cannot accurately be called a selective androgen receptor degrader. However, Z15 does appear to act through the androgen receptor in some, as of yet, unknown fashion.</p><p>1. Despite proposing that Z15 binds to the AR ligand binding domain, it appears to have similar efficacy against wild type AR and the splice isoform ARv7 which lack the AR ligand binding domain. For example, please see figure 2E. Z15 has similar effects on wild type AR (top band) and ARv7 (bottom band). Multiple high profile publications have reported lack of the ligand binding domain in ARv7. For example, see Antonarakis et al. N Engl J Med 2014; 371:1028-1038.</p><p>2. The data that Z15 affects AR protein stability as opposed to AR protein expression by some other means is not convincing. For example, see the cyclohexamide experiment in figure 5D. There is minimal difference between the cyclohexamide minus conditions (left half of figure) and the cyclohexamide containing conditions (right half of figure).</p><p>I think Z15 is a useful molecule, but please do not over-sell the data. I do not think that it acts through your proposed mechanism. However, Z15 is specific to AR expressing cell lines, and efficacious in vivo. I suggest only publishing that much of the story and leaving the downstream mechanism to a subsequent publication.</p><p>The manuscript is in need of English language editing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript reports the discovery of a novel selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) targeting the androgen receptor ligand binding domain (AR-LBD) via virtual screening and bioassays. However, the potential targets and binding sites for the degradation of AR and ARVs have not been clarified because the binding of AR-LBD may not induce the degradation of ARVs. For instance, Ponnusamy et al. (10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0976) reported SARD not only binds to AR LBD but also binds to the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain (AF-1) of AR.

The authors state 'The results indicated that Z15 could inhibit DHT-induced transcriptional activities of both exogenous and endogenous AR in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B, 1C, 1D).'

The novelty of this present study is the discovery of a structurally novel SARD molecule with a modestly potent in vitro activity. There is no direct comparison of Z15 with current best SARD molecules to demonstrate any major advantages.</p><p>There are some specific deficiencies that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Since Z15 induces AR degradation after 12 h treatment time, the authors should rule out that induced AR degradation is specific. It is possible that the levels of other proteins may also be reduced and reduction of AR protein is one of many mechanisms for the cell growth inhibition of Z15;</p><p>2. While Z15 binds to AR LBD with a Kd value of 21 uM, this level of binding could be an artifact, not necessarily a real binding. Therefore, the binding assay needs to be further optimized;</p><p>3. Z15 induces degradation of AR in cells and effectively inhibits tumor growth in the 22RV1 xenograft model in mice, AR degradation in tumor tissues needs to be demonstrated.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) to overcome antiandrogen resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The work was particularly strengthened by the data showing binding of Z15 to both the AR ligand binding domain and the transactivation domain – which makes their other data make much more sense.</p><p>I have one significant area where I suggest further improvement. In lines 226-244, the authors describe the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line as castration resistant. I and most investigators generally consider LNCaP cells to be castration sensitive. Conversely, the sub-line of LNCaP, C42B, is generally considered to be castration resistant but retains expression of the androgen receptor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have performed additional experiments to address concerns raised in the previous review. Despite their great efforts, the following points are still not being addressed.</p><p>1. While it is clear that Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7, the proposed biochemical mechanism of action is not convincing, The main issue is that Z15 binds to AR LBD with Kd = 21 μm and to AR AF1 domain with Kd = 15 uM, it has a biological activity at sub-μM ranges, much stronger than its direct binding to AR LBD and AR AF1. Based upon its chemical structure, Z15 should have a high plasma protein binding and would require higher concentrations in cells to achieve its biological activity if the proposed direct binding, followed by induced degradation is true. Therefore, it is very likely that Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 through a different mechanism, other than those proposed by the authors.</p><p>2. While Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 proteins in cells and in tumor tissues, it is still unclear if Z15 also reduces the levels of many other proteins in cells and in tumor tissues. The authors have examined three other proteins in the revision and showed that Z15 does not reduce these other three proteins. However, in order to be certain that Z15 specifically reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 proteins in cells, a more global proteomic analysis would be needed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD) to overcome antiandrogen resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

significantly inhibited by Z15 in a dose-dependent manner, while Z15 (IC50 = 1.37 μM) showed comparable proliferation inhibition potency with positive control ARV-110 (IC50 = 0.86 μM) in VCaP cells,

These new experiments included measuring the binding of Z15 to proteins from cytosolic lysates of LNCaP cells by competing with radio-labeled DHT and the surface plasmon resonance assay, which provide additional evidence that Z15 binds to AR. In addition, the authors have performed global proteomics experiments to show that AR, as well as several AR-regulated gene products, were down-regulated. Although it is still very likely Z15 has a complex cellular mechanism of action, the proposed mechanism action by the authors (i.e. direct binding to AR and induced degradation of AR and ARV7) is responsible in part for the anti-tumor activity of Z15 in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. It is recommended that the authors make the following revisions before the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1. Use the binding from the surface plasmon resonance assay as the primary biochemical evidence that Z15 binds to AR, due to the limitations of the BLI assay as the authors indicated in their letter.</p><p>2. Provide a Table for all those proteins down-regulated by ARV-110 and Z15 and compare those proteins commonly down-regulated by both compounds, as well as additional proteins, which are differentially regulated by ARV-110 and Z15.</p><p>The proteomic data further showed that while AR is obviously the protein most profoundly reduced by ARV-110, AR is only among those proteins reduced by Z15, suggesting that Z15 is a much less specific degrader of AR, as compared to ARV-110. The authors should add discussions to acknowledge that while down-regulation of AR and ARV7 appears to be a major mechanism for the antitumor activity of Z15, Z15 may have other mechanisms of action which contribute to its anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Overall, Z15 is an interesting compound but is not a specific degrader of AR and ARV7. The cellular mechanism of action for Z15 is much more complex than the authors tried to portray.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70700.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data has novel and interesting findings with the small molecule for potential further development in castrate-resistant prostate cancer but the reviewers cautioned against over-interpreting or over-selling the proposed mechanism.

ARV7 which lacks the ligand-binding domain but remains constitutively active as a transcription factor, the works of Antonarakis et al and other researches indicated the ARV7 expression was associated with the resistance of CRPC to enzalutamide or abiraterone. As Z15 displays both the full length-AR and the ARV7 inhibition activity, while ARV7 does not possess LBD region, we wonder if Z15 could also bind to other region of AR and then induce ARV7 degradation. The AF1 of AR was considered as an important molecule target region of AR previously, and our BLI assay found that AR AF1 inhibitor UT-34 could bind to AR AF1 directly with KD value of 9.3 μM (Figure 4D), however, UT-34 could not induce ARV7 degradation in 22Rv1 cells in our western blot analysis (Figure 4-figure supplement 2D-F). Interestingly, Z15 was also detected binding to AR AF1 with KD value of 15.0 μM (Figure 4E). Not surprisingly, we didn’t find any binding affinity between AR AF1 and ENZa even at a high concentration of 200 μM (Figure 4F).

Compared to AR PROTAC ARV-110, Z15 could not only bind to AR LBD but also AR AF1 (Figure 4A-4F), thus that ARV7 positive enzalutamide resistant 22Rv1 cells proliferation inhibition potency of Z15 (IC50 = 3.63 μM) was greater than ARV-110 (IC50 = 14.85 μM) (Figure 6A), Z15 strongly decreased 22Rv1 cells colony numbers compared to both untreated group and ARV-110 treated group (Figure 6B), Z15 treatment also showed the stronger apoptosis induction activity of AR positive CRPC cell lines (LNCaP, 22RV1) than ARV-110 (Figure 6D-E). Compared to AR AF1 inhibitor UT-34 which was reported possess ARV7 degradation activity, Z15 has similar mechanism, as the AR DC50 of Z15 in LNCaP cells was 1.05 μM (Figure 2G, Figure 2-figure supplement 1H), in 22Rv1 cells, the AR DC50 was 1.16 μM, the ARV7 DC50 was 2.24 μM (Figure 2H, Figure 2-figure supplement 1I), however, UT-34 could not induce ARV7 degradation in 22Rv1 cells in our western blot analysis (Figure 4-figure supplement 2D-F), which indicated that Z15 may has stronger ARV7 degrade activity than UT-34. Based on PCa patient tumor tissues, we further cultured PCa organoids and treated organoids with 1 μM Z15 for 7 days. The results showed that Z15 significantly inhibited PCa organoid proliferation compared to the control group (Figure 6C), which showed the potential of Z15 for clinical translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have identified a good lead compound but further optimization and studies are needed to make a true impact for the filed of developing AR degraders for the treatment of castration-resistance prostate cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Seven compounds (structures shown in Figure 8-figure supplement 1) with more than 80% similarity with Z15 were finally purchased for the further bioactivity evaluation. ZL-2 and ZL-4 exhibited the most AR transcription inhibitory potency, while others also showed comparable AR inhibition activity compared to Z15 (Figure 8A-B). In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that these active molecules could reduce AR and PSA protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, most of them showed stronger AR down-regulation activity than Z15 (Figure 8C, Figure 8-figure supplement 3A-D). Together, these active Z15 analogs indicate that through the chemical structural modification of Z15, we may find out more novel selective androgen receptor degraders with better AR inhibition activity in a shorten future. Moreover, we have designed the synthesis route of Z15, and prepared more than one gram of product for the in-vivo assay. It would be conveniently to expand the compound space to optimize Z15 via the design route.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study reported identification of a novel selective androgen receptor degrader molecule (SERD), which the authors named Z15.

The most interesting properties for Z15 are that Z15 could inhibit both FL-AR and AR-V7, as well as its degradation potency for both FL-AR and AR-V7. Based on our data presented in the revised manuscript, there are some advantages of Z15 compared to current reported AR degraders. Compared to AR PROTAC ARV-110, Z15 could not only bind to AR LBD but also AR AF1 (Figure 4A-F), thus that ARV7 positive enzalutamide resistant 22Rv1 cells proliferation inhibition potency of Z15 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.63 μM) was greater than ARV-110 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 14.85 μM) (Figure 6A), Z15 strongly decreased 22Rv1 cells colony numbers compared to both untreated group and ARV-110 treated group (Figure 6B), Z15 treatment also showed the stronger apoptosis induction activity of AR positive CRPC cell lines (LNCaP, 22RV1) than ARV-110 (Figure 6D-E). Compared to AR AF1 inhibitor UT-34 which was reported possess ARV7 degradation activity, Z15 has similar mechanism, as the AR DC50 of Z15 in LNCaP cells was 1.05 μM (Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1H), in 22Rv1 cells, the AR DC50 was 1.16 μM, the ARV7 DC50 was 2.24 μM (Figure 2H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1I), however, UT-34 could not induce ARV7 degradation in 22Rv1 cells in our western blot analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), which indicated that Z15 may has stronger ARV7 degrade activity than UT-34. Based on PCa patient tumor tissues, we further cultured PCa organoids and treated organoids with 1 μM Z15 for 7 days. The results showed that Z15 significantly inhibited PCa organoid proliferation compared to the control group (Figure 6C), which showed the potential of Z15 for clinical translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some specific deficiencies that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Since Z15 induces AR degradation after 12 h treatment time, the authors should rule out that induced AR degradation is specific. It is possible that the levels of other proteins may also be reduced and reduction of AR protein is one of many mechanisms for the cell growth inhibition of Z15;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To verify the specificity of Z15 downregulated AR protein levels, we chose 3 AR pathway related but independent proteins GR, HSP90 (AR chaperonin) and cyclin-dependent kinases 7 (CDK7) as controls. Western blot analysis indicated that Z15 have no influence on GR, HSP90 and CDK7 protein levels in 22Rv1 cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While Z15 binds to AR LBD with a Kd value of 21 uM, this level of binding could be an artifact, not necessarily a real binding. Therefore, the binding assay needs to be further optimized;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. According to the manual of ForteBio Octet RED96 instrument (ForteBio, Inc, CA, USA), the ForteBio Octet detected protein-small molecule (MW &lt; 2 kDa) general affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) is about 10<sup>-4</sup> – 10<sup>-7</sup> M, thus, we think that the ForteBio Octet detected binding affinity between Z15 and AR LBD with a K<sub>D</sub> Value of 21 μM is generally convincing. Moreover, the competitive AR LBD binding assay was performed to demonstrate the direct interaction between Z15 and AR LBD. Synthetic androgen R1881 displayed strong binding potency to AR with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.30 nM, which indicated this assay system's feasibility. In line with the BLI assay consequence, Z15 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 45.32 nM) still exhibited similar AR binding affinity to ENZa (IC<sub>50</sub> = 78.95 nM) (Figure 4C). Besides, our fluorescence polarization (FP) assay also demonstrated Z15 could compete with androgen binding to AR LBD (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). These data suggested that Z15 could antagonize AR by targeting the ligand binding domain directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Z15 induces degradation of AR in cells and effectively inhibits tumor growth in the 22RV1 xenograft model in mice, AR degradation in tumor tissues needs to be demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. We have repeated the in vivo assay and detected similar tumor growth inhibition activity of Z15, also, AR and PSA protein levels in tumor tissues were detected by Western blot, the results indicated that the tumor AR, ARV7 and PSA protein levels were significantly declined in both 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg Z15 dose treated group (Figure 7D, Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-C).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I thank the authors for their continued work and find the revised manuscript to be much improved. The work was particularly strengthened by the data showing binding of Z15 to both the AR ligand binding domain and the transactivation domain – which makes their other data make much more sense.</p><p>I have one significant area where I suggest further improvement. In lines 226-244, the authors describe the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line as castration resistant. I and most investigators generally consider LNCaP cells to be castration sensitive. Conversely, the sub-line of LNCaP, C42B, is generally considered to be castration resistant but retains expression of the androgen receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this recommendation. LNCaP should exactly be a castration sensitive cell line. As we have some difficulties in purchasing or asking C4-2B cells from ATCC or other labs, we chose VCaP cells for further investigation which are also generally considered to be castration resistant but retains expression of the androgen receptor. As a result of MTT assay, the proliferation of VCaP cells was significantly inhibited by Z15 in a dose-dependent manner, Z15 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.37 μM) showed comparable proliferation inhibition potency with positive control ARV-110 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.86 μM) in VCaP cells (Figure 6A). What’s more, Z15 treatment also promoted the apoptosis of VCaP cells (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have performed additional experiments to address concerns raised in the previous review. Despite their great efforts, the following points are still not being addressed.</p><p>1. While it is clear that Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7, the proposed biochemical mechanism of action is not convincing, The main issue is that Z15 binds to AR LBD with Kd = 21 μm and to AR AF1 domain with Kd = 15 uM, it has a biological activity at sub-μM ranges, much stronger than its direct binding to AR LBD and AR AF1. Based upon its chemical structure, Z15 should have a high plasma protein binding and would require higher concentrations in cells to achieve its biological activity if the proposed direct binding, followed by induced degradation is true. Therefore, it is very likely that Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 through a different mechanism, other than those proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this recommendation.

While Z15 reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 proteins in cells and in tumor tissues, it is still unclear if Z15 also reduces the levels of many other proteins in cells and in tumor tissues. The authors have examined three other proteins in the revision and showed that Z15 does not reduce these other three proteins. However, in order to be certain that Z15 specifically reduces the levels of wild-type AR and ARV7 proteins in cells, a more global proteomic analysis would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. To analysis whether Z15 downregulate AR and ARV7 through directly binding to AR, we performed 4 assays to investigate this problem.</p><p>1) The competitive AR binding assay was performed to demonstrate the direct interaction between Z15 and AR LBD, whereby compounds in competition with the radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H] DHT in cytosolic lysates from LNCaP cells were measured. Synthetic androgen R1881 displayed strong binding potency to AR with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.30 nM, which indicated the feasibility of this assay system. Z15 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 45.32 nM) exhibited similar AR binding affinity to ENZa (IC<sub>50</sub> = 78.95 nM) (Figure 4C). Besides, our fluorescence polarization assay also demonstrated Z15 could compete with androgen binding to AR LBD (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2) In this revised version, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay to detect binding affinity between Z15 and AR AF1, the results showed that the KD value was 0.93 μM (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This KD value was more reasonable, as the ARV7 DC<sub>50</sub> of Z15 was about 2.24 μM.</p><p>3) The KD value detected by our BLI assay were much higher, which Z15 binds to AR LBD with Kd = 21 µM and to AR AF1 domain with Kd = 15 µM. However, the KD value between Z15 and AR LBD or Z15 and AR AF1 were comparable to the KD value between positive control ENZa for AR LBD or UT-34 for AR AF1(Figure 4A-B, D-F). We also consulted the engineer of Sartorius Group (instrument supplier) about this problem, we known that ForteBio Octet RED96 (our BLI analysis instrument) is more suitable for protein-protein interaction analysis, the protein-compound analysis by this instrument may less sensitive, so, positive control is very important. This could partially explain why the biological activity at sub-μM ranges of Z15, much stronger than its direct binding to AR LBD and AR AF1.</p><p>4) We performed 4D-lable free proteomics analysis, KEGG analysis proved that Z15 and AR LBD directly binding PROTAC molecule ARV-110 had similar influence on functional pathways of LNCaP cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-D), which indicated that Z15 reduces AR protein levels unlikely through other pathways. However, we also found Z15 treated group showed more stronger inhibition activity of lipid metabolism related proteins and pathways compared to ARV-110 group. We reasoned this phenomenon partially induced by the down regulation of SREBF1 which is an AR downstream regulate protein.</p><p>Therefore, these results trend to support that Z15 downregulate AR and ARV7 through directly binding to AR LBD and AR AF1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please see the comments of reviewer #3 below.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have performed several experiments to confirm the direct binding of Z15 to AR. These new experiments included measuring the binding of Z15 to proteins from cytosolic lysates of LNCaP cells by competing with radio-labeled DHT and the surface plasmon resonance assay, which provide additional evidence that Z15 binds to AR. In addition, the authors have performed global proteomics experiments to show that AR, as well as several AR-regulated gene products, were down-regulated. Although it is still very likely Z15 has a complex cellular mechanism of action, the proposed mechanism action by the authors (i.e. direct binding to AR and induced degradation of AR and ARV7) is responsible in part for the anti-tumor activity of Z15 in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. It is recommended that the authors make the following revisions before the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1. Use the binding from the surface plasmon resonance assay as the primary biochemical evidence that Z15 binds to AR, due to the limitations of the BLI assay as the authors indicated in their letter.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this kind comment. We have redrawn Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2, the AR competitive binding assay result was used as primary biochemical evidence that Z15 binds to AR LBD (Figure 4A), the surface plasmon resonance assay result was used as primary biochemical evidence that Z15 binds to AR AF1 (Figure 4C). The BLI assay results were mainly shown in supplementary materials (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide a Table for all those proteins down-regulated by ARV-110 and Z15 and compare those proteins commonly down-regulated by both compounds, as well as additional proteins, which are differentially regulated by ARV-110 and Z15.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. Supplementary file 1d and Supplementary file 1e were re-arrangement to list all those proteins down-regulated by ARV-110 and Z15. The proteomic data reveals that there are 19 proteins commonly down-regulated by both ARV-110 and Z15, these proteins account for 55.9% (19 among 34) in ARV-110 down-regulated proteins (Supplementary file 1d) and 27.5% (19 among 69) in Z15 down-regulated proteins (Supplementary file 1e). We think these two re-arrangement tables showed ARV-110 and Z15 down-regulation proteins situation more clearly to the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The proteomic data further showed that while AR is obviously the protein most profoundly reduced by ARV-110, AR is only among those proteins reduced by Z15, suggesting that Z15 is a much less specific degrader of AR, as compared to ARV-110. The authors should add discussions to acknowledge that while down-regulation of AR and ARV7 appears to be a major mechanism for the antitumor activity of Z15, Z15 may have other mechanisms of action which contribute to its anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion, this suggestion combined with the previous recommendation about the mechanisms of action of Z15 gives us many inspirations, and we are very grateful for this. In the revised manuscript, we discussed that Z15 may have other mechanisms of action which contribute to its anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. It is described as follows:</p><p>“However, we notice that the AR degradation potency of Z15 is not as stronger as AR-targeted PROTAC molecule ARV-110, suggesting that Z15 is a less specific AR degrader compared to ARV-110. We acknowledge that while Z15 suppresses CRPC progress mainly through targeting AR and ARV7, Z15 may have other mechanisms of action which contribute to its anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, Z15 is a novel selective AR and ARV7 degrader that warrants further structure optimization and anti-CRPC mechanisms investigation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
