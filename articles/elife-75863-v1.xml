higher-order structures. While its importance has already been confirmed in several intracellular processes of different organs, very little is known about its role in skeletal muscle. Here, using Septin7 conditional knockdown (KD) mouse model, the C2C12 cell line, and enzymatically isolated adult muscle fibers, the organization and localization of septin filaments are revealed, and an ontogenesis-dependent expression of Septin7 is demonstrated. KD mice displayed a characteristic hunchback phenotype with skeletal deformities, reduction in in vivo and in vitro force generation, and disorganized mitochondrial networks. Furthermore, knockout of Septin7 in C2C12 cells resulted in complete loss of cell division while KD cells provided evidence that Septin7 is essential for proper myotube differentiation. These and the transient increase in Septin7 expression following muscle injury suggest that it may be involved in muscle regeneration and development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>septins</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TKP2020-NKA-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-4.1.1-TKP2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NKFIH K-137600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.3-15-2016-00020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Septin7 is described as a novel component of skeletal muscle cytoskeleton with essential roles in muscle development and the proper organization of the myofilaments and the mitochondrial network while its absence leeds to reduced force and skeletal deformities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper contractile activation of the striated muscle requires precisely orchestrated machinery consisting of the T-tubule with the embedded dihydropyridine receptor, the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in its membrane, and mitochondria. Furthermore, appropriate localization of ion channels and proteins contributing to calcium homeostasis and downstream signaling pathways requires a precisely organized structure and coordinated function of the cytoskeletal networks providing the connection between intracellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria) within the sarcomere, and the linkage between sarcomeres and surface membrane. Recent studies have suggested a role of septins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gönczi et al., 2021</xref>) in these key cellular processes in cardiac and skeletal muscle function as well. However, muscle-specific function of the different septin isoforms has not yet been completely explored.</p><p>Septins have been first described as regulators of cytokinesis and cell polarity in yeast, and since their discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartwell, 1971</xref>) their expression has been demonstrated in many other organisms, including mice and humans. Numerous studies imply the important role of septins in several intracellular processes as molecular scaffolds and diffusion barriers that control localization of membrane proteins. They are also involved in host–pathogen interactions during infections, in cell mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 2014</xref>), endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall and Russell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barve et al., 2018</xref>), determining cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mostowy et al., 2011</xref>), and even in mechano-transductional pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caudron and Barral, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gladfelter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam and Calvo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>). Since septins interact with actin, microtubules, and membrane structures of cells and assemble into filaments, they became generally accepted as the fourth cytoskeletal component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of these interactions is still the focus of intense investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiliotis and McMurray, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spiliotis and Nakos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Woods and Gladfelter, 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is already known that these 30–65 kDa highly conserved GTP-binding proteins form hetero-oligomeric complexes, and besides filaments, they polymerize into higher-order structures, sheets, rings, and cage-like formations contributing to biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weirich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>). The number of septin isoforms encoded is extremely variable among different organisms. In humans, 13 different isoforms were identified, which were classified into four groups (SEPTIN 2, 3, 6, and 7) on the basis of sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2005</xref>), with a lone presence of Septin7 in its group. Their ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connolly et al., 2011</xref>) and/or tissue-specific expression influences the localization and function of cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caudron and Barral, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spiliotis and Nelson, 2006</xref>). The altered expression of septins has been linked to neurodegenerative or excretory system diseases, cardiovascular failures, immunological problems, or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Septin filaments are predominantly made up of hexamers and octamers of septins belonging to three or all four of homology groups, according to the cell type. All of these filaments include the Septin7, which indicates the pivotal role of this ubiquitous protein in the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeRose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soroor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendonça et al., 2021</xref>). The knockout of Septin7 is embryonic lethal. Its absence resulted in the loss of other septin proteins in the oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kinoshita et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, the role of Septin7 has been demonstrated in nervous and reproductive systems and its diverse functions in various neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus), in the development of cancer (glioma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma). For a comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2018</xref>. Furthermore, Septin7 has been proposed as a novel regulator of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deb and Hasan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deb et al., 2016</xref>). It has been revealed to downregulate the expression of the Orai and inositol-trisphosphate-receptor 3 (IP3R), subsequently affecting the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by which it can cause deficient flight ability in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tada et al., 2007</xref>). Knockdown of Septin7 resulted in myofibrillar disorganization and functionally reduced ventricular contractility and cardiac output in <italic>Zebrafish</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dash et al., 2017</xref>), caused an alteration of myosin heavy-chain localization and disorganization of muscle fibers in somatic muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dash et al., 2017</xref>), and significantly affected cytoskeleton dynamics in the ophthalmic artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perumal et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, apart from these observations, no data is available on the function of Septin7 in striated skeletal muscle.</p><p>Here, we give evidence on the crucial role of Septin7 in skeletal muscle physiology using the C2C12 cell line and a Septin7 conditional knockdown mouse model established in our laboratory. We demonstrate an ontogenesis-dependent expression of Septin7, its effect on the phenotype and the in vivo and in vitro force generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Septin7 is essential in proper muscle development and myotube differentiation and demonstrate its presumed contribution to muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Skeletal muscle fibers express different septin isoforms</title><p>mRNA expression of representative members from all homology groups of septins has been detected in total lysates of human skeletal muscle by RT-PCR reactions on <italic>m. quadriceps femoris</italic> from amputated limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Varying expression of Septin7 has also been observed at the protein level during muscle development. Septin7 protein expression declined gradually with age, as evidenced by comparing muscle samples from 4-week-old and 4-month-old mice to newborns. On the other hand, <italic>Septin7</italic> expression seems to be independent of muscle type since signals were similar in different types of muscles (<italic>m. tibialis anterior</italic> – TA, <italic>m. extensor digitorum longus –</italic> EDL, and <italic>m. soleus</italic> – Sol) at the selected time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This ontogenesis-dependent decline in the Septin7 protein expression is consistent with our results at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Septin7 was visualized by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and merged images were generated with α-actinin and RyR1 to determine the relative localization of Septin7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

When bred with mice containing a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked sequence of exon 4 encoding the GTP-binding P-loop of <italic>Septin7</italic> in the mouse genome, Cre-mediated recombination will catalyze exon 4-excision, resulting in an additional frame shift mutation downstream to this exon. Cre+ hemizygous mice following 3 months of tamoxifen feeding have been selected for the in vivo and in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To estimate muscle-specific downregulation of Septin7 protein expression, total lysates of <italic>m. quadriceps femoris</italic> and <italic>m. pectoralis</italic> were examined.

In addition, cell proliferation was stopped, providing an additional clue for the importance of Septin7 in cell division. Because cell proliferation was too severely affected under this condition, the milder, partial knockdown approach using shRNA was applied to assess the impact of Septin7 on myoblast proliferation and myotube formation.

These data express quantitatively the conspicuous visual observations, that is, in S7-KD cultures a specific population of cells was present, which were large in size and lost their processes, resulting in a more rounded shape. As revealed by the individual data points presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, a portion of KD cells have approximately the same size as the Scr ones; however, a large number of cells in KD cultures have significantly increased area.

Based on their mRNA expression profile in mouse and human skeletal muscle samples, the presence of at least one essential member of each homology group indicates the possibility of build-up of the previously described hetero-oligomeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeRose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soroor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendonça et al., 2021</xref>). These results predict the presence of a higher-order oligomeric structure of septins, though further structural investigations are needed.</p><p>Septin7 showed a differential, declining expression with age both in fast and slow twitch skeletal muscles, which may emphasize its significance in muscle development. In line with the observation, that genetic deletion of <italic>Septin7</italic>, <italic>Septin9</italic>, or <italic>Septin11</italic> resulted in embryonic lethality, reflecting their essential role in early, intrauterine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Füchtbauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röseler et al., 2011</xref>). Considering that Septin7 is the only member of the SEPTIN7 homology group, its loss is not expected to be compensated for in the oligomers. Furthermore, the conditional Septin7 KD (Cre+) mice showed altered phenotype and produced decreased muscle force. This raises two questions: (1) are septins essential in the early development of skeletal muscle, and (2) do they lose their significance with aging?</p><p>Connection between septins and other cytoskeletal proteins has a prominent role in the conversion of mechanical inputs into biochemical signals. Septins have been shown to co-localize with actin filaments within stress fibers associated with focal adhesion complexes, as well as perinuclear actin. Septins participate in mechano-transduction by promoting the formation of contractile actomyosin networks, and the recruitment of myosin to actin in cancer-associated fibroblasts, in mammalian epithelial cells, and mouse cardiac epithelial cells (see the review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam and Calvo, 2019</xref>). In accordance with the above, we have demonstrated the co-localization of Septin7 and actin filaments in control C2C12 cells, and furthermore, without Septin7 these cells were not able to proliferate. Knocking down Septin7 in C2C12 cells resulted in altered filament structure, cell size, and shape as well. This is in line with the observation that during embryogenesis interaction of Septin-2, 6, 7, and 9 with the cytosolic elements has an essential role in the regulation of cardiac functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Suppression of septin expression in skeletal muscle results in severe skeletal deformities</title><p>Although septins were considered as key players of cell division based on their evolutionary conserved function in cytokinesis, they are now associated with a variety of other processes. Downregulation of the ubiquitous Septin7 has been implicated in several pathological events, including abnormal morphology and immature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2010</xref>); altered glucose uptake in the insulin-sensitive podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wasik et al., 2012</xref>); inefficient microvascular angiogenesis, actomyosin organizations, and directional migration in primary mouse cardiac endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).

Unfortunately, the earliest possible application of tamoxifen, that is, administering it to pregnant Cre- females, resulted in stillborn offspring. Short applications, 1 month or less, in young or adult animals resulted in only a minor (&lt;20%) reduction in Septin7 expression with inconclusive modifications in muscle function. These trials led us to use longer (3-month-long, as described) tamoxifen treatment, which gave appreciable (~50%) reduction at the protein level and definite changes in function. As we were concerned whether such long tamoxifen treatment might have effects on its own, tamoxifen-treated littermate Cre- mice were also compared to nontreated control animals. These experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) confirmed that it was not tamoxifen feeding alone rather the consequent reduction in Septin7 expression that was responsible for the alterations seen in Cre+ mice.</p><p>In Septin7-modified Cre+ mice, generated in our laboratory, spinal structural deformity, similar to the human Scheuermann’s kyphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sardar et al., 2019</xref>) affecting the thoracic or thoracolumbar spine, was observed. The muscle atrophy and decreased muscle tone observed in Cre+ animals are assumed to be responsible for this vertebral defect since tamoxifen treatment alone did not cause similar malformation. In itself, tamoxifen had no effect on muscle structure or body weight. It should be noted, however, that such effects of tamoxifen were administered to mice with impaired muscle function, that is, to mdx mice (mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorchies et al., 2013</xref>), to FKRPP448L mutant mice with dystroglycanopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), and to Mtm1 knockout mice (murine model of myotubular myopathy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maani et al., 2018</xref>).

This correlates with the observation that Septin7 determines cell morphology in different cell types, like dorsal root ganglia neurons in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boubakar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageta-Ishihara et al., 2013</xref>), or in mouse primary fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, involvement of Septin7 as a target gene of miR-127-3p has been revealed in the regulation of C2C12 proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These observations, together with our data, suggest that cytoskeletal septin organization has a pivotal role in determining cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, altered cell morphology and filopodia formation in KD cultures also imply the potential role of Septin7 in myoblast migration. Some publications already discussed that modifying the expression of specific septin isoforms (in some cases Septin7) alters the migration of different eukaryotic cell types, like microvascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), human epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2019</xref>), neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boubakar et al., 2017</xref>), and human breast cancer or lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elkhadragy et al., 2020</xref>).

This in turn indicated, based on previous experiments on satellite cells (see the review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Rudnicki, 2011</xref>), that it could play an important role in muscle regeneration, too. Indeed, we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>) that Septin7 expression is increased following a mild muscle injury induced by the injection of BaCl<sub>2</sub>. The extent of regeneration following the injection was monitored by detecting the presence of Pax7 in satellite cells, and a clear correlation was seen in the time course of the expression pattern of the two molecules. In line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>), the most intense regeneration, and thus the increase in the expression of both Pax7 and Septin7, was seen a few days after the injury, while after 2 weeks regeneration was essentially complete and the expression of the two molecules returned to baseline. As the appearances of Pax7 as well as that of centrally located nuclei are accepted markers of muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazzotti and Coletti, 2016</xref>), we concluded that the increased expression of Septin7 could also be an essential component of the regeneration process. Although these findings set the basis for the involvement of septin filaments in muscle repair, further experiments are needed to elucidate their exact role in the process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Mice hemizygous for this HSA-Cre transgene are viable, fertile, normal in size, and do not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. These HSA-Cre transgenic mice have the <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase gene driven by the human alpha-skeletal actin (<italic>ACTA1</italic>) promoter. Cre activity is restricted to adult striated muscle fibers. The HSA-MerCreMer (<italic>HSA-MCM</italic>) construct encodes a Cre recombinase (Cre) and contains a mutant estrogen ligand-binding domain (ERT2) that requires the presence of tamoxifen for activity as well. When bred with mice containing a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked sequence of interest, Cre-mediated recombination will result in striated muscle-specific deletion of the flanked genome. Genomic DNA was isolated from finger biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zangala, 2007</xref>) and screened for the presence of the <italic>HSA-MCM</italic> transgene by PCR using the appropriate primers spanned the C-terminus MerCre junction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and produced a 717 bp product.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title><italic>Septin7</italic> genotyping and detection of exon 4 deletion</title><p>C57BL/6J <italic>Septin7<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (SS00) mice were obtained from Prof. Dr. Matthias Gaestel, Institute of Physiological Chemistry Hannover Medical School. These mice were crossed with B6.Cg-Tg(<italic>ACTA1</italic>-cre)79Jme/J mice (ssC0). The SsC0 offspring were back crossed with SS00 mice.

Based on the presence of specific 151 and 197 bp bands, the wild-type C57BL/6J (BL6 in the following) and floxed mice could be identified, while the deletion of exon 4 proved to be partially achieved as represented by 256 bp bands. According to the gene structure, exon 4 (107 bp, flox region is about 0.5 kb) can be conditionally removed, which results in a non-sense-mediated decay.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse-immortalized C2C12 myoblast cell line was cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Biosera, Nuaille, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco), and 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Biosera). Medium was changed every other day and cells were subcultured at 80–90% confluence. Myoblast fusion and generation of differentiated myotubes were induced by exchanging the culture media to DMEM containing 2% horse serum (Gibco) approximately at 90% confluence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CRISPR-Cas9</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and HDR plasmid constructs specific to mouse <italic>Septin7</italic>, targeting three different places in the coding sequence (in exon# 3, 4, and 5), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfection of the C2C12 cells with KO and HDR plasmids was carried out in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, OR) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). 48 hr after transfection, puromycin selection was applied for 5 days, then single cells were sorted according to expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) from the KO and HDR vectors, respectively, using FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Single cells were kept in normal culturing media until cell growth was observed in the appropriate cultures.

For controls, a noneffective scrambled shRNA cassette vector was employed (Scr). 3 hr after transfection, the medium was replaced by complete DMEM, cells were allowed to recover and synthesize the coded shRNA for 48 hr. Puromycin (2 µg/ml)-containing medium was applied to select cells containing the specific shRNA sequences until well-defined cell clones were visible within the culture plates. Individual clones were then separated and cultured further to analyze the effective gene silencing by Western blot. Appropriate clones presenting significant Septin7 expression change were tested throughout increasing passage numbers, and continuously detectable lower Septin7 expression was required to use the cell clone for further investigation (S7-KD cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo experiments</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>In vivo CT imaging</title><p>For the in vivo imaging, mice were anesthetized by 3% isoflurane (Forane) with a dedicated small animal anesthesia device.

Briefly, when the animals reliably grasped the bar of the grip test meter, they were then gently pulled away from the device. The maximal force before the animal released the bar was digitized at 2 kHz and stored by an online connected computer. The test was repeated 10–15 times to obtain a single data point. Measurements for the trained groups were always carried out before the 14 days running regime. For all other animal groups, the grip test was measured on the day when the animals were sacrificed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro experiments</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Measurement of muscle force</title><p>Muscle contractions were measured as described in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodnár et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, fast and slow twitch muscles, <italic>m. extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL) and <italic>m. soleus</italic> (Sol), were removed and placed horizontally in an experimental chamber continuously superfused (10 ml/min) with Krebs’ solution (containing in mM: 135 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose , 10 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; pH 7.2; room temperature), equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> plus 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. One end of the muscle was attached to a rod while the other to a capacitive mechano-electric force transducer (Experimetria, Budapest, Hungary). Two platinum electrodes placed adjacent to the muscle were used to deliver short, supramaximal pulses of 2 ms in duration to elicit single twitches. Force responses were digitized at 2 kHz using TL-1 DMA interface and stored with Axotape software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Muscles were then stretched by adjusting the position of the transducer to a length that produced the maximal force response and allowed to equilibrate for 6 min.</p><p>Single pulses at 0.5 Hz were used to elicit single twitches. At least 10 twitches were measured under these conditions from every muscle. The individual force transients within such a train varied by less than 3% in amplitude, thus the mean of the amplitude of all transients was used to characterize the given muscle. To elicit a tetanus, single pulses were applied with a frequency of 200 Hz for 200 ms (EDL) or 100 Hz for 500 ms (Sol). Duration of individual twitches and tetani was determined by calculating the time between the onset of the transient and the relaxation to 10% of maximal force.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Isolation of single skeletal muscle fibers</title><p>Single muscle fibers from FDB were enzymatically dissociated in minimal essential media containing 0.2% type I collagenase (Sigma) at 37°C for 30–40 min depending on the muscle weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szentesi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fodor et al., 2008</xref>).

After the fixation method 0.1 M glycine in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was used to neutralize excess formaldehyde. Fibers were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X (TritonX-100, Sigma) for 10 min and blocked with a serum-free protein blocking solution (Dako, Los Altos, CA) for 30 min. Slides were rinsed three times with PBST solution. Primary antibodies (anti-RyR1, anti-Septin7, and skeletal muscle-specific anti-α-actinin, see ‘Key resources table’) diluted in blocking solution were added to the fibers and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber. Samples were washed three times with PBST and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing three times, a drop of mounting medium was added to each slide (Mowiol 4-88, Sigma) and coverslips placed on the mounting medium. Images from Alexa Fluor 488, TRITC, and DAPI-labeled samples were acquired with an AiryScan 880 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany) equipped with a ×20 air and a ×40 oil objective. Excitation at 488, 543, and 405 nm wavelengths was used to detect fluorescence of the aforementioned secondary antibodies, respectively, while emission collected above 550 nm with a long-pass filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Muscle regeneration</title><p>Skeletal muscle injury was accomplished by BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection. 20 µl of 1.2% BaCl<sub>2</sub> (dissolved in physiological saline) was injected to the left <italic>m. tibialis anterior</italic> muscle (TA) of BL6 mice (right <italic>m. tibialis anterior</italic> muscle was nontreated control).

Upper, aqueous phase of samples was incubated in 500 µl (cultures) or 750 µl (tissues) of RNase-free isopropanol at room temperature for 10 min, then total RNA was harvested in RNase-free water and stored at –80°C. The assay mixture (20 μl) for reverse transcriptase reaction (Omniscript, QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) contained 1 µg RNA, 0.25 μl RNase inhibitor, 0.25 μl oligo (dT), 2 μl dNTP (200 μM), 1 μl high-affinity RT in 10× RT buffer. Amplifications of specific cDNA sequences were carried out using specific primer pairs that were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA) based on mouse and human nucleotide sequences published in GenBank and purchased from Bio Basic (Toronto, Canada). The specificity of custom-designed primer pairs was confirmed in silico by using the Primer-BLAST service of NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/</ext-link>). The sequences of primer pairs, annealing temperatures for each specific primer pair, and expected amplimer size for each polymerase chain reaction are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. Amplifications were performed in a programmable thermal cycler (Labnet MultiGene 96-well Gradient Thermal Cycler; Labnet International, Edison, NJ) with the following settings: initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles (denaturation at 94°C, 30 s; annealing at optimized temperatures for each primer pair for 30 s – see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; extension at 72°C, for 60 s) and then final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were mixed with EZ-Vision Dye 6X loading buffer, and DNA bands were visualized following an electrophoresis in 1.2%–2.5% agarose gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantitative PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA samples originating from different skeletal muscles (<italic>m. tibialis anterior</italic>, <italic>m. pectoralis,</italic> and <italic>m. quadriceps</italic>) of mice were subjected to DNase treatment and reverse transcription (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Appropriate cDNA samples were used for quantitative PCR reaction (LightCycler 480, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using either SYBRGreen mix (PCR Biosystems, Oxford, UK) and specific primer pairs for the detection of mitochondrial (<italic>16S RNA</italic>) and nuclear (<italic>Hexokinase</italic>) RNA, or high-specificity TaqMan assays (Mm00550197_m1) against mouse <italic>Septin7</italic> (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All qPCR reactions were conducted in triplicates. C<sub>p</sub> values were determined with the Light Cycler 480 SW 1.5.0 software (Roche). Relative copy numbers were calculated via the ∆C<sub>p</sub> method. The ratios of the values of the examined and normalization genes gave the relative expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total cell lysates and skeletal muscle tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM EGTA, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail [Sigma, St. Louis, USA]) with HT Mini homogenizer (OPS Diagnostics). Fivefold concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% bromophenol blue dissolved in 10% SDS, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) was added to total lysates to adjust equal protein concentration of samples and boiled for 5 min at 90°C. 8 or 10 μg of total protein (for Septin7 and Pax7, respectively) were loaded to each lane, and separated in 7.5% SDS–polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% non-fat milk dissolved in PBS, then membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (see ‘Key resources table’). After washing for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 1% Tween-20 (PBST), membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (see ‘Key resources table’). Membranes were developed and signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Optical density of signals was measured with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and results were normalized to the optical density of control tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cells and fluorescent labeling of mitochondria</title><p>Mitochondria of cultured cells were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (0.5 µM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in which living cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in CO<sub>2</sub>-thermostated environment. MitoTracker probes passively diffuse across the plasma membrane and accumulate in active mitochondria. Once their mitochondria are labeled, the cells can be treated with an aldehyde-based fixative to allow further processing of the sample. To perform immunocytochemistry, cell cultures were fixed immediately with 4% PFA for 15 min. After the fixation method, 0.1 M glycine in PBS was used to neutralize excess formaldehyde. Fibers were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X (TritonX-100, Sigma) for 10 min and blocked with a serum-free protein blocking solution (Dako) for 30 min. Slides were rinsed three times with PBST solution. Primary Septin7 antibody was diluted in blocking solution, added to the samples, and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber. On the next day, samples were washed three times with PBST and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies and TRITC-phalloidin or FITC-phalloidin (1:1000) for 1 hr at room temperature. After three times washing, a drop of mounting medium was added to each slide. Confocal images were acquired with an AiryScan laser scanning confocal microscope as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Determination of cellular proliferation</title><p>The degree of cellular growth (reflecting proliferation) was determined with CyQUANT NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells (2500 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well black plates with clear bottoms (Greiner Bi-One, Mosonmagyaróvár, Hungary) for 48 hr. HBSS buffer was prepared (Component C) with deionized water, then one time diluted (1×) dye binding solution was added to the CyQUANT NF dye reagent (Component A). Growth medium was exchanged to 100 μl of 1× dye binding solution. Microplate was covered and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and fluorescence was measured at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths using FlexStation 3 multimode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Relative fluorescence values were expressed as percentage of control regarded as 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fusion index</title><p>Progress of myotube differentiation was quantified using immunocytochemistry in C2C12 cells. Cells were plated into glass coverslips, and in each day of differentiation process samples were fixed in 4% (PFA) solution and subjected to a desmin-specific immunolabeling and DAPI staining. Confocal images were taken from the appropriate samples. Fusion index was calculated as the ratio of the nuclei number in myocytes with two or more nuclei versus the total number of nuclei within the visual fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-17-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Pooled data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

If Tamoxifen treatment was started for Cre- pregnant mice, the offsprings were born still. If Tamoxifen treatment was applied for adult animals (where Septin7 expression is reduced as compared to neonatal/young mice) only minor knock-down (less than 20%) could be achieved. These long trials, on the one hand, led us to use the protocol presented in the MS where an approximately 50% reduction in expression could be demonstrated. These findings, on the other hand, are indicative, together with the experiments on cultured cells, that the role of Septin7 is most prominent during muscle development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To conclude that Septin-7 plays an important causative role in muscle regeneration following injury, the injury response should be carefully evaluated with and without Septin-7 deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised by the Reviewers that a clear causative role of Septin7 in muscle regeneration would require a detailed description of the process in animals with reduced expression of the protein. This in-depth analysis is, in our opinion, beyond the scope of the current study. A thorough analysis with the expression patterns of the key transcription factors and regulatory proteins merits an independent study. Nevertheless, in our manuscript we give evidence that the expression of Septin7 is upregulated (as normalized to α-actinin) following muscle injury clearly indicating that this response is not simply due to the production of new fibers to replace those that were damaged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several areas of interest (for example muscle fiber subcellular morphology/mitochondrial phenotypes) require additional quantification and/or more sophisticated analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>A more detailed analysis of subcellular morphology including that of mitochondria has been carried out.

Septin7 protein expression was determined in skeletal muscle samples from mice at different developmental stages. As presented in Figure. 1C we observed a decrease in Septin7 protein expression from newborn to adult stages. The expression profile of Septin7 was also investigated in samples from 2, 4, 6, 9, and 18-month-old mice. Here, we observed a significant decrease in Septin7 protein expression in samples isolated from mice of 4, 6, 9, and 18 months of age (58±8; 48±9; 66±16; 54±9% relative to the 2-month-old muscles, respectively), however there were no considerable changes between samples after 4 months of age.</p><p>In order to generate skeletal muscle specific, conditional Septin7 knockdown animals, we applied Tamoxifen treatment at different developmental stages in our preliminary studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) . When Cre- pregnant females were fed with Tamoxifen in the third trimester of pregnancy, it caused intrauterin lethality independent of the genotype.

3-month-old mice were treated with both intraperitoneal injections for 5 consecutive days or Tamoxifen diet for 4 weeks. Here, only a moderate deletion of the exon4 was detected in <italic>Septin7</italic> gene in Cre+ animals (data obtained from these mice are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). These findings and the observation of ontogenesis dependent expression of Septin7 indicated its significance at the early stage of development and suggested that we should modify the gene expression at earlier age. Six weeks of diet supplemented with Tamoxifen generated well detectable exon deletion in younger (1-month-old) mice. Based on these observations we decided to start the Tamoxifen-supplemented diet in younger (4-week-old) animals immediately after separation from the mother and we kept the treatment for a longer period (3 months) to be sure that exon deletion will be prominent in all Cre+ animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Examine the effect of septin-7 deletion on regeneration following muscle injury.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the concern of the Reviewer that the effect of Septin7 deletion on muscle regeneration should be investigated in more detail and that those results would further prove the role of this protein in skeletal muscle. We, therefore, already started to investigate the regeneration process in Septin7 depleted skeletal muscle. BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection was used to initiate a mild injury and the accompanying changes in morphology and the expression of different regulatory proteins were examined. We, however, believe that these experiments not only require more time despite the advances already made but are of substantial size that these data should not be included into this manuscript (which is already at its limit for space), rather they should be presented as an independent manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Provide a more robust characterization of muscle fiber morphological differences after septin-7 depletion, specifically for key components of the EC coupling machinery.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the Reviewer's suggestion about further characterization of muscle fiber morphological changes in Septin7 depleted samples, however, one needs to be aware that the extent of the decrease in Septin7 expression in the individual skeletal muscle fibers would not necessarily be equal.</p><p>Nevertheless, additional immunolabeling on isolated single fibers from FDB muscles of Cre+ and Cre- mice were conducted. We now present confocal images showing the results from actin and MYH4 (as two main contractile proteins), and L-type calcium channel-specific staining from Cre+ and Cre- samples (see the Figure 2—figure supplement 3 in the revised version) as well. Double immunolabeling was carried out alongside Septin7. We conclude from these experiments (and from the EM images presented in Figures. 4 and 5), that significant difference in the key components of skeletal muscle contractile elements and one of the main EC coupling channel proteins were not observed between the muscle fibers of the two groups.</p><p>Furthermore, intact FDB fibers were incubated with Di-8-ANEPPS dye to label the T-tubule system. As the representative images below demonstrate, we could not detect any significant alteration of T-tubules in Septin7 modified Cre+ animal samples as compared with its control Cre- counterpart. Unfortunately, for technical reasons the double labeling of T-tubule system with Di8-ANEPPS and Septin7 immunostaining was not successful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Provide a more robust characterization of the mitochondrial morphology differences after septin-7 depletion, including using orthogonal approaches to validate or extend upon the striking decrease in mitochondrial protein content.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there was a discrepancy between the representative images (Figure 5E and 5F) indicating differences in mitochondrial morphology between Cre+ and Cre- mice and the data shown in Figure 5C. We thank the Reviewer for calling our attention to this point. We reexamined the data based on the suggestions made by the Reviewer (see below) and reorganized the panels in Figure 5. Please note that the average data in the original MS were determined in transversal EM sections, while panel F of the original figure (now panel G) presents the large mitochondrial network in horizontal sections of Cre+ muscles. Also, in Figure 5G of the original manuscript (now panel I), individual measured data of total area of mitochondria within the examined visual fields represent two, well separated data sets, one of which has similar value as compared with the Cre-, while the other set represents significantly higher total area causing significantly increased median of the averaged data.</p><p>Nevertheless, as suggested, a more detailed morphological characterization of the mitochondria was carried out and thus the aspect ratio (AR) and form factor (FF) values of the mitochondria were also determined using the same transversal EM images. In Cre+ samples both parameters (AR=1.82±0.04; FF=1.53±0.03) were altered as compared with the Cre- data (AR=2.04±0.03; FF=1.49±0.02), but the difference was statistically significant only in the case of AR data (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.16, respectively). Both of the aforementioned parameters were significantly higher in Cre+ samples in the longitudinal sections.</p><p>Furthermore, changes in mitochondrial morphology following Septin7 depletion have been further investigated in cultured C2C12 cells using MitoTracker Red CMXRos staining in living cells (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2 in the revised version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be interesting for the readers some additional discussion comparing the loss of Septin-7 in aging skeletal muscle with the loss of muscle function in aging.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer's appreciation regarding our results and its importance in muscle physiology. We accept the concern of the Reviewer that the comparison of Septin7 deletion and the loss of muscle function with aging would be essential in the discussion. Accordingly, we extended the Discussion of the revised manuscript to address this.</p><p>We, however, believe that our results indicate more profound role of Septin7 in the earlier developmental phase of skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, our preliminary results suggest that cytoskeletal septins (here, Septin7 was investigated) could play an important role in muscle regeneration and in the formation of new myofibers. Further investigations are required to describe the exact mechanism behind this. In addition, we have already started experiments regarding the functional role of Septin7 in the migration of myogenic cells. These experiments are in our view, beyond the scope of the current manuscript but could be the basis of further studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Conclusive statements regarding the role of Septin 7 in muscle regeneration should be removed.
