One approach for understanding the mechanisms that promote germline specification and function has been the identification of genes whose protein products localize exclusively to the germline and for which loss-of-function mutations result in absent or non-functional germ cells and gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seydoux and Braun, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, PIE-1 is a key regulator of germline specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mello et al., 1992</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, P0, undergoes a series of asymmetric divisions that generate four somatic founder cells and the germline blastomere P4. The PIE-1 protein is maternally deposited and uniformly present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the zygote, but rapidly disappears in each somatic blastomere shortly after division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mello et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reese et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tenenhaus et al., 1998</xref>). In <italic>pie-1</italic> mutants, the germline lineage differentiates into extra intestinal cells causing an embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mello et al., 1992</xref>). PIE-1 localizes prominently in nuclei in the early P-lineage blastomeres and persists in the primordial embryonic germ cells through much of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mello et al., 1996</xref>). The presence of PIE-1 correlates with global hypo-phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (pol II) in germline blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seydoux and Dunn, 1997</xref>), and some studies suggest that PIE-1 may directly inhibit the CTD kinase to prevent transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batchelder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh and Seydoux, 2008</xref>).</p><p>PIE-1 is a member of the tandem CCCH zinc finger protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackshear et al., 2005</xref>). PIE-1 differs from most of its homologs in having a prominent nuclear localization. However, like the majority of its family members, PIE-1 also localizes in the cytoplasm where it is thought to bind and regulate the expression of germline mRNAs, including the <italic>nos-2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tenenhaus et al., 2001</xref>). Hints at the nuclear function of PIE-1 came from a yeast two-hybrid screen which identified the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein MEP-1 as a PIE-1 interacting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>). MEP-1 co-purifies with LET-418, a homolog of mammalian ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor Mi-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Zelewsky et al., 2000</xref>), and with HDA-1, a homolog of mammalian histone deacetylase HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi and Mello, 1998</xref>). Inactivation of maternal <italic>mep-1</italic> and <italic>let-418</italic> causes a striking developmental arrest of L1-stage larvae, whose somatic cells adopt germline-specific transcriptional programs, and assemble germline-specific peri-nuclear nuage-like structures called P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>). These soma-to-germline transformations depend on the trithorax-related protein MES-4 and components of a polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) (MES-2 and MES-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>), whose functions are thought to promote fertility by maintaining germline chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strome and Updike, 2015</xref>). Taken together, these previous studies on PIE-1 suggest that it functions as a master-regulator of the germline fate in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, preventing somatic differentiation, while also protecting the germline chromatin from remodeling. However, the possible biochemical mechanisms through which this small CCCH zinc finger protein exerts its dual effects on transcription and chromatin in the germline were entirely unknown.</p><p>Here, we show PIE-1 promotes the regulation of its targets at least in part through the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). By yeast two-hybrid screening, we show that PIE-1 engages the highly conserved E2 SUMO ligase UBC-9. UBC-9 enzymes catalyze the addition SUMO to lysine residues on target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capili and Lima, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson, 2004</xref>). The reversible addition of SUMO (or SUMOylation) and its removal by de-SUMOylating enzymes is thought to occur on thousands of substrate proteins with diverse functions, especially nuclear functions including DNA replication, chromatin silencing, and the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hendriks and Vertegaal, 2016</xref>). SUMOylation can have multiple effects and is not primarily associated with the turnover of its targets, but rather is often associated with changes in protein interactions. For example, SUMOylation of a protein can promote interactions with proteins that contain SUMO-interacting motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matunis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Through a series of genetic and biochemical studies, we show that the SUMO pathway promotes the activity of PIE-1 in preserving the embryonic germline. We show that PIE-1 is itself modified by SUMO. Paradoxically, PIE-1 is not SUMOylated in early embryos, but rather in adult animals where PIE-1 was not previously known to be expressed or functional. Indeed, CRISPR-mediated GFP tagging of the endogenous <italic>pie-1</italic> locus confirmed uniform nuclear expression of PIE-1 protein throughout the meiotic zone and in oocytes of adult hermaphrodites. Using whole proteome analysis for detecting SUMO-conjugated proteins, we identify the type 1 HDAC, HDA-1, as a protein modified by SUMO in a PIE-1-dependent manner. Surprisingly, whereas PIE-1 was originally thought to inhibit the MEP-1/Mi-2/HDA-1 complex in embryos, we show that in the germline PIE-1 acts in concert with the SUMO pathway to promote the association of MEP-1 with HDA-1, and to maintain the hypoacetylation of germline chromatin. Although <italic>pie-1</italic> lysine 68 mutants that prevent PIE-1 SUMOylation are viable, we show that they exhibit synthetic lethality in combination with null alleles of <italic>gei-17</italic>, a <italic>Drosophila Su(var)2–10</italic> SUMO-E3 ligase homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mohr and Boswell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ninova et al., 2020</xref>), and that double mutants exhibit potent desilencing of a piRNA Argonaute sensor. Our findings are consistent with a model in which PIE-1 engages SUMO to preserve the embryonic germline fate, and also to promote the assembly of a MEP-1/Mi-2/HDA-1 chromatin remodeling complex required for inherited Argonaute-mediated gene silencing in the adult hermaphrodite germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIE-1 is SUMOylated in adult germ cells</title><p>To explore how PIE-1 promotes germline specification, we sought to identify protein interactors. Immunoprecipitation of PIE-1 protein from embryo extracts proved to be challenging because the protein is expressed transiently in early embryos, where it is only present in early germline cells. Moreover, PIE-1 was insoluble and unstable in worm lysates preventing the analysis of PIE-1 complexes by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify PIE-1 interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). As expected, this screen identified the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein MEP-1, a known PIE-1 interactor and co-factor of the Mi-2/NuRD (nucleosome remodeling deacetylase) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Passannante et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>).

Although covalent in nature, the addition of SUMO to substrates is rapidly reversible by SUMO protease enzymes that are active under conditions typically used to prepare lysates for immunoprecipitation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Bacco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, even the preparation and centrifugation of lysates at 4°C followed by reconstitution in IP buffer with no other incubation resulted in the complete removal of SUMO from its target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To identify SUMO-conjugated proteins, we inserted a poly-histidine epitope into the endogenous <italic>smo-1</italic> gene, and then used nickel (Ni) affinity chromatography under stringent denaturing conditions to enrich SUMOylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tatham et al., 2009</xref>). Eluates from Ni-affinity chromatography were then analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref> and see below).</p><p>In principle, it is possible to directly detect SUMOylated peptides by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Impens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knuesel et al., 2005</xref>). To create a cleavage signature suitable for high-throughput identification of modified peptide fragments, leucine 88 of SUMO must be substituted with lysine. Unfortunately, editing the endogenous <italic>smo-1</italic> locus to encode the L88K mutation caused a lethal <italic>smo-1</italic> phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>Previous proteomic analyses of SUMOylated worm proteins have relied on <italic>smo-1</italic> transgenes that encode HIS-tagged SUMO fused to the FLAG epitope or to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drabikowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaminsky et al., 2009</xref>). Inserting in-frame FLAG or mCherry sequences into the endogenous <italic>smo-1</italic> locus caused pronounced hypomorphic <italic>smo-1</italic> phenotypes (data not shown). We therefore inserted hexahistidine (HIS6) or decahistidine (HIS10) sequences directly after the initiator methionine codon of <italic>smo-1</italic> without any other sequences. Both HIS fusions resulted in fully viable and healthy strains indistinguishable from wild type. We chose to use the HIS10 fusion because it was robustly conjugated to target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and allowed better retention to the Ni-NTA resin under stringent denaturing and washing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B and C</xref>).</p><p>The Ni-NTA resin retains non-SUMOylated protein species that are recovered even in the absence of HIS10::SUMO expression (e.g., see lanes 3 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). These non-SUMOylated proteins are not recovered via associations with SUMO-modified proteins but rather directly due to background binding of the individual denatured protein to the Ni-affinity matrix. The recovery of these background species from the matrix is not, therefore, a good measure of the actual ratio of SUMO-modified and -unmodified species in the lysate. The unavoidable recovery of unmodified species also impairs the sensitivity of MS as a means for identifying SUMO-modified proteins. Given the very high rate of false-negative detection in SUMO MS studies, we chose to apply the lowest possible arbitrary cut off of 1 spectral count enrichment over two controls—untagged SMO-1 and depletion of HIS10::SMO-1 by smo-1(RNAi)—when generating our list of candidate SUMO conjugates. This analysis identified 977 candidate SUMO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, and Discussion section for comparison with previous studies).

Importantly, failure to detect a protein by SUMO proteomics should not be construed as evidence the protein is not modified or regulated by SUMO. For each candidate protein of interest, co-valent modification by SUMO should be assessed directly with the more sensitive approach of Ni-affinity chromatography and western blotting.</p><p>PIE-1 did not pass the arbitrary cut-off we applied to our MS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We therefore carefully monitored PIE-1 SUMOylation by western blotting. To do so, we inserted a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope into the endogenous <italic>pie-1</italic> gene. The PIE-1::FLAG protein was expressed at similar levels in wild-type and <italic>his10::smo-1</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), and these worms were fully viable. Ni-affinity chromatography of embryo lysates failed to enrich a modified form of PIE-1::FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, Ni-affinity chromatography of adult lysates enriched a slowly migrating form of PIE-1::FLAG protein that was ~12 kD larger than unmodified PIE-1::FLAG (compare lanes 14 and 19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The modified PIE-1::FLAG band was absent when we mutated the presumptive SUMO acceptor site lysine 68 to arginine in PIE-1::FLAG (K68R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, lane 20). Thus, lysine 68 is required for PIE-1 SUMOylation.</p><p>We were surprised to detect SUMOylated PIE-1 in adult hermaphrodites but not in embryos.

In the adult pachytene germline, we found that PIE-1::GFP co-localized with chromosomes (as monitored by co-localization with mCherry histone H2B) and PIE-1 protein levels appeared to gradually increase during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As a control, we monitored sensor activation in an <italic>rde-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which disrupts the maintenance of silencing downstream in the piRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). The reporter was desilenced in 67% of first-generation <italic>rde-3</italic> homozygous worms and reached 100% in third-generation homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Two different <italic>pie-1</italic> null alleles desilenced the piRNA sensor in 65% (15/23) and 54% (7/13) of first-generation homozygotes, but subsequent generations could not be monitored due to embryo lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The <italic>pie-1[K68R]</italic> mutation had a mild desilencing effect: the piRNA sensor remained silenced in the first generation, but gradually became active over the next three generations, where it was expressed in ~50% of the fourth-generation homozygotes. Two presumptive <italic>gei-17</italic> null alleles failed to desilence the reporter through four generations of monitoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). While attempting to make the <italic>gei-17; pie-1[K68R]</italic> double mutant, we found that <italic>gei-17/+; pie-1[K68R]</italic> hermaphrodites are completely sterile, suggesting that <italic>gei-17</italic> is haploinsufficient in <italic>pie-1[K68R]</italic> mutants. To overcome this problem, we used CRISPR to induce homozygous <italic>gei-17</italic> deletion alleles directly in a piRNA sensor strain homozygous for <italic>pie-1[K68R]</italic>. All 18 <italic>gei-17; pie-1[K68R]</italic> strains recovered in this way exhibited complete first-generation desilencing of the piRNA sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and were also completely sterile. In contrast, control injections into the otherwise wild-type piRNA sensor strain produced 10 homozygous <italic>gei-17</italic> null strains that were fertile and viable but failed to desilence in the piRNA sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus PIE-1 and GEI-17 appear to function redundantly to promote piRNA surveillance and fertility in the adult germline.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PIE-1 and GEI-17 function together to promote piRNA-mediated silencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Epifluorescence images (upper panels) of piRNA sensor expression in dissected gonads from wild-type and <italic>rde-3(ne3370)</italic> worms.

The PIE-1 protein was found to localize prominently to embryo germline nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mello et al., 1996</xref>), where it was proposed to inhibit pol II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seydoux and Dunn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seydoux and Fire, 1994</xref>), possibly through direct inhibition of the CTD kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batchelder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh and Seydoux, 2008</xref>). Here, we have shown that PIE-1 is also expressed in the adult germline where it does not directly inhibit transcription, but rather functions along with components of the SUMO pathway to promote the hypoacetylation of germline chromatin and with the SUMO E3 homolog GEI-17 to promote Piwi Argonuate-dependent gene silencing. Although PIE-1 is not SUMOylated in the embryo, our genetic studies indicate that SUMO components, including the SUMO E3 ligase homolog GEI-17, function together with PIE-1 to preserve embryonic germline fates. PIE-1 interacts with SMO-1/SUMO and UBC-9, as well as GEI-17, by yeast two-hybrid, suggesting that PIE-1 may recruit these factors directly to its germline targets. Thus, our findings suggest how PIE-1, through its association with the SUMO pathway, may exert its remarkable dual effects as a germline determinant that controls both transcription and chromatin remodeling.</p><p>Using an affinity-based approach and mass spectrometry, we identified hundreds of <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins likely to be direct SUMO conjugates. Our results complement published work identifying SUMO-regulated targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drabikowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaminsky et al., 2009</xref>) and suggest that many SUMOylation substrates remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In addition, we have shown that a HIS10::SUMO fusion expressed from the endogenous <italic>smo-1</italic> locus is fully functional and can be used along with mutagenesis studies to identify specific SUMO acceptor lysines in substrate proteins (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Using these tools, we have shown that both PIE-1 and the type-1 HDAC, HDA-1, are SUMOylated in the adult germline, and that PIE-1 SUMOylation promotes the assembly of an adult germline NuRD complex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SUMO as an elusive modulator of protein interactions</title><p>We found that SUMO modifications to worm target proteins are rapidly and nearly completely reversed in IP sample buffer at 4°C. Consequently, SUMO-dependent protein complexes are likely to rapidly disassemble and to thus be difficult or impossible to detect in co-IP studies. Therefore, the actual in vivo interaction between MEP-1 and HDA-1 in the adult germline may be much more robust than detected here. This possibility is supported by parallel studies in which appending a conjugation-defective SUMO by translational fusion to HDA-1, HDA-1::SMO-1, dramatically increased the association of HDA-1 with MEP-1 and other components of the NuRD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified a complex, termed MEC, where MEP-1 resides along with Mi-2, but notably, without HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunert et al., 2009</xref>). The cultured cells where this MEC complex was identified were derived from ovarian tissues and express the Piwi Argonaute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mugat et al., 2020</xref>), raising the question of whether a parallel SUMO-regulated HDAC/MEC complex also functions in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary but has been missed due to the labile nature of SUMO modifications.</p><p>In the embryo HDA-1 is not SUMOylated and yet interacts robustly with its NuRD complex co-factors. We do not know how or why the assembly of HDA-1-NuRD complex differs between embryos and adults. Perhaps, SUMOylation of HDA-1 and other NuRD complex components helps overcome an unknown barrier to co-assembly in the adult germline, enabling the proteins to associate via a mechanism bridged by SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matunis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelisch et al., 2017</xref>). Such a mechanism could render the assembly and function of the adult germline NuRD complex more dynamic and responsive to signals that control the conjugation and removal of SUMO.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PIE-1 as a SUMO E3 and co-factor for the conserved SUMO-E3 GEI-17/PAIS1</title><p>Because PIE-1 appears to interact directly with UBC-9, it is possible that PIE-1 harnesses the SUMO-conjugating machinery by acting like an E3 SUMO ligase both for itself and for target proteins. SUMOyation of PIE-1 could enhance its E3 activity and its association with UBC-9 via the non-covalent SUMO-binding site on the backside of UBC-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capili and Lima, 2007a</xref>). The N-terminal two-thirds of PIE-1—which includes lysine 68 and both zinc finger motifs—interacts with UBC-9 in our yeast two-hybrid assays (data not shown), and the non-overlapping proline-rich C-terminal domain of PIE-1 interacts with MEP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, PIE-1 may bind UBC-9 and MEP-1 simultaneously. Perhaps this ternary complex transiently associates with HDA-1 to promote its SUMOylation. HDA-1-SUMO might then associate with one or both of the putative SUMO-interacting motifs on MEP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A recent study identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GEI-17 homolog Su(var)2–10 as a bridge between a nuclear Piwi Argonaute and a chromatin remodeling complex that includes the histone methyltransferase SetDB1/Eggless (Egg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ninova et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that, in addition to SetDB1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Piwi Su(var)2–10 complex may promote SUMOylation of HDAC1 to assemble a germline NuRD complex that prepares chromatin for SetDB1-dependent methylation. Perhaps in animal germlines, SUMO-dependent assembly of the NuRD complex frees it from other tasks, thereby enabling nuclear Argonautes—via associations with SUMO E3 enzymes—to recruit and assemble this vital chromatin remodeling and silencing machinery at their targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# F1804; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_262044">AB_262044</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-MRG-1</td><td>Novus Biologicals</td><td>Cat# 49130002; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10011724">AB_10011724</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-HDA-1</td><td>Novus Biologicals</td><td>Cat# 38660002; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10708816">AB_10708816</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-LET-418</td><td>Novus Biologicals</td><td>Cat# 48960002; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10708820">AB_10708820</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal anti-tubulin</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat# MCA77G; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_325003">AB_325003</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3, acetyl K9</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab12179; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_298910">AB_298910</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-PRG-1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista et al., 2008</xref></td><td>N/A</td><td>IB(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-SMO-1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelisch et al., 2017</xref></td><td>Gift from Hay Lab</td><td>IB(1:500) <break/>Freshly purified from hybridoma cell culture</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-PIE-1(P4G5)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mello et al., 1996</xref></td><td>N/A</td><td>IB(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-mouse IgG (HRP-conjugated)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 62–6520; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533947">AB_2533947</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse anti-rabbit IgG light (HRP-conjugated)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab99697; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10673897">AB_10673897</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-rat IgG (HRP-conjugated)</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs</td><td>Cat# 712-035-150; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340638">AB_2340638</ext-link></td><td>IB(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 594</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>(Cat# A-11005; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534073">AB_2534073</ext-link>)</td><td>IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</td><td>This study</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic>: strain OP50</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center</td><td>WormBase: OP50</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic>: strain HT115</td><td><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center</td><td>WormBase: HT115</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic>: Ahringer collection</td><td>Laboratory of C.

plays a role in establishing transcriptional silencing of piRNA-regulated genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by promoting local histone deacetylation. Here, the authors provide genetic evidence that the PIE-1 zinc finger protein is important for silencing of piRNA-regulated genes, and show that sumoylation of lysine 68 in the PIE-1 zinc finger protein is required for both for its association with HDA-1 and for sumoylation of HDA-1, demonstrating that PIE-1 sumoylation plays a role in piRNA-mediated silencing of gene expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PIE-1 promotes SUMOylation and activation of HDAC1 during the <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Federico Pelisch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper you describe experiments showing that PIE-1 is sumoylated at K68, and that K68 sumoylation plays a role in PIE-1 interaction with HDA-1 and its sumoylation, which leads to its activation. The reviewers found the sumoylation dependence of PIE-1 function in piRNA silencing to be of interest, but raised major issues that need to be addressed.

For instance, does a SUMO::K68R PIE-1 fusion complement the pie-1 mutant, or is the exact site of PIE-1 sumoylation important? Also, in vitro deacetylase assays of the sort suggested in the decision letter for <italic>eLife</italic>-63299, are needed to determine if PIE-1 K68 sumoylation leads to increased HDA-1 enzymatic activity by comparing WT and K68R PIE-1 strains.

How sumoylation of K68 in PIE1 affects its function was not worked out. Can the deleterious effect of the K68R mutation on PIE-1 function be reversed by generating a SUMO-PIE-1 fusion, as was done for HDA-1 in the co-submitted paper? K68 maps to the N-terminal side of ZF1 in the PIE-1 protein in what appears to be an unstructured region. Does the SUMO residue play a role in the interaction of PIE-1 with HDA-1? Are the zinc fingers required for PIE-1 interaction with HDA-1 or UBC-9? No zinc finger mutations were tested. Does HDA-1 have a SIM that would allow it to interact selectively with sumoylated PIE-1? Another, possibility is that the PIE-1 SUMO moiety is important because it interacts with the non-covalent SUMO-binding site on the backside of UBC-9 (Capill and Lima, JMB 369:606, 2007), which might stabilize the interaction. The backside interaction of SUMO with UBC-9 is proposed to promote UBC-9-mediated sumoylation of target proteins with SUMO consensus sites that are directly recognized by UBC-9. In this scenario, SUMO-PIE-1 would in effect be acting as an E3 SUMO ligase for HDA-1 by serving as a recruitment &quot;factor&quot;. In this regard, the authors could test biochemically whether recombinant PIE-1 or K68SUMO-PIE-1 stimulates sumoylation of HDA-1 by UBC-9, using recombinant WT and KKRR mutant HDA-1 as substrates. These issues deserve discussion.</p><p>2. What is the SUMO E3 ligase that sumoylates PIE-1? Is it possible that through association with UBC-9, perhaps through its zinc fingers, PIE-1 is sumoylated in cis within a PIE-1/UBC-9 complex?</p><p>3. In many places, including the title, the authors make the claim that PIE-1 promotes sumoylation and activation of HDA-1. While it is clear that PIE-1 does increase sumoylation of HDA-1, in a manner requiring K68, and that H3K9ac levels are decreased as a result, the authors do not provide any direct evidence that this process increases HDA-1 catalytic activity, as is implied in the title and elsewhere. As indicated in the review of the co-submitted paper, this would need to be established by carrying out an HDAC assay on control and sumoylated HDA-1 in vitro. Instead of enzymatic activation, it is possible that the PIE-1 interaction and HDA-1 sumoylation results in relocalization of HDA-1 within the nucleus to facilitate more efficient H3K9ac deacetylation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Kim et al. address the role of PIE-1 sumoylation during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis.

The authors mention that gei-17 alleles are viable, could the authors mention any thoughts on why the tm2723 allele is lethal/sterile?</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>i. Panel C is mentioned in the text in the wrong place. Also in C, what do the authors think about the big increase in MEP-1 sumoylation in the PIE-1(K68R) background?</p><p>ii.

Even if compatible with some results in vivo, showing that this is a plausible mechanism in vitro would be extremely helpful and greatly support the authors' claim.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>i. The authors make a quantitative comparison of the HDA-1/MEP-1 interaction in the text. I think this is not correct. Even if these have been run in the same gel, this could just be a lower exposure. In this line, the HDA-1 blot in the 'Adult' IP would benefit from a longer exposure to better appreciate what seems a rather small difference between PIE-1 and PIE-1(K68R).</p><p>ii. Since there still seems to be interaction between MEP-1 and HDA-1 in the PIE-1(K68R) background, does smo-1(RNAi) or ubc-9(G56R) reduce this further?</p><p>iii.

Could the authors make some quantitation of the immunofluorescence data?</p><p>Overall, I think this manuscript proposes a very interesting model and the results support this model, although I am not convinced these are sufficient to strongly back the authors' claims. I would very much like to see a revised version with some in vitro data backing the authors' model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Kim et al., show that, beyond its roles of preventing somatic differentiation in the germline of embryos, Zn-finger protein PIE-1 also functions in the adult germline, where it is both SUMOylated as well as interacts with the SUMO conjugating machinery and promotes SUMOylation of protein targets. They identify HDA-1 as a target of PIE-1-induced SUMOylation. Here too, I find the claims interesting, however data is sometimes missing or does not fully support the claims.</p><p>1. A key claim of novelty over previously proposed &quot;glue&quot; functions of SUMO is based on the fact that they find that temporally regulated SUMOylation of a very specific residue in a specific protein is affecting protein activity: The observation that &quot;SUMOylation of HDA-1 only appears to regulate its functions in the adult germline&quot; and not in the embryo together with the finding that &quot;other co-factors such as MEP-1 are SUMOylated more broadly, these findings imply that SUMOylation in the context of these chromatin remodeling complexes, does not merely function as a SUMO-glue (Matunis et al., 2006) but rather has specificity depending on which components of the complex are modified and/or when.&quot;</p><p>I find this claim poorly supported by the data. In fact, I find that the data supports that multiple SUMOylations contribute to formation of larger complexes: The His-SUMO IP (Figure 2B) brings down far more un-SUMOylated HDA-1 than SUMOylated. This argues for the presence of large complexes with different factors being SUMOylated and many bringing down unmodified HDA-1. The chromatography experiments (Figure 3B-C) also provide hits that are in complex and not direct interactors. Finally, HDA-1 SUMOylation is indicated to regulate MEP-1 interaction with numerous factors (Figure 3D). If all these factors are in one complex, it is hard to imagine how a single SUMO residue would mediate all of these simultaneously. It is quite likely (and not tested) that loss of HDA-1 SUMOylation leads to (partial?) dissociation of a large complex, rather than loss of individual interactions with the SUMO residue of HDA-1. Unlike claimed by the authors, there is no evidence that the &quot;activity&quot; of HDA-1 is regulated by SUMO modification.</p><p>2. Based on loss of MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction upon pie-1 RNAi and smo-1 RNAi (Figure 4B), the authors conclude that &quot;SUMOylation of PIE-1 promotes the interaction of HDA-1 with MEP-1 in the adult germline&quot;.</p><p>The evidence that it is PEI-1 SUMOylation that is affecting MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction is fairly weak. In fact, based on Figure 4A, MEP-1 and HDA-1 interact without expression of PIE-1, and in PIE-1 K68R (sumoylation-deficient), although due to poor labeling of the panel it is not clear whether lane 1 and 4 refer to the WT pie-1 locus without tag or lack of pie-1.</p><p>In 4B the HDA-1 band that is present in L4440 but not in pie-1 or smo-1 RNAi is very faint, and in our experience such weak signal is not linear i.e., bands can disappear or appear depending on the exposure. Importantly, according to the data, seemingly unmodified HDA-1 immunoprecipitated with MEP-1 (Figure 4B). This data contradicts the authors' claim that &quot;These findings suggest that in the adult germline only a small fraction of the HDA-1 protein pool, likely only those molecules that are SUMOylated, can be recruited by MEP-1 for the assembly of a functional NURD complex&quot;.</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that pie-1 and smo-1 depletion eliminate the interaction between HDA-1/MEP1 doesn't mean that the SUMOylation of pie-1 specifically is required for the interaction: perhaps un-SUMOylated pie1, and SUMOylation of something else, are both necessary for the interaction. The authors show that MEP-1 is also SUMOylated (Figure 3C). When IP-ing GFP-MEP-1, they precipitate all its modified forms and associated factors. One alternative possibility for why smo-1 RNAi abolishes MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction is that MEP-1 SUMOylation is needed for interaction with HDA-1 (independently of pie-1). (On a side note, why are the authors not including MEP-1 SUMOylation in the model?)</p><p>3. On page 13 the authors write: &quot;These findings suggest that SUMOylation of PIE-1 on K68 enhances its ability to activate HDA-1 in the adult germline&quot; and &quot;We have shown that PIE-1 is also expressed in the adult germline where it engages the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein MEP-1 and the SUMO-conjugating machinery and functions to promote the SUMOylation and activation of the type 1 HDAC, HDA-1 (Figure 6)&quot;. Activation of HDA-1 is misleading and was never tested. If not performing in vitro assays for HDAC activity, the authors at least need to look at whether pie loss (degron) leads to acetylation of genomic HDA-1 targets and whether it affects HDA-1 (and/or MEP-1) recruitment to these sites. This could be done by ChIP-seq of HDA-1 and H3K9ac in WT and pie-1 degron animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63300.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

MW markers are missing in the blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added markers to indicate the MW in each blot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>i. The generation of the ubc-9 ts allele is an exceptional tool. Could the authors show SUMO conjugation levels at permissive vs restrictive temperature? Just out of curiosity, is this a fast-acting allele?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. Yes, this is a fast-acting and reversible ts allele, so we hope it will prove useful to the community. We are glad to make it available, although it is also very easy to CRISPR it in. Based on our genetic tests the protein is a weak hypomorph (slightly reduced function), but we have not tested its SUMO-conjugating activity by comparing substrates at the permissive and non-permissive temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. The authors mention that gei-17 alleles are viable, could the authors mention any thoughts on why the tm2723 allele is lethal/sterile?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands gei-17 null alleles are homozygous viable, but produce a mixture of ~70% sterile adults and ~2% dead embryos in each brood. We have not analyzed tm2723, but note that it is available as an unbalanced (homozygous) strain according to wormbase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3:</p><p>i. Panel C is mentioned in the text in the wrong place. Also in C, what do the authors think about the big increase in MEP-1 sumoylation in the PIE-1(K68R) background?</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the figure calls, and we have rearranged the figure to more clearly and concisely indicate the embryo and adult studies. You are right, MEP-1 SUMOylation does seem to be increased slightly in the mutant and in <italic>pie-1(RNAi)</italic>. However, we have not identified the SUMO acceptor lysines nor generated any functional data indicating the importance (if any) of MEP-1 SUMOylation. Investigating this modification to MEP-1 will require a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. I have the same comment for panel D as I had for figure 1 comment III: the exposure/loading for the embryo WB seems lower, as judged by the co-purifying, unmodified HDA-1. A positive control for sumoylated protein coming from embryos would be nice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the loading and include MEP-1 as a positive control for a SUMOylated protein from embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. In general, the model of PIE-1 acting as a SUMO machinery recruiter should be tested with recombinant proteins. Even if compatible with some results in vivo, showing that this is a plausible mechanism in vitro would be extremely helpful and greatly support the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this perspective. We agree that in vitro studies would be helpful in the future, especially if they help uncover factors or modifications that cause adult germline and embryo MEP-1 Mi2/LET-418 complexes to differ so dramatically in their association with HDA-1. Especially if these factors—whatever they are—turn out to be highly conserved proteins (unlike PIE-1). Until that problem is solved, even if PIE-1 could be shown to promote HDA-1 SUMOylation in vitro with purified components, it would be unlikely to modulate the association of HDA-1 with MEP-1 in vitro, as the aforementioned modifications or co-factors that suppress/promote their association are not yet in hand.</p><p>At present, our genetic arguments strongly support the idea that PIE-1 works together with SUMO components to carry out its functions. We feel like our hard fought gains in understanding and revealing a potential mechanism for PIE-1 adult germline function (by promoting HDAC NuRD complex assembly) are very significant given the strong context of the entirely in vivo genetic backdrop for these whole animal studies. We feel like this genetic in vivo aspect of the story is solid and very interesting and is already well-supported by good molecular genetic studies using endogenous alleles throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4:</p><p>i. The authors make a quantitative comparison of the HDA-1/MEP-1 interaction in the text. I think this is not correct. Even if these have been run in the same gel, this could just be a lower exposure. In this line, the HDA-1 blot in the 'Adult' IP would benefit from a longer exposure to better appreciate what seems a rather small difference between PIE-1 and PIE-1(K68R).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a longer exposure that helps to make this difference more clear. It should be noted that the SUMO-dependence of this interaction is pursued more directly and completely in our parallel story on HDAC SUMOylation. Although it may seem weak, it is most definitely real and, we believe, important. In the revised Discussion, we suggest that this apparently weak association is likely misleading due to SUMO reversal during IP incubations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Since there still seems to be interaction between MEP-1 and HDA-1 in the PIE-1(K68R) background, does smo-1(RNAi) or ubc-9(G56R) reduce this further?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the revised Figure 4, lanes 31 and 32, both <italic>pie-1(RNAi) and smo-1(RNAi)</italic> appear to reduce this interaction further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. In panel B, the LET-418 blot on the right is massively overexposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a shorter exposure, but LET-418 interacts very robustly with MEP-1 in adult lysates, which is what we were trying to illustrate. When relative exposures are adjusted to detect HDA-1, this over-exposure happens to the LET-418 western.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. Once again, in vitro binding experiments to get some indication that the authors' model is plausible would be a great addition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks again for this comment. We have responded to this issue of in vitro studies above. But please clarify if there are specific new in vitro experiments you have in mind. Again, the genetic arguments we make are very well supported by molecular genetic studies and by yeast two-hybrid data.</p><p>It is not clear what aspect of our model seems implausible. We do agree with the reviewer that the role of PIE-1 in promoting HDA-1 SUMOylation and its role in the regulation of the adult stage MEP-1–HDA-1 interaction remains somewhat tentative (but is addressed more deeply in the second paper). But we don’t think they are implausible. In the revised manuscript, we have de-emphasized these molecular details (taking them out of the title, for example). We think the findings that PIE-1 is SUMOylated and acts through SUMO to regulate gene expression in both the adult and embryo germlines are important and well-established aspects of our paper. As noted above, the importance of HDAC SUMOylation is addressed much more completely in the parallel submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5:</p><p>i. Could the authors make some quantitation of the immunofluorescence data?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include quantification (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I think this manuscript proposes a very interesting model and the results support this model, although I am not convinced these are sufficient to strongly back the authors' claims. I would very much like to see a revised version with some in vitro data backing the authors' model.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope the reviewer will be satisfied with the revisions we have made to emphasize the molecular genetic (rather than biochemical) focus of our work. We have emphasized and expanded on our 2-hybrid data in order to help address this need for in vitro mechanistic binding information. PIE-1 is a difficult protein in terms of solubility, both in vivo and in our limited attempts to work with it in vitro. It is also a novel protein, that beyond its tandem zinc fingers is not conserved. So detailed in vitro insights into how PIE-1 SUMOylation changes its function are unlikely to be of great interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. As noted earlier, a key mystery that deserves further investigation at the biochemical level is why HDA-1 fails to associate with the NuRD complex in the adult germline, in the first place. In any event, thanks for your careful consideration of our work, and we apologize that we cannot be more forthcoming with in vitro data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript by Kim et al., show that, beyond its roles of preventing somatic differentiation in the germline of embryos, Zn-finger protein PIE-1 also functions in the adult germline, where it is both SUMOylated as well as interacts with the SUMO conjugating machinery and promotes SUMOylation of protein targets. They identify HDA-1 as a target of PIE-1-induced SUMOylation. Here too, I find the claims interesting, however data is sometimes missing or does not fully support the claims.</p><p>1. A key claim of novelty over previously proposed &quot;glue&quot; functions of SUMO is based on the fact that they find that temporally regulated SUMOylation of a very specific residue in a specific protein is affecting protein activity: The observation that &quot;SUMOylation of HDA-1 only appears to regulate its functions in the adult germline&quot; and not in the embryo together with the finding that &quot;other co-factors such as MEP-1 are SUMOylated more broadly, these findings imply that SUMOylation in the context of these chromatin remodeling complexes, does not merely function as a SUMO-glue (Matunis et al., 2006) but rather has specificity depending on which components of the complex are modified and/or when.&quot;</p><p>I find this claim poorly supported by the data. In fact, I find that the data supports that multiple SUMOylations contribute to formation of larger complexes: The His-SUMO IP (Figure 2B) brings down far more un-SUMOylated HDA-1 than SUMOylated. This argues for the presence of large complexes with different factors being SUMOylated and many bringing down unmodified HDA-1.</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated in the paper, the Ni-affinity enrichments are performed under denaturing conditions and therefore do not pull down complexes bridged by protein-protein interactions. This is why PIE-1 protein which is otherwise not soluble, was recovered using this method. The non-SUMOylated proteins recovered in these experiments are brought down individually (not in complexes), and presumably this is due to unavoidable background binding between the Ni resin and clusters of Histidines in these proteins. Background binding to the resin is different for every protein, and is not by itself a useful measure of the relative SUMOylation level of the protein. We now explain the procedure and emphasize the points more strongly in the revised paper. Thanks for pointing out these issues as no doubt many other readers would be unfamiliar with such details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The chromatography experiments (Figure 3B-C) also provide hits that are in complex and not direct interactors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referring to Figure 3 in the HDA-1 paper, not this paper. Again, the histograms compare the recovery of proteins by Ni-affinity chromatography under <bold><italic>denaturing conditions</italic>,</bold> which does not capture protein complexes. We have clarified in both papers that Ni-affinity chromatography was done under denaturing conditions, and we apologize for the confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, HDA-1 SUMOylation is indicated to regulate MEP-1 interaction with numerous factors (Figure 3D). If all these factors are in one complex, it is hard to imagine how a single SUMO residue would mediate all of these simultaneously.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree; this is a striking finding. Appending SUMO by translational fusion to HDA-1 results in a dramatic increase in the co-IP between MEP-1, HDA-1, and several other factors that are known to form complexes with HDA-1. As we discuss in the paper, appending SUMO to HDA-1 seems to overcome a barrier to its interaction with MEP-1 and enables the proteins to assemble a functional NuRD complex in the adult germline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is quite likely (and not tested) that loss of HDA-1 SUMOylation leads to (partial?) dissociation of a large complex, rather than loss of individual interactions with the SUMO residue of HDA-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t understand this comment, which again seems to be addressing the HDA-1 paper, not this paper. Perhaps the reviewer did not understand that we pulled down MEP-1 not HDA-1 in Figure 3D of the HDA-1 paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unlike claimed by the authors, there is no evidence that the &quot;activity&quot; of HDA-1 is regulated by SUMO modification.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize again for this misunderstanding. We agree that SUMO is unlikely to alter the HDA-1 enzymatic activity. Rather as now more clearly stated throughout the paper, we believe it alters its activity toward its histone substrates by enhancing its association with MEP-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Based on loss of MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction upon pie-1 RNAi and smo-1 RNAi (Figure 4B), the authors conclude that &quot;SUMOylation of PIE-1 promotes the interaction of HDA-1 with MEP-1 in the adult germline&quot;.</p><p>The evidence that it is PEI-1 SUMOylation that is affecting MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction is fairly weak. In fact, based on Figure 4A, MEP-1 and HDA-1 interact without expression of PIE-1, and in PIE-1 K68R (sumoylation-deficient), although due to poor labeling of the panel it is not clear whether lane 1 and 4 refer to the WT pie-1 locus without tag or lack of pie-1.</p></disp-quote><p>Again we apologize for the confusion and poor labeling of our figures. We now make it clear that all of the strains are wildtype for PIE-1 function with the exception of those expressing PIE-1(K68R) or exposed to <italic>pie-1(RNAi)</italic>. The dash was meant to indicate the absence of the tag not the protein or gene activity. In the original figure, the top panels showed results from adult lysates, and the bottom panels showed results from embryo lysates. As we note in the paper and as mentioned by the reviewer, HDA-1 and MEP-1 interact robustly in embryos regardless of the SUMOylation status of HDA-1. To make the experiments and results clearer, we now place the two conditions—Adult and Embryo—side by side and color code them. We also put the most important blots (HDA-1) on top and call out all the key lanes by number. As noted above and now emphasized throughout the paper, the interaction between MEP-1 and HDA-1 is weak in the Adult stage, and this weak interaction requires PIE-1 activity and is promoted by PIE-1 SUMOylation. We also now make a point of discussing how this apparently weak interaction may be a detection problem due to reversal of SUMO in the IP lysates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In 4B the HDA-1 band that is present in L4440 but not in pie-1 or smo-1 RNAi is very faint, and in our experience such weak signal is not linear i.e., bands can disappear or appear depending on the exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>Under the conditions used in our study, a relatively very small amount of HDA-1 is recovered in the MEP-1 IPs from the adult germline compared to the embryo. We also include longer exposures now that show this better. The interaction is reproducible, and is consistently reduced in <italic>K68R, pie-1(RNAi)</italic>, and <italic>smo-1(RNAi)</italic> worms. In contrast Mi2/LET-418 interacts robustly with MEP-1 at all stages and in all genetic contexts. We intentionally exposed the blots from Adults and Embryos for equal amounts of time so that the relative amount of LET-418 blot and HDA-1 recovered in the IPs could be compared directly. Hence the over-exposure of LET-418 and under-exposure of the HDA-1. At the request of the reviewers, we have added additional figures showing longer exposures of HDA-1 in the Adult stage coIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, according to the data, seemingly unmodified HDA-1 immunoprecipitated with MEP-1 (Figure 4B). This data contradicts the authors' claim that &quot;These findings suggest that in the adult germline only a small fraction of the HDA-1 protein pool, likely only those molecules that are SUMOylated, can be recruited by MEP-1 for the assembly of a functional NURD complex&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and again we apologize for not explaining this finding better. SUMO modifications are transient and reversible and are often subject to reversal by de-SUMOylating machinery during incubation in IP lysates. We now address this issue directly in the Results and Discussion sections and include a figure (1D) to illustrate this rapid de-conjugation of SUMO from substrates in IP buffer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the fact that pie-1 and smo-1 depletion eliminate the interaction between HDA-1/MEP1 doesn't mean that the SUMOylation of pie-1 specifically is required for the interaction: perhaps un-SUMOylated pie1, and SUMOylation of something else, are both necessary for the interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We show that PIE-1(K68R) reduces but does not eliminate the interaction, and we speculate that PIE-1, even when not SUMOylated can promote the interaction. Our best evidence is genetic, so of course it could be indirect. However, PIE-1 does directly interact with MEP-1, and with SUMO and UBC-9, so a direct modification of HDA-1 is certainly plausible. We have better explained and de-emphasized this detail and hope this makes the paper more acceptable to the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that MEP-1 is also SUMOylated (Figure 3C). When IP-ing GFP-MEP-1, they precipitate all its modified forms and associated factors. One alternative possibility for why smo-1 RNAi abolishes MEP-1/HDA-1 interaction is that MEP-1 SUMOylation is needed for interaction with HDA-1 (independently of pie-1). (On a side note, why are the authors not including MEP-1 SUMOylation in the model?)</p></disp-quote><p>MEP-1 is SUMOylated in both the embryo and the adult, as are additional components of the NuRD complex. While it’s possible that this modification is essential for its (their) functions in one or both tissues, we have not explored this yet. A careful exploration of this question will require finding and mutating the acceptor lysines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On page 13 the authors write: &quot;These findings suggest that SUMOylation of PIE-1 on K68 enhances its ability to activate HDA-1 in the adult germline&quot; and &quot;We have shown that PIE-1 is also expressed in the adult germline where it engages the Krüppel-type zinc finger protein MEP-1 and the SUMO-conjugating machinery and functions to promote the SUMOylation and activation of the type 1 HDAC, HDA-1 (Figure 6)&quot;. Activation of HDA-1 is misleading and was never tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to imply enzymatic activity was increased. This section has been totally revised to stress the key genetic findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If not performing in vitro assays for HDAC activity, the authors at least need to look at whether pie loss (degron) leads to acetylation of genomic HDA-1 targets and whether it affects HDA-1 (and/or MEP-1) recruitment to these sites. This could be done by ChIP-seq of HDA-1 and H3K9ac in WT and pie-1 degron animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, it is difficult/impossible to collect enough material by dissecting gonads to be able to perform ChIP seq studies on adult germline tissue from worms. One solution is to drive a tagged transgene and perform ChIP that way. We did this in the HDA-1 paper. However, we felt that performing mRNA seq on the actual mutant alleles, directly, gives a similar read out on overlap between targets. We now include direct comparisons of up-regulated genes in dissected gonads from <italic>hda-1([KKRR])</italic>, <italic>mep-1::degron</italic>, and <italic>pie-1::degron</italic>, showing strong overlaps (Figure 5F).</p></body></sub-article></article>
