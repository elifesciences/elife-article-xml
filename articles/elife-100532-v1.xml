unexpected events. Whether and how humans also re-orient attention ‘in mind’ following expected and unexpected working-memory tests remains elusive. We leveraged spatial modulations in neural activity and gaze to isolate re-orienting within the spatial layout of visual working memory following central memory tests of certain, expected, or unexpected mnemonic content. Besides internal orienting after predictive cues, we unveil a second stage of internal attentional deployment following both expected and unexpected memory tests. Following expected tests, internal attentional deployment was not contingent on prior orienting, suggesting an additional verification – ‘double checking’ – in memory. Following unexpected tests, re-focusing of alternative memory content was prolonged. This brings attentional re-orienting to the domain of working memory and underscores how memory tests can invoke either a verification or a revision of our internal focus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>selective attention</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>internal attention</kwd><kwd>attentional orienting</kwd><kwd>alpha oscillations</kwd><kwd>microsaccades</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NWO Vidi Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Ede</surname><given-names>Freek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>ERC Starting Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MEMTICIPATION850636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Ede</surname><given-names>Freek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Memory tests evoke a second stage of internal attentional deployment following both expected and unexpected memory tests, extending attentional re-orienting to working memory.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attention enables us to select and prioritize relevant information and can be directed not only to external sensations but also to internal representations held in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin and Nobre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Panichello and Buschman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Souza and Oberauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Ede and Nobre, 2023</xref>). In everyday life, attention is often directed to sensory and mnemonic information that is likely to become relevant based on probabilistic cues, but new events may also prompt us to revise our attentional focus, particularly when these events come unexpected.</p><p>This underscores a classic distinction between two separate attentional stages: attentional orienting and re-orienting. For example, following a probabilistic pre-cue, participants may initially orient their attention to the left where a visual target is expected, but if the target unexpectedly comes on the right, attention requires to be re-oriented to the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Posner, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Studies on external attention have extensively characterized the mechanisms of both orienting of attention following predictive probabilistic cues and re-orienting of attention following unexpected perceptual targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbetta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbetta et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doricchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Posner, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Posner et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Posner and Cohen, 1984</xref>). In contrast, studies on internal attention – directed to representations held in working memory – have almost exclusively focused on just the former: the mechanisms supporting initial orienting following predictive retrocues (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberauer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sahan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Souza and Oberauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Ede and Nobre, 2023</xref>) or temporal expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>). These studies have made clear, among others, how the brain relies on memorized locations to orient to specific objects held within the spatial layout of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Draschkow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lepsien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macedo-Pascual et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Ede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ede et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Ede et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, whether deployment of spatial attention within visual working memory also occurs in response to ensuing memory tests – and how this depends on whether working memory tests prompt mnemonic content that is certain, expected, or unexpected to become tested – has remained elusive.</p><p>To fill this gap, we designed a visual working memory task in which we varied the reliability by which retrocues predicted the upcoming working memory test. Retrocues were either 100% reliable, 80% reliable, or 60% reliable, yielding memory tests for items that were certain (100%), expected (80/60% reliable and valid), or unexpected (80/60% reliable but invalid) to be probed for report. Building on ample prior studies, we tracked spatial orienting of attention within the spatial layout of visual working memory using two established markers: the lateralization of 8–12 Hz posterior EEG-alpha activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macedo-Pascual et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>) and the spatial biasing of (micro)saccades (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Draschkow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Ede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ede et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>). By presenting memory items laterally, but memory tests centrally, we could use these spatial markers to test whether attention also re-orients inside the mind when specific memory content becomes tested – and to assess how such re-orienting depends on prior expectations regarding the to-be-tested memory content.</p><p>To preview our results, we first confirm that our two spatial markers track orienting of attention in response to the retrocue, in a manner that scales with cue reliability (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haegens et al., 2012</xref>). Having established the sensitivity of our markers and the use of the retrocue, we next uncover evidence for spatial re-orienting within the mind in response to the central memory test – including following tests of expected memory objects, but only when the to-be-tested memory object cannot be anticipated with complete certainty. Moreover, when the memory test prompts selection of the unexpected memory content, we unveil how re-orienting in mind does not take off later, but does last longer, consistent with slower responses following unexpected (invalidly cued) memory tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Human participants performed a visual working memory task in which retrocues directed attention to either of two visual items (colored oriented gratings) held in working memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

To this end, we turned to EEG-alpha and gaze signatures of internal attentional orienting within the spatial layout of visual working memory. Critically, we tracked orienting of attention not only in response to the retrocue (as in ample prior studies, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macedo-Pascual et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>), but also in response to the memory test, as a function of whether the memory test was (a) certain (after 100% reliable cues), (b) uncertain but conform the cue-induced expectation (after 80/60% <italic>valid</italic> cues), or (c) different than expected (after 80/60% <italic>invalid</italic> cues). To do so, we leveraged a unique aspect of our task in which we always presented the test stimulus (i.e. the memory probe) centrally. This enabled us to track re-orienting to the left/right memory item, and disentangle such re-orienting ‘in mind’ from visual processing of the test stimulus itself.</p><p>In what follows, we first present our behavioral performance findings to confirm that participants used the cue to benefit memory-guided behavior. We then turn to our EEG and gaze signatures of attentional orienting during working memory following the retrocue. Finally, we turn to our critical findings of attentional re-orienting following the memory test at the end of the working memory delay.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Better performance following expected vs. unexpected memory tests</title><p>Because we varied the reliability of the cue across blocks, we first evaluated reproduction errors and reaction times (RT) across block types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). We found comparable accuracy (reproduction errors) across the four block types (<italic>F</italic>(3,69) = 1.378, <italic>p</italic>=0.257, η<sup>2</sup>=0.057), while for RTs we found a significant main effect of block type (<italic>F</italic>(3,69) = 8.994, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, η<sup>2</sup>=0.281). This was corroborated by a significant linear trend (<italic>F</italic>(1,23) = 15.304, <italic>p</italic>=0.001, η<sup>2</sup>=0.400), with faster responses in blocks with more reliable cues.</p><p>To more directly quantify cueing effects on performance, we turned to the blocks with 80% and 60% reliable cues, as these contained memory tests that were either expected (following a valid retrocue) or unexpected (following an invalid retrocue). This confirmed clear behavioral consequences of cue-induced expectations on memory-guided behavioral performance, with higher reproduction accuracy (lower errors) and faster response speed (lower RTs) when the memory test probed the expected (validly cued) vs. the unexpected (invalidly cued) memory item (80% reliable-cue blocks, accuracy: <italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = 5.357, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, RT: <italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = –5.651, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; 60% reliable-cue blocks, accuracy: <italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = 3.850, <italic>p</italic>=0.012, RT: <italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = –5.286, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, effects of cue validity were also larger following 80% (2.948 degrees and 219 ms better after valid vs. invalid cues) vs. 60% (2.221 degrees and 100 ms better after valid vs. invalid cues) reliable cues. For RT, this was corroborated by a significantly larger cue-validity effect following 80% vs 60% reliable cues (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = –3.497, <italic>p</italic>=0.002), though for accuracy this difference did not reach significance (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = –1.533, <italic>p</italic>=0.139). Together, these results show that participants used the cue even when the cue was 80% or 60% reliable, and did so in a graded manner that depended on cue reliability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Attentional orienting after the cue shows graded spatial modulations in both EEG-alpha activity and in gaze</title><p>Having established robust cueing benefits on memory-guided behavioral performance, we next aimed to track the dynamics of cue-driven attentional orienting, as a function of cue reliability. We here uniquely did so for two separate markers that have each been implicated in attentional orienting within the spatial layout of visual working memory: the lateralization of 8–12 Hz EEG-alpha activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macedo-Pascual et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Ede, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wallis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>), and the spatial biasing of saccade directions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Draschkow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Ede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ede et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>We first considered alpha lateralization.

It’s worth noting that while alpha lateralization shows very comparable amplitudes in the imperative-100% and 100% conditions, the saccade bias was larger following imperative-100% vs. 100% reliable cues. This may reflect a difference between these two cueing conditions that is selectively picked up by our gaze marker (though it may also reflect differential sensitivity of our two markers to different sources of noise). While the two markers each had their own characteristic patterns, a direct comparison between the two markers is non-trivial (as they are two distinct dependent variables) and was beyond the scope of the current study (for studies targeting the inter-relation between these two markers, we refer the reader to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Signatures of attentional orienting also reveal attentional re-orienting after the memory test, but only when the test is not certain</title><p>A unique feature of our task was that the two memory items were always left and right at encoding, while the working memory test was always central.

The first thing that stands out is that we found a qualitatively different spatial modulation in our gaze marker of attentional orienting following memory tests when memory tests were fully anticipated (after 100% reliable cues) vs. uncertain (after 80/60% reliable cues). When the test was certain (100%), a significant saccade bias in the direction opposite from the memorized location of the tested item was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, cluster <italic>p</italic>=0.021, <italic>p</italic>=0.003, for imperative-100% and 100% conditions, respectively). This likely reflects ‘return’ saccades to the center in response to the memory test stimulus from lingering gaze-position biases following the cue (i.e. a residual effect from the cue-induced modulation).</p><p>In contrast, and of key interest here, when the nature of the test stimulus was not 100% certain (in 80/60% cue-reliability conditions), we found a pronounced saccade bias towards the memorized location of the tested item (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, 80%-valid block: cluster <italic>p</italic>=0.023, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; 60%-valid block: cluster <italic>p</italic>=0.009, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, for valid-cue and invalid-cue trials, respectively). Because the test stimulus was presented in the center, this saccade bias shows re-orienting to the mnemonic contents in mind, in response to the memory test. Critically, we found this re-orienting in mind not only following unexpected tests (for which the preceding retrocue initially directed attention to the other, non-tested, memory item during the delay), but also following expected tests.</p><p>As shown in the corresponding saccade-size-over-time plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>, consistent with what we observed following the cue, the difference between toward and away saccades following the test was again predominantly driven by saccades in the fixational micro-saccade range (&lt;2°), and the time course (saccade bias) results hold even when exclusively considering fixational eye movements below 2 visual degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, just like mnemonic focusing after the cue, re-orienting after the memory test was also predominantly reflected in fixational micro-saccades, and not looking back at the original location of the memory items that were encoded at 6 degrees away from central fixation.</p><p>We also sorted patterns of gaze bias after the memory test by performance but could only establish a link between this gaze bias and RTs following expected memory tests in our 80% cue-reliability condition (cluster <italic>p</italic>=0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of significant statistical differences in the remaining conditions may possibly reflect a lack of sensitivity (insufficient trial numbers) for this additional analysis.</p><p>Besides the striking difference in our gaze marker of internal orienting following memory tests that were certain (100% cue reliability) vs. uncertain (80/60% cue reliability), we also found revealing differences in response to memory tests that were expected (validly cued) vs. unexpected (invalidly cued), as we turn to and quantify in detail next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Unexpected memory tests prolong spatial re-orienting in working memory but do not delay the onset of re-orienting</title><p>As described above, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, we found prominent spatial biases in gaze in the direction of the memorized location of the tested memory item when the to-be-tested memory item was not certain until the test stimulus appeared (i.e. in the blocks with 80% and 60% reliable cues). We found this following both expected (validly cued) and unexpected (invalidly cued) memory tests. At the same time, we also observed a striking difference between these two types of trials. While our spatial marker of attention re-orienting in mind after the memory test started at a similar latency after expected and unexpected memory tests, the marker was prolonged following unexpected (invalidly cued) memory tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>We quantified this in two ways (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and van Ede, 2024</xref>): (a) comparing the time courses of our spatial gaze marker following expected and unexpected memory tests using a cluster-based permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) and (b) using a jackknife latency analysis method that directly quantified the onset and offset of this re-orienting marker (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smulders, 2010</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 1998</xref>). First, we found significant clusters when comparing the saccade bias following expected (validly cued) and unexpected (invalidly cued) memory tests, in both 80% and 60% cue-reliability blocks, as indicated by the black horizontal significance lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> (cluster <italic>p</italic>=0.003, <italic>p</italic>=0.025). Second, we directly compared the onset and offset latency of the saccade bias following expected and unexpected memory tests. For onset latency after the memory test, we found no statistical difference following expected and unexpected memory tests (80%: <italic>t</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = –0.567, <italic>p</italic>=0.577, BF<sub>01</sub>=3.877 in favor of the null hypothesis; 60%: <italic>t</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = –0.440, <italic>p</italic>=0.665, BF<sub>01</sub>=4.108 in favor of the null hypothesis).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, this complementary sub-sampling analysis confirmed that our observed differences between the saccade bias following expected and unexpected memory tests in both 80% and 60% cue-reliability conditions are robust even when carefully matching the number of trials between validly cued (expected) and invalidly cued (unexpected) memory test.</p><p>For completeness, we also directly compared the valid-vs-invalid difference in offset latency between the 80% and 60% conditions. We found no evidence for a significant difference in the cue-validity effect on this prolonged re-orienting following memory tests in the 80% and 60% cue-reliability blocks (<italic>t</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = 0.237, <italic>p</italic>=0.815, BF<sub>01</sub>=5.962 in favor of the null hypothesis).</p><p>We additionally conducted fractional area latency (FAL) analysis on the comparison of the saccade bias following the memory test between valid- and invalid-cue trials to rule out the potential contribution of peak amplitude differences into the onset and offset latency differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen and Hillyard, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiesel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luck, 2005</xref>). Consistent with our jackknife-based latency analysis, the FAL analysis revealed a significantly prolonged saccade bias following the unexpected tests (the invalid-cue trials) vs. expected tests (the valid-cue trials) in both 80% and 60% cue-reliability conditions (411 ms vs. 463 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(14)</sub> <italic>=</italic> 2.358<italic>, p</italic>=0.034; 417 ms vs. 468 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 2.168, <italic>p</italic>=0.047; for 80% and 60% condition, respectively).

This could reflect that when the cue is not 100% reliable, participants may prioritize the cued item only partially, necessitating revisiting the cued item when it actually becomes tested (a second-stage ‘verification’ step that can be skipped with the cue is 100% reliable). At the same time, however, we also observed comparatively less orienting in response to the cue in these trials in which the cue is not 100% reliable. Accordingly, it remains possible that the re-orienting signal that we observed after the test is driven exclusively by trials where participants did not use the initial cue, but waited for the test before shifting attention to the relevant memory item for the first time (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>). In such a scenario, we should <italic>only</italic> observe attention deployment after the test stimulus in trials in which participants did <italic>not</italic> use the preceding retrocue.</p><p>While it is notoriously difficult to know for certain whether participants used the cue or not at the single-trial level, our saccade marker affords a handle on this. Unlike continuous alpha activity, saccades are events that can be classified on a single-trial level. Although alpha can also be analyzed as the single-trial level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macdonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wöstmann et al., 2019</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kosciessa et al., 2020</xref>), saccades offer the unique opportunity to split trials not by graded amplitude fluctuations but by discrete all-or-none events. We reasoned as follows: in the trial-average, we found a saccade bias between 200–600 ms after the cue (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) that was driven by more toward saccades.

This may reflect the prolonged need to re-orient to the other memory item, when previously having relied more on the cue to prioritize the memory item that did not end up being tested in these invalidly cued trials.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Re-orienting of attention after the memory test is not contingent on initial orienting after the cue.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Left panel: saccade bias towards the memorized location of the test item after memory test in trials with and without a toward saccade after the cue for validly cued trials in 80% cue-reliability block.

First, building on ample prior studies that have tracked attentional orienting following retrocues, we show how two spatial markers of internal attentional orienting – alpha lateralization and saccade-direction bias – each tracks attentional orienting in working memory in a graded fashion, according to cue reliability. Complementing this more established line of research, we here unveil similar attentional deployment within the spatial layout of working memory in response to the memory test, but only when there remained uncertainty about which memory item would be tested. Finally, when the memory test probed the unexpected memory item (in invalidly cued trials), we found that attentional re-orienting did not take off later but did become prolonged, consistent with the slower memory-guided behavior after unexpected memory tests. We discuss each finding in turn.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of the main findings.</title><p>Schematic summary of our central findings regarding dynamic attentional orienting and re-orienting after the cue and the memory test, as a function of cue reliability and test expectations.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100532-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Consistent with ample prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin and Nobre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lepsien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsukura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rerko and Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Moorselaar et al., 2015</xref>) (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Souza and Oberauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Ede and Nobre, 2023</xref>), our behavioral data showed clear cueing benefits on memory-guided behavior, as most clearly demonstrated by better and faster performance following memory tests that were preceded by a valid vs. invalid retrocue. Moreover, at least for RT, we also found a larger cue-validity effect when cues were more reliable, suggesting a graded allocation of internal selective attention that depended on cue reliability (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berryhill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ester and Pytel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gözenman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunseli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shimi et al., 2014</xref>). More direct evidence for this graded attentional allocation came from our two continuous markers of internal attentional orienting. First, we found a robust spatial lateralization of alpha activity in all conditions, but also found that this modulation was more pronounced following more reliable cues. This is consistent with several prior studies demonstrating graded alpha lateralization according to cue reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Günseli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haegens et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to this more established marker, we here also tracked internal attentional allocation via spatial biases in saccade directions, building on several prior studies from our lab that have demonstrated spatial biases in microsaccade directions as a reliable marker of internal orienting of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Draschkow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Ede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Ede et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and van Ede, 2024</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a graded modulation of this gaze marker of attention shifts within the spatial layout of visual working memory.</p><p>While we observe clearly graded modulations in the trial average, it is notoriously hard to know whether attentional allocation was also graded at the single-trial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stokes et al., 2015</xref>). For example, following 80% reliable cues, it could be that participants consistently deployed 80% of their full ‘attention potential’, or deployed their full attention potential in 80% of the trials. Disambiguating these alternatives is challenging, and beyond the scope of our work. In addition, while it is of interest to understand to what extend our two markers track the same vs. distinct components of internal attention, this too is beyond the scope of our current study and instead, we refer the reader to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>A central novelty of our study is the demonstration of attentional re-orienting after the working-memory test – and its dependence on the reliability of the preceding retrocue. While ample studies from the study of external attention have considered spatial re-orienting of attention to unexpected perceptual targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbetta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbetta et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doricchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Posner, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Posner et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Posner and Cohen, 1984</xref>), the study of spatial attentional deployment of working memory has predominantly focused on spatial orienting in response to retrocues, without additionally considering <italic>re</italic>-orienting in response to expected/unexpected memory tests (the analog of expected/unexpected targets in perceptual-attention studies).</p><p>To date, several prior studies have demonstrated how attention can dynamically orient and re-orient to previously encoded memory items in anticipation of the memory test, such as following sequential retrocues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vries et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2020</xref>), or following expectations that designated one item relevant early and another late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Ede et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>). In these studies, orienting/re-orienting happened while anticipating which memory item would become tested. In contrast, our findings of attentional re-orienting specifically concern spatial re-orienting in response to the memory test; not in anticipation of this test. While ample prior studies have considered processes related to retrieval at the memory test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ester and Pytel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Souza et al., 2016</xref>), or reselection at memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Wyble, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2023</xref>), we uniquely focused on deployment of spatial attention to the tested memory item (not general, non-spatial cognitive processes related to retrieval, or attentional reselection to decide what features to be encoded into working memory). We were in a unique position to isolate such spatial deployment of attention following the test, because our memory test was always centrally presented while our memory items were presented lateralized.</p><p>Regarding our findings in response to the memory test, we have three key findings that we discuss in turn. First, we show that attentional deployment after the memory test only occurs when the cue leaves some uncertainty regarding which memory item will be tested. When the cue is 100% reliable, participants may drop the other memory item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gözenman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gressmann and Janczyk, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin and Nobre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunseli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oberauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pertzov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Moorselaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Williams et al., 2013</xref>) or transform the relevant item into a different format (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larocque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LaRocque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>) that does not invoke spatial revisiting after the memory test. For example, participants may transform the relevant item into the appropriate action plan, when 100% certain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henderson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nasrawi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nasrawi and van Ede, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Olivers and Roelfsema, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schneider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Ede et al., 2019b</xref>). In contrast, when the other item cannot be dropped, in the case of cues that leave some uncertainty, the memory items likely preserve their spatial organization, inviting spatial deployment of attention following the memory test.</p><p>Second, we found attentional deployment in mind not only following unexpected memory tests – for which attention required to be <italic>re-</italic>directed to the unexpected memory item – but also following expected memory tests. This suggests that, when both items could become tested, participants continued to rely on the memory test to revisit the appropriate memory item, even when they had already attended it after the cue. In other words, participants may engage in a second-stage verification (‘double checking’) in mind, whenever cues do not predict memory tests with certainty. Indeed, when sorting the trials by whether participants were likely to have already attended the cued memory item following the preceding retrocue, we found no evidence that having previously attended the memory item diminished the attentional deployment after the test.</p><p>Third, we found a clear difference in spatial deployment of attention following expected and unexpected memory tests. Specifically, spatial deployment (re-orienting) of attention in mind was prolonged when the test prompted a report for the memory item that was not expected to become tested. This is consistent with the slowing of memory-guided behavior that is typically found after unexpected memory tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin and Nobre, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lepsien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsukura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rerko and Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Moorselaar et al., 2014</xref>, for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Souza and Oberauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Ede and Nobre, 2023</xref>), as also observed in the current study. At the same time, we found no evidence that unexpected memory tests resulted in delayed attentional allocation to the appropriate item, as would be expected if the internal focus of attention first had to be ‘disengaged’ before it could be relocated. Thus, while unexpected memory tests do not delay the process of re-orienting in mind to the appropriate memory content, attentional deployment did become prolonged when re-focusing the unexpected memory item, likely reflecting prolonged effort to extract the relevant information from the memory item that was not expected to be tested. However, there may also be alternative accounts for this observation, such as suppressing a learned tendency to saccade in the direction of the expected item following an unexpected memory test.</p><p>By considering two markers of spatial orienting/re-orienting of internal selective attention, we were in the unique position to assess their utility for tracking attentional focusing in memory. Though we found both EEG-alpha and gaze markers to robustly track spatial orienting following the retrocue, only gaze showed a clear pattern of re-orienting in response to the test stimulus. In our task, the test stimulus was a large central stimulus that may have attenuated alpha activity, possibly making it challenging to find spatial modulations in alpha activity (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Ede et al., 2014</xref>), without similarly affecting gaze. In future studies, it will prove interesting to more carefully delineate such factors and to more carefully compare the utility and function of both markers.</p><p>Collectively, our findings delineate the dynamics of spatial orienting and re-orienting of attention in visual working memory following attentional retrocues and memory tests. By testing working memory items centrally, our data uniquely reveal a second stage of internal attentional deployment following expected and unexpected memory tests. We unveil that participants revisit tested memory content even when contents were already previously attended – suggesting a second verification (‘double checking’) in mind. Moreover, when tests prompted unexpected memory content, we found that re-orienting in mind became prolonged, putatively reflecting a prolonged effort to re-sample unexpected content from memory. These findings bring attentional re-orienting to the domain of working memory and underscore the relevance of studying attentional dynamics in memory not only following explicit attention cues, but also following ensuing memory tests that can invoke a revision or verification of our internal focus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-four healthy human volunteers participated in the experiment (age ranges from 19 to 28; 17 females and 7 males, all right-handed).

All participants provided written informed consent, and consent to publish prior to participation and were reimbursed 10 euros per hour as compensation for their time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Task and procedure</title><p>Participants performed an internal selective-attention task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) whereby a retrospective cue (i.e. retrocue) informed participants which of the two previously encoded memory items was either certain (100%) or more likely (80/60%) to become tested for an ensueing behavioral orientation-reproduction report.</p><p>Each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) began with an encoding display containing two to-be-memorized gratings (with different colors and orientations) for 200 ms, followed by an initial delay period with a central fixation cross that remained on the screen for 800 ms. Then, the central fixation cross changed its color to match the color of one of the memorized gratings for 200 ms, acting as the attentional cue that predicted which memory item would most likely become tested after another delay. After the second delay interval (1300 ms) following the cue, participants were presented with the centrally presented memory test with a random orientation and were instructed to reproduce the precise orientation of the tested memory item by moving the mouse with their dominant hand (right hand) and terminating the report by clicking the mouse button. A feedback score ranging from 0 to 100 was given after each report (with score of 100 reflecting the minimum error of 0, and score of 0 reflecting the maximum error of 90 degrees).</p><p>In a block-wise manipulation, we employed four cue-reliability conditions: informative 100%, 80%, and 60% cue-reliability conditions, and an imperative 100% cue-reliability condition. In the informative cue conditions, we always indicated which memory item to report via the color of the memory test. In the 100% condition, the color of the cue predicted the color of the upcoming test stimulus with 100% reliability. In the 80% condition, the cue predicted the color of the upcoming test correctly in 80% of trials (valid-cue trials), while in the remaining 20% of trials the cue was invalid and the uncued memory item was tested instead (invalid-cue trials). The 60% condition was identical except now the cue was only 60% reliable (60% valid-cue trials, 40% invalid-cue trials). Because in all the three informative-cue conditions, participants needed to make a report based on the color of the test grating, it was possible that participants could neglect the attentional cue even when it was 100% reliable. We, therefore, added a fourth condition, the imperative 100% cue-reliability condition. In this block, the cue was again 100% reliable, but the color of the test grating was always black such that participants were forced to use the color of the cue to know which memory item they would need to report.</p><p>Each participant completed two sessions, one informative-cue session and one imperative-cue session. We did this, so that participants would only have to switch once between blocks with a colored vs. a black memory test. Before starting each session, participants practiced 20 trials of the 100%-reliable cue with the respective testing style (color test for informative session, black test for imperative session) for about 5 minutes. The session sequence was counterbalanced across participants. For the informative-cue session, participants finished three blocks of 250 trials each for the 100%, 80%, and 60% conditions, respectively, and the sequence of different cue-reliability was pseudorandomized and counterbalanced across participants. For the imperative-cue session, participants finished one block of 250 trials for the 100%-reliable cue condition.

A fast independent component analysis (ICA), as implemented in the Fieldtrip, was then applied to the EEG epochs to remove components associated with blinks and eye movements. ICA components that captured eye blinks and horizontal eye movements were removed after inspecting the correlations between each component with the VEOG (vertical electrooculography: the difference signal between the electrodes above and below the right eye) and the HEOG (horizontal electrooculography: the difference signal between the electrodes horizontally next to the left and right eye) signal, respectively. A visual inspection method by using ‘ft_rejectvisual.m’ function in Fieldtrip with the ‘summary’ method was then applied and trials with exceptionally high variance were removed as artifact trials.

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), the calculation of the alpha lateralization focused on posterior electrode clusters (left: O1, PO7, PO3, P9, P7, P5, P3, P1, O2; right: PO8, PO4, P10, P8, P6, P4, P2). In addition, to obtain topographical maps of lateralization, we contrasted alpha power for left and right attention trials (i.e. ((left-right)/(left +right))×100) for all electrodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Eye-tracking acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>The eye tracker (EyeLink 1000, SR Research SR) was positioned ∼5 cm in front of the monitor on a table(~65 cm away from the eyes). Horizontal and vertical gaze position was continuously recorded for single eye at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Before recording, the eye tracker was calibrated through the built-in calibration and validation protocols from the Eye-Link software. Participants were asked to keep their chin on the chin rest for the entire block after calibration.</p><p>Offline, eye-tracking data were converted from the .edf to the .asc format, and were read into MATLAB through Fieldtrip. Blinks were marked by detecting clusters of zeros in the eye-tracking data. Then the data from 100 ms before to 100 ms after the detected blink clusters were turned to Not-a-Number (NaN) and excluded from further analysis to eliminate residual blink artifacts. After blink rejection, data were epoched, once relative to the cue onset and once relative to the memory test onset (equivalent to our EEG analyses).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Saccade detection</title><p>We employed a velocity-based method to detect saccades. This method was built on other established velocity-based methods for saccade detection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engbert and Kliegl, 2003</xref>), and has been successfully applied for saccade detection in working memory retrocue tasks similar to the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Since the memory items in the current experiment were always presented horizontally (i.e. center-left, and center-right), our saccade detection focused on the horizontal channel of the eye data – an approach we have previously demonstrated to be effective in capturing directional biases in saccades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We first computed gaze velocity by measuring the distance between consecutive temporal gaze positions. To enhance precision and diminish noise, we applied temporal smoothing to the velocity using a Gaussian-weighted moving average filter with a 7 ms sliding window, utilizing the ‘smoothdata’ function in MATLAB. We then determined the onset of a saccade as the first sample where the velocity surpassed a trial-based threshold set at five times the median velocity. To prevent multiple classifications of the same saccade, we enforced a minimum delay of 100 ms between successive saccades. Saccade magnitude and direction were determined by assessing the disparity between pre-saccade gaze position (from –50–0 ms before threshold crossing) and post-saccade gaze position (from 50 to 100 ms after threshold crossing). Finally, each identified saccade was categorized as ‘toward’ or ‘away’ based on its direction (left/right) and the side of the cued memory item (left/right). ‘Toward’ denoted a saccade aligned with the memorized location of the cued item, while ‘away’ indicated a saccade opposite to the memorized location of the cued item. Following saccade identification and labeling, we quantified the time courses of saccade rates (in Hz) using a sliding time window of 50 ms, progressing in 1 ms increments. For our main analyses, we focused directly on the spatial bias in saccades, calculated simply as the differences (in Hz) between toward and away saccades. We also separately show toward and away saccade rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Saccade latency analysis</title><p>To compare the latency of the time-series data of the spatial saccade bias after the memory test, we applied a simplified jackknife method (as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smulders, 2010</xref>) to compare the latency of onset and offset of the saccade bias between validly and invalidly cued memory tests in the reporting stage. The onset latency and offset latency were defined by the time point that the amplitude reaches or drops to 50% of the peak value, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the jackknife-based latency analysis, we further applied a fractional area latency (FAL) method to the saccade bias comparison between validly and invalidly cued memory tests to rule out the contribution of the peak amplitude difference into the onset and offset latency difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen and Hillyard, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiesel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luck, 2005</xref>). We first defined the onset and offset latency of the saccade bias as the first time point at which 25% or 75% of the total area of the component has been reached, relative to a lower boundary of a difference of 0.3 Hz between toward and away saccades (to remove the influence of noise fluctuations in our difference time course below this lower boundary). The extracted onset and offset latency for all participants was then compared using paired-samples t-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Saccade-toward trials extraction</title><p>To assess whether our findings of re-orienting at the test phase were contingent on the initial orienting following the cue, we aimed to separate trials based on saccades following the cue. To extract those trials in which we could have increased confidence that participants had used the cue at the single-trial level, we classified trials into whether a saccade in the direction toward the cued memory item was detected or not in the critical time window of 200–600 ms after the cue (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, after getting the usable eye traces for each epoch, we extracted trials with discernible saccades (gaze shifts) detected in the 200–600 ms post-cue period and in which the direction of the first saccade matched the memorized location of the cued item as the ‘toward-saccade after the cue’ trials (80% cue-reliability blocks: 65.5±27.8 trials; 60% cue reliability blocks: 60.8±27.8 trials). Alternatively, all other remaining trials were labeled as the ‘no toward-saccade after the cue’ rials (80%: 184.5±27.8 trials; 60%: 189.2±27.8 trials). Following this trial separation rule based on the data at the cue stage, we then compared saccade biases in response to the test stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical evaluation for the behavioral data was achieved first by one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs on the absolute reproduction error and RTs of all cue-reliabilities (imperative 100%, informative 100%, 80%, and 60% blocks), respectively. For the comparison between trials with valid vs. invalid cues (which were only available in the 80% and 60% blocks), paired-sample t-tests between validly and invalidly cued trials were applied to the reproduction error and the response time, respectively. To test whether cue-validity effects depended on cue reliability, we additionally employed as two-way repeated measures ANOVA with the factors of cue-validity (valid/invalid) and cue-reliability (80/60%). A Bonferroni method was applied for multiple-comparison correction. All reported <italic>p</italic> values are Bonferroni corrected.</p><p>To statistically assess the temporal profiles of the spatial modulations in EEG activity (alpha lateralization) and eye movements (spatial saccade bias), we employed a cluster-based permutation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) using the fieldtrip ‘ft_timelockstatistics’ function with ‘montecarlo’ method. This method is well-suited for evaluating the consistency of data patterns at multiple adjacent data points under a single permutation distribution of the largest cluster, effectively bypassing the multiple-comparisons problem. We conducted 10,000 permutations to construct the permutation distribution of the largest cluster that would be obtained by chance and identified clusters using Fieldtrip’s default settings, which involve grouping temporally adjacent data points with the same sign that were statistically significant in a mass univariate t-test at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Cluster size was defined as the sum of all <italic>t</italic> values within a cluster. We applied this procedure to test the time-series of spatial biases (alpha lateralization and saccade bias after cue) against 0 and to directly compare spatial biases between validly and invalidly cued memory tests (saccade bias after test).</p><p>In addition to the statistical evaluations that considered the full time-courses, we also used a-priori knowledge from prior studies to zoom in on relevant time windows for both outcome measures. This served mainly to ease direct comparison between our cue-reliability conditions. For alpha lateralization, we zoomed in on the a-priori-defined 400–800 ms post-cue window, based on the same window used for visualization in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Ede et al., 2019a</xref>. Likewise, for the spatial saccade bias, we zoomed in on the a-priori-defined 200–600 ms post-cue window based on a prior study from our lab that revealed how this is the critical window after cue onset in which saccade directions are biased toward the memorized location of the cued memory target (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For the saccade bias latency comparison between validly and invalidly cued memory tests, the estimates of latency from the employed jackknife method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smulders, 2010</xref>) were compared between validly and invalidly cued memory tests using paired-samples t-tests.</p><p>Where relevant, we also employed Bayesian analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rouder et al., 2017</xref>) to evaluate how many times the null hypothesis was favored compared to the hypothesis that a difference between the two conditions might exist.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Scientific and Ethical Review Board (VCWE) of the Faculty of Behavior &amp; Movement Sciences, VU University Amsterdam (reference number: VCWE-2021-009).

Using a combination of spatial modulations in neural activity (EEG-alpha lateralization) and gaze bias quantified as time courses of microsaccade rate, the authors examined how retro cues with varying levels of reliability influence attentional deployment and subsequent memory performance. The conclusion is that attentional re-orienting occurs within visual working memory, even when tested centrally, with distinct patterns following expected and unexpected tests. The findings provide new value for the field and are likely of broad interest and impact, by highlighting working memory as an action-bound process (in)dependent on (an ambiguous) past.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study uniquely integrates behavioral data (accuracy and reaction time), EEG-alpha activity, and gaze tracking to provide a comprehensive analysis of attentional re-orienting within visual working memory. As typical for this research group, the validity of the findings follows from the task design that effectively manipulates the reliability of retro cues and isolates attentional processes related to memory tests. The use of well-established markers for spatial attention (i.e. alpha lateralization) and more recently entangled dependent variable (gaze bias) is commendable. Utilizing these dependent metrics, the concise report presents a thorough analysis of the scaling effects of cue reliability on attentional deployment, both at the behavioral and neural levels. The clear demonstration of prolonged attentional deployment following unexpected memory tests is particularly noteworthy, although there are no significant time clusters per definition as time isn't a factor in a statistical sense, the jackknife approach is convincing. Overall, the evidence is compelling, allowing the conclusion of a second stage of internal attentional deployment following both expected and unexpected memory tests, highlighting the importance of memory verification and re-orienting processes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I want to stress upfront that these are not specific to the presented work and do not affect my recommendation to offer the report to the public in its present form.</p><p>The sample size is consistent with previous studies, a larger sample could enhance the generalizability and robustness of the findings. The authors acknowledge high noise levels in EEG-alpha activity, which may affect the reliability of this marker. This is a general issue in non-invasive electrophysiology that cannot be handled by the authors but an interested reader should be aware of it. Effectively, the sensitivity of the gaze analysis appears &quot;better&quot; in part due to the better SNR. The latter also sets the boundaries for single trial analyses as the authors correctly mention. In terms of generalizability, I am convinced that the main outcome will likely generalize to different samples and stimulus types. Yet, as typical for the field, future research could explore different contexts and task demands to validate and extend the findings. The authors provide here how and why (including sharing of data and code).</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Really nice work, Thank you!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100532.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Sisi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>VU Amsterdam</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Ede</surname><given-names>Freek</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the study &quot;Re-focusing visual working memory during expected and unexpected memory tests&quot; by Sisi Wang and Freek van Ede, the authors investigate the dynamics of attentional re-orienting within visual working memory (VWM). Utilizing a robust combination of behavioral measures, electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking, the research presents a compelling exploration of how attention is redirected within VWM under varying conditions. The research question addresses a significant gap in our understanding of cognitive processes, particularly how expected and unexpected memory tests influence the focus and re-focus of attention. The experimental design is meticulously crafted, enabling a thorough investigation of these dynamics. The figures presented are clear and effectively illustrate the findings, while the writing is concise and accessible, making the complex concepts understandable. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of visual working memory and attentional re-orienting, contributing meaningfully to the field of cognitive neuroscience. Despite the strengths of the manuscript, there are several areas where improvements could be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this summary and positive appraisal of our study and our findings. In addition, we are of course grateful for the excellent suggestions for improvements that we have embraced to further strengthen our article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Microsaccades or Saccades?</p><p>In the manuscript, the terms &quot;microsaccades&quot; and &quot;saccades&quot; are used interchangeably. For instance, &quot;microsaccades&quot; are mentioned in the keywords, whereas &quot;saccades&quot; appear in the results section. It is crucial to differentiate between these two concepts. Saccades are large, often deliberate eye movements used for scanning and shifting attention, while microsaccades are small, involuntary movements that maintain visual perception during fixation. The authors note the connection between microsaccades and attention, but it is not well-recognized that saccades are directly linked to attention. Despite the paradigm involving a fixation point, it remains unclear whether large eye movements (saccades) were removed from the analysis. The authors mention the relationship between microsaccades and attention but do not clarify whether large eye movements (saccades) were excluded from the analysis. If large eye movements were removed during data processing, this should be documented in the manuscript, including clear definitions of &quot;microsaccades&quot; and &quot;saccades.&quot; If such trials were not removed, the contribution of large eye movements to the results should be shown, and an explanation provided as to why they should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this relevant point. Before turning to this relevant distinction, we first wish to clarify how, for our main aim of tracking the dynamics of ‘re-orienting in working memory’, any spatial modulation in gaze – be it driven by micro- or macro-saccades – suits this purpose. Having made this explicit, we also fully agree that disambiguating the nature of the saccade bias during internal focusing has additional value.</p><p>Because it is notoriously challenging (or at least inherently arbitrary) to draw an absolute fixed boundary between macro- and microsaccades, we instead decided to adopt a two-stage approach to our analysis (building on prior studies from our lab, e.g., de Vries et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). In the first step, we analysed spatial biases in all detected saccades no matter their size (hence our labelling of them as “saccades” when describing these analyses). In a second step, we decomposed and visualized the saccade-rate effect as a function of saccade size in degrees. This second stage directly exposed the ‘nature’ of the saccade bias, as we visualized in Figure 2c (with time on the x axis, saccade size on the y axis, and the spatial modulation color coded). Because these visualizations directly address this major comment, we have now made these key set of results much clearer in our work (we agree that our original visualization of this key aspect of our data was suboptimal). In addition, we have added similar plot for the saccade data in the test-phase in Supplementary Figure S2b.</p><p>These complementary analyses show how the saccade bias (more toward than away saccades) is indeed predominantly driven by small saccades (hence are labelling as “micro-saccades” when interpreting our findings), and less so by larger saccades associated with looking back all the way to the location where the memory item had been presented at encoding (positioned at 6 degrees). This is important as it helps to arbitrate between fixational/micro-saccadic eye-movement biases (previously associated with covert and internal attention shifts; cf. de Vries et al., 2023; Engbert and Kliegl, 2003; Hafed and Clark, 2002; Liu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022) vs. larger eye movements back to the original locations of the item (previously associated with ‘looking at nothing’ during memory retrieval and imagery; cf. Brandt and Stark, 1997; Ferreira et al., 2008; Johansson and Johansson, 2014; Laeng et al., 2014; Martarelli and Mast, 2013; Spivey and Geng, 2001). By adopting this visualization, we can show this while preserving the richness of our data, and without having to a-priori set an (inherently arbitrary) threshold for classifying saccades as either “macro” or “micro”.</p><p>Having explained our rationale, we nevertheless agree with the reviewer that it is worth showing how our time course results hold up when only considering fixational eye movements below 2 visual degrees, which we consider “fixational” provided that our memory stimuli at encoding were presented at 6 visual degrees from central fixation. We show this in Supplementary Figure S1. As can be seen below, our main saccade bias results stay almost the same when restricting our analyses exclusively to fixational saccades within 2 degrees, both when considering our data after the retrocue (Supplementary Figure S1a) as well as after the memory test (Supplementary Figure S1b).</p><p>Because we agree this is important complementary data, we have now added this as supplementary figures. In addition, we have added the results to our article. We also point to these additional corroborating findings at key instances in our article:</p><p>Page 5 (Results)</p><p>“As in prior studies from our lab with similar experimental set-ups, internal attentional focusing was predominantly driven by fixational micro-saccades (small, involuntary eye-movements around current fixation). To reveal this in the current study, we decomposed and visualized the observed saccade-rate effect as a function of saccade size (Figure 2c), following the same procedure as we have adopted in other recent studies on this bias (de Vries et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). As shown in the saccade-size-over-time plots in Figure 2c, also in the current study, the difference between toward and away saccades (with red colours denoting more toward saccades) was predominantly driven by fixational saccades in the micro-saccades range (&lt; 2°).”</p><p>“Moreover, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1a, complementary analyses show that our time course (saccade bias) results hold even when exclusively considering eye movements below 2 visual degrees that we defined as “fixational” provided that the memory items were presented 6 visual degrees from the fixation during encoding. This further corroborates that the bias observed during internal attentional focusing was predominantly driven by fixational micro-saccades rather than looking back to the encoded location of the memory items (cf. Johansson and Johansson, 2014; Richardson and Spivey, 2000; Spivey and Geng, 2001; Wynn et al., 2019).”</p><p>Page 7 (Results):</p><p>“As shown in the corresponding saccade-size-over-time plots in Supplementary Figure S2b, consistent with what we observed following the cue, the difference between toward and away saccades following the test was again predominantly driven by saccades in the fixational microsaccade range (&lt; 2°), and the time course (saccade bias) results hold even when exclusively considering fixational eye movements below 2 visual degrees (Supplementary Figure S1b). Thus, just like mnemonic focusing after the cue, re-orienting after the memory test was also predominantly reflected in fixational micro-saccades, and not looking back at the original location of the memory items that were encoded at 6 degrees away from central fixation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alpha Lateralization in Attentional Re-orienting</p><p>In the attentional orienting section of the results (Figure 2), the authors effectively present EEG alpha lateralization results with time-frequency plots and topographic maps. However, in the attentional reorienting section (Figure 3), these visualizations are absent. It is important to note that the time period in attentional orienting differs from attentional re-orienting, and consequently, the time-frequency plots and topographic maps may also differ. Therefore, it may be invalid to compute alpha lateralization without a clear alpha activity difference. The authors should consider including timefrequency plots and topographic maps for the attentional re-orienting period to validate their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer also for this constructive suggestion. The reason we did not expand on the time-frequency maps and topographies at the test-stage was the relative lack of alpha effects at the test stage (compared to the clearer alpha modulations after the retrocue). Nevertheless, we agree that including these data will increase transparency and the comprehensiveness of our article. We now added time-frequency plots and topographic maps for alpha lateralization in response to the workingmemory test in Supplementary Figure S2. As can be seen, the time-frequency plots and topographies in the re-focusing period after the working-memory test were consistent with our time-series plots in Figure 3a – reinforcing how alpha lateralization is generally not clear following the working-memory test. In accordance with this relevant addition, we added the following in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Page 7 (Results):</p><p>“For complementary time-frequency and topographical visualizations, see Supplementary Figure S2a.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Onset and Offset Latency of Saccade Bias</p><p>The use of the 50% peak to determine the onset and offset latency of the saccade bias is problematic. For example, if one condition has a higher peak amplitude than another, the standard for saccade bias onset would be higher, making the observed differences between the onset/offset latencies potentially driven by amplitude rather than the latencies themselves. The authors should consider a more robust method for determining saccade bias onset and offset that accounts for these amplitude differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this valuable point. We agree that the calculation of onset and offset latencies of the saccade bias could be influenced by the peak amplitude of the waveforms. Thus, we further conducted the Fractional Area Latency (FAL) analysis on the comparison of the saccade bias following the working-memory test between valid cue (expected test) and invalid cue (unexpected test) trials. The FAL analysis has been commonly applied to Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to estimate the latency of ERP components (Hansen and Hillyard, 1980; Luck, 2005). Instead of relying on the peak latency, the FAL method calculates latency based on a predefined fraction of the area under the waveform. This can provide a more robust measure of component latency. Prompted by this comment, we now also applied FAL analysis to our saccade bias waveforms. This corroborated our original conclusion. Because we believe this is an important complement, we now added these additional outcomes to our article:</p><p>Page 9 (Results):</p><p>“We additionally conducted Fractional Area Latency (FAL) analysis on the comparison of the saccade bias following the memory test between valid- and invalid-cue trials to rule out the potential contribution of peak amplitude differences into the onset and offset latency differences (Hansen and Hillyard, 1980; Kiesel et al., 2008; Luck, 2005). Consistent with our jackknife-based latency analysis, the FAL analysis revealed a significantly prolonged saccade bias following the unexpected tests (the invalid-cue trials) vs. expected tests (the valid-cue trials) in both 80% and 60% cue-reliability conditions (411 ms vs. 463 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(14)</sub> = 2.358, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034; 417 ms vs. 468 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 2.168, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047; for 80% and 60%, respectively). Again, there was no significant difference in onset latency following unexpected vs. expected tests. (346 ms vs. 374 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(14)</sub> = 2.052, <italic>p</italic> = 0.060; 353 ms vs. 401 ms, <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub> = 1.577, <italic>p</italic> = 0.136; for 80% and 60%, respectively).”</p><p>In accordance, we also added the following to our Methods:</p><p>Page 18 (Methods):</p><p>“In addition to the jackknife-based latency analysis, we further applied a Fractional Area Latency (FAL) method to the saccade bias comparison between validly and invalidly cued memory tests to rule out the contribution of the peak amplitude difference into the onset and offset latency difference (Hansen and Hillyard, 1980; Kiesel et al., 2008; Luck, 2005). We first defined the onset and offset latency of the saccade bias as the first time point at which 25% or 75% of the total area of the component has been reached, relative to a lower boundary of a difference of 0.3 Hz between toward and away saccades (to remove the influence of noise fluctuations in our difference time course below this lower boundary). The extracted onset and offset latency for all participants was then compared using paired-samples t-tests.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Control Analysis for Trials Not Using the Initial Cue</p><p>The control analysis for trials where participants did not use the initial cue raises several questions:</p><p>(1) The authors claim that &quot;unlike continuous alpha activity, saccades are events that can be classified on a single-trial level.&quot; However, alpha activity can also be analyzed at the single-trial level, as demonstrated by studies like &quot;Alpha Oscillations in the Human Brain Implement Distractor Suppression Independent of Target Selection&quot; by Wöstmann et al. (2019). If single-trial alpha activity can be used, it should be included in additional control analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that alpha activity can also be analyzed at the single-trial level. However, because alpha is a continuous signal, single-trial alpha activity will necessarily be graded (trials with <italic>more</italic> or <italic>less</italic> alpha power). This is still different from saccades, that are not continuous signals but true ‘events’ (either a saccade was made, or no saccade was made, with no continuum in between). Because of this unique property, it is possible to sort trials by whether a saccade was present (and, if present, by its direction), in an all-or-none way that is not possible for alpha activity that can only be sorted by its graded amplitude/power. This is the key distinction underlying our motivation to sort the trials based on saccades, as we now make clearer:</p><p>Page 10 (Results):</p><p>“Although alpha can also be analyzed as the single trial level (e.g. Macdonald et al., 2011; Wöstmann et al., 2019; for a review, see Kosciessa et al., 2020), saccades offer the unique opportunity to split trials not by graded amplitude fluctuations but by discrete all-or-none events.”</p><p>In addition, please note how our saccade markers were also more reliable/sensitive, especially in the subsequent memory-test-phase of interest. This is another reason we decided to focus this control analysis on saccades and not alpha activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors aimed to test whether the re-orienting signal observed after the test is not driven exclusively by trials where participants did not use the initial cue. They hypothesized that &quot;in such a scenario, we should only observe attention deployment after the test stimulus in trials in which participants did not use the preceding retro cue.&quot; However, if the saccade bias is the index for attentional deployment, the authors should conduct a statistical test for significant saccade bias rather than only comparing toward-saccade after-cue trials with no-toward-saccade after-cue trials. The null results between the two conditions do not immediately suggest that there is attention deployment in both conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. We fully agree and, in fact, we had conducted the relevant statistical analysis for each of the conditions separately (in addition to their comparison). Upon reflection, we came to realize that in our original submission it was easy to overlook this point, and therefore thank the reviewer for flagging this. To make this clearer, we now also added the relevant statistical clusters in Figure 4a,b and more clearly report them in the associated text:</p><p>Page 10 (Results):</p><p>“As we show in Figure 4a,b, we found clear gaze signatures of attentional deployment in response to expected (valid) memory tests, no matter whether we had pre-selected trials in which we had also seen such deployment after the cue in gaze (cluster P: 0.115, 0.041, 0.027, &lt;0.001 for 80%-valid, 60%-valid, 80%-invalid, 60%-invalid trials, respectively), or not (cluster P: 0.016, 0.009, 0.001, &lt;0.001 for 80%-valid, 60%-valid, 80%-invalid, 60%-invalid trials, respectively).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Even if attention deployment occurs in both conditions, the prolonged re-orienting effect could also be caused by trials where participants did not use the initial cue. Unexpected trials usually involve larger and longer brain activity. The authors should perform the same analysis on the time after the removal of trials without toward-saccade after the cue to address this potential confound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this. It is crucial to point out, however, that after any given 80% or 60% reliable cue, the participants cannot yet know whether the subsequent memory test in that trial will be expected (valid cue) or unexpected (invalid cue). Accordingly, the prolonged re-orienting after unexpected vs. expected memory tests cannot be explained by differential use of the cue (i.e., differential cue-use cannot be a “confound” for differential responses to expected and unexpected memory tests, as observed within the 80 and 60% cue-reliability conditions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study utilized EEG-alpha activity and saccade bias to quantify the spatial allocation of attention during a working memory task. The findings indicate a second stage of internal attentional deployment following the appearance of a memory test, revealing distinct patterns between expected and unexpected test trials. The spatial bias observed during the expected test suggests a memory verification process, whereas the prolonged spatial bias during the unexpected test suggests a reorienting response to the memory test. This work offers novel insights into the dynamics of attentional deployment, particularly in terms of orienting and re-orienting following both the cue and memory test.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The inclusion of both EEG-alpha activity and saccade bias yields consistent results in quantifying the attentional orienting and re-orienting processes. The data clearly delineate the dynamics of spatial attentional shifts in working memory. The findings of a second stage of attentional re-orienting may enhance our understanding of how memorized information is retrieved.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although analyses of neural signatures and saccade bias provided clear evidence regarding the dynamics of spatial attention, the link between these signatures and behavioral performance remains unclear. Given the novelty of this study in proposing a second stage of 'verification' of memory contents, it would be more informative to present evidence demonstrating how this verification process enhances memory performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive summary of our work and for highlighting key strengths. We also appreciate the constructive suggestions, such as addressing the link between our observed refocusing signals and behavioral performance in our task. We now performed these additional analyses and added their outcomes to the revised article, as we detail in response to comment 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2 shows graded spatial modulations in both EEG-alpha activity and saccade bias. However, while the imperative 100% cue conditions and 100% validity conditions largely overlap in EEG-alpha activity, a clear difference is present between these two conditions in saccade bias. The cause of the difference in saccade bias is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting difference. At this stage, it is hard to know with certainty whether this reflects a genuine difference in our 100% reliable and 100% imperative cue conditions that is selectively picked up by our gaze but not alpha marker. Alternatively, this may reflect differential sensitivity of our two markers to different sources of noise. Either way, we agree that this observation is worth calling out and reflecting on when discussing these results:</p><p>Page 6 (Results):</p><p>“It’s worth noting that while alpha lateralization shows very comparable amplitudes in the imperative-100% and 100% conditions, the saccade bias was larger following imperative-100% vs. 100% reliable cues. This may reflect a difference between these two cueing conditions that is selectively picked up by our gaze marker (though it may also reflect differential sensitivity of our two markers to different sources of noise). […]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3 shows signatures of attentional re-orienting after the memory test presented at the center. When the cue was not 100% valid, a noticeable saccade bias towards the memorized location of the test item was observed. This finding was explained as reflecting a re-orienting to the mnemonic contents. To strengthen this interpretation, I suggest providing evidence for the link between the attentional re-orienting signatures and memory performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. We now sorted trials by behavioral performance using a median split on RT (fast-RT vs. slow-RT trials) and reproduction error (highaccuracy vs. low-accuracy trials). Because we believe the outcomes of these analyses increase transparency as well as the comprehensiveness of our article, we have now included them as Supplementary Figure S3.</p><p>As shown below, we were able to link the saccade bias following the memory test to subsequent performance, but this reached significance only for the 80% valid-cue trials when splitting by RT (cluster P = 0.001). For the other conditions, we could not establish a reliable difference by our performance splits. Possibly this is due to a lack of sensitivity, given the relatively large number of conditions we had and, consequently, the relatively small number of trials we therefore had per condition (particularly in the invalid-cue condition with unexpected memory tests). We now bring forward these additional outcomes at the relevant section in our Results:</p><p>Page 7 (Results):</p><p>“We also sorted patterns of gaze bias after the memory test by performance but could only establish a link between this gaze bias and RT following expected memory tests in our 80% cuereliability condition (cluster P = 0.001, Supplementary Figure S3). The lack of significant statistical differences in the remaining conditions may possibly reflect a lack of sensitivity (insufficient trial numbers) for this additional analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) When comparing the time course of attentional re-orienting after the memory test, a prolonged attentional re-orienting was observed for unexpected memory tests compared to the expected ones. While the onset latency was similar for unexpected and expected memory tests, the offset latency was prolonged for the unexpected memory test. Could this be attributed to the learned tendency to saccade toward the expected location in more valid trials? In this case, the prolonged re-orienting may indicate increased efforts in suppressing the previously learned tendency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this interesting possibility. In our original interpretation, this prolonged signal reflects a longer time needed to bring the unexpected memory content ‘back in focus’ before being able to report its orientation. At the same time, we agree that there are alternative explanations possible, such as the one raised by the reviewer. We now make this clearer when discussing this finding:</p><p>Page 14 (Discussion):</p><p>“[…] attentional deployment did become prolonged when re-focusing the unexpected memory item, likely reflecting prolonged effort to extract the relevant information from the memory item that was not expected to be tested. However, there may also be alternative accounts for this observation, such as suppressing a learned tendency to saccade in the direction of the expected item following an unexpected memory test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) To test whether the re-orienting signature is predominantly influenced by trials where participants delayed the use of cue information until the memory test appeared, the authors sorted the trials based on saccade bias after the initial cue. However, it would be more informative to depict the reorienting patterns by sorting trials based on memory performance. The rationale is that in trials where participants delayed using the initial retro-cue, memory performance (e.g., measured by reproduction error) might be less precise due to the extended memory retention period. Compared to saccade bias for initial orienting, memory performance could provide more reliable evidence as it represents a more independent measure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As delineated in response to comment 2, we now conducted this additional analysis and added the relevant outcomes to our article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) While the number of trials was well-balanced across blocks (~ 240 trials), how did the authors address the imbalance between valid and invalid trials, especially in the 80% cue validity block?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. First, we wish to point out that while trial numbers will indeed impact the sensitivity for finding an effect, trial numbers do not bias the mean – and therefore also not the comparison between means. In this light, it is vital to appreciate that our findings do not reflect a significant effect in valid trials but no significant effect in invalid trials (which we agree could be due to a difference in trial numbers), but rather a statistical difference between valid and invalid trials. This significant difference in the means between valid and invalid true cannot be attributed to a difference in trial numbers between these conditions.</p><p>Having clarified this, we nevertheless agree that it is also worthwhile to empirically validate this assertion and show how our findings hold even when carefully matching the number of trials between valid and invalid conditions (i.e., between expected and unexpected memory tests). To do so, we ran a sub-sampling analysis where we sub-sampled the number of valid trials to match the number of invalid trials available per condition (and averaged the results across 1000 random sub-samplings to increase reliability). As anticipated, this replicated our findings of robust differences between the gaze bias following expected and unexpected memory tests in both our 80 and 60% cue-reliability conditions. We now present these additional outcomes in Supplementary Figure S4.</p><p>Because we agree this is an important re-assuring control analysis, we have now added this to our article:</p><p>Page 9 (Results):</p><p>“To rule out the possibility that the saccade-bias differences following expected and unexpected memory tests are caused by uneven trial numbers (200 vs. 50 trials in the 80% cuereliability condition, 150 vs. 100 trials in the 60% cue-reliability condition), we ran a subsampling analysis where we sub-sampled the number of valid trials to match the number of invalid trials available per condition (averaging the results across 1000 random sub-samplings to increase reliability). As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, this complementary subsampling analysis confirmed that our observed differences between the saccade bias following expected and unexpected memory tests in both 80% and 60% cue-reliability conditions are robust even when carefully matching the number of trials between validly cued (expected) and invalidly cued (unexpected) memory test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wang and van Ede investigate whether and how attention re-orients within visual working memory following expected and unexpected centrally presented memory tests. Using a combination of spatial modulations in neural activity (EEG-alpha lateralization) and gaze bias quantified as time courses of microsaccade rate, the authors examined how retro cues with varying levels of reliability influence attentional deployment and subsequent memory performance. The conclusion is that attentional reorienting occurs within visual working memory, even when tested centrally, with distinct patterns following expected and unexpected tests. The findings provide new value for the field and are likely of broad interest and impact, by highlighting working memory as an action-bound process (in)dependent on (an ambiguous) past.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study uniquely integrates behavioral data (accuracy and reaction time), EEG-alpha activity, and gaze tracking to provide a comprehensive analysis of attentional re-orienting within visual working memory. As typical for this research group, the validity of the findings follows from the task design that effectively manipulates the reliability of retro cues and isolates attentional processes related to memory tests. The use of well-established markers for spatial attention (i.e. alpha lateralization) and more recently entangled dependent variable (gaze bias) is commendable. Utilizing these dependent metrics, the concise report presents a thorough analysis of the scaling effects of cue reliability on attentional deployment, both at the behavioral and neural levels. The clear demonstration of prolonged attentional deployment following unexpected memory tests is particularly noteworthy, although there are no significant time clusters per definition as time isn't a factor in a statistical sense, the jackknife approach is convincing. Overall, the evidence is compelling allowing the conclusion of a second stage of internal attentional deployment following both expected and unexpected memory tests, highlighting the importance of memory verification and re-orienting processes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I want to stress upfront that these weaknesses are not specific to the presented work and do not affect my recommendation of the paper in its present form.</p><p>The sample size is consistent with previous studies, a larger sample could enhance the generalizability and robustness of the findings. The authors acknowledge high noise levels in EEG-alpha activity, which may affect the reliability of this marker. This is a general issue in non-invasive electrophysiology that cannot be handled by the authors but an interested reader should be aware of it. Effectively, the sensitivity of the gaze analysis appears &quot;better&quot; in part due to the better SNR. The latter also sets the boundaries for single-tiral analyses as the authors correctly mention. In terms of generalizability, I am convinced that the main outcome will likely generalize to different samples and stimulus types. Yet, as typical for the field future research could explore different contexts and task demands to validate and extend the findings. The authors provide here how and why (including sharing of data and code).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for summarising our work and for carefully delineating its strengths. We also appreciate the mentioning of relevant generic limitations and agree that important avenues for future studies will be to expand this work with larger sample sizes, complementary measurement techniques, and complementary task contexts and stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the conclusion, Wang and van Ede successfully demonstrate that attentional re-orienting occurs within visual working memory following both expected and unexpected tests. The conclusions are supported by the data and analyses applied, showing that attentional deployment is by the reliability of retro cues. Centrally presented memory tests can invoke either a verification or a revision of internal focus, the latter thus far not considered in both theory and experimental design in cognitive neuroscience.</p><p>I don't have any recommendations that will significantly change the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for having carefully evaluated our work and hope the reviewer will also perceive the changes we made and the additional analyses we added in responses to the other two reviewers as further strengthening our article.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Brandt SA, Stark LW. 1997.
