only immune and inflammatory responses but also maintenance of metabolic fitness of organisms. Combined genetic deficiency of three clusters in the miR-17~92 family drastically shifted macrophage phenotypes toward the inflammatory spectrum characterized by heightened production of pro-inflammatory mediator TNF and diminished expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Consequently, macrophages residing in the adipose tissues from myeloid-specific miRNA triple knockout mice spontaneously developed inflammatory phenotypes and displayed alterations of overall physiological conditions as evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs sustained IL-10 production by promoting transcription of the <italic>Fos</italic> gene, which is secondary to downregulation of <italic>Fos</italic> by transcription factor YY1, a direct target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs. Together, these results identified miR-17~92 family miRNAs as crucial regulators of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and exemplified how macrophage-intrinsic regulatory circuit exerted impactful influence on general physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>interleukin-10</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31821003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31725010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institute for Immunology at Tsinghua University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>miR-17~92 family of miRNAs control the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue macrophages, the absence of which leads to disturbed adipose homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs are a class of short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally in metazoan organisms. miRNAs are processed from their primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are cleaved by enzymes Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) intoÂ ~70 nucleotide precursors (pre-miRNAs) that are further processed by Dicer into theÂ ~22 nucleotide long mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krol et al., 2010</xref>). For approximately 25â40% of miRNAs, their precursors are located in close proximity to other neighboring precursors on chromatin to form miRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altuvia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>), which typically yield mature miRNAs with distinct seed regions that may act coordinately to achieve common functions. miR-17~92 family miRNAs consist of three paralogous miRNA clusters (<italic>Mirc1</italic> [called âmiR-17~92â here], <italic>Mirc2</italic> [called âmiR-106a~363â here],Â and <italic>Mirc3</italic> [called âmiR-106b~25â here]) that encode in total 13 distinct mature miRNAs, which can be further divided into four subfamilies (miR-17, miR-18, miR-19, and miR-25) according to their seed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ventura et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic studies have shown that global deficiency of the miR-17~92 cluster results in embryonic lethality, whereas deletion of miR-106a~363Â or miR-25~363 cluster yields no apparent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ventura et al., 2008</xref>). Functionally, miR-17~92 family miRNAs play an important role in developmental processes and are regarded as oncogenes during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mogilyansky and Rigoutsos, 2013</xref>). In the immune system, miR-17~92 family miRNAs have been implicated inÂ the maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis, regulation of T follicular helper cell differentiation, and modulation of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>). However, relatively little is known about the functions of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in myeloid cells including macrophages.</p><p>Macrophages play an essential role in theÂ maintenance of tissue homeostasis and in innate immunity. In response to various environmental cues, tissue resident macrophages display a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging from highly inflammatory ones typically observed upon infections to homeostatic ones during the processes of tissue repair. The spectrum of phenotypes could be partially attributed to the relative quantities of pro- versus anti-inflammatory mediators such as the antagonizing TNF-IL-10 pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugimoto et al., 2019</xref>). The production of these pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is tightly controlled to achieve an intricate balance, and disruption of such balance has been causally linked with pathogenesis of an array of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bain and Mowat, 2014</xref>). Moreover, the impact of these immune factors reaches far beyond the immune system evidenced by their effects on overall physiological and metabolic conditions. For example, during the development of obesity, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF promote insulin resistance in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olefsky and Glass, 2010</xref>). In the obese adipose tissues, macrophages are the most abundant infiltrating immune cells and the major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odegaard and Chawla, 2011</xref>). Thus, the proper macrophage phenotypes in the adipose tissue microenvironment are critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that miR-17~92 family miRNAs critically controlled the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes in adipose tissue macrophagesÂ (ATMs). Myeloid-specific deletion of three clusters of miR-17~92 family miRNAs twisted ATMs toward a spontaneously inflammatory phenotype characterized by diminished IL-10 and elevated TNF, leading to disrupted adipose homeostasis evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs prevented inflammation by promoting IL-10 expression through a YY1-Fos-IL-10 regulatory circuit engaging both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Collectively, our results uncovered crucial roles of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in regulating macrophage inflammatory phenotypes in the context of adipose homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>miR-17~92 family miRNAs protect mice from obesity</title><p>To investigate the function of miR-17~92 family miRNAs, we generated <italic>Mirc2<sup>â</sup></italic><sup>/â</sup> (called âmiR-106a~363<sup>â/â</sup>â here) <italic>Mirc3<sup>â</sup></italic><sup>/â</sup> (called âmiR-106b~25<sup>â/â'</sup> here) <italic>Mirc1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> (called âmiR-17~92<sup>flox/flox</sup>â here) <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre triple knockout (TKO) mice, which efficiently deleted all miRNAs in miR-17~92 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). Interestingly, we found that TKO mice consistently exhibited increased body weights than age- and gender-matched <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre (WT) control mice at the age of 30 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>). Then we isolated the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) from these mice and found that both the absolute weights of VAT and BAT and the percentages of VAT in TKO mice were significantly higher than those in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). Furthermore, we scanned these mice with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found that the total adipose tissue weight and its percentage of body weight were significantly increased in TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Thus, these results indicated that miR-17~92 family miRNAs protected mice from obesity. To mimic this chronic obese phenotype, we fed TKO and WT mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). Consistent with the results obtained with animals under regular diet, body weights, VAT weights, and the VAT percentages of TKO mice were significantly higher than those of WT mice upon 20 weeks of feeding with high fat-diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâH</xref>). Meanwhile, TKO and WT mice were scanned with MRI, and MRI quantitation indicated that both total adipose tissue weight and its percentage were significantly increased in TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). To further clarify the physiological role of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in ameliorating obesity, we generated mice deficient of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in the hematopoietic compartment by transferring bone marrow (BM) cells from WT and TKO mice into irradiated C57BL/6J or CD45.1 recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3E</xref>), and subsequently fed these chimeric mice with a regular chow diet or high-fat diet. TKO chimeric mice also exhibited increased body weights compared with WT chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>). Moreover, the absolute weights and the percentages of VAT and total adipose tissue were significantly increased in TKO chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1LâO</xref>). In summary, these results demonstrate that myeloid-intrinsic miR-17~92 family miRNAs protect mice from obesity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>miR-17~92 family miRNAs protect mice from obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative photograph (left panel) and body weight (right panel) of the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre (WT) and miR-106a~363<sup>â/â</sup>Â miR-106b~25<sup>â/â</sup>Â miR-17~92<sup>flox/flox</sup> <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre (TKO) mice at the age of 30 weeks, nÂ =Â 14â16 per group.

However, the functions of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in innate immune cells remain elusive. Here we illustrated the previously unidentified functions as well as underlying mechanisms of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in regulating the balance between key pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in macrophages and uncovered a novel target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Such regulation bears important biological outcomes in the context of macrophage-mediated chronic inflammation with impact on general physiology such as body weight and glucose tolerance.</p><p>In recent years, due to life style changes such as increased intake of refined foods, the incidence of obesity has risen dramatically all over the globe, which in turn leads to an explosion of obesity-related disorders including but not limited to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finucane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">GonzÃ¡lez-Muniesa et al., 2017</xref>). A variety of factors have been implicated in theÂ development of obesity, including dysregulation of interconnected endocrine circuits, systemic chronic inflammation, and certain cell-intrinsic mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaitin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kahn and Flier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qatanani and Lazar, 2007</xref>). Immune modulating cytokines including TNF and IL-10 are also critical regulators of insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olefsky and Glass, 2010</xref>). For example, TNF-activated signaling molecules such as IKK, JNK, S6 kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) could potentially phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) to attenuate insulin signaling and subsequently contribute to theÂ development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirosumi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 1998</xref>). Although miR-17~92 family miRNAs have been reported to regulate adipocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), the current study depicted a miR-17~92 family miRNA-centric immune circuit operative in macrophages that indirectly controls metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance and obesity.</p><p>Previous studies have implicated theÂ roles of miR-17~92 family miRNAs in developmental processes and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mogilyansky and Rigoutsos, 2013</xref>), and validated multiple targets including E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Donnell et al., 2005</xref>), PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Donnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>), Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ventura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>), PHLPP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), and C/EBPÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). In this study we identified YY1 as a novel target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs. Attenuation of YY1 protein by macrophage-intrinsic miR-17~92 family miRNAs sustains expression of Fos and thus activities of a key transcription complex AP-1, resulting in optimal expression of a major homeostatic cytokine IL-10 and restraining cells from overactivation. To our knowledge, these results represent the first experimental evidence for suggesting an immune-regulatory role of YY1 in myeloid cells. The detailed analyses of regulation and function of transcription factor YY1 in macrophages warrant future investigation. Nevertheless, despite identifying YY1 as a target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs, we cannot exclude the possibility that other miRNA targets may be involved in regulating macrophage phenotypes. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which miR-17~92 family miRNAs regulate macrophage biology.</p><p>TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine critical for host defense against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, yet excessive production of TNF has been causally linked with multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, IBD,Â and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the production of TNF must be tightly controlled by a variety of negative regulators. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in resolution of inflammation and robustly suppresses production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouyang and O'Garra, 2019</xref>). Full-fledged expression of IL-10 by macrophages is achieved by coordinated action of transcription factors including c-Maf and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ouyang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010</xref>). Here we identified miR-17~92 family miRNAs as key positive regulators supporting IL-10 production in ATMs, raising possibilities for this family of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets of inflammatory and metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The authors show that disruption of the miR-17~92 family leads to increased pro-inflammatory activity of adipose macrophages. Myeloid specific deletion of three clusters of miR-17~92 family miRNAs altered twisted adipose tissue macrophages towards a spontaneously inflammatory phenotype characterized by diminished IL-10 and elevated TNF, leading to disrupted adipose homeostasis evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs prevented inflammation by promoting IL-10 expression through a YY1-Fos-IL-10 regulatory circuit. Overall, this is an interesting study (especially the fact that miR-17~92 family KO mice are &quot;obese&quot;) with strong physiological significance and compelling molecular mechanisms. However, more experiments are needed to support a clear link between the inflammatory status observed in miR-17~92 family KO mice and adipose macrophages.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The majority of experiments was performed with BM-derived macrophages cultured for an unknown time in MCSF media. However, monocyte-derived macrophages are significantly different compared to tissue macrophages and show similarities â at the utmost â to peritoneal infiltrates after thioglycolate injection, but not to homeostatic tissue-resident macrophages (Gosselin et al., 2014). It is therefore questionable if the here presented findings on (partially LPS-stimulated) BMDMs can be translated to tissue-resident adipose macrophages under physiological conditions. It is similarly possible that the development of exacerbated weight gain in TKO is the consequence of a peripheral phenotype (for instance of monocytic origin), as indicated by the BM transplantation experiments, rather than the consequence of a defect in tissue-resident macrophages. Accordingly, the authors need to perform more experiments to show that the phenotype is caused by adipose macrophages. For example, showing the expression levels of all miR-17~92 family members in ex vivo isolated ATM subpopulations. In this regard, am important study to consider will be Jaitin et al., 2019.</p><p>It is further not clear, why the authors included LPS stimulation in their experimental design, when the phenotype is evident in TKO mice under physiological conditions. It would be easier for the reader, if the authors would focus on unstimulated cells rather than showing different time points after LPS treatment. Results from the in vitro LPS experiments cannot be extrapolated to the physiological in vivo situation. Finally, to overcome the correlative nature of the experiments, it would be necessary to show, that the &quot;obese&quot; phenotype can be rescued in TKO Tnf+/- mice.</p><p>The authors showed that IL-10 supplementation can rescue the TNF phenotypes in miR-17~92-deficient microphages. It will be important to further extend this result by using an IL-10 blocking system. On a similar point, in respect to Figure 6, the link between YY1-Fos-Il10 is not completely clear. The authors should show that silencing of YY1 in TKO leads to decreased Tnf and increased Il10 expression. The authors should also test the effects of YY1 loss on cytokine production?</p><p>In Figure 1D the authors show body weight during HFD and indicate higher weight of TKO. However, in Figure 1A the authors show that TKO already have higher weight under steady state conditions. The authors need to add the weights of untreated WT and TKO to the graph. Same for Figure 1I, the authors should show the weight of chimeras without HFD.</p><p>RNA-seq experiment should be performed with ex vivo isolated ATM and not with in vitro derived cells. Two time points for both genotypes are necessary (&quot;pre-obese&quot; and &quot;obese&quot;) to observe gene changes during obesity development.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MicroRNAs of the miR-17~92 family maintain adipose tissue macrophage homeostasis by sustaining IL-10 expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors significantly improved their work during the revision and strengthen their main points with new experimental evidence significantly. However, some few minor things remain to be clarified before we can proceed to acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The bioinformatical analysis or the description of the corresponding RNA-Seq experiments is still complicated to understand. The authors state in their new version: &quot;Furthermore, genome wide RNA profiling analyses were performed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorted ATMs from WT and TKO mice fed with regular chow diet or high fat diet.&quot; However, in the Figure legend it is stated: &quot;(E) Gene Ontology analysis of WT and TKO ATM RNA-seq datasets showing the enriched gene ontology terms in TKO ATMs. (F) RNA-seq analysis showing RNA expression in TKO ATMs versus those in WT cells. RNAs up-regulated in TKO ATMs were colored red, whereas RNAs down-regulated were colored blue, gene Tnf was pointed out and colored orange and gene Il10 was pointed out and colored green.&quot; Is this data shown in 2E+F now derived from obese or pre-obese animals? If this is derived from just one condition (obese or pre-obese mice), why didn't the authors show all conditions?</p><p>2) Furthermore, how many animals were used for the RNA-Seq experiment depicted in Figure 2E and F? Is this just 2 samples (one WT and one TKO) pooled from multiple mice? Please either indicate in the figure legends or in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) The authors stated that red/blue marked genes in Figure 2F indicates up- or down-regulated genes. What is their definition for up- or down-regulation? 2-fold change? Or is this based on statistics (which might be problematic with n=1).</p><p>4) Please highlight the top 10 differential expressed genes in the Figure 2E and Figure 5A scatter blot.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55676.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The majority of experiments was performed with BM-derived macrophages cultured for a unknown time in MCSF media.

We used BMDMs mainly for the mechanistic studies due to the scarcity of the number of ATMs (approximately 40,000 cells from 0.1 g fat tissues per mouse). To corroborate the findings obtained from in vitro cultured macrophages, we ex vivo isolated ATMs and showed that miR-17~92 family miRNAs were efficiently deleted in ATMs from TKO mice (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C-E, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs maintain adipose tissue macrophage homeostasisâ). Importantly, in ATMs, the expression of IL-10 and TNF was regulated by miR-17~92 family miRNAs in a similar trend to that in BMDMs (new Figure 2F-H, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs maintain adipose tissue macrophage homeostasisâ), further validating BMDMs as a suitable in vitro system for the mechanistic investigations. As the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-Cre line used in this study does not discriminate between monocytes and certain tissue resident macrophages, we cannot definitively exclude the effects of recruited monocytes, although the robust deletion of miR-17~92 family miRNAs as well as the inflammatory phenotypes of ATMs supported the notion that ATMs might contribute significantly to the overall phenotypes. We also included the Jaitin et al., reference in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is further not clear, why the authors included LPS stimulation in their experimental design, when the phenotype is evident in TKO mice under physiological conditions.

Finally, to overcome the correlative nature of the experiments, it would be necessary to show, that the &quot;obese&quot; phenotype can be rescued in TKO Tnf+/- mice.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of activating signals, resting BMDMs expressed nearly undetectable amounts of inflammatory genes such as <italic>Tnf</italic> at both mRNA and protein levels (threshold cycle number &gt; 30 by qPCR for <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA and protein concentrations &lt; 5 pg/ml as measured by TNF ELISA). Thus, in order to reveal the effects of miR-17~92 family miRNAs and to perform mechanistic experiments in vitro, we used LPS stimulation to activate macrophages and to upregulate inflammatory gene expression. Of note, the results obtained from activated BMDMs are in large consistent with the ex vivo isolated ATMs regarding inflammatory gene regulation.</p><p>For the phenotype rescue experiment, we agree with the reviewer that TNF loss-of-function experiment would be of great value. However, incorporating a <italic>Tnf</italic> null allele into the current TKO background would result in knockin and knockout of 5 different gene alleles and the time to generate such mice might take one year, to the conservative estimate. Alternatively, we employed in vivo administration of an anti-TNF antibody and found that TNF blockade markedly ameliorated the obese phenotype in TKO animals (new Figure 3H, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs balance TNF and IL-10 production in macrophagesâ). We believe that this approach is equally valuable at demonstrating a role for TNF in development of obesity in TKO animals, with the added benefits of boosting therapeutic potentials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed that IL-10 supplementation can rescue the TNF phenotypes in miR-17~92-deficient microphages.

The authors should also test the effects of YY1 loss on cytokine production?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of IL-10 is reduced in TKO macrophages compared to that in WT macrophages, and thus we supplemented IL-10 instead of blocking IL-10 signaling. Nevertheless, we performed the loss-of-function experiment with an anti-IL-10R antibody and found that blockade of IL-10 signaling normalized the difference of TNF production in WT and TKO BMDMs (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs balance TNF and IL-10 production in macrophagesâ), further supporting a role for IL-10 in the system. Moreover, silencing YY1 in TKO BMDMs led to decreased TNF and increased IL10 expression at the mRNA and protein levels (new Figure 6I-L, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs directly target YY1 to regulate Fos expressionâ), agreeing with the model of miR-17~92 family miRNAs-IL-10-TNF regulatory axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1D the authors show body weight during HFD and indicate higher weight of TKO. However, in Figure 1A the authors show that TKO already have higher weight under steady state conditions. The authors need to add the weights of untreated WT and TKO to the graph. Same for Figure 1I, the authors should show the weight of chimeras without HFD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the weights of WT and TKO mice with regular chow diet (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs protect mice from obesityâ) as well as the weights of WT and TKO chimeras with regular chow diet (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs protect mice from obesityâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RNA-seq experiment should be performed with ex vivo isolated ATM and not with in vitro derived cells. Two time points for both genotypes are necessary (&quot;pre-obese&quot; and &quot;obese&quot;) to observe gene changes during obesity development.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment. We have performed the RNA-seq experiment with ex vivo isolated ATMs from âpre-obeseâ (regular chow diet) and âobeseâ (high fat diet for 8 weeks) mice. Analyses of gene expression data sets revealed that ATMs from both âpre-obeseâ and âobeseâ TKO mice showed more prominent inflammatory gene signature than those from WT mice (new Figure 2E and F and new Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A and B, described in subsection âmiR-17~92 family miRNAs maintain adipose tissue macrophage homeostasisâ), further confirming the inflammatory phenotypes of TKO ATMs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The bioinformatical analysis or the description of the corresponding RNA-Seq experiments is still complicated to understand. The authors state in their new version: &quot;Furthermore, genome wide RNA profiling analyses were performed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorted ATMs from WT and TKO mice fed with regular chow diet or high fat diet.&quot; However, in the Figure legend it is stated: &quot;(E) Gene Ontology analysis of WT and TKO ATM RNA-seq datasets showing the enriched gene ontology terms in TKO ATMs. (F) RNA-seq analysis showing RNA expression in TKO ATMs versus those in WT cells. RNAs up-regulated in TKO ATMs were colored red, whereas RNAs down-regulated were colored blue, gene Tnf was pointed out and colored orange and gene Il10 was pointed out and colored green.&quot; Is this data shown in 2E and F now derived from obese or pre-obese animals? If this is derived from just one condition (obese or pre-obese mice), why didn't the authors show all conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2E and F, these data were derived from pre-obese animals and a description was added in the figure legend. Those RNA-seq results from obese WT and TKO mice were shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, how many animals were used for the RNA-Seq experiment depicted in Figure 2E+F? Is this just 2 samples (one WT and one TKO) pooled from multiple mice? Please either indicate in the figure legends or in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA from two mice of each genotype were pooled for RNA-seq experiment and this information was added in figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors stated that red/blue marked genes in Figure 2F indicates up- or down-regulated genes. What is their definition for up- or down-regulation? 2-fold change? Or is this based on statistics (which might be problematic with n=1).</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2F, upregulated and downregulated genes in TKO ATMs were identified as p-value â¤ 0.05, (FPKM +1) fold changes (TKO/WT) â¥ 1.6 for upregulated genes and (FPKM +1) fold changes (TKO/WT) â¤ 0.6 for downregulated genes, which was described in Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please highlight the top 10 differential expressed genes in the Figure 2E and Figure 5A scatter blot.</p></disp-quote><p>Those top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes were highlighted in new Figure 2E and new Figure 5A and were listed in figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
