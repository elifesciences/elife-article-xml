react to sensory feedback, but rather uses an internal model of the body to predict the consequences of motor commands before sensory feedback arrives. Time-delayed sensory feedback can then be used to correct for the unexpected—perturbations, motor noise, or a moving target. The cerebellum has been implicated in this predictive control process. Here, we show that the feedback gain in patients with cerebellar ataxia matches that of healthy subjects, but that patients exhibit substantially more phase lag. This difference is captured by a computational model incorporating a Smith predictor in healthy subjects that is missing in patients, supporting the predictive role of the cerebellum in feedback control. Lastly, we improve cerebellar patients’ movement control by altering (phase advancing) the visual feedback they receive from their own self movement in a simplified virtual reality setup.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>ataxia</kwd><kwd>control theory</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>reaching</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD040289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bastian</surname><given-names>Amy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>Noah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Applied Physics Laboratory Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FNACCCX19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>Amanda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1825489</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastian</surname><given-names>Amy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>Noah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A control system model of cerebellar patients' movements provides insight into the cerebellum's role in reaching and informs a virtual reality intervention to improve patient reaches.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans normally rely on a balance of feedback and predictive control mechanisms to make smooth and accurate movements. Proprioceptive and visual feedback are necessary for determining body postures at the beginning and end of a movement and can be used to guide slow movements accurately. However, feedback is time delayed, and thus it never represents the current state of the body during movement. Because of this, it is thought that we depend on internal models of the body that are built based on prior experience. These models can be rapidly accessed and thus provide a fast internal prediction system to estimate how a movement will unfold, enabling us to better understand where our limbs are at any given moment. This allows us to make fast and accurate movements despite long-latency feedback.</p><p>People with cerebellar damage show a characteristic pattern of incoordination during movement that is referred to as ataxia. When reaching, they make curved movements that miss intended targets and require multiple corrections. This pattern of over- and undershooting a target (dysmetria) and oscillatory corrections (intention tremor) are hallmarks of cerebellar ataxia. One hypothesis that might explain ataxia is that the predictive estimation and control provided by cerebellar circuits is dysfunctional or lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Normally, the estimation of limb state (e.g. position and velocity) benefits from integrating proprioceptive measurements with an internal predictive control model during a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamovich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuentes and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paillard and Brouchon, 1974</xref>). However, patients with cerebellar damage do not seem to receive this benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>). Worse, it is possible that their predictive model actually conveys incorrect state information during active movements, which could corrupt rather than enhance proprioceptive estimation of limb state. This difficulty of predicting the future state of limbs during active movement leads to movements that are poorly directed and scaled, requiring ongoing corrections to reach a goal location.</p><p>Patients with cerebellar ataxia may rely more heavily on visual feedback to correct dysmetric movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beppu et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beppu et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 1998</xref>). A drawback of visual feedback is that it is slower than proprioception; intention tremor in these patients’ movements is thought to stem from dependence on time-delayed visual feedback to make corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 1998</xref>). However, it is not known how well they incorporate this visual feedback into their movements. Is visual feedback control impaired? Or does the dysmetria stem solely from errors in predictive (i.e. feedforward) control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhanpuri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith and Shadmehr, 2005</xref>)? A gait study by Morton and Bastian suggested that cerebellar patients could use feedback information to make reactive corrections during split-belt treadmill walking in order to maintain stability, but lacked the ability to adapt their predictive motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>). Other studies have indirectly supported the notion that patients can incorporate some level of visual feedback control in reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used behavioral experiments and computational modeling to test for any impairment in visual feedback control (correction based on measured error) and disambiguate it from previously described impairments in feedforward control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bares et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broersen et al., 2016</xref>). Subjects performed a visuomotor task which required them to track an unpredictable target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>). This method allowed us to determine that cerebellar patients can integrate visual feedback control similarly to healthy, age-matched control subjects. We then hypothesized that we could exploit intact feedback control to reduce dysmetria. Specifically, we provided an acceleration-dependent alteration to visual feedback of a hand cursor. This alteration serves to compensate for the phase lags introduced by time delay, allowing patients to use visual feedback more effectively. This real-time controller successfully reduced patients’ dysmetria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>A total of 17 patients with cerebellar deﬁcits and 14 age-matched controls were tested in one or more of the following experiments. Patients were excluded if they had any clinical or MRI evidence of damage to extra-cerebellar brain structures, or clinical evidence of dementia, aphasia, peripheral vestibular loss, or sensory neuropathy. The age-matched controls were clinically screened for any neurological impairments. Experiments 1–2 tested 11 cerebellar patients (seven male, four female) and 11 age-matched controls (four male, seven female). Patient and control ages were within +/- 3 years of age. The one exception is a pairing of a 78-year-old patient with a 71-year-old control. Experiment 3 tested 12 cerebellar patients (eight male, four female) and 12 age-matched controls (three male, nine female), and all patient and control ages were within +/- 3 years of age. Subjects gave informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Each subject used his or her dominant arm for all tasks. The only exception was one unilaterally affected cerebellar patient who was instructed to use her affected, non-dominant, hand. We quantiﬁed each subject’s ataxia using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trouillas et al., 1997</xref>). Because this study involves upper limb reaching behavior, we calculated an Upper Limb ICARS sub-score comprising the sum of the upper-limb kinetic function elements of the test.

The target angle followed a pseudorandom sum-of-sines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or single-sine pattern. Each trial was 100 s long. We tested three different Feedback Gain conditions in the sum-of-sines (Experiment 1) task: 1.35 (cursor moves 35% farther than hand), 0.65 (cursor motion is attenuated by 35%), and 1.0 (veridical feedback; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Subjects were not informed that there was a gain change.</p><p>For Experiment 3 (discrete reaches), the robot moved the arm to align the cursor with the red dot start position (55° elbow angle) before each reach. After approximately 2 s, the red dot disappeared, and a green target dot (1.5 cm diameter, at 85° elbow angle) appeared elsewhere on the screen. Subjects were instructed to bring the white cursor dot to the center of the green target dot (a 30° flexion movement) as smoothly and accurately as possible without over or undershooting the target. If the fingertip did not reach within 1.75 cm of the target within 800 ms, the green dot changed to blue and subjects were instructed to complete the reach (trials were not repeated); the subjects were also asked to try to move faster on the next trial. The next trial started after the subject kept the fingertip in the target dot for two continuous seconds.</p><p>Healthy control subjects performed five practice trials and patients performed 10 practice trials to familiarize themselves with the procedure.

The target trajectory comprised 15 sine waves whose frequencies were prime multiples of 0.05 Hz, namely 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.55, 0.65, 0.85, 0.95, 1.15, 1.45, 1.55, 1.85, 2.05, 2.15, and 2.35 Hz. Phases of each sinusoid were randomized. Each trial was 100 s long, comprising ﬁve replicates of the sum-of-sines trajectory. The sinusoids were scaled so that the <italic>angular velocity</italic> of each sinusoid never exceeded 720°/s, while the <italic>positional</italic> amplitude of each sine wave never exceeded 2°. The non-harmonic relation of the component sinusoids created a temporally complex target motion with 45 degrees of freedom (amplitude, phase, and frequency for 15 sinusoids) that repeats every 20 s; a portion of the trajectory is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, wherein it can be observed that the signal trajectory includes multiple seemingly random turn-arounds within even very short timescales. This complexity, coupled with the long period, makes this target motion far less predictable than a simple single-sine motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miall and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poulton, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, the dramatic increase in tracking phase lag presented in this paper (see Results) for sum-of-sine responses recapitulates the main finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>, confirming that from a practical point of view subjects were less able to predict the movement trajectories. Nevertheless, this signal design allowed good signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency while avoiding excessively large or fast motions of the target, making it well suited as a probe signal for tracking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>). The normalized magnitude of the Fourier spectrum of our input signal is shown in the top half of in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.

The amplitude of each sine wave matched (component-wise) the sum-of-sines experiments. Subjects were once again instructed to keep the cursor in the target dot as much as possible.

The data were visually inspected for unusual activities that were not representative of the subject's typical behavior. For example, if the subject turned away from the screen to cough or talk, movement would cease for a few seconds and the data from those few seconds were removed from further analysis. The movement trajectories for a given subject were then averaged across trials at each time instant, excluding any deleted data. The averaged data were linearly detrended and converted to the frequency domain via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). An example of the result of this process for a cerebellar patient is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> (the frequency domain data is complex valued at each frequency so only the magnitude is shown).</p><p>For Experiment 1 (sum of sines), to estimate a subject's frequency response, we calculated the ratio of the DFT of the subject's movement to the DFT of the underlying target trajectory at each of the 15 frequencies in the sum-of-sines. The result of this calculation is 15 complex numbers, called <italic>phasors</italic>, representing the frequency response estimate for a given subject. The magnitude of each phasor is the <italic>gain</italic> and the angle is the <italic>phase</italic> of the subject's response at that frequency.</p><p>The processing of the data for Experiment 2 (single sines) was identical to the processing of the sum-of-sines data, except that there was no averaging across trials and no manual inspection/filtering of the data for unusual activities. This is because we were only looking at one frequency from each sine wave trial, and any error caused by an unusual, aperiodic activity (such as pausing) would introduce very little power at any individual frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Phasor plot (Experiments 1 and 2)</title><p>To visualize the frequency response, we used Phasor Plots as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In these plots, the gain is the radial distance from the origin, and phase lag is the clockwise angle of the data with respect to the horizontal axis. Perfect tracking at a given frequency corresponds to unity gain and zero phase lag, as illustrated by the large dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The distance between any point on the phasor plot and this dot provides a measure of the amplitude of the (sinusoidal) error signal at that particular frequency as a proportion of the input signal amplitude.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Interpreting phasor plots.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Brief explanation of phasor plots, which are explained in depth in Methods in ‘Phasor Plot.’ (<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the relationship between the real and imaginary components of the complex numbers and the gain and phase lag.

Points on this circle correspond to the ideal response gain for minimizing error given a particular phase lag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>). Points on this circle represent the gain values that minimize error assuming the subject cannot further minimize phase lag. Points outside the circle indicate the subject is moving too much for a given phase lag; reducing the amplitude of movement would achieve a lower tracking error and would do so with less effort. Points within the circle may represent striking a balance between effort and error in that the subject is not moving enough to fully minimize their error given a certain phase lag. Lastly, points that lie on the unit circle, traced in bold black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, would indicate that the subject is replicating the sinusoidal component exactly, albeit at a phase shift.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Phasor plot scaling (Experiment 1)</title><p>If a subject were to ‘fully’ respond to an applied visual gain, the subject would need to scale his or her movement so that the visual output appeared the same as it did in the veridical feedback condition, although there is no constraint (or instruction) to do so. In reality, a subject may scale his or her movements more than this, less than this, or even not at all. To quantify this, we fit a Scaling Factor that, when multiplied by the frequency response phasors for a given Feedback Gain condition, best aligned the phasors with those of the veridical condition. We only included the five lowest frequencies in this calculation because at these frequencies subjects generally appeared to have robust responses (based on visual inspection of the data). At high frequencies, however, response magnitudes were low and therefore fitting the Scaling Factor could be dominated by noise.</p><p>Scaling Factor (dependent measure) was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, testing for the effects of two independent variables, group (patient vs. control) and Feedback Gain (0.65 and 1.35). If a main effect was found to be significant, we calculated an effect measure (η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) using the Measures of Effect Size toolbox for Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hentschke and Stüttgen, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-5"><title>Modeling (using data from Experiment 1)</title><p>To capture the visuomotor tracking response of both cerebellar patients and age-matched healthy controls, we adapted the classic McRuer gain-crossover model: a delayed, scaled integrator which specifically assumes that the subject is responding to an unpredictable stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McRuer and Krendel, 1974</xref>). The McRuer gain-crossover model is highly simplified, and in its original incarnation was meant to capture the sensorimotor frequency response near the gain crossover frequency (i.e. where the open-loop gain of the combined plant and controller has unit magnitude). The idea is that near this frequency, closed-loop robustness is governed by the amount of phase lag; if that phase lag exceeds 180°, the closed-loop system becomes unstable. In a neighborhood of the gain-crossover frequency, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McRuer and Krendel, 1974</xref> recognized that subjects tended to have an open-loop gain whose magnitude dropped off inversely with frequency (like an integrator, or k/s), and the phase lag was a bit more than 90° (the integrator adds 90 degrees, and a delay in their model increases the phase lag as a function of frequency). We adopt a version of this simplified model to facilitate the interpretation of data (Figure 4).</p><p>We hypothesized that the patient and control models would be equivalent except for the magnitude of the feedback delay (Figure 4A). To test this, we considered a more general class of models that allows for distinct parameters for the patients and healthy control subjects, and includes the possibility of distinct delays on the visual measurement of target motion from that of self-movement feedback (which can incorporate for example, proprioception, which generally incurs a lower latency than visual). To determine the simplest combined model of patients and controls which provided both a good and consistent fit without overfitting, we used a model selection process similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madhav et al., 2013</xref> based on Experiment 1 data (sum-of-sines). In the most flexible model, all patient and control parameters were allowed to vary independently with eight free parameters: k<sub>patient</sub>, k<sub>control</sub>, Visual Gain<sub>patient</sub>, Visual Gain<sub>control</sub>, Visual Delay<sub>patient</sub>, Visual Delay<sub>control</sub>, Feedback Delay<sub>patient</sub>, and Feedback Delay<sub>control</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The following model selection procedure aimed to determine which of those eight parameters should be free and which should be yoked together to most parsimoniously fit the data. All combinations of yoked parameters were tested, subject to yoking gains with gains, and delays with delays. We also tested a few degenerate model structures (such as a pure gain or delay, with no feedback); some of these model structures allowed for the elimination of one or more of the blocks within the model structure.</p><p>The following procedure was repeated for each possible model (note: here a ‘model’ includes both patient and control submodels). For each subject, we represented their frequency response as an array of 15 complex numbers (one for each of the frequencies tested in the sum-of-sines experiment). We began by pulling 10 of the 11 age-matched patient–control pairs from the full dataset. Then, we took the average of those 10 patients' (and, separately, controls) frequency responses at each tested frequency. Using the MATLAB function ‘fminsearch,’ we used these average frequency response functions to fit the current model parameters to the average data by minimizing the frequency-domain (FD) error:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mtext>FD-error</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>control</italic> and <italic>patient</italic> in the above equation were arrays with 15 complex values, corresponding respectively to frequency responses of healthy control subjects and patients at the 15 frequencies tested.

This was our gauge for the ability of the model to capture the responses. Using the 11 sets of the model parameters for that particular model (i.e. one set of parameters for each subject pair that was left out), we created an 11 × 8 matrix, each row of which corresponding to the parameters for a given leave-one-out fit. The elements of the matrix were the residuals between each of the eight parameters and their average value. We calculated the maximum singular value of this matrix as a gauge for model consistency. This was repeated for all potential models. Finally, by modifying our fitting procedure above, we used bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for the parameter values in our best model. Specifically, we randomly sampled eleven times with replacement from the eleven subjects. This was repeated 1000 times to generate 1000 sets of parameter values. From these values, we found the 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>‘Essentially all models are wrong, but some are useful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gep and Draper, 1987</xref>) so rather than choosing a single ‘correct’ model, we scrutinized all models that exhibit a good tradeoff of model fit and model consistency. We also considered the number of free parameters (parsimony). Lastly, we examined whether a given model produced physiologically realistic parameters; models with nonphysiological parameters would suggest inadequate model structure leading to parameter bias. We determined the common features and subtle differences between these good models and the outcome of these meta analyses are described in Results.</p><p>We converted each frequency-domain model (which includes patient and control submodels) to state space in Matlab, and simulated the model pair using the lsim command (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The input was the sum-of-sines target angle trajectory used in experiments. The model output produced a distinct prediction for the elbow-angle trajectory for each group (patients and controls; Figure 4C). These simulated elbow-angle responses were compared to subject responses as follows. We averaged across trials for each subject to compute a single time-domain response for each patient and each age-matched control; we then averaged across subjects in each group to compute a mean elbow-angle response for patients and a mean elbow-angle response for controls.

We determined the angle of the ﬁrst correction by ﬁnding when the velocity crossed zero after the initiation of the reach. The angle of the elbow at this time point is the angle of the ﬁrst correction. This angle was divided by the goal angle of 30°. In a smooth and accurate reach, no correction would be needed and the ‘angle of first correction’ would be the target angle; in this scenario, the ratio between the ‘angle of ﬁrst correction’ and the goal angle would be 1. If the result was greater than 1.03, the reach was categorized as hypermetric, and likewise, if the result was less than 0.97, the reach would be categorized as hypometric.

We conducted a one-sided t-test to determine whether patients scaled their gain in the hypothesized direction against the null hypothesis that patients’ scaling factors would be 1 (i.e. they would not respond to the applied feedback gain). Both groups scaled up (patients: p=0.03, t = −2.1, DOF = 10; controls: p=4×10<sup>−6</sup>, t = −8.3, DOF = 10) or scaled down (patients: p=0.005, t = 3.23, DOF = 10; controls p=0.0002, t = 5.3, DOF = 10) their movement, commensurate with the respective decrease or increase of the cursor Feedback Gain.

Likewise, for a Feedback Gain of 0.65, the Scaling Factor was typically approximately 0.8, again implying that subjects compensated, albeit not fully, for the visual rescaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Here we asked if they are using the same ‘control structure’ (i.e. a model of the interplay between sensory feedback, external sensory input, and motor output) as age-matched controls. Because the cerebellar and age-matched control groups scaled their movements similarly in Experiment 1, one might hypothesize that they were using a similar control structure. However, the scaling was measured relative to each subject’s baseline movement in the veridical condition and was not a measure of their overall error performance on the task; for example, issues of phase lag would not be captured by the scaling analysis. Thus, here we use our findings from Experiment 1 along with the model selection procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madhav et al., 2013</xref> to determine any differences in control structures used by patients and age-matched controls.</p><p>Consider the hypothesized model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. In this model, the brain calculates the error between perceived elbow angle and target angle, as shown in the subtraction calculation in the feedback diagram. The model merges the cascade of the subject's internal controller and mechanical plant (arm and robot dynamics); the combined plant and controller is treated as a classic McRuer gain-crossover model—a scaled integrator—a model based on the assumption that the subject is responding to an unpredictable stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McRuer and Krendel, 1974</xref>). Our hypothesis is that all model parameters would be equivalent between patients and age-matched controls, except that patients would have a feedback delay commensurate with their visual processing time and controls would have a lower latency feedback delay commensurate with their proprioceptive feedback processing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crevecoeur and Scott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2008</xref>). This is because we expect that patients would rely more on (slower) visual feedback to compensate for their deficient estimation of limb state. Visuomotor delay during smooth pursuit tracking is generally much faster than the time required for movement initiation, and estimates for such visuomotor tracking delay vary, but would be expected in the range of 110 to 160 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner and Smeets, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day and Lyon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin and Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pruszynski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saunders and Knill, 2003</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modeling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our modeling framework was based on the McRuer Crossover model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McRuer and Krendel, 1974</xref>).

The models were compared based on joint consideration of model consistency and model fit.

Model Best 6 added one more free parameter compared to Best 5 (Lowest Variance) and was the only one of the top five models that allowed for variation in the feedback delay for controls; this addition yielded a small delay (~39 ms) and while only providing a small enhancement in model fit-error, shown in both frequency domain plot and time domain validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The Final Model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) was distilled from the top four models to show the general features among them, together with the range of parameters derived from these models. In addition to the parameter values having consistent values across the top four models, they also have intuitively plausible values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). While the true parameters have biological limitations, we did not restrict their values during the fitting procedure. This provides a useful diagnostic tool, since unrealistic parameter fits would indicate inadequate model structure: parameter bias is a hallmark of model deficiency. In the four top models, Visual Delays for controls were found to be 141–147 ms, which is physiologically plausible. Interestingly, this delay was much shorter than for patients, whose Visual Delays were 181–211 ms. Critically, patients exhibited longer response delay both on the visual measurement of target motion and that of self-movement feedback, compared to controls. The top models also suggest that Feedback Delay is shorter than Visual Delay for both patients and controls, although for two of top models, the patients exhibited equivalent Visual and Feedback Delays. Visual Gain values are all approximately 0.40 which also seems reasonable given a visual inspection of the data: subjects do not appear to be attempting to replicate the full magnitude of the signal, but some smaller portion of the signal. We further examined the frequency responses of patients and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Patients exhibited substantially greater phase lag at high frequencies than controls; at low frequencies, both populations exhibited very little phase lag, but, surprisingly, controls exhibited slightly more phase lag than patients in this frequency range. Thus, there was a phase ‘cross over’ frequency between patients and controls, which was also captured by our top models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>As a final test of our modeling approach, we examined how our Best 4 (Lowest Err) Model's parameters changed when we applied variations in Feedback Gain as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. Recall that in the 1.35 Feedback Gain condition, the dot moves more than the person's hand position; therefore, we expect the subject to move slightly less than they do in the veridical feedback condition because they do not need to move as much to get the same visual output (i.e. we expect k to decrease). Similarly, we expect the subject to attempt to replicate a greater portion of the signal because it is easier to do so. Thus, we expect the Visual Gain (the amount of the input signal that the subject is trying to reproduce) to be greater in the 1.35 Feedback Gain Condition than in the veridical condition. Recall that the Visual Gain affects the <italic>input</italic> to the visual error computation. We expect the opposite trend for the 0.65 Feedback Gain condition, as is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. Given that we believe the delays are biologically limited based on transmission time of visual information, we expect the delay magnitudes to stay the same between Feedback Gain conditions. Indeed, the model parameters change in the hypothesized manner when different Feedback Gains were applied. The results from fitting the Best 4 (Lowest Err) Model to the data from each of the different Feedback Gains yields the parameter values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>. The visual feedback delays are nearly identical between Feedback Gain conditions, and the k and Visual Gain values increase and decrease as hypothesized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. The one difference between the hypothesis and these model values is in the lack of a feedback delay for the control subjects.

We also hypothesized that patients would generate larger tracking errors.</p><p>At the five lowest frequencies tested, all control responses landed in/on the circle, whereas only 31% of patient responses landed in/on the circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, patients generated larger tracking errors: 70% of patient responses exhibited larger error magnitude than the respective age-matched control responses. Furthermore, we created an aggregate tracking error for the single-sines experiment by calculating the sum of the tracking errors for the lowest five frequencies. We compared the aggregate tracking error between patients and age-matched controls by calculating the difference for each pair and testing those differences against 0 using a two-sided sign test. The null hypothesis for a two-sided sign test is that there was no difference between patients and their age-matched controls. The alternative hypothesis is that the controls may be either better or worse than patients. When we compared the difference between the aggregate tracking errors for each patient/control pair to 0, controls were significantly better than patients at single-sines tracking with 10 out of 11 controls performing better than their age-matched counterpart (p=0.012). These results illustrate cerebellar patients’ poor predictive ability. Importantly, note that this analysis does not distinguish what portion of their errors stemmed from poor prediction of the stimulus trajectory versus poor control of the arm.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Patients and controls have categorically different responses to single-sine and sum-of-sine stimuli.</title><p>Each data point is the response at a single frequency (magnitude and phase) of a single subject.

For this experiment, because neither group would be able to predict the target trajectory, we expected that patients would be less impaired relative to controls. Indeed, patient and control behaviors were more similar in this condition: for the five lowest frequencies tested in the sum-of-sines condition, 72% of control responses and 64% of patient responses were in/on the circle. Note, however, that there is an increased phase lag of the cerebellar patients (relative to controls), particularly as the frequency of the stimulus increases, which would be expected if the patients were dependent primarily on time-delayed visual feedback (a pure feedback delay introduces greater phase lag at higher frequencies). Specifically, 73% of individual patient frequency responses were more phase lagged than the responses of the age-matched control (as computed on an individual frequency basis).</p><p>As expected, we also observed a reduction in tracking error from the sum-of-sines task to the single-sines task. We calculated the magnitude of the tracking error for each subject for each frequency (i.e. for the frequencies that were tested in both conditions) and then compared the errors between the conditions. 93% of controls’ and 75% of patients’ tracking errors were reduced in the single-sine task in comparison to his or her performance in the sum-of-sines task. Again, we computed the aggregate tracking error for the sum-of-sines task, as described earlier, using the same five frequencies used in the single-sines aggregate tracking error calculation. We then used a two-sided sign test to determine that patients (p=9×10<sup>−4</sup>) and controls (p=9×10<sup>−4</sup>) were better at tracking single-sines than sum-of-sines, with all patients and all controls having less tracking error for single-sines than sum-of-sines.</p><p>To specifically look at phase lag between groups (patients vs. controls) and conditions (single- vs. sum-of-sines), we used a circular statistical approach. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows polar representations of the phase lags from the single-sine and sum-of-sines conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>) and an example time series from a control and cerebellar subject tracking the 0.85 Hz sine wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). The example control subject showed little phase lag suggesting that this individual could make use of an internal prediction of the dot movement and their arm movement. In contrast, the example cerebellar subject showed a systematic phase lag suggesting that their ability to use prediction is impaired. The pattern of lag can be visualized across frequencies in the polar plots. As a group, controls show a small increase in lag as the frequency increases in the single-sine condition, whereas the cerebellar group shows large lags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, compare purple vectors). Circular ANOVA for the single-sine condition showed that the cerebellar group had greater lags compared to controls (Group effect, p=1×10<sup>−8</sup>), that the lags increased with frequency (Frequency effect, p=7×10<sup>−11</sup>) and an interaction such that the cerebellar group lags increased more than controls across frequency (Interaction effect, p=2×10<sup>−6</sup>). In the sum-of-sines condition, the difference in lags across frequency was qualitatively greater when comparing cerebellar and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, compare black vectors). Overall the cerebellar group showed greater phase lags compared to controls (Group effect, p=0.02), and there was a statistically significant effect of Frequency (Frequency effect, p=7×10<sup>−30</sup>).

This was assessed during a sum-of-sines visuomotor tracking task by subtly changing the gain of the visual cursor feedback (i.e. hand) and measuring the degree to which an individual subject could modulate the gain of his or her corrective movements. Our modeling corroborated this finding: the structure and parameters between patients and controls were generally the same, except that the patient and control models differed substantively in their feedback delay. The patients relied on time delayed cursor feedback of their hand position, whereas controls appeared to be able to generate predictions of their hand position.</p><p>We also saw increases in phase lag for patients versus controls when following predictable sine waves. While patients showed large phase lags that increased with frequency in both conditions, controls only showed large phase lags in the sum-of-sines condition when the stimulus was unpredictable. We interpret this to mean that the control subjects could predict the movement of <italic>both</italic> the hand <italic>and</italic> stimulus in the single-sine condition, but the cerebellar patients could not predict <italic>either</italic> as reliably as controls, relying more heavily on visual, moment-to-moment feedback for tracking.</p><p>The above results are significant as it has previously been difficult to assess visual feedback control in these patients due to their clear impairments in feedforward control of movement. In Experiment 3, we tested whether patients’ largely intact visual feedback could be exploited to benefit their targeting performance in a reaching task. Indeed, we found that cerebellar patients could leverage their intact, albeit delayed, feedback control ability to improve their movement when we manipulate their visual feedback to assist them.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Delay in patients but not in healthy controls</title><p>Cerebellar patients are thought to make faulty state estimates of arm motion due to a damaged internal model, which adversely affects their proprioceptive estimates during active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we expect them to increase their reliance on visual feedback, which is time delayed compared to proprioceptive feedback. Here we hypothesized that our patients’ feedback control system would have an increased delay in comparison to controls. This hypothesis is supported by work that showed that healthy subjects normally rely more on proprioception than vision for feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevecoeur et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevecoeur et al., 2016</xref> model, increased variability of the proprioceptive information would lead to increased weighting of visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevecoeur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>), which comes at the cost of increased delay for patients compared to controls.</p><p>Our modeling results reveal that patients have a delay in their feedback loop that approximates what one would expect from visual feedback, while controls appear to have negligible feedback delay. One interpretation of the control data is that controls are relying on a predictive internal model of their arm dynamics. This would allow them to make corrections even faster than they could using purely proprioceptive feedback. In other words, healthy controls can make corrections for current target movements based on a prediction of the present limb state from outdated measurements and known motor commands, rather than waiting on delayed sensory feedback.</p><p>We think that the cerebellar patients’ deficits are best explained by their dependence on time-delayed visual feedback, though it is theoretically possible that delays in motor execution could contribute. Previous studies have shown that some patients with cerebellar damage exhibit longer than usual reaction time delays when asked to make discrete, rapid movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beppu et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beppu et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vilis and Hore, 1980</xref>). These reaction time studies aimed to quantify a movement initiation delay as opposed to a feedback delay. Here, we specifically assessed the timing of the in-flight trajectory alterations made while tracking an unpredictable stimulus. While our feedback delay is a type of ‘reaction time’ because this task requires making corrections on the fly, the neural mechanisms underlying these corrections may differ from those responsible for planning and initiation of a rapid movement.</p><p>Cerebellar patients can also show a reduced feedback gain in situations where responses are driven by proprioception more than vision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurtzer et al., 2013</xref> studied cerebellar patients’ ability to modulate long latency stretch responses (i.e. EMG responses within 45–100 ms of a muscle stretch) that depend on knowledge of intersegmental dynamics of the arm. This was assessed by mechanically perturbing the elbow joint and measuring long latency responses from elbow muscles and from shoulder muscles in anticipation of the passive shoulder motion induced by elbow movement. Cerebellar patient responses were found to have a lower gain and a slight delay in timing compared with controls. We interpret this in the context of the different task demands between studies-- in that study, proprioception drove the response; here vision appears to be more important to patients. These results combined suggest that cerebellar subjects can reweight which feedback modality to rely on (proprioception versus vision) depending on task demands, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block and Bastian, 2012</xref>, and may reduce the sensorimotor gain on either modality to minimize the negative effects of delay.</p><p>Lastly, while the confluence of data and modeling presented here seems to indicate that patients rely disproportionately on delayed feedback from vision for this visuomotor tracking task, two of our top models (Model Best 5, Lowest Err and Best 4, Lowest Err; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) actually exhibited shorter feedback delays than visual delays for patients. This suggests that the patients’ control systems in this task may include some reliance, albeit weaker, on prediction and proprioception.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Modeling results support the cerebellum as a smith predictor</title><p>Sensorimotor tasks are naturally analyzed using control systems theory and system identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roth et al., 2014</xref>), and because cerebellar patients’ dysmetria resembles a poorly tuned control system, many researchers have analyzed cerebellar behavior using control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miall et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrill et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our modeling results indicate that control subjects make corrections based on prediction of a future limb state measurement. While there is some controversy on this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pélisson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>), previous work has proposed that the cerebellum might function in a manner consistent with a Smith Predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miall et al., 1993</xref>). Essentially, a Smith Predictor is a control architecture that compensates for self-movement feedback delay. To achieve this requires a simulation of the plant in order to predict sensory consequences of motor output, and a simulated delay that ‘stores’ the plant simulation for comparison with delayed feedback. In order to understand the consequences of incorporating a Smith Predictor, consider the generic feedback block diagram of sensorimotor control depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (top) and model the brain as either a controller <italic>with</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, left) or <italic>without</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, right) a Smith Predictor. Interestingly, upon simplification, we find the exact structures yielded by two of the top models (<italic>Best 5 Lowest Var</italic> and <italic>Best 4 Lowest Var</italic>): the patient model matches the simplified block diagram without a Smith Predictor and the age-matched control model matches the simplified block diagram which one. This suggests that an intact cerebellum may act in a manner qualitatively similar to a Smith Predictor and that patients ability to perform such prediction is impaired.1.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Our modeling results agree with the theory of the cerebellum as a Smith Predictor.</title><p>A basic model for the control system is shown in the top panel. In our experiment, the plant, P, represents the entire mechanical arm system, including the robot exoskeleton arm. A single visual delay block delays the input from both the reference signal and the feedback information. A visual gain scales the amount of the input the subject will attempt to replicate. The brain, illustrated by a dashed box, can be modeled as containing just a controller, C, as shown on the right side. Or, the brain can be modeled as a controller with an accompanying Smith Predictor, as shown on the left side. When these two alternate structures are simplified, we are left with the exact model structures yielded by our previous modeling results.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53246-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Perhaps the increased feedback delay in the cerebellar patients is unavoidable if one assumes the patients' control systems lack the essential capabilities of a Smith Predictor (making and storing predictive plant simulations). Thus, the apparent increased reliance on visual feedback seen in cerebellar patients may not be a compensatory mechanism at all—perhaps all subjects rely on delayed visual feedback, but healthy subjects disguise the delay using predictions of future measurements of limb state. Patients may simply lack this capability and it is not that they <italic>compensate</italic> for their deficit by relying <italic>more</italic> on visual feedback but instead that the loss of the sensory prediction and storage reveals the visual feedback delay inescapably present in both groups. This would provide some clarity on how cerebellar patients could ‘learn’ to ‘compensate’ in this way even when their cerebellum was damaged.</p><p>At its core, the Smith Predictor has to do with simulating the mechanical plant (and appropriate delay) in order to mitigate the effect of <italic>feedback</italic> delay. But notice that in our model there is a large visuomotor delay on the reference input even with the Smith Predictor in place. In order to compensate for the delayed visual measurement of the stimulus, the brain would need to be able to predict reference motions. To avoid this confound of stimulus prediction, and focus on feedback delay compensation, we fit our models using responses to unpredictable (sum-of-sine) target motions.</p><p>But, what if the target motion were predictable? Previously, it was shown in another species (weakly electric fish) that target predictability can indeed improve tracking performance, and it was hypothesized that this was based on an internal model of predictable reference motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we extend this to healthy human subjects who show marked improvement in the single-sine (predictable) tracking task. Cerebellar patients exhibit much more modest improvement in tracking predictable stimuli, suggesting that they may have impairment in both their own plant model predictions and predictions of external sensory references (see Results, Experiment 2). Further data and experiments would be needed to better isolate the effects of cerebellar damage on these potentially disparate functions of the cerebellum.</p><p>Lastly, even if a healthy cerebellum helps ‘cancel’ expected cursor feedback, this does not imply that visual cursor feedback goes unused: any errors in visual feedback, i.e., cursor self-motion feedback that is not precisely anticipated by the cerebellum, could be highly informative, and recent evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yon et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that a predictive model of action–perception could heighten perceptual sensitivity, making self-motion (in this case, cursor) feedback more nuanced and precise.</p><p>There are potential alterative modeling interpretations of the data presented in this paper. For example, a state predictor with optimal state feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crevecoeur and Gevers, 2019</xref>) is consistent with our observation that healthy subjects compensate for delay and is an avenue for further investigation. Also, our observation that visual target delay was longer in the patient model than the control-subject could conceivably be due to a different source of phase lag that our simplified modeling structure was not able to capture. Future experiments and analysis will investigate this further.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Potential for real-world application</title><p>In Experiment 3, we were successfully able to reduce the dysmetria of both the hypermetric and hypometric cerebellar patients in an elbow flexion task. Our visual feedback-control-based intervention was developed based on a control model which represented dysmetria as a mismatch between the patient’s internal model of their limb inertia and the actual limb inertia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhanpuri et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the success of our intervention provides support to this inertial mismatch theory. However, recent evidence based on the application of limb weights suggest that the inertial mismatch theory may be insufficient to explain dysmetria in multi-joint movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zimmet et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, feedback enhancement of multi-joint movements will likely require modifications of the simple acceleration-based controller tested in this paper. Moreover, the ‘best’ acceleration-dependent feedback gain was patient specific even for the single-degree-of-freedom reaches tested for this study, suggesting that idiosyncrasies in each patient’s motor control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>) may mandate patient-specific tuning. Such tuning will be made more complex for 2D and 3D arm movements.</p><p>Though our intervention successfully reduces the initial over or undershooting component of the reach, our method does not attempt to correct all aspects of dysmetria. Patients with cerebellar ataxia also typically exhibit increased movement variability. Application of this visual feedback gain does not attempt to reduce the variability of patient reaches. Secondly, our intervention does not completely eliminate the oscillations experienced by the subject after this first correction is made. Moreover, our modeling work does not characterize or explain this increased variability directly. Mild oscillations after the first correction can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. It is possible that adding a damping term to the feedback intervention might be able to address this oscillatory behavior.</p><p>Our results provide an encouraging foundation for future studies because they show that cerebellar patients are capable of using their own intact visual feedback control system to make accurate reaches. Further study is needed to determine whether this intact feedback control system could be leveraged therapeutically to reduce dysmetria without need for a virtual reality system. Alternatively, it is possible that wearable sensory augmentation (for example, tendon vibration or skin stretch) could be used as a surrogate for the vision-based sensory shift provided here. These alternatives are especially important because drug therapy for cerebellar ataxia is not currently viable, leaving rehabilitative and assistive therapies alone as the primary means of treatment for these patients. In any case, we hope that by identifying these intact movement control mechanisms we might help move treatment possibilities forward.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development HD040289 to AJB and NJC, Applied Physics Lab Graduate Fellowship FNACCCX19 to AMZ, National Science Foundation 1825489 to NJC and AJB.

interplay of feedforward and feedback processes. A large body of evidence has provided compelling evidence of the critical role for the cerebellum in feedforward control. In contrast, cerebellar involvement in feedback control has been more controversial. In this study, Zimmet and colleagues show that individuals with cerebellar ataxia are able to use visual feedback in a similar manner as control participants. However, unlike the controls, they were unable to compensate for delays in feedback processing-thus, their inability for predictive control resulted in delayed feedback. Interestingly, if the feedback was phase advanced in a virtual reality system, the patients' performance improved, providing a nice demonstration of the interplay between feedback and feedforward processes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cerebellar patients have intact feedback control that can be leveraged to improve reaching&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Max Donelan (Reviewer #2); Frederic Crevecoeur (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript investigates the role of the cerebellum in feedback control, comparing the performance of individuals with cerebellar pathology to a matched control group. The patients failed to exhibit predictive control (feedforward control), instead showing a strong dependency on the visual feedback (feedback control). The authors simplified a complicated control system intro tractable models, evaluated the model across different topologies, and designed experiments to distinguish between feedback control in the absence of prediction, and feedback control that leverages prediction. Their findings support the hypothesis that while, control participants could combine proprioceptive feedback with an internal model to have a prediction of the body's state and/or the target motion to allow for zero-delay tracking, the patients with cerebellar damage could not. The final experiment provides a strong and courageous test of these ideas, using a manipulation that partly corrected for the patients' deficiencies by shifting the visual information in an idiosyncratic manner to optimize predictive control to the visual feedback. The manuscript is clearly of great interest as it provides valuable data and insight with respect to cerebellar-dependent motor impairments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Issues with Experiment 3: Is the experimental manipulation about the manipulation of the delay, or does it become one of a manipulation of gain? If you would add acceleration feedback to a response that consists of sines (as in experiments 1 and 2), you add a signal that is 180 degrees out of phase, which simply leads to a reduction of gains (not a correction for delays as claimed, see the Introduction, last paragraph). For single point-to-point movements, adding acceleration could make sense, but does this make a clear prediction relevant to the goals of the current study? It seems as if it also here acts as a change of gain. The authors show that the optimal amount of acceleration (and thus the gain) is idiosyncratic. This corresponds with idiosyncratic biases in visuomotor matching that have been reported in the literature (e.g. in Rincon-Gonzalez et al.,(011, and Kuling et al., 2017). Gain control may be in intact in the patients (or experiment may lack sensitivity to detect gain control given ease in learning these).</p><p>2) Complexity of the analyses. These analyses are smart but difficult to follow and there may be alternatives that either simplify the presentation or are better suited to the questions under consideration.</p><p>a) The authors argue that the use of visual feedback introduces a delay. Instead of assessing the delay, they present the results in terms of a frequency-dependent phase-lag (illustrated by phasor plots that require some explanation). It may be simpler to regard the observed phase lags as corresponding to a delay of a bit more than 100 ms for al frequencies. The same argument holds for switching between the frequency domain and spatial analyses.</p><p>b) The models would benefit from more explanation. In particular, it requires a big leap of faith from the reader to be willing to accept that the controller and plant can be modeled as a simple integrator. It required in part, reading the McRuer and Krendel, 1974 paper.

Others may benefit from a clear explanation in the Introduction that builds their intuition.</p><p>d) The manner in which you chose the appropriate gain on the acceleration term may suffer from post-hoc selection bias. This concern was ameliorated by Figure 7C and Figure 8 which show clear systematic effects of this gain on dysmetria.</p><p>e) The developments are based on a simple model which ignores much of recent work on feedback control and delay compensation: state-of-the-art control models consider state-feedback control (Todorov and Jordan, 2002), and a lot of work has been done to characterise feedback functions and their respective latencies (Scott, Trends in neurosciences 39 (8), 512-526). Delay compensation has been studied in this context following visual perturbations (Izawa and Shadmehr, 2008) and mechanical perturbations (Crevecoeur and Scott, 2013). Recently it was proposed that in theory, a faulty delay compensation within the stability margin can produce oscillations in eye and arm movements, but these two operations are needed in both visual and limb motor systems (Crevecoeur and Gevers, Neural computation 31 (4), 738-764). While recognizing all models have limitations, the authors should consider this framework. The reason is that this literature has found consistent delays of ~100-120ms for the visual system, and ~50-60ms for somatosensory feedback. These are physiological measurements so if there is no reason to suspect a change in conduction velocity for cerebellar patients, these numbers could be used in in a state-feedback control model. This concern is based on the fact that the calculated delays by fitting the McRuer integrator with a Smith predictor seem off (170ms). If the model structure does not correspond to the physiology, the fitted parameters can be precise but inaccurate. We realize that considering state-feedback control model and delay compensation in the framework of LQG is more complex. However, this may be justified as this framework has been used extensively to model reach control and feedback responses to mechanical and visual perturbations.</p><p>f) The previous study by Kurtzer on long-latency control in cerebellar patients (Kurtzer et al., 2013) was not used in this study since it did highlight a reduction in response gain specific to the long-latency motor system, which is a valuable data for modelling purposes.</p><p>3) The results show that the patients lack delay compensation for the predictable visual stimulus. The question arises as whether the problem was delay compensation with respect to their body movements or with respect to the external world. The behavior of Exp 1 is used to conclude that the patients had impairments in their estimate of limb state. This conclusion seems indirect and it is not based on a limb perturbation. The authors imply that delay compensation is associated with proprioceptive estimates only, and that it is not expected to occur in the visual system. The associated rationale is not clear. It would seem that compensation for delays in the visual system is also necessary for controls to track the predictable target. Can we conclude that feedback control is intact, or is this specific form of visuomotor control that is unaffected? Possibly feedback control in the proprioceptive system is also intact, what seems to be missing is delay compensation, but it was not demonstrated whether the faulty delay compensation was in the visual or somatosensory motor system. The lack of predictive control could be in the visual system based on the tracking experiments. The deficit was attributed to predictive control of the limb based on indirect fitting of the model, but the rationale for this is unclear.</p><p>Related to this issue, the theoretical background suggests a role of the cerebellum in predicting the behavior of one's body (internal model). It is unclear how the experiments test this idea. Experiments 1 and 2 differ in the predictability of the stimulus, not the predictability of the body. The different behavior of the cerebellar patients in experiment 2 (and not in experiment 1) would indicate a problem with the prediction of the world, rather than of the body.</p><p>4) It was suggested that cerebellar patients had intact feedback control based on experiment 1. This is likely an overstatement: qualitative differences were visible in the traces of Figure 4 and the interaction between conditions and groups was associated with p = 0.07. Thus, it could be that the relatively low sample size does not allow to conclude for differences based on the analyses suggested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Issues with Experiment 3: Is the experimental manipulation about the manipulation of the delay, or does it become one of a manipulation of gain? If you would add acceleration feedback to a response that consists of sines (as in experiments 1 and 2), you add a signal that is 180 degrees out of phase, which simply leads to a reduction of gains (not a correction for delays as claimed, see the Introduction, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>This question raises a fairly complicated way to look at acceleration-dependent feedback, but that may have arisen from how we wrote the manuscript. Acceleration-dependent feedback leads position feedback by 180 degrees, but the amplitude scales with temporal frequency. This is scaled and added to position feedback, providing predictive feedback. In practical terms, the acceleration-dependent feedback is based on a moving-average estimate of acceleration, which amounts to including a finite-impulse-response (“sliding window”) low-pass filter to the acceleration computation. We used N=100 data points and a sampling period of 1ms (1kHz sampling); based on this, one can develop a simple approximation to our acceleration dependent feedback, showing in Matlab notation, as follows:</p><p>s = zpk('s');</p><p>Ts = 1e-3; % sampling time</p><p>N = 100; % num samples</p><p>MovAvg = (1/N)*(1-exp(-s*Ts*N))/(1 – exp(-s*Ts)); % Laplace transform for a 100ms moving average ka = 0.02; % example acceleration gain used in our experiments w = 2*pi*logspace(-1,log10(2.5),50); options = bodeoptions;</p><p>options.FreqUnits = 'Hz'; % bode( 1 + ka * s^2 * MovAvg,w,options);</p><p>The Bode plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (of just the combination of position and acceleration-dependent feedback) shows that this feedback is basically a high-pass (phase leading) filter, as expected:</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53246-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>When the gain ka is less than zero, this becomes a lag filter. The implementation of this filter and the practical details are now better described in the Materials and methods (subsection “Acceleration-Dependent Feedback (Experiment 3)”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For single point-to-point movements, adding acceleration could make sense, but does this make a clear prediction relevant to the goals of the current study? It seems as if it also here acts as a change of gain. The authors show that the optimal amount of acceleration (and thus the gain) is idiosyncratic. This corresponds with idiosyncratic biases in visuomotor matching that have been reported in the literature (e.g. in Rincon-Gonzalez et al.,(011, and Kuling et al., 2017). Gain control may be in intact in the patients (or experiment may lack sensitivity to detect gain control given ease in learning these).</p></disp-quote><p>First, we want to clarify, in light of our response above, that acceleration gain and a position gain are not the same thing. That said, we agree that gain control may be intact in these patients and indeed our Experiment 1 demonstrates this (see Figure 3C). In that experiment, we increased (decreased) the overall <italic>position</italic>​ feedback gain and patients and age-matched controls responded similarly, both decreasing (increasing, respectively) their response in a similar manner.</p><p>Also, the apparently idiosyncratic response to acceleration is actually quite consistent across patients in the sense that while they all have their own “optimal” value, each patient tends to trend in a similar way with respect to a change in acceleration-dependent feedback gain. See Figure 7C, for example, where all patients show a positive slope in their Mean Angle of First Correction as a function of <italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic>. The “optimal” is different because of each patient’s idiosyncratic baseline behavior, giving rise to a correspondingly idiosyncratic “intercept” in Figure 7C.</p><p>Thank you for pointing out these references. We had a bit of trouble finding an accurate way to map Kuling et al., 2017, to our current study. Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2011, shows the proprioceptive map of the arm is systematic and stable, but idiosyncratic. Hand position (unseen) estimation was mapped under conditions with and without tactile feedback and different hands. Each subject had a unique pattern of errors that was stable between hands and over time. This may be related to why the gain (ka) of acceleration is idiosyncratic, trying to compensate for the idiosyncratic estimation error. We adjusted the acceleration feedback by changing gain Ka, which in fact adjusts the filter we add externally, as you can see in the following figure:</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53246-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While the relationship between the Rincon-Gonzalez paper and the present manuscript is not completely clear, it does seem that the idiosyncratic nature of the mappings could be related, so in the Discussion, we have added the following general sentence to that effect:“Moreover, the “best” acceleration-dependent feedback gain was patient specific even for the single-degree-of-freedom reaches tested for this study, suggesting that idiosyncrasies in each patient’s motor control system (Rincon-Gonzalez, Buneo, and Tillery, 2011; Kuling et al., 2017) may mandate patient-specific tuning. Such tuning will be made more complex for 2D and 3D arm movements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Complexity of the analyses. These analyses are smart but difficult to follow and there may be alternatives that either simplify the presentation or are better suited to the questions under consideration.</p><p>a) The authors argue that the use of visual feedback introduces a delay. Instead of assessing the delay, they present the results in terms of a frequency-dependent phase-lag (illustrated by phasor plots that require some explanation). It may be simpler to regard the observed phase lags as corresponding to a delay of a bit more than 100 ms for al frequencies. The same argument holds for switching between the frequency domain and spatial analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The phasor plot is used to show the detailed frequency responses of all control and patient individuals, then reveal the categorical differences. In the modeling part, which is aimed at capturing the main group differences of the internal model structure, we did consider the pure delay model structure, a pure delay multiplied by a pure gain (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, Pure Delay model structures (D1, D2, D3)). Further, you can see in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D, although the pure delay models show good model consistency, they all present high fit error in both frequency and time domain, indicating that they do a poor job of capturing the data.</p><p>While we agree that the vast majority of the differences in phase lag between the populations can be accounted for by the delay, phase lag by itself is not equivalent to delay. Indeed, even in our extremely simplified model, as the reviewers rightly point out, we wound up with a delay that was probably on the high side (170ms), i.e. our model fits were consistent but biased (we agree with this, more later). Our model includes feedforward (measuring the target) and feedback (measuring self-motion) delays, as well as an additional 90deg phase lag in the feedback loop thanks to the McRuer-style integrator for the Plant + Controller. So it is not quite accurate to try to capture all the phase lag with a delay as this will miss several important factors:</p><p>1) Low-pass muscle and mechanical dynamics, which we have coarsely tried to capture with the integrator in the feedback loop</p><p>2) It would not discern between lags produced by self-motion feedback (which can be un-delayed due to model-based self-motion prediction in healthy subjects) and feedforward measure delay of the target (which cannot be eliminated unless the target is predictable).</p><p>Our model is simple and thus doesn’t capture everything perfectly either, and we elaborate on this below, but simplifying everything to just a delay would undermine our ability to make sensible comparisons about the structural differences between the populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The models would benefit from more explanation. In particular, it requires a big leap of faith from the reader to be willing to accept that the controller and plant can be modeled as a simple integrator. It required in part, reading the McRuer and Krendel, 1974 paper. But requiring readers to seek it out, read it, and understand it gets in the way of the digesting the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this literature will not be familiar to everyone and we further improved the writing by adding more explanations of McRuer gain-crossover model in the Materials and methods (subsection “Modeling (Using Data from Experiment 1)”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It took a while to understand why the acceleration term is like prediction. Others may benefit from a clear explanation in the Introduction that builds their intuition.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed; some intuitive explanation was added for the Acceleration-Dependent Feedback in the Materials and methods (subsection “Acceleration-Dependent Feedback (Experiment 3)”). Also more details are shown in our reply to question 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The manner in which you chose the appropriate gain on the acceleration term may suffer from post-hoc selection bias. This concern was ameliorated by Figure 7C and Figure 8 which show clear systematic effects of this gain on dysmetria.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe our lack of clarity here caused a misunderstanding. We performed two sets of experiments:</p><p>First, we used the PEST algorithm, an iterative experimental method for finding an optimal parameter based on a psychometric evaluation at each step of the algorithm. Specifically, cerebellar patients performed blocks of 10 reaches where this gain was held constant. Based on the categorization for the 10 reaches (hypometric, on-target, or hypermetric), the gain was increased, remained the same, or decreased, as determined by the PEST algorithm (see text for details). We then applied the final gain and measured the angle of first correction using that value of <italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic> for 10 reaches.</p><p>Second, we performed an entirely independent experiment where we tested several gains <italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic>, and demonstrated a strong positive correlation across those patients that were tested (not all patients could be tested in this way, see text).</p><p>All of the data from both experiments are plotted in Figure 7C. We do not believe there is any serious concern of post-hoc selection bias.</p><p>To help clarify this, we completely rewrote the Materials and methods section describing these experiments (—subsection “Acceleration-Dependent Feedback (Experiment 3)”) and we’ve clarified the Results (subsection “Experiment 3: Virtual Reality Feedback Can Reduce Dysmetria”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The developments are based on a simple model which ignores much of recent work on feedback control and delay compensation: state-of-the-art control models consider state-feedback control (Todorov and Jordan, 2002), and a lot of work has been done to characterise feedback functions and their respective latencies (Scott, Trends in neurosciences 39 (8), 512-526).

From the literature, estimates vary a bit, but are generally in the range of 110 – 160ms:</p><p>Haith, Pakpoor, and Krakauer, 2016: 143ms (mean online visuomotor feedback latency)</p><p>Pruszynski, Johansson and Flanagan, 2016: 110 ms (target jump, vision to kinematics)</p><p>Franklin and Wolpert, 2008: 151.5 ms (target jump, vision to force)</p><p>Saunders and Knill, 2003: 163 ms (online correction to self-motion perturbation during reaching)</p><p>Day and Lyon, 2000: 125 ms – 160 ms (target jump, vision to kinematics)</p><p>Brenner and Smeets, 1996: 110 ms (target jump, vision to kinematics)</p><p>We have updated our text reviewing visuomotor delays from the literature (subsection “Cerebellar Patient Performance Best Captured by Long Latency Closed-Loop Model”), citing delays of 110-160ms as reported above.</p><p>Discussion of delay parameter bias in our original manuscript.​ Initially, for our modeling, we had hand-picked a fairly large (63) subset of all possible models of the general model structure in Figure 4A. However, we were short sighted and left out critical model configurations that allowed more appropriate flexibility in model parameters. For this revision, we modified the code to test all possible 2667 model configurations and discovered models that were better in error and inconsistency as described in the paper. While these improved models are highly similar to the “best models” we had proposed before, there were some key differences, especially in regards to delay. For example, we have found visual tracking delay in healthy controls around 141-147ms, which is consistent with the above literature. Surprisingly (to us, although perhaps not in hindsight) patients had considerably longer delays (181-211ms) when we allowed the parameters to vary in the right way. Our short-sightedness stemmed from now allowing this “de-yoking” of the delays in the right way, essentially “blending” the delays of patients and controls, winding up with a model that was a compromise. Classic example of parameter bias!</p><p>So it seems likely that the initial “bias” that this reviewer so poignantly anticipated was caused by an unintentional, but initially forced compromise between patients and controls. Indeed it is an interesting result that the best model configurations we have now discovered exhibit an increase in delay of about 60 ms give or take for patients, a result consistent with observed delay differences in movement initiation.</p><p>This modeling correction has led to several small changes in the manuscript (mostly in the subsection “Cerebellar Patient Performance Best Captured by Long Latency Closed-Loop Model”), including a reworking of Figure 4 (including supplementary figures), and updated nomenclature for the models throughout the manuscript. The most scientifically significant component of this is the difference in delay between patients and controls. This is discussed in the aforementioned subsection.</p><p>State space:</p><p>Since receiving this review, Dr. Cowan and his PhD student Di Cao have begun working extensively with our collaborator James Freudenberg at Michigan to connect McRuer + Smith Predictor like computations to Optimal Feedback Control Theory (OFCT). The new analyses that these reviews have prompted are extremely interesting but far from tidy, and including them would greatly complicate an already complicated manuscript. We are taking them very seriously but feel that including the math here would make the paper (which ultimately is most useful for its experiments and data analysis) impenetrable and very long. We are working very fast to make this all the subject of an entire paper that we believe will be readable by computational motor control readers. We will be sure to acknowledge the reviewers of this paper that have disclosed themselves, and tie it to the present manuscript, if published.</p><p>Now, as to the accessibility of the models we are using the paper, there are large subsets of the readership for whom these old papers are standard but we also believe there is good reason readers who are unfamiliar might benefit from the parsimonious ideas in the McRuer model and the like. We hope that our improvements to the modeling description will serve to expose researchers to these useful ideas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) The previous study by Kurtzer on long-latency control in cerebellar patients (Kurtzer et al., 2013) was not used in this study since it did highlight a reduction in response gain specific to the long-latency motor system, which is a valuable data for modelling purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion which describes the Kurtzer et al. findings and how they relate to the current study:</p><p>“Cerebellar patients can also show a reduced feedback gain in situations where responses are driven by proprioception more than vision. Kurtzer et al., 2013, studied cerebellar patients’ ability to modulate long latency stretch responses (i.e. EMG responses within 45-100 ms of a muscle stretch) that depend on knowledge of intersegmental dynamics of the arm. […] These results combined suggest that cerebellar subjects can reweight which feedback modality to rely on (proprioception versus vision) depending on task demands, consistent with Block et al., 2012, and may reduce the sensorimotor gain on either modality to minimize the negative effects of delay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results show that the patients lack delay compensation for the predictable visual stimulus. The question arises as whether the problem was delay compensation with respect to their body movements or with respect to the external world. The behavior of Exp 1 is used to conclude that the patients had impairments in their estimate of limb state. This conclusion seems indirect and it is not based on a limb perturbation. The authors imply that delay compensation is associated with proprioceptive estimates only, and that it is not expected to occur in the visual system. The associated rationale is not clear. It would seem that compensation for delays in the visual system is also necessary for controls to track the predictable target. Can we conclude that feedback control is intact, or is this specific form of visuomotor control that is unaffected? Possibly feedback control in the proprioceptive system is also intact, what seems to be missing is delay compensation, but it was not demonstrated whether the faulty delay compensation was in the visual or somatosensory motor system. The lack of predictive control could be in the visual system based on the tracking experiments. The deficit was attributed to predictive control of the limb based on indirect fitting of the model, but the rationale for this is unclear.</p><p>Related to this issue, the theoretical background suggests a role of the cerebellum in predicting the behavior of one's body (internal model). It is unclear how the experiments test this idea. Experiments 1 and 2 differ in the predictability of the stimulus, not the predictability of the body. The different behavior of the cerebellar patients in experiment 2 (and not in experiment 1) would indicate a problem with the prediction of the world, rather than of the body.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, Experiment 1 was only sum-of-sines (unpredictable) stimuli (see subsection “Generating Target Trajectories (Experiments 1 &amp; 2)”). We perform modeling only on the basis of the sum-of-sines data; that’s why we mainly consider the delay compensation associated with proprioceptive estimates, and do not consider delay compensation for the (unpredictable) target motion in the modeling component of the study. By making comparison between patients and controls in this way, we focused on the role of cerebellum in predicting self-motion from the internal model.</p><p>Later we compared between single and sum of sines (see subsection entitled “Experiment 2: Poor Tracking of Simple Oscillatory Trajectories Highlights Cerebellar Patients’ Predictive Deficit” in Results​)​. We find that controls were significantly better than patients at single-sines tracking, illustrating cerebellar patients’ poor predictive ability as compared to controls which seem better able to compensate for visual delay when the target is predictable.</p><p>To help avoid confusion about what is tested in what experiments, we have summarized the three type experiments near the beginning of the Materials and methods (subsection “Experimental apparatus, experiments, and task instructions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It was suggested that cerebellar patients had intact feedback control based on experiment 1. This is likely an overstatement: qualitative differences were visible in the traces of Figure 4 and the interaction between conditions and groups was associated with p = 0.07. Thus, it could be that the relatively low sample size does not allow to conclude for differences based on the analyses suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree; we have softened this language. See subsection “Experiment 3: Virtual Reality Feedback Can Reduce Dysmetria”, first paragraph and Discussion, third paragraph. Also note that the Discussion points out that the patient feedback, while intact, is delayed and therefore not fully intact. The point is that the patient population while suffering from imperfect control, much of this seems to be in prediction and delay compensation, but the feedback gains are generally similar.</p></body></sub-article></article>
