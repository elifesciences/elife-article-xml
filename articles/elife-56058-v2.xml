is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is the only PAT predicted to bind Type-I PDZ domain-containing proteins. However, ZDHHC14’s neuronal roles are unknown. Here, we identify the PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) PSD93 as a direct ZDHHC14 interactor and substrate. PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes to the axon initial segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14’s importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>PSD93</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated potassium channels</kwd><kwd>ZDHHC14</kwd><kwd>DLG2</kwd><kwd>Kv1 channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brody Family Medical Trust Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>Shaun S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS094402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010842</institution-id><institution>Temple University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and axon initial segment targeting of PSD93 and Kv1-family potassium channels, events that are essential for normal neuronal excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are large, morphologically complex cells whose normal physiological function requires targeting of different voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels to specific subcellular locations. For example, voltage-gated calcium channels and neurotransmitter receptors must be clustered pre- and post-synaptically, respectively, to ensure the fidelity of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buonarati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suh et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels must be clustered at the axon initial segment (AIS) and, in myelinated axons, at or near nodes of Ranvier, to ensure correct initiation and propagation of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang and Rasband, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leterrier, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson and Jenkins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waxman and Foster, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms ensure the appropriate targeting of neuronal ion channels and receptors. In particular, non-enzymatic scaffold proteins, particularly those containing PSD95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, directly bind the intracellular C-terminal tails of several families of receptors and channels and thereby control their trafficking to, and/or stability at, precise subcellular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Sheng, 2004</xref>). PDZ domains are subdivided into several classes with the two best known subclasses, Type-I and Type-II PDZ domains, binding C-terminal sequences ending in S/T-X-V (where X is any amino acid) and Φ-X-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nourry et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A second mechanism to control receptor, ion channel, and scaffold protein interactions and targeting is dynamic post-translational modification. One post-translational modification whose importance in neurons is increasingly appreciated is the covalent addition of long-chain fatty acids to protein cysteine residues, a process called S-palmitoylation (or S-acylation, referred to here simply as palmitoylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamberlain and Shipston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hallak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">María-Eugenia and Van Der Goot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smotrys and Linder, 2004</xref>). Palmitoylation plays key roles in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>), particularly at synapses where many scaffold proteins and ion channels and receptors are palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naumenko and Ponimaskin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomas and Huganir, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>We previously suggested that these two mechanisms might act in concert because a surprising number of palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) possess C-terminal sequences that are themselves predicted to bind PDZ domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas and Hayashi, 2013a</xref>). However, almost all of these potential PDZ-binding PATs terminate in Type-II PDZ ligand (Φ-X-Φ) sequences and hence are unlikely to directly bind major Type-I PDZ domain proteins, several of which are important palmitoyl-proteins in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hung and Sheng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Sheng, 2004</xref>). The only PAT that contains a C-terminal Type-I PDZ ligand (S/T-X-V) is ZDHHC14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas and Hayashi, 2013a</xref>), a PAT whose neuronal roles and substrates are unknown. The lack of investigation of ZDHHC14 is perhaps surprising, given that this PAT is highly expressed in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>) and may even be the most highly expressed PAT in this brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>). ZDHHC14 is also one of only four PATs intolerant to loss of function genetic mutations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). This latter finding suggests that role(s) of ZDHHC14 cannot be compensated for by other PATs, which might be explained by ZDHHC14’s unique predicted PDZ-binding ability.</p><p>Here, we identify the Type-I PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) family scaffold protein PSD93 (post-synaptic density 93/chapsyn 110/DLG2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 1996</xref>) as a direct interactor and substrate of ZDHHC14. Like its close paralog, PSD95, PSD93 is a known palmitoyl-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Husseini et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Topinka and Bredt, 1998</xref>). However, while palmitoylation is well described to control PSD95 targeting to the post-synaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firestein et al., 2000</xref>), the role of PSD93 palmitoylation is less clear. We provide evidence that palmitoylation by ZDHHC14 targets PSD93 not to synapses, but to the AIS. Loss of ZDHHC14 also reduces palmitoylation and AIS targeting of Kv1 family potassium channels, whose clustering at the AIS was previously reported to be PSD93-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ogawa et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this model, and with the known role of Kv1 channels in constraining action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamada and Kuba, 2016</xref>), loss of ZDHHC14 reduces outward currents, which are likely mediated by voltage-dependent potassium channels, and also increases neuronal excitability. These findings have implications for our understanding of physiological regulation of neuronal excitability and how such regulation is impaired in conditions linked to hyper-excitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZDHHC14 binds PSD93 in a PDZ ligand-dependent manner</title><p>Seven of 24 mouse and eight of 23 human PATs have sequences that terminate in a predicted PDZ ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas and Hayashi, 2013a</xref>). However, only the sequence of ZDHHC14 terminates in a Type-I PDZ ligand (LSSV [Leu-Ser-Ser-Val-COOH]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This LSSV sequence is perfectly conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and might be predicted to bind Type-I PDZ-domain scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hung and Sheng, 2002</xref>), many of which cluster ion channels and receptors at sites of excitability in neurons. We thus hypothesized that ZDHHC14 might use its conserved PDZ ligand to bind interacting partners and potential substrates and hence used this region as ‘bait’ to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat hippocampal cDNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three unique ‘hits’ encompassed the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of the scaffold protein PSD93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Back-transformation experiments using a shorter ‘prey’ plasmid expressing PSD93-PDZ3 alone revealed that PSD93-PDZ3 directly bound the wild type (LSSV) C-terminus of ZDHHC14 but did not bind a mutant ZDHHC14 C-terminus with a mutated PDZ ligand (LSSE: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that the C-terminal PDZ ligand of ZDHHC14 binds PSD93-PDZ3 in yeast.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZDHHC14 interacts with and palmitoylates both palmitoylated isoforms of PSD93 but more robustly palmitoylates PSD93β.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ZDHHC14 showing predicted transmembrane domains (TM, gray boxes), DHHC cysteine rich catalytic domain (blue box) and the C-terminal region used for yeast 2-hybrid screening (Bait), including the LSSV motif.

Palmitoylation is a key mechanism that allows precise and dynamic regulation of protein targeting during development and in response to neuronal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>). However, while roles of palmitoylation in regulating protein targeting at the synapse are reasonably well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brigidi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firestein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>), far less is known regarding the importance of palmitoylation at other sites involved in neuronal excitation. Here we identify ZDHHC14 as a key controller of palmitoylation and AIS targeting of PSD93 and Kv1 family channels. Loss of ZDHHC14 also profoundly increases neuronal excitability, a finding that could be explained by loss of Kv1 channels from the AIS. Clustering of Kv1 channels at the AIS is thus controlled by palmitoylation-dependent mechanisms reminiscent of those that govern targeting glutamate receptors to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firestein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomas and Huganir, 2013b</xref>). However, AIS targeting of Kv1 channels involves a distinct PDZ-domain protein and a different, largely unstudied PAT.</p><p>PSD93’s interaction with, and palmitoylation by, ZDHHC14 is dependent on ZDHHC14’s C-terminal PDZ ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that ZDHHC14 recognizes PSD93, and perhaps other substrates, in a PDZ ligand-dependent manner. This PDZ ligand-dependent mechanism of substrate recognition by a PAT was also reported for ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, which use their Type-II PDZ ligands to bind and palmitoylate the PDZ domain-containing protein GRIP1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). While these are the only three PATs known to use this mechanism of substrate recognition, certain kinases also bind and phosphorylate PDZ domain-containing substrates in a manner dependent on the kinase’s PDZ ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasegawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sabio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although the C-termini of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 are not predicted to bind ZDHHC14, they all terminate in Type-I PDZ ligands that (i) are critically important for their axonal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Clapham, 1999</xref>) and (ii) can directly bind PSD93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, it is possible that PSD93 is not only a direct ZDHHC14 substrate but also acts as a scaffold to allow ZDHHC14 to control palmitoylation and subcellular targeting of Kv1 channels. This possibility is further increased by our finding that ZDHHC14 binds PDZ domain 3 of PSD93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), while Kv1.4 binds PDZ domain 2 of PSD93 (originally described as an unidentified ‘Clone 5’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 1995</xref>) and subsequently confirmed as PSD93/Chapsyn-110 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 1996</xref>. However, ZDHHC14 is not enriched at the AIS, but rather predominantly localizes to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). These findings would support a model in which PSD93 acts as a scaffold for Kv1 channels and ZDHHC14 at the Golgi to allow ZDHHC14-dependent palmitoylation of Kv1 channels and their subsequent co-trafficking with PSD93 to the AIS. This mechanism is not unprecedented, as palmitoylation within the Golgi was reported to facilitate forward trafficking of the BK potassium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tian et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>ZDHHC14 loss significantly reduces palmitoylation of PSD93 and Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) but does not eliminate palmitoylation of these proteins. Whether this residual palmitoylation is due to the presence of other PATs, incomplete <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown, or both, is currently unknown. Assessing residual (non-ZDHHC14-dependent) palmitoylation of these proteins could potentially require developing reagents to knock-down multiple additional PATs. Some potential insight into this issue is provided by a recent report that the zebrafish ortholog of Kv1.1 could be palmitoylated by the PAT HIP14 (ZDHHC17) in cotransfected HEK293 cells, although palmitoylation of endogenous neuronal Kv1.1 by ZDHHC17/HIP14 was not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). HIP14/ZDHHC17 might thus be a candidate to contribute to residual palmitoylation of Kv1.1 (as well as possibly other Kv1 channels). However, ZDHHC17 is less likely to mediate residual PSD93 palmitoylation because this PAT lacks a Type-I PDZ ligand and loss of ZDHHC17 does not affect PSD93 palmitoylation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wan et al., 2013</xref>). While we cannot rule out roles for ZDHHC17/HIP14 and/or other PATs, our findings suggest that PSD93 and Kv1 palmitoylation is dominantly controlled by ZDHHC14 in hippocampal neurons.</p><p>The temporally similar developmental upregulation of ZDHHC14, PSD93, and Kv1 channel protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is striking, but such a biochemical analysis cannot address the subcellular location(s) to which these proteins localize as their levels increase. However, a prior study reported, albeit non-quantitatively, that Kv1.2 is first detectably enriched at the AIS of cultured hippocampal neurons at a very similar timepoint (DIV13) to when we observe marked upregulation of total Kv1.2 protein levels (DIV12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sánchez-Ponce et al., 2012</xref>). This finding strengthens the possibility that Kv1.2 upregulation coincides with and/or results in its AIS targeting. We nonetheless appreciate that more in-depth analyses, potentially involving laser-capture dissection of sufficient individual AIS’s to run immunoblots and/or comprehensive, semi-quantitative immunocytochemical experiments at individual AIS’s, would be required to further test this hypothesis.</p><p>Intriguing, additional support for a shared function of ZDHHC14, PSD93, and Kv1 channels in AIS regulation emerges from examining the evolutionary conservation of ZDHHC14, PSD93, and the AIS itself. Sodium channel clustering in proximal axons is first observed immunohistologically in vertebrates, coincident with the evolution of AIS-anchoring domains in these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kole and Stuart, 2012</xref>). Similarly, N-terminal palmitoylation sites are only present in vertebrate orthologs of PSD93 and are absent in the fruit fly PSD93 ortholog Discs Large (DLG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas and Hayashi, 2013a</xref>). Lastly, ZDHHC14’s PDZ ligand, which greatly increases ZDHHC14’s ability to palmitoylate PSD93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is first observed in simple chordates (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, palmitoyl-sites and PDZ ligands in Kv1 channels are more evolutionarily ancient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the ability of ZDHHC14 to palmitoylate PSD93, and for palmitoyl-PSD93 to act as a scaffold to cluster Kv1 channels at the AIS, appear to have evolved with the appearance of the AIS itself as nervous systems became more complex.</p><p>Several lines of evidence are consistent with direct loss of Kv1-type voltage-gated potassium channels accounting for the increased excitability of <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons. First, ZDHHC14 loss decreases outward currents, a phenotype most readily accounted for by reduced number and/or function of voltage-gated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson et al., 2002</xref>). ZDHHC14 loss also reduces AIS localization of multiple Kv1 family channels, assessed immunocytochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, Kv1-type channels activate at subthreshold membrane potentials and counteract voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) currents, thereby dampening action potential firing and reducing neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamada and Kuba, 2016</xref>). The decrease in outward currents and increase in excitability seen after ZDHHC14 loss are thus both consistent with a reduction in Kv1 channel number and/or function.</p><p>Specific features of APs in <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons are also consistent with reduced Kv1 channel number and/or function. For example, Kv1-type channels are known to regulate AP firing by suppressing generation of, as well as shortening, action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamada and Kuba, 2016</xref>) so Kv1 channel loss at the AIS could account for the decreases in latency to the first action potential, rheobase, and rate of action potential repolarization seen in <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,E,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, the slight but significant AP broadening that we observed in <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons (half-width; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) was also seen following acute block of Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kole et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We are nonetheless aware that other factors may also influence excitability in <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons. For example, while the slightly increased resting membrane potential is also consistent with loss of Kv1 channels, we cannot exclude roles for other voltage-gated potassium channels in this increase. An increased resting membrane potential could also inactivate a subset of voltage- gated sodium channels, which might in turn account for the decreased peak AP amplitude and rate of AP rise seen with <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Another change seen after ZDHHC14 loss is the shortening of the AIS itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), previously reported to be a compensatory response to increased neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumitrescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grubb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>). Like the increased membrane potential, this decreased AIS length could thus be a secondary consequence of Kv1 loss after <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown but could also be due to other changes. In summary, several aspects of the excitability changes in <italic>Zdhhc14</italic> knockdown neurons are consistent with a direct loss of Kv1 channels, but we recognize that other changes may be downstream secondary consequence of such loss, or may be due to altered regulation of other voltage-dependent channels and/or AIS structural proteins.</p><p>We also recognize that mutating the palmitoyl-cysteines of the PSD93β isoform reduces AIS localization of PSD93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to a lesser extent than is seen following loss of ZDHHC14 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings suggest that additional ZDHHC14 substrate(s) may also contribute to AIS localization of PSD93. Kv1 channels themselves, which PSD93 directly binds and which are robustly palmitoylated in a ZDHHC14-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), could potentially play such a role. It is especially intriguing that many other AIS-localized ion channels, scaffolds, and cell adhesion molecules are either known or predicted to be palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson and Jenkins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pei et al., 2016</xref>). It would be important to determine in the future the extent to which ZDHHC14 loss impairs palmitoylation of these proteins, and how any such additional changes in palmitoylation might affect not just PSD93 localization, but also the broader structure and/or function of the AIS.</p><p>Given that ZDHHC14 may regulate other palmitoyl-proteins, it is theoretically possible that signals in our biochemical and/or immunocytochemical experiments could represent heteromultimers of PSD93 and its paralogous palmitoyl-protein PSD95, which were reported in transfected non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 1996</xref>). However, subsequent studies of endogenous proteins from brain tissue suggested that although both PSD95 and PSD93 are found in multimeric complexes, endogenous PSD93/PSD95 heteromultimers were not detected (i.e. the endogenous multimeric complexes consist of homomeric PSD95 or PSD93, but not both) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsueh et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, any potential heteromultimerization would not be an issue for our ABE assays, which assess denatured proteins that run as monomers on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also note that our PSD93 antibody is validated using knockout tissue by the supplier. This antibody might still theoretically detect PSD95 in immunocytochemical experiments, but a prior study reported that PSD95 (detected with another widely used monoclonal antibody, which is itself validated using knockout tissue) is undetectable at the AIS, whereas PSD93 is AIS-localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ogawa et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, we used the same PSD93 antibody, and a very similar fixation protocol, to the work of Ogawa et al. We would thus expect that antibodies against PSD93 (and also PSD95, if we were to use them) would show similar specificity in our experiments. Together, these findings suggest that we do not detect PSD93/PSD95 heteromultimers in either biochemical or immunocytochemical assays.</p><p>We also note that the effect of ZDHHC14 loss on neuronal excitability is more dramatic than the effect on AIS targeting of any individual Kv1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> versus 9). One possible explanation for this finding is that palmitoylation not only regulates channel targeting to the AIS but also regulates Kv1 channel electrophysiological responses. Indeed, palmitoylation was previously shown to modulate voltage-sensing of Kv1.1 expressed in Sf9 cells and loss of Kv1.1 palmitoylation decreased current amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gubitosi-Klug et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, though, another intriguing possibility is that ZDHHC14 is a master regulator of multiple AIS ion channels and/or scaffold proteins and that impaired localization and/or function of these additional ZDHHC14 substrates further impacts neuronal excitability.</p><p>While we have focused this study on physiological neuronal regulation, our findings also have implications for our understanding of how neuronal excitability is altered in conditions such as epilepsy. Indeed, mutations in multiple Kv1 channel genes and copy number variations of the <italic>Dlg2</italic> gene (which codes for PSD93) are associated with multiple neurological conditions characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability, including epilepsy, myokemia, episodic ataxia, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuscó et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eunson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felix, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reggiani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). It is an intriguing possibility that dysregulated palmitoylation of PSD93 and/or Kv1 channels contributes to the pathogenesis of such conditions. In contrast, ZDHHC14 has not, thus far, been associated with any neuropathological condition. However, ZDHHC14 is one of only four PATs intolerant to loss of function mutations in humans, suggesting that it may be an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). While it is possible that roles of ZDHHC14 in non-neuronal tissues underlie this requirement, it is again intriguing that ZDHHC14’s potential action as a master regulator of AIS structure and function could account for its indispensability.</p><p>In summary, our findings that palmitoylation of PSD93 by ZDHHC14 is important for regulating targeting of voltage-gated ion channels to the AIS and for neuronal excitability, provide key insights into multiple outstanding questions. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first substrates of ZDHHC14 in any system and reveal, for the first time, a role for PSD93 palmitoylation in neurons, a question that has remained unanswered for two decades. We also demonstrate that Kv1 family voltage-gated potassium channels are endogenously palmitoylated in neurons and provide additional mechanistic insight into the regulation of their AIS targeting and physiology. These findings have important implications for our understanding of physiological regulation of neuronal excitability and its dysfunction in epilepsy and/or other conditions marked by hyper-excitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Transduced hippocampal neurons were lysed and sonicated in the same lysis buffer on DIV16 and lysates passed through a QIAshredder homogenization column (#79654, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HEK293T cell and hippocampal neuron lysates were then incubated at 50°C for 20 min after which protein was precipitated and excess MMTS removed by acetone precipitation. Protein pellets were then dissolved in 4% SDS buffer (4% [w/v] SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA plus PIC) and the resultant solution wassplit in two and incubated for one hour with either 0.7 M hydroxylamine pH 7.4 (+NH<sub>2</sub>OH, HAM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), to cleave thioester bonds and remove palmitate groups, or with 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 (buffer control, -NH<sub>2</sub>OH). Both buffers contained 1 mM biotin-HPDP (Soltec Ventures, Beverly, MA) to biotinylate newly revealed cysteines.

Lysates were passed through a 0.22 μm Spin-X filter column after which total protein amount was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal protein amounts were denatured in SB and subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gels with GST precipitates, ABE samples, or developmental time course samples were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF (#IPVH00010, 0.45 μm, Millipore-Sigma) membranes, blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk/Tris buffered saline (TBS), and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. HRP conjugated secondary antibodies were used for ECL-mediated visualization (Western Lightening Plus-ECL, #NEL105001EA, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) with film (GeneMate Blue Lite Autorad Film, F-#9024−8 × 10, VWR, Radnor, PA).

Transfected neurons were fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA in 1xPBS with 4% (w/v) sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. All coverslips were then washed three times (five minutes per wash) in 1xPBS followed by block and permeabilization with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (NGS, Southern Biotech) and 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1xPBS for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated with indicated primary antibodies overnight at room temperature in permeabilization/block solution, washed with PBS and then incubated with Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies for one hour at room temperature before mounting on glass slides with FluorSave Reagent (Millipore-Sigma, #345789). Specificity of anti-PSD93, anti-Kv1.1, anti-Kv1.2, anti-Kv1.4, and anti-ankyrin-G antibodies in immunocytochemical studies was verified by control experiments omitting the primary antibody in question, which, in each case, abolished staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Immunostained neurons were imaged using a Nikon C2 inverted confocal microscope with a 60x oil immersion objective (1.4 NA, plan-Apo). Z-stack images were taken with 0.4 μm spacing at 1024 × 1024 resolution and parameters were kept constant between different conditions. In all experiments wells of neurons were randomly assigned to the various groups.</p><p>For experiments involving AIS protein targeting a field of interest was selected based on the AIS marker (AnkG) with no knowledge of the experimental signal (PSD93, Kv1.1–1.4) that was subsequently acquired in a separate channel. Confocal image stacks were opened using ImageJ Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and background subtraction was performed using a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels. AIS targeting was determined using the 3D Objects Counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>) in ImageJ Fiji by thresholding the AnkG signal to generate a 3-dimensionally reconstructed mask of regions of interest corresponding to individual AISs. The mask was then used to quantify mean intensity and integrated density within each AIS in the corresponding PSD93 or Kv1 channel image (again in three dimensions) using the ‘Redirect to’ function in the 3D Object Counter plugin. Thresholding settings were maintained through an individual experiment image set and a lower limit size filter of 300 pixels was set to exclude non-AIS 3D objects. Data from particles not corresponding to intact AISs were manually removed prior to analysis. In each individual experimental replicate, i.e. an independent culture, a minimum of 15, and a mean of 85 individual AISs were quantified and averages were calculated to generate a single determination for both mean intensity and integrated density that was considered a biological replicate.</p><p>AIS lengths were determined by tracing thresholded AnkG images through the confocal stack to generate a 3D tracing of each individual AIS using the using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Longair et al., 2011</xref>) in ImageJ Fiji. Thresholding settings were maintained through an individual experiment image set. In each individual experimental replicate, defined as an independent culture, at least 50–150 individual AISs were traced and an average AIS length was calculated to generate a single determination that was considered a biological replicate.</p><p>Images of spine-bearing (i.e. presumptive excitatory) PSD93β-myc transfected neurons were acquired and an experimenter blind to condition scored AIS myc distribution manually using maximum intensity projections generated in ImageJ Fiji. Ten transfected neurons were imaged and scored per condition in each individual transfected culture and the percentage value of AIS-enriched versus diffuse signal per culture was considered a biological replicate.</p><p>For illustration purposes images used in figures are maximum intensity projections generated and modified for brightness and contrast using ImageJ Fiji where settings were maintained across each example set of images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>For electrophysiological experiments, neurons were cultured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moon et al., 2013</xref>) and infected at DIV3 with AAVs. At 13–15 days post-infection whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature. Cells were briefly viewed for EGFP fluorescence to confirm infection (Olympus FITC/GFP filter cube). Whole-cell recordings were obtained using borosilicate glass electrodes (resistance 3–5 MΩ) filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 130 potassium methylsulfate, 10 KCl, 5 Tris-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 4 Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 0.4 Na<sub>4</sub>GTP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 to 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 12 glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. NBQX (4 μM), D-AP5 (10 μM), and picrotoxin (100 μM; Abcam) were included in the extracellular medium to block AMPA-, NMDA-, and GABA-mediated synaptic transmission, respectively. For all current-clamp experiments membrane potential was kept between −60 and −65 mV by applying small DC current. For the voltage-clamp experiments we used the same intracellular solution as for the current-clamp recordings. Neurons were held at −70 mV and a series of voltage steps were given from −80 mV to +100 mV in increments of 15 mV. Data were acquired using Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized using Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). All data were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. Individual neurons were considered biological replicates and wells of neurons were randomly assigned to the various groups. Data were analyzed off-line using Clampfit (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism eight software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In all graphs the mean is shown and error bars indicate standard deviation of the mean (SD). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine if data were normally distributed. Statistical test used is indicated in the corresponding figure legend or table column. In cases with two experimental groups, if data were normally distributed unpaired Student’s t-test was used but if data were not normally distributed or variances between groups were unequal (determined by F test) a non-parametric Mann Whitney t-test was used. In cases with more than two experimental groups, all data were normally distributed, thus 1-way ANOVA was used unless variances between groups were unequal (determined by Bartlett’s test), in which case Welch’s 1-way ANOVA was used instead. In cases with more than one independent variable without repeated measures, two-way ANOVA was used. When repeated electrophysiological measurements were taken on individual neurons with increasing current steps, neurons fired 0-X number of action potentials and the resulting data were analyzed using a repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. However, when a neuron did not fire any action potentials at a given current step there was no time value for latency to first action potential resulting in missing values so instead a mixed effects analysis was used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is “in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>”.

The goal of this manuscript was to examine the role of the palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ZDHHC14 in regulating the clustering of Kv1 channels via PSD93 at the axon initial segment (AIS). The novel observations in this study are that ZDHHC14 drive palmitoylation of PSD93. This post-translational modification promotes the clustering of PSD93 to the AIS. In doing so, PSD93 seems to serve as a scaffold to facilitate targeting and clustering of Kv1 channels to the AIS. The relevance of these observations is underscored by data suggesting that the downregulation of ZDHHC14 increases the excitability of hippocampal neurons. In general, the paper is well written, uses well-established approaches in the field, and the data seem of high quality, with appropriate controls and in support of the main hypothesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Statistical analyses are insufficient and in their current form overstate the data. For example, the authors fail to explain what type of data distribution is expected and which is the appropriate chosen test (figure legends indicate all tests used, but it remains a mystery to understand the abundant use of t-tests for example). When using descriptive statistics (means), the authors incorrectly show S.E.M. instead of S.D. The sample size (N) varies quite dramatically sometimes within the same graph and analysis – it is unclear how sometimes highly significant results are obtained from comparisons of N=3-13 within the same test.</p><p>2) The authors chose to treat individual neurons (Figure 3 and supplements, Figure 4, Figure 7) as biological replicates. This is a problematic decision for several reasons. AIS show significant heterogeneity in length, onset and location as shown by numerous recent studies (Thome et al., 2014 Neuron, Hamada et al., 2016 PNAS, Hoefflin et al., 2017 Front Cell Neurosci, Meza et al., 2018 J Neurosci). This has direct impact on neuronal excitability (Gulledge and Bravo, 2015 eNeuro, Kole and Brette, 2018 Curr Opin Neurosci, Goethals and Brette, 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>). Therefore, individual neurons vary quite a bit in all of these parameters, including possibly location and distribution of putative binding sites. Therefore when statements in the Discussion are based on these data, an issue arises (for example Discussion, fourth and fifth paragraphs). It is far more accurate to treat individual cultures as N, with at least 50-100 AIS/culture. This is what the vast majority of current papers on the AIS field reflect. The authors do not have to perform new experiments, but rather compare their existing data differently. It would give a far more accurate read-out.</p><p>3) The image analysis for AIS measurements of expression as described in the Materials and methods section is inadequate to draw meaningful conclusions about clustering. Co-localization analysis in confocal stacks requires 3D reconstruction and not just a change in &quot;color&quot; of two overlaying channels in Maximum Intensity Projections. The same issue applies to AIS length measurements.</p><p>4) The conclusions drawn based on data in Figures 5 and 8 are overstated. Immunoblot analysis of Kv1.x expression from entire neuron lysates takes into consideration all Kv expression – somatodendritic as well as axonal/AIS. It is by no means an indicator of a developmental expression at the AIS (see Discussion). Such an experiment would require either the laser-dissection of individual AIS in sufficient numbers to run immunoblots, or a comprehensive, semi-quantitative IF analysis at individual AIS. These experiments are not essential, but the authors should tone down the conclusions and also state that all Kvs will be detected in an immunoblot assay, regardless of their subcellular localization. Figure 8: In the Results, this data is used to suggest that: &quot;ZDHHC14 predominantly controls palmitoylation of PSD93 and Kv1 within the Golgi&quot;. However, the authors provide no quantification of their IF data.</p><p>5) Electrophysiology. While potentially very informative, the data presented are not sufficient to conclude that it is indeed the loss of ZDHCC14 and therefore Kv channels at the AIS that result in an increase in excitation. The authors should report at least all passive properties (table format) across samples. What about current threshold, threshold voltage, half-width, and an analysis of AP waveform? As they stand, electrophysiological experiments inform of a possible physiological role played by palmitoylated kv1 channels, however, the reduced threshold could also be produced by down-regulation of other outward potassium conductances or increases of excitatory inward currents as a direct consequence of ZDHHC14 knockdown. The authors should provide direct evidence (by voltage-clamp) that the neurons with increased excitability show a reduced outward current that can be ascribed to kv1 channels. These should be easy experiments to perform.</p><p>6) All raw Western blot films should be provided as supplementary data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;The Palmitoyl Acyltransferase ZDHHC14 Controls Kv1-Family Potassium Channel Clustering at the Axon Initial Segment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Data in our revised manuscript are now re-plotted using SD rather than SEM. In addition, to better represent the experimental variation in the data, we now plot all data normalized to control across biological replicates rather than normalized to the control in each individual experiment. We also performed normality tests and F or Bartlett’s tests of equal variation of all data sets and now only use t-tests when the data are normally distributed and groups have equal variation. If the data do not pass these two tests, we instead perform a non-parametric Mann Whitney test. We explain these analyses in more detail the revised Materials and methods section “Statistical analyses”.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewers’ concern with the varying N in some individual experiments. In the example they highlight, this issue occurred because we first assessed palmitoylation of only one PSD93 isoform by wild type ZDHHC14 and only later assessed palmitoylation of a second PSD93 isoform, and the effect of the ZDHHC14-LSSE mutation. Because a wtZDHHC14 and PSD93 “reference” sample was always included in the later experiments we pooled all data, but the N number for the “wt ZDHHC14 and PSD93” condition was hence disproportionately greater. We have now removed experiments that did not include a ZDHHC14-LSSE condition and analyzed the data in two ways. In a revised main Figure 1 we present the data with the alpha and beta subunits analyzed separately where the N are equal across all conditions (N=6 and N=4, respectively) and in a new Figure 1—figure supplement 3 we show the data plotted and analyzed together where there is a much smaller discrepancy between N. The N in these updated statistical analyses are thus much more similar.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up these points and hope they would agree that our updated analyses better represent the data. Importantly, all of the major effects that we initially reported remain statistically significant with these revised tests and methods of analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors chose to treat individual neurons (Figure 3 and supplements, Figure 4, Figure 7) as biological replicates.

It would give a far more accurate read-out.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point from the reviewers. As suggested, we revised our analyses using individual cultures (rather than AIS’s) as N and also used 3D reconstruction (see Point 3 below) rather than maximum intensity projections. Under these new analysis conditions, we found that the effect of ZDHHC14 loss on AIS localization of PSD93, Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4 remained statistically significant, as did the change in AIS length. We have re-plotted the data to reflect these changes and modified the Results and Discussion text to describe these modified analyses and our conclusions. As with point #1, we note that the major effects that we initially reported largely remain statistically significant with these revised analyses. For Kv1.2, the mean gray value data do not reach significance with this modified analysis, but the integrated density data remain significant i.e. the total amount of Kv1.2 at the AIS is still reduced (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 3, and Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The image analysis for AIS measurements of expression as described in the Materials and methods section is inadequate to draw meaningful conclusions about clustering. Co-localization analysis in confocal stacks requires 3D reconstruction and not just a change in &quot;color&quot; of two overlaying channels in Maximum Intensity Projections. The same issue applies to AIS length measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. As suggested, we reanalyzed both AIS targeting and AIS lengths using 3D reconstruction. As explained in our response to Point 2, our five readouts (PSD93 targeting, Kv1.1 targeting, Kv1.2 targeting, Kv1.4 targeting, and AIS length) remained statistically significant when 3D reconstructions were used and when data were analyzed using individual cultures as N (Points 3 and 2, respectively). We have modified our Materials and methods (“Image acquisition and analysis” section) and figures to reflect these new analyses (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 3, and Figure 7). We have also updated our Materials and methods section to fully explain these updated analysis procedures. For clarification, we also note that although the initial Point #3 includes the term “co-localization”, our AIS targeting analyses do not assess co-localization per se – instead the AnkG signal is used as a mask and the PSD93/Kv1.X signal within the masked region is then calculated. Importantly, though, the reviewers’ suggestion to use a mask generated from a 3D reconstruction of the entire stack of images, rather than a 2-dimensional Maximum Intensity projection greatly reduced contributions from non-AIS-localized (e.g. synaptodendritic) PSD93/Kv1.X signals from other neurons in the culture. We are hence very grateful to the reviewers for suggesting this modified analysis, as we hope they would agree that it far more accurately captures the effects of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusions drawn based on data in Figures 5 and 8 are overstated. Immunoblot analysis of Kv1.x expression from entire neuron lysates takes into consideration all Kv expression – somatodendritic as well as axonal/AIS.

Such an experiment would require either the laser-dissection of individual AIS in sufficient numbers to run immunoblots, or a comprehensive, semi-quantitative IF analysis at individual AIS.

We have therefore toned down the conclusions of our developmental expression analysis as suggested. We have also softened the language regarding possible location(s) in which ZDHHC14-dependent palmitoylation of PSD93 and Kv1 occurs. However, we do include an additional reference (Sanchez-Ponce et al., 2012) that shows (albeit non-quantitatively) that Kv1.2 is first detected at the AIS at a very similar timepoint (DIV13) to when we observe marked upregulation of Kv1.2 protein levels (DIV12) in similar hippocampal cultures. We briefly mention this point in our revised Discussion, while also highlighting the caveats raised by reviewers (second paragraph of the “Developmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels” Results section, the “ZDHHC14 is a major neuronal PAT for Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.4” Results section, the “ZDHHC14 is predominantly a Golgi-localized PAT in hippocampal neurons” Results section, and the third and fifth paragraph of the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Electrophysiology.

These should be easy experiments to perform.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to perform additional analyses and experiments to address this point. Indeed, we found that key features of the action potential properties in Zdhhc14 knockdown neurons are consistent with reduced Kv1 channel number and/or function. In particular, closer examination of our data revealed that the latency to the first action potential, rheobase, and the rate of action potential repolarization were all decreased in Zdhhc14 knockdown neurons (Figure 9D-G; Table 1). These data are consistent with reduced Kv1 levels and/or function at the AIS because Kv1-type channels are known to regulate action potential firing by suppressing generation of, as well as shortening, action potentials (Yamada and Kuba, 2016). In addition, the slight but significant AP broadening in Zdhhc14 knockdown neurons (Table 1) is consistent with that seen following acute block of Kv1 channels (Guan, Pathak, and Foehring, 2018; Kole, Letzkus and Stuart, 2007). Moreover, our new experiments showing markedly reduced outward currents in the absence of Zdhhc14 further support the notion that the increased excitability is due to loss of Kv1 channels (Figure 9A-C). Together, these new data and analyses are all consistent with our model in which ZDHHC14 regulates Kv1 localization and/or function. Despite this additional supportive evidence, we are nonetheless careful to note that additional ZDHHC14 substrate(s) may contribute to these effects. We have updated Figure 9 to include these new data and have also added a new Table 1 to summarize the results of the action potential analyses. In addition, we briefly expanded our Discussion to highlight how these new data support our overall model (seventh and tenth paragraphs of the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) All raw Western blot films should be provided as supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>Images of all raw Western blot films are now provided in additional figure supplements relating to the corresponding parent figure, as requested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have made a great effort of addressing the comments of reviewers, including new experiments and greatly improving the statistical analysis as well as analysis if imaging data.
