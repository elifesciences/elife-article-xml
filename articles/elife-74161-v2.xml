disruption due to a changing climate, predicting which species are most vulnerable to environmental change is critical. The life-history of a species is an evolved response to its environmental context, and therefore a promising candidate for explaining differences in climate-change responses. However, we need broad empirical assessments from across the world's ecosystems to explore the link between life history and climate-change responses. Here, we use long-term abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammals and a two-step Bayesian meta-regression framework to investigate the link between annual weather anomalies, population growth rates, and species-level life history. Overall, we found no directional effect of temperature or precipitation anomalies or variance on annual population growth rates. Furthermore, population responses to weather anomalies were not predicted by phylogenetic covariance, and instead there was more variability in weather responses for populations within a species. Crucially, however, long-lived mammals with smaller litter sizes had smaller absolute population responses to weather anomalies compared with their shorter living counterparts with larger litters. These results highlight the role of species-level life history in driving responses to the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>demography</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>living planet</kwd><kwd>population decline</kwd><kwd>bayesian statistics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Independent Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-6108-00467B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In mammals, how populations respond to extremes in the weather is related to their pace of life, with shorter living species having stronger responses than their longer living counterparts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face in the twenty-first century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diaz, 2019</xref>). Although habitat loss and direct exploitation are currently the most important drivers of extinction in the natural world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daskalova et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diaz, 2019</xref>), changes to the climate altering both the mean and variance of weather conditions and the frequency of extreme events, are predicted to cause widespread declines of global biodiversity in the coming decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almond et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newbold, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soroye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>). For mammals and birds, temperature increases are already associated with declining population trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spooner et al., 2018</xref>) and many endangered species have already been negatively impacted by climate change in at least part of their range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pacifici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps more worryingly, abrupt ecological disruption due to climate change has been predicted to have large negative future impacts on biodiversity, with tropical ecosystems being affected as early as 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newbold, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trisos et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, these future impacts will likely be exacerbated by interactions between the climate and other drivers of extinction such as habitat loss or disease prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brook et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). Research highlighting the species and ecosystems that are most sensitive to climate-change impacts will therefore provide crucial knowledge to prevent future losses to global biodiversity.</p><p>Not all species are equally sensitive to changes in the climate. Species vary in their climatic niches and in their behavioural, physiological, and demographic responses to environmental change and we therefore expect there to be both climate ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antão et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moritz and Agudo, 2013</xref>). At the macro scale, species-occupancy data highlight that geographic range shifts are the key response associated with climate change across taxa, resulting in changes to community composition, but not necessarily population decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antão et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dornelas et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, this pattern also occurs in broad species-assemblage and abundance-change data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dornelas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 2020</xref>). While there is a lack of consistent directional temperature-related biodiversity change effects today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antão et al., 2020</xref>), many species are predicted to become at risk of climate-induced population declines before 2,100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trisos et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, investigating the mechanisms of how climate change induces population change may improve our predictions of the species most-affected by warming temperatures.</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms underpinning population declines in response to climate change and the temporal scale at which these mechanisms occur, at short- or long-term timescales, remains one of the main challenges when investing the influence of climate change on population change. Population abundance time-series and demographic data have begun to reveal how climate change leads to population decline. For birds and mammals average abundance trends were negatively associated with long-term rates of climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spooner et al., 2018</xref>), but sparse data in short time-series are at risk of overfitting weather effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knape and de Valpine, 2011</xref>). Therefore, targeted demographic studies unpicking how changes in weather patterns cause population change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cordes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coulson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Layton-Matthews et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paniw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodroffe et al., 2017</xref>) and whether species traits can help predict these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pacifici et al., 2017</xref>) are vital to highlight vulnerable species. While emphasis is often on long-term temperature trends, the immediate impact of the weather on populations, particularly in the context of extreme or anomalous events (e.g. heat waves and droughts), is also important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maxwell et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, there may also be impacts of increased variance in weather conditions as opposed to changes in central tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Coeur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stenseth et al., 2003</xref>). Applying these concepts at a comparative scale and assessing finer-scale population changes with respect to changes in the weather (and particularly extreme weather events or weather variance), and their relationship to species traits, will aid in illuminating climate-change responses across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Compagnoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Life-history variation is a promising factor that could explain observed variation in responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pacifici et al., 2017</xref>). The timing of key demographic events of survival and recruitment across the life cycle, or life-history traits, are evolved responses to the environment, and characteristics relating to both ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ life histories are therefore adaptive in different environmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stearns, 1992</xref>). For example, life-history differences between three amphibian species in Western Europe drove predicted survival and reproduction responses to the North Atlantic Oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cayuela et al., 2017</xref>). Generally, organisms with slower life histories are better adapted to cope with environmental fluctuations. Longer-lived organisms have a reduced relative effect of variability in vital rates, variability which is expected during environmental change, on population growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2008</xref>) and long-lived plants have weaker absolute demographic responses to weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Compagnoni et al., 2021</xref>). However, while generally buffered, long-lived, slow-reproducing animals are often more at risk of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardillo et al., 2005</xref>), and slower to recover when perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gamelon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Turkalo et al., 2017</xref>). Comparative approaches linking life-history traits to climate-change responses may therefore provide a useful predictive link to improve our understanding of climate vulnerability.</p><p>In this study, we investigated annual population responses to temperature and precipitation anomalies (i.e. weather deviation from average conditions) in populations of terrestrial mammals across the world’s ecosystems. We tested whether life history predicts population responses to the weather, and therefore its utility in assessing vulnerability to climate change. We addressed these questions using 486 long-term (≥10 consecutive years) abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammal obtained from the Living Planet Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almond et al., 2020</xref>), by implementing a two-step meta-regression framework. First, for each abundance record, we assessed how observed annual population growth rates were influenced by standardised weather anomalies (annual deviation from long-term average weather patterns) and intra-annual weather variance using autoregressive additive models that accounted for temporal autocorrelation in abundance records and overall abundance trends.</p><p>Then, we used a phylogenetically controlled Bayesian meta-regression with weather-effect coefficients as the response variable to address three key questions: (1) Are there directional (i.e. different from 0) temperature and precipitation effects on abundance changes across the terrestrial mammals? (2) How are these patterns influenced by covariance both within and between species, and are there vulnerable biomes or spatial patterns in responses? (3) Can species-level life-history traits predict the absolute magnitude of population responses to the weather? We characterised population responses to weather anomalies/variance accounting for both within- and among- species variance, incorporating a categorical predictor of ecological biome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson et al., 2001</xref>), and three broad continuous life-history traits that are widely characteristic of the key axes of life-history variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stearns, 1992</xref>). Due to a lack of overall biodiversity change globally in response to climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antão et al., 2020</xref>), we predicted that there will be no clear directional patterns in population responses to weather anomalies or weather variance overall. Instead, because life-history traits are an evolved response to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stearns, 1992</xref>), we predicted that mammals with ‘slow’ life-history traits will be buffered against weather anomalies and have responses with a lower absolute magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2008</xref>). We focused on absolute responses to weather anomalies in the context of life history because we had no a priori expectation for directional patterns in response to weather, but instead expected greater variance in (or more extreme) responses from ‘fast’ species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Compagnoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Coeur et al., 2021</xref>). We expected that the link between population responses and life history would result in strong phylogenetic autocorrelation in weather responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melero et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, we predicted that population responses to weather anomalies would be more pronounced in biomes that experience more stable average climatic conditions.</p><p>The terrestrial mammals are an ideal study system to explore the predictors of population responses to climate change because they are a well-studied group with a combination of intensive abundance monitoring across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almond et al., 2020</xref>), detailed life-history information for hundreds of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myhrvold et al., 2015</xref>) and a highly-resolved phylogeny to facilitate phylogenetic comparative analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Upham et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, there is growing evidence from the mammals of the mechanistic links between the climate, demography, and population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coulson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paniw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodroffe et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We assessed population responses to weather anomalies in 486 long-term abundance time-series records from 157 species of terrestrial mammals globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Furthermore, 95% of records had temperature and precipitation coefficients from –4.29 to 3.17, and –1.41 to 1.88, respectively. Nevertheless, approximately 8% (n=42) of temperature coefficients and 1% of precipitation coefficients were greater than 3 or less than –3, indicating that small clusters of populations experienced more extreme annual responses to the weather. In addition to temperature and precipitation anomalies, we also found no clear directional effects of weather variance on population growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig23">Appendix 1—figure 23</xref>). There was also a positive effect of the number of years of population data for a record and the response to temperature anomalies, with a linear slope, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> of 0.12 [0.03,0.21].

However, there was a relationship between the variance in temperature effects and the length of the record; short records displayed larger variation in temperature effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig24">Appendix 1—figure 24</xref>). While this finding has important implications for the biases in the raw data, record length was accounted for in all models, and therefore we do not expect that it influences our findings. These results highlight the paradigm of the existence of both winners and losers in weather responses, but no clear directional effect across Mammalia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spatial and phylogenetic effects</title><p>We tested whether there were differences in mean weather responses across ecological biomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olson et al., 2001</xref>).

The posterior mean for species-level variance in temperature effects was 0.2 [0.01,0.4] which was 20 times greater than the posterior estimate of 0.01 [0.0,0.03] for phylogenetic covariance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

These patterns are reflected in the temperature and precipitation coefficients, for which large variation can be seen among records of the same species. For example, <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> (bank vole) in the Rodentia had nine population records, and a range of temperature/precipitation effects from –3.33 to 3.86 and –2.72 to 2.41 respectively, compared to coefficients from –11.60 to 9.22 and –3.47 to 3.22 across Rodentia as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

So, for every additional 5 years of life, there was a 16.8% decrease in absolute responses to temperature and 14.6% decrease in the absolute responses to precipitation.

While we found no directional patterns of responses to temperature and precipitation anomalies or intra-annual variance across the mammals, life-history traits relating to the pace of life were associated with absolute responses to weather. Namely, shorter living species with increased litters sizes, or species characterised with ‘fast’ life-history traits, responded with a greater absolute magnitude compared to those with ‘slow’ life-history traits. Practically, our results suggest that increased extreme/anomalous weather events will have a greater impact (both positive or negative) on the abundance of short-living mammals with higher reproductive output. Therefore, increased monitoring of vulnerable species with ‘fast’ life-history characteristics may benefit mammal conservation as global weather anomalies are increasingly common.</p><p>We find support for the hypothesis that longevity, and ‘slow’ life-history traits more generally, buffer organisms against short-term variability in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2008</xref>). Life history evolves in response to, and as an adaptation to, environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stearns, 1992</xref>), but rarely has the link between life history and responses to the environment been demonstrated at a global scale. We add to a small number of studies linking population demography and the climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Compagnoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>). We do not argue that long-lived species are less vulnerable to climate change. Over longer time-scales, species with slow life-history traits are also slower to recover from perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gamelon et al., 2014</xref>), which would include sustained environmental change. Furthermore, many long-lived mammal species are affected by other threats such as poaching and habitat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardillo et al., 2005</xref>). Critically, however, our results highlight the potential utility of life-history traits for predicting species vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>More generally, demography has a role to play in predicting population declines in the Anthropocene and in highlighting targets for conservation management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richards et al., 2021</xref>). Our study emphasises this role, demonstrating the predictive power of life-history traits when investigating responses to environmental change. However, there are limitations and barriers to the utility of demography in conservation. Only 1.3% of tetrapods globally have sufficient demographic information with which to estimate population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conde et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used summary traits that are available for many species (maximum longevity and mean litter size). Although these summary traits were well correlated with more robust demographic traits for a smaller subset of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig26">Appendix 1—figure 26</xref>), maximum recorded longevity, while sufficient as a broad indicator, is strongly influenced by sampling variance and a flawed measure of longevity differences between taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moorad et al., 2012</xref>). Ideally, lifetables with mortality and reproduction trajectories across the life cycle can be combined with data on external drivers to investigate detailed patterns in population dynamics, rather than relying on abundance trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Desforges et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). The recent development of the demographic resilience framework, which uses demographic data across the life cycle to simulate how a population may respond to perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capdevila et al., 2020</xref>), has excellent potential in extending these findings to explore demographic relationships with climate responses in detail. Unfortunately, however, detailed (st)age-specific demographic information is currently available only for a minority of species, but growing in availability rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salguero-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to continue to increase the collection of demographic data (and other traits) for many more species than are currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conde et al., 2019</xref>), so that we may predict population changes with respect to environmental change. Achieving this target may revolutionise the way we quantify species vulnerability to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antão et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dornelas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>), helping to prevent extinctions before they occur.</p><p>In line with recent global assessments of biodiversity in the face of climatic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>), we did not find an overall directional effect of weather anomalies on population growth rates. This may in part reflect the fact that abundance changes are a higher order process determined by complex interactions between demographic components that counteract each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>). However, our results contrast with findings of linear associations between mammal abundance and temperature change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spooner et al., 2018</xref>). These differences may reflect our approach to investigate annual changes, rather than long-term trends. Significant population trends from long time-series are detectable from smaller component time-series even when sampling is incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wauchope et al., 2019</xref>), and thus responses detected in trends may reflect broader changes in response to the climate that are not detected in models of annual change. Furthermore, we estimated linear, annual effects of weather on population growth rates, where population responses may actually be more complex non-linear patterns or lagged effects. However, the detection of climate effects on average trends may also be confounded by effects of other (sometimes more dominant) drivers (e.g. habitat loss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daskalova et al., 2020a</xref>). While out of the scope of the current study, population dynamics in endothermic mammals have been linked to other drivers such as diet specialisation, body size and human influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacifici et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, our findings can be explained in light of recent studies from the Living Planet Database that have found that the large majority of records do not exhibit population declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find evidence for phylogenetic covariance in weather responses between species. Closely related species can have disparate responses to weather anomalies. Recent evidence from birds indicated strong phylogenetic covariance in vital rates, particularly in adult survival, and the incorporation of phylogenetic information greatly improved predictive performance when imputing vital rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2021</xref>). In line with the overall patterns, our findings may reflect the trade-offs between vital rates, which cancel one another out when scaling up to population-level processes such as population growth rates in response to the weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paniw et al., 2021</xref>). However, this result is in contrast to findings from butterflies, which suggested that local responses to weather anomalies had a strong phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melero et al., 2022</xref>). One potential explanation for our finding is that for long-term time-series, there may also be temporal trade-offs in vital rates, where for example investing heavily into survival in one year (in response to weather) may impact subsequent reproduction for several years, decreasing the magnitude of population growth rates. The extent of phylogenetic covariance in vital rate responses and trade-offs remains unknown, but understanding how the climate impacts demographic rates across species may provide a useful tool for imputing population responses to the climate across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">James et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Instead, we highlight the importance of variation in population responses to weather anomalies within a species. Different populations of the same species can have different responses to weather anomalies. Sampling heterogeneity has recently been shown to have broad implications for metrics of population dynamics, where demographic rates are poorly correlated among sampling sites for the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engbo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Römer et al., 2021</xref>). Demographic differences within a species range may reflect broader environmental gradients or wider climatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Römer et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, inferences obtained from monitoring single populations or studies may not accurately portray species-level variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaillard et al., 2013</xref>). This has broad implications for macroecology, particularly in population viability assessments (PVA) and species-distribution modelling. As well as suffering from data quality issues in their parameterisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaudhary and Oli, 2020</xref>), our findings suggest that PVAs based on data from a single population may not accurately reflect population viability across a species’ geographic range. Therefore, incorporating detailed demographic data, and investigating differences in population responses across a range, could greatly improve our perspective on population viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Desforges et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, presence-only models of species distributions that do not account for responses to the environment within a species range do not accurately represent species distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benito Garzón et al., 2019</xref>). Moving towards trait-based monitoring and explicitly including demographic processes with mechanistic links to appropriate drivers into species distribution models could greatly improve predictions of climate change impacts on the biosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trisos et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>As with many macroecological studies exploring global patterns in biodiversity using data collated from many individual studies, it is important to acknowledge limitations in the current study. These limitations include spatial biases, effects of record length on population responses, and the scope of current analyses. First, while broad in coverage spatially, population records in the Living Planet Database are biased towards temperate biomes and Europe/North America, a feature common in macroecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2012</xref>). We aimed to overcome these biases by using data on a well-studied taxonomic group with a broad range of life-history traits, conservative Bayesian meta-regression incorporating uncertainty, and explicitly exploring spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Second, there was a consistent effect of record length on population responses to weather, for which longer records were associated with lower-absolute (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> closer to 0) population responses. We accounted for record length in all analyses and do not expect that it influenced our findings, but it is important to acknowledge that increased long-term monitoring is crucial to assess population dynamics. Finally, the scope of the current study was to explore how standardised annual weather anomalies affect the directionality of annual population responses and absolute magnitude of responses with respect to life history. Thus, we do not make conclusions about how life history influences the directionality of responses, nor how long-term climatic trends influence population change.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ultimately, improving our predictions of how humans are influencing the natural world is paramount to prevent rapid declines to global biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kissling et al., 2018</xref>).

We show that linking species traits such as life-history traits to changes in the environment may equip us with tools to predict and prevent future losses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To assess the effects of weather anomalies on population growth rates, we collated information on global weather and the abundance, life history and phylogeny of the terrestrial mammals.

The records measure annual abundance in a variety of ways (e.g. full population counts, density, indices). We tested whether the method of data collection influenced the effect of weather on population growth rates, and found that they did not influence overall effect distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig19">Appendix 1—figure 19</xref>). Records contain information on the location, realm, biome, and taxonomy of the species in the record. We included only data for the terrestrial mammals that had species-level life-history information and coordinate locations, which referred to either specific or more general locations for each population (accounted for using weather data from a buffered radius around each location). Our analyses were focussed on estimating weather effects on annual population growth rates using regression models with several covariates, and short timeseries are at large risk of overfitting when including covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knape and de Valpine, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we opted to include only long-term records with 10 or more consecutive years of abundance data, and only for years in which there was also weather data (1979–2013). We tested the implications of this choice of data quality by running additional analyses with both ≥5 and ≥20 years of data. Our key findings were robust to the choice of long-term records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig25">Appendix 1—figure 25</xref>), and we therefore continued with 10 years.

Using the Living Planet Database record coordinate locations as a centroid, we averaged the monthly weather data for a buffered radius of 5 km around each record location using the <italic>exactextractr</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baston, 2020</xref>). Averaged weather variables and weather effects for alternate buffer radii (50 m and 50 km) were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>), and thus we do not expect that our results were sensitive to the choice of this radius.</p><p>Generally, given that organisms have evolved in a given environmental context (with seasonal fluctuations), we expect that populations will respond more often to extremes in the weather, as opposed to raw weather changes. Furthermore, across the globes surface the variance in weather variables changes substantially, which may influence population responses. Thus, we explored population responses for the key weather variable of standardised annual anomalies, and then validated our approach using annual weather variance. These weather anomalies are the average distance of the observed temperature and precipitation from expected values in a given year. For the anomalies, we decomposed z-scored averaged monthly weather data for each location for the full timeseries (1979–2013 i.e. a longer timeseries than each record) using a Seasonal-Trend Decomposition by Loess (STL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleveland et al., 1990</xref>). We refer to z-scoring when variables were mean centered on 0 and standardised by their standard deviation. We used a seasonal window of 7 (seasonal smoothing parameter) and trend window of 1,000 (trend smoothing parameter) for the decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cleveland et al., 1990</xref>). We extracted the anomaly component, which describes the remainder when accounting for the trend and seasonal components of the timeseries. We then used annual mean temperature and precipitation anomalies as the key weather variables in subsequent analyses. Weather variance was calculated for each year as the Pearson’s variance of monthly mean temperature and monthly total precipitation values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Species-level life history</title><p>We tested how responses to weather anomalies was associated with a species’ position on the ‘fast’-‘slow’ continuum of life history using summary traits. We used three key traits that broadly characterise species-level life history that are available for a large number of species: maximum longevity, litter size and adult body mass. We collected these traits from the compendium developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conde et al., 2019</xref>, combining information from three primary database sources: The Amniote Life-History Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myhrvold et al., 2015</xref>), PanTHERIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2009</xref>) and AnAge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tacutu et al., 2013</xref>) databases. Adult body mass data was obtained exclusively from the Amniote Life-History Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myhrvold et al., 2015</xref>). Where multiple records were available for a single species, we took the largest maximum longevity value and the mean litter size/adult body mass. We removed erroneous raw litter size data for <italic>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</italic> (mean litter size = 37.8) and <italic>Marmota broweri</italic> (mean litter size = 1063), which both greatly exceeded the 95% quantile for mean litter size (7.13) and contradicted published species information. For analysis, we z-scored the natural-logarithm of raw life-history trait data, and verified that the life-history variables were represented across the range of weather anomaly variables in the raw data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the suitability of the selected traits for capturing species-level life history, we also explored demographic rates from structured population models and the covariance of life-history traits. We extracted 37 suitable structured matrix population models (namely, ergodic, reducible, primitive, non-NA population matrices) from the COMADRE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salguero-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>). From these matrix population models, we calculated adult survival (mean survival of adult life stages), life-expectancy and generation time. Generally, there was high covariance in all life-history traits, with longevity traits positively associated with adult body mass and negatively associated with litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig26">Appendix 1—figure 26</xref>). The additional life-history traits from structured population models were also significantly correlated with maximum longevity, litter size and adult body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig26">Appendix 1—figure 26</xref>). Furthermore, we repeated subsequent analyses for 16 species that had both detailed demographic rates and population abundance data, and found that the link between life history and population responses to weather anomalies was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig27">Appendix 1—figure 27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phylogeny data</title><p>The mammal phylogeny was obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Upham et al., 2019</xref>, which uses a ‘backbone-and-patch’ Bayesian approach for a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix and is part of the Vertlife project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vertlife.org/">https://vertlife.org/</ext-link>).

First, for each record we estimated the effect of annual weather anomalies (and weather variance) on population growth rates.

We used this standardised population growth rate to ensure that the effects of weather on population growth rates were on the same scale across the population records (e.g density measured between 1 and 5 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> vs. full population counts between 10,000 and 50,000 individuals).</p><p>Then, with r<sub>t</sub> as the response variable, we estimated the effect of temperature and precipitation anomalies on population growth using generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) fit using the <italic>gamm</italic> function of the <italic>mgcv</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wood, 2017</xref>). We opted to use a general linear-modelling framework as opposed to a state-space approach, which is often employed for time-series to account for measurement error and estimate trends (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalova et al., 2020b</xref>). The primary reason for this choice was that we aimed to assess broad comparative patterns in population change, and did not expect systematic errors in model parameters due to measurement error. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalova et al., 2020b</xref> found that abundance trend terms were highly correlated between linear and state-space approaches across the Living Planet Database, which would be expected if there are not systematic errors in measurement across the database. Our results were robust to this modelling choice, and we found that the observed population responses were highly correlated between GAMM and state-space approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>; see full alternative approaches section below).</p><p>In addition to estimating the influence of weather anomalies, we accounted for temporal autocorrelation in abundance and trends in population change. Changes in abundance are influenced by several drivers of population dynamics including habitat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daskalova et al., 2020a</xref>) and population processes such as density dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brook and Bradshaw, 2006</xref>), which may confound any influence of the weather on abundance. Therefore, because we aimed to assess the isolated impact of weather anomalies, accounting for these trends in abundance and temporal autocorrelation was crucial. We initially explored the extent of autocorrelation in abundance patterns using timeseries analysis and found evidence for lag 1 autocorrelation in abundance, but not for greater lags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">4</xref>). Furthermore, we tested the potential impact of density dependence on estimating environmental effects using an autoregressive timeseries simulation and found that environmental effects were robust to density dependence even for short timeseries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Thus, to estimate the effect of weather anomalies on population growth, for each record we modelled population growth rate in each year as<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the intercept and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is a linear parametric term with coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for the weather W (temperature or precipitation anomaly) in year <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In addition to models fit using a generalised linear modelling approach, we also tested the validity of the final GAMM approach by calculating weather effect coefficients using state-space autoregressive time-series models that incorporated both process and observation error, which are often used as predictive models of time-series abundance data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalova et al., 2020b</xref>). Here, the state process of the population growth rate r in year t was a function of a linear effect of the weather variable on the abundance and random noise. An advantage of state-space approaches in this context is that explicitly modelling process noise captures inherent variation in population growth rate that may confound linear relationships with weather anomalies.

Across time-series records, there was a high fit-to sample, and the fit-to-sample was not influenced by the length of the time-series record (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). We compared weather coefficients from state-space models with those obtained from GAMMs using Pearson’s regression, and found highly significant correlations for both temperature and precipitation effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>).

Specifically, we used regularising priors obtained from prior predictive simulations of the slope, intercept and exponential variance terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McElreath, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McElreath, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figures 12</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">15</xref>). Here, we compared the estimates and predictions of priors to the limits of observed data and expected patterns to inform the priors. In addition to prior choices made in this section, we further tuned the priors during the model selection to improve the efficiency/accuracy of Markov chains. For example, for Normal priors we tuned parameters with further reductions in standard deviation to improve the efficiency of the Markov chains. Choosing conservative regularising priors was also appropriate given the large number of parameters in phylogenetically or spatially controlled models. We performed prior predictive simulation for the global intercept term of directional weather effects (question 1), the β terms relating to differences in weather effects (i.e. biome effects; question 2), β terms for linear life-history effects (question 3), and mixed-effects variance terms for species variance and phylogenetic covariance (question 2). For the full set of priors used in analyses please refer to the meta_regression/ directory of the supplementary code doi:10.5281/zenodo.6620489.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Life-history effects on weather responses</title><p>For question 3, we tested how species-level life history influences absolute responses to weather anomalies. Although on average we expect that species life history influences population responses to the environment, we have little evidence to suggest that life history per se influences the directionality of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morris et al., 2008</xref>).

Moreover, as you rightly point out, the available data are heavily biased towards some groups and biomes. Many analyses have been published using similar databases (e.g., Ono et al., 2019), so clearly some see value in such analyses. My concern is that because one has to &quot;sell&quot; the paper one avoids pointing out the limitations -- but alas this is not specific to your study.</p><p>One concern I have is how such analyses can be informed by the more detailed and accurate studies based on long-term monitoring of single populations (e.g., Gaillard et al., 2013). One knows that weather effects will vary among populations -- e.g., depending on where the population is in the climatic niche (see above) -- and such variation is crucial in predicting effects of weather and climate change. Large &quot;meta-regressions&quot; such as yours might be useful in summarizing the data available in one database, and you have done an excellent job analyzing these data, but given the far from random sample you have available, it is hard to assess how to make sense of the patterns observed. Perhaps using subsamples of high quality studies in different groups and biomes (if that is at all possible) to assess the predictive performance of your models may help.</p><p>You rightly discuss the limits of using maximum longevity as an index of a better measure such as adult survival rate. Would it be possible for the sample of species you have to at least assess the relationship between maximum longevity and adult survival rate? And for those species to repeat the analyses? The precision would be much lower as the sample size is likely to be small but you can at least assess the consistency of the relationships.</p><p>Regarding the effects of biomes, I did not understand how it was parameterized (e.g., l 465). It was included as a categorical predictor, right (figure S16 seems to indicate that)? So you have β_Biome[j] for j=1:number of biomes?</p><p>Adler, P. B., et al., 2011.

The topic is highly interesting, and generally the manuscript is written in clear and concise way with some exceptions (see comments below). My main concern is about the timescales over which the weather events are calculated. As I understand it, these are anomalies away from the yearly expected value. This approach was of course used because the LPD data is recorded on an annual basis. However, there is a huge difference in the effect of slightly elevated temperatures across a whole year vs. one month with very high temperatures. The authors appear to have addressed this by looking at the yearly anomaly and the variance in the weather (annual weather variance) calculated across each year; however they are currently lacking some detail on exactly what this entailed (it is currently only mentioned in passing).</p><p>The authors have done a good job pulling all these analyses together into an accessible piece, and have provided all of the code to repeat these analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1/ Overall framing and questions/hypotheses:</p><p>– Please justify more clearly, somewhere in the introduction, why looking at the weather is interesting for understanding future effects of climate change (see lines 87/88 and 111/112).</p><p>– In the introduction, the evidence from past work could be summarised more efficiently and concisely around key points (e.g., see lines 74-82, lines 96-104); thus the overall narrative/structure of the introduction can be improved.</p><p>– Beyond the three questions you ask, please explain what the underlying hypotheses are (e.g., for each question, adding a few words to explain what you expect: what are the spatial patterns you predict, what do you hypothesize would be the effect of life history, etc.)? In addition, the phrasing of the first question is a bit ambiguous with the term &quot;consistent&quot; (in my understanding, here you ask, across species and populations, whether the weather effects are significant, as in whether they differ from zero). Adding a specific hypothesis would also help to make this question clearer.</p><p>– Finally, please justify more why you look at the magnitude (absolute values) of the weather effects when investigating the influence of life-history on the responses, and why you don't investigate the directionality of the effects.</p><p>2/ Results</p><p>The results could be presented more efficiently and clearly overall. I would suggest including a few higher-level summaries throughout the manuscript to conclude on specific points.</p><p>3/ Discussion:</p><p>– Some of the limitations of the study should be developed in the discussion, in particular:</p><p>– The potential biases of the study (e.g., length of the time series): you mention that record length was significantly associated with temperature and precipitation effects. I would be good to mention whether your results are likely robust to these biases or otherwise what the expected effects on the results would be.</p><p>– The fact that you use absolute values (magnitude of the weather effects) for the life-history models, so that you can't conclude about the directionality of the effects. I suggest highlighting how your work helps predict future responses and inform conservation despite the fact that you didn't investigate the directionality of the effects (see lines 239/240; 243/244) (e.g., do your results imply that populations of species with fast life history should be more closely monitored irrespectively of whether they grow or decline?).</p><p>– It would be good for the discussion to make the key points stand out more.</p><p>4/ Methods</p><p>Life-history traits: It is important to include a statement about the degree of multicollinearity among the traits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74161.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please try to improve the narrative by making it less exploratory (Reviewer #4).

In particular, temporal replication is a component that we believe will give more indications of the robustness of our analyses. We have therefore run extensive additional analyses to explore the implications of data quality on our findings. Specifically, we repeated the full meta-regression framework, but included ≥5 years or ≥20 years of abundance data. The latter in particular enabled us to critically evaluate the assumptions of our key findings with respect to data quality. In both cases, in conjunction with our main findings we did not find evidence for directional patterns of weather responses.

Importantly however, we suggest that ≥5 years of data are not sufficient to characterise annual responses to weather.In answer to the original point of the reviewer, rerunning analyses on a subset of increased quality (longer records) yielded consistent results in terms of life-history. Namely, traits relating to the fast-slow continuum were still associated with absolute responses to weather anomalies. We therefore conclude that our broad findings are robust. We have now included a brief description of this additional analysis L401-403 and the inclusion of a supplementary Figure S25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You rightly discuss the limits of using maximum longevity as an index of a better measure such as adult survival rate. Would it be possible for the sample of species you have to at least assess the relationship between maximum longevity and adult survival rate? And for those species to repeat the analyses? The precision would be much lower as the sample size is likely to be small but you can at least assess the consistency of the relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer rightly points out the issues with maximum longevity, which of course as a measure of the lifespan of the oldest recorded individual of a species, introduces a lot of noise when assessing species-level life history. We completely agree that in an ideal world we would have a fully formed life-table/structured population model with which we could assess other key life-history traits such as adult survival, life expectancy or generation time (Gaillard et al., 2005). The question is then whether the noise introduced by this biased measure is too much, given the research questions. Our goals were comparative here, which the reviewer concedes they have scepticism in, but that we feel are important to explore broad global patterns with available data. The goal of this study was to explore weather responses for as many mammal species as possible, for which we felt we needed life-history variables that gave us a comparable breadth of data. We reasoned that the broad metrics of maximum longevity and mean litter size were largely characteristic of key life-history axes for this number of species. However, as is rightly pointed out we did not initially explore this assumption explicitly.</p><p>Therefore, we have now performed several additional analyses to address these concerns, which can now be found in methods section L454-465 and with additional supplementary figures Figure S26 and Figure S27. We did not find that the choice of broad life-history metrics impacted our key results.</p><p>To answer in more detail here however, as is pointed out by the reviewer, this level of demographic detail is hard to come by, save for high-quality, individual-based, longitudinal studies, which the reviewer is extremely familiar with. We opted to use the COMADRE animal matrix population model database to extract more detailed demographic information for as many terrestrial mammal species as possible. After data checks (including only ergodic, reducible, primitive, non-NA matrices etc.) we were left with 37 species that had both detailed structured population models and the broad metrics of life-history we include. From these models, we calculated generation time (the mean number of years needed for a cohort to replace itself, a key fast-slow trait used in many studies, see Healy <italic>et al.,</italic> (2019) for a recent example), life expectancy, and adult survival (here defined as the mean survival of adult stages in the matrix). First, we explored the collinearity between these life-history variables in the larger subset of 37 species, which is presented in Figure S26. This pairs plot gives the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for each pairwise set of log-transformed life history variables that we assessed here.</p><p>You will see that, in spite of the biases highlighted, the life-history variables included here are all highly correlated with one another, even for this small subset of 37 species. Specifically for Maximum Longevity, it has Pearson’s coefficients of &gt;0.64 when correlated with more detailed life-history variables. This suggests that our choice of broad characteristics is appropriate for this comparative question.</p><p>As suggested, we then extended to include these life-history variables in our meta-regression framework. However, the number of species that had both sufficient life-history information and LPD population data and weather responses was 16 (10 times lower than the number of species included in the main findings of the manuscript). We hope you agree that this amount of data is not ideal to explore these patterns at a global scale. Therefore, we analysed this data in a much simpler hierarchical model framework rather than the full phylogenetically controlled analyses. Here, we simply regressed life history variables against absolute weather responses, including only a random effect of species and controlling for sample size. You can see the results of the posterior predictions in Figure S26. Posterior predictions are given with the 90% credible intervals for each life-history/weather effect combination.</p><p>While the sample size here prohibits a more detailed exploration of these patterns, the same negative relationships can be observed. The coefficients of these responses were all below -0.12. These reiterate our findings of increased absolute responses to weather in short-lived species.</p><p>Gaillard, J.M., Yoccoz, N.G., Lebreton, J.D., Bonenfant, C., Devillard, S., Loison, A. et al.,</p><p>(2005).

The topic is highly interesting, and generally the manuscript is written in clear and concise way with some exceptions (see comments below). My main concern is about the timescales over which the weather events are calculated. As I understand it, these are anomalies away from the yearly expected value. This approach was of course used because the LPD data is recorded on an annual basis. However, there is a huge difference in the effect of slightly elevated temperatures across a whole year vs. one month with very high temperatures. The authors appear to have addressed this by looking at the yearly anomaly and the variance in the weather (annual weather variance) calculated across each year; however they are currently lacking some detail on exactly what this entailed (it is currently only mentioned in passing).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of detail when describing the effect of weather variance. The reviewer is absolutely correct, we explored the effect of weather variance on population growth in addition to weather anomalies. Generally, we aimed to explore the consequences of ‘extreme’ weather in the current study, hence the exploration of anomalies and variance in contrast to climate trends for example. As pointed out by reviewer #1, this focus on weather was not entirely clear in the introduction, and we have therefore more explicitly made the link to weather anomalies and weather variance in the new version L90-94. In Figure S23 we presented the posterior estimates for the effect of temperature (a) and precipitation (b) variance on population growth rates.</p><p>These results are near identical to the results for weather anomalies, with the same conclusion of no directional pattern of temperature or precipitation variance on population growth rates. The model for temperature does highlight an interesting pattern of increase phylogenetic covariance however.</p><p>In the updated manuscript, we have made this result clearer L173-174.

We aimed to make these specific points much more concise and clearer in narrative, which you will now find L68-151. We hope you agree that these improve the manuscript.

Generally, we expected no directional effect (following the winner/loser paradigm introduced in the second paragraph), but greater absolute responses in ‘fast’ species (paragraph 4 – following Morris et al., 2008 and Compagnoni et al., 2021). Given the demographic components underpinning population change, which are evolutionarily constrained (James et al., 2020), we initially expected phylogenetic autocorrelation. Finally, although spatial effects are less clear, we predicted that biomes with lower climate variability, where organisms are evolved in narrow climatic niches, would have larger impacts of weather anomalies. Please see introduction for full response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the phrasing of the first question is a bit ambiguous with the term &quot;consistent&quot; (in my understanding, here you ask, across species and populations, whether the weather effects are significant, as in whether they differ from zero). Adding a specific hypothesis would also help to make this question clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>On reflection for this point, we agree that the term ‘consistent’ was not necessarily indicative of what we were attempting to communicate. And the reviewer rightly points out that we were aiming to ascertain whether responses were different from 0. However, we do not agree that the term significant is appropriate in the context of the current study given its heavy Bayesian focus, which may result in confusion with inference.
