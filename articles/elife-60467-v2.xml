Cholesterol is the most abundant component of myelin and essential for myelin membrane assembly in the central nervous system. However, the underlying mechanisms of precise control of cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. In the present study, we found that Qki depletion in neural stem cells or oligodendrocyte precursor cells in neonatal mice resulted in impaired cholesterol biosynthesis and defective myelinogenesis without compromising their differentiation into Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes. Mechanistically, Qki-5 functions as a co-activator of Srebp2 to control transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes. Consequently, Qki depletion led to substantially reduced concentration of cholesterol in mouse brain, impairing proper myelin assembly. Our study demonstrated that Qki-Srebp2-controlled cholesterol biosynthesis is indispensable for myelinogenesis and highlights a novel function of Qki as a transcriptional co-activator beyond its canonical function as an RNA-binding protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholesterol biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>myelination</kwd><kwd>Qki</kwd><kwd>Srebp2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>NCI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37CA214800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007313</institution-id><institution>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>startup</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP170002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Qki-Srebp2–mediated cholesterol biosynthesis is indispensable for myelinogenesis during early brain development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ, accounting for 23% of the total cholesterol in the body even though the brain represents only 2% of the total body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietschy and Turley, 2004</xref>). About 70–80% of the brain cholesterol resides in myelin, a compact multilayer membrane structure that is generated by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin is critical for rapid saltatory nerve conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armati and Mathey, 2010</xref>). Myelin is a lipid-rich material, and cholesterol accounts for the highest molar percentage (~52%) among all myelin lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrast et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis in the mouse brain is highest during the first three weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietschy and Turley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quan et al., 2003</xref>), the same period in which the rate of myelinogenesis is highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armati and Mathey, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The brain depends extensively on de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, which is mainly carried out by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as the blood-brain barrier blocks the uptake of cholesterol from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camargo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saher et al., 2005</xref>). Genetic ablation of squalene synthase (<italic>Fdft1</italic>), an enzyme involved in the early step of cholesterol biosynthesis, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells has resulted in failure of proper myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saher et al., 2005</xref>). The importance of cholesterol biosynthesis in myelination is also implicated in various neurological disorders accompanied by myelin defects. For example, hereditary diseases such as Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS), desmosterolosis, and lathosterolosis are caused by mutations of the cholesterol biosynthesis genes encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), and sterol-C5-desaturase (SC5D), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanungo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nwokoro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>). In particular, SLOS patients present with cognitive defects and delayed motor and language development along with hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>). Patients with desmosterolosis have defects in the corpus callosum, thinning of white matter, and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zerenturk et al., 2013</xref>). One of the major neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia, usually develops in late adolescence or early adulthood when maturation of the brain, including steps such as myelin biogenesis, occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Hellard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steen et al., 2017</xref>). White matter abnormalities often occur in schizophrenic patients in association with reduced lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steen et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, among the 108 schizophrenia-associated genomic loci, one is on chromosome 22q13.2, which includes <italic>SREBF2</italic> gene that encodes sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), the major transcription factor that regulates cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Hellard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steen et al., 2017</xref>). Antipsychotic drugs are known to increase SREBP2 activity, resulting in upregulated expression of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernø et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Hellard et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a potential role of SREBP2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Besides the neurological diseases accompanied by myelination defects, reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders, for which myelin involvement has been documented but less understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leoni and Caccia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohamed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Segatto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsunemi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiang et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, cholesterol biosynthesis plays a pivotal role in brain function, particularly myelination, and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism causes various neurological diseases. Yet the underlying mechanisms of precise control of cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes during developmental myelination remain elusive.</p><p>Mammalian <italic>Quaking</italic> (<italic>Qk</italic>) undergoes alternative splicing to express the RNA-binding proteins Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darbelli and Richard, 2016</xref>). Various studies have extensively demonstrated that Qki regulates the RNA processing of the genes encoding myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), p27kip1, and neurofascin 155 in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darbelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larocque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larocque et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). The quaking viable (<italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic>) mouse is a spontaneous recessive mutant with an approximate 1-Mbp deletion in the upstream of <italic>Qk</italic> locus, leading to diminished expression of Qki in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebersole et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardy et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Qk<sup>v</sup></italic> homozygotes suffer from tremor and early death due to severe hypomyelination in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sidman et al., 1964</xref>). Previous studies showed that <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice exhibited reduced myelin lipid content, including cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 1971</xref>), and this phenomenon was thought to be secondary to impaired differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darbelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larocque et al., 2005</xref>). However, similar numbers of oligodendrocytes in some regions of the CNS in <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice and control mice and even hyperplasia in these regions in the former mice were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doukhanine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Myers et al., 2016</xref>). These contradictory data suggested that Qki might regulate myelination in the CNS through mechanisms besides controlling oligodendrocyte differentiation and that reduced myelin lipid in <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice could be a direct consequence of <italic>Qk</italic> loss rather than secondary to impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, our recent study demonstrated that Qki is not required for mature oligodendrocyte survival in adult mice, and that Qki-5 forms a complex with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPARβ)-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) to transcriptionally control fatty acid metabolism, which is essential for mature myelin maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Qki might transcriptionally regulate lipid metabolism, such as cholesterol biosynthesis, during developmental myelination in young mice.</p><p>In the present study, using conditional <italic>Qk</italic>-knockout mice specifically lacking expression of Qki in either neural stem cells (NSCs) or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during the crucial myelin-forming period of postnatal brain development, we identified a critical, previously uncharacterized phenomenon that Qki-depleted NSCs and OPCs can still differentiate into Aspa<sup>+</sup>/Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes. However, these cells do not form myelin properly due to impaired cholesterol biosynthesis. We also found that Qki-5 interacted with Srebp2 and activated its transcriptional activity for the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Deletion of <italic>Qk</italic> almost completely abolished expression of various cholesterol biosynthesis genes in oligodendrocytes and reduced the cholesterol content in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-depleted mice. Our study highlights a novel function of Qki as a co-activator of Srebp2 in developing brain beyond its canonical function as an RNA-binding protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Qki depletion in mouse NSCs leads to hypomyelination in the CNS</title><p>We asked whether the hypomyelination induced by knockout of <italic>Qk</italic> is due to impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation or defective myelinogenesis.

To further determine the effect of Qki on myelin formation, we crossed mice bearing the <italic>mTmG</italic> reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) with <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice or control mice. The mTmG reporter, in which expression of cell membrane-localized tdTomato (mT) is replaced by cell membrane-localized EGFP (mG) in Cre recombinase-expressing cells, enabled us to trace newly formed myelin (after tamoxifen injection) according to the membrane-bound GFP signals. The percentage of the GFP<sup>+</sup> area in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO;<italic>mTmG</italic> mice markedly decreased relative to that in control <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup>T2</sup>;<italic>mTmG</italic> mice (10.6% vs. 68.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, hypomyelination accompanied by microglial infiltration was observed in the optic nerves in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In line with these findings, ultrastructural analyses of myelin sheaths in the optic nerves using transmission electron microscopy revealed that only 23.3% of the axons were myelinated in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice, whereas compact myelin formed in 79.0% of the axons in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The myelin sheaths wrapping the sparse axons in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice were considerably thinner than those in control mice and failed to form the compact myelin structure (g-ratio, 0.94 vs. 0.78; p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We further performed a time-course analysis of MBP expression in the corpus callosum to compare the efficiency of myelin formation between <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice and control mice during the critical time of myelin growth (P12–P21). Qki depletion slowed down the myelin formation during P12–P21, a time frame in which myelin is initiated and actively generated, ultimately resulting in failure of proper myelin formation at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, we observed that Qki depletion leads to defect in formation of node of Ranvier at P21 in the optic nerve, where rapid and robust myelination occurs during development, using antibodies against paranodal protein (Caspr) and nodal proteins (AnkG and PanNav) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As node formation was severely affected at P21, we further examined when the defect is initiated during early myelin development. Previous studies showed that clustering of ion channels at the nodes requires proper myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rasband and Peles, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rasband et al., 1999</xref>). As myelination is rapidly formed at its peak from P14 in the optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayoral et al., 2018</xref>), we monitored earlier times (P14 and P17) to ask if myelin defect induced by Qki depletion affects de novo formation of nodes. Defect in node formation was observed as early as P14, which cannot be overcome at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>), and this observation is in line with the defect in myelination observed from P12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Specifically, total number of nodes (including both intact and the incomplete nodes) in the optic nerve was decreased upon Qki depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Importantly, the percentage of intact nodes among the total nodes was significantly reduced with Qki depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Our observation suggests that the failure of myelin formation upon Qki depletion leads to the failure of node formation during the critical period of myelin development. Despite severely compromised axonal ensheathment and defective structure of node of Ranvier, the axonal diameter and density of axon in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice were comparable with those in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>), and no evidence of axonal damage was detected in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice via immunofluorescent staining of amyloid precursor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In addition, we further asked if Qki loss impacts on the axon initial segment (AIS) structure. We found that the length of AIS labeled by AnkG at the proximal axon adjacent to the soma (NeuN) was not altered in the cortex region of <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–M</xref>), further suggesting that the integrity of the axon was not affected upon Qki depletion. Taken together, these data demonstrated that depletion of Qki in mouse NSCs results in severe neurological deficits due to hypomyelination in the CNS accompanied by the defect in node formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Qki loss in NSCs does not impair formation of OPCs or Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes</title><p>Next, we sought to determine whether the hypomyelination observed in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was caused by a defect in the generation of OPCs from NSCs, impaired maturation from OPCs to oligodendrocytes, or a failure of myelinogenesis. Excluding the first possibility, we found that the number of Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> OPCs in the developing cortex tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was slightly higher than that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), probably due to a compensatory increase in the proliferation of OPCs in response to hypomyelination. Notably, 92.6% of Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> OPCs in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice lacked expression of Qki, indicating that Qki does not affect the generation or survival of OPCs. Excluding the second possibility above, immunofluorescent staining of Aspa and Gstpi, two well-established markers of mature oligodendrocytes, revealed that the numbers of Aspa<sup>+</sup> and Gstpi<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice were comparable to those in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Also, co-immunofluorescent staining of Aspa and Gstpi demonstrated that they represent the same mature oligodendrocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The majority of these Aspa<sup>+</sup> and Gstpi<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice lacked expression of Qki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>), indicating that OPCs without expression of Qki are still capable of differentiating into Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes. Of note, we did not use another commonly used marker, CC-1, in our study because a recent study demonstrated that the CC-1 antibody actually recognizes Qki-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bin et al., 2016</xref>), raising the concern that CC-1 is not a good marker for labeling mature oligodendrocyte in <italic>Qk</italic>-knockout mice. In fact, the number of CC-1<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice significantly decreased to 6.7% of that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas the number of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was similar to that in control mice. The reason for this phenomenon is that the Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice cannot be recognized by CC-1 antibodies due to the absence of Qki-7 in these cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Qki loss in neural stem cells does not impair formation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells or Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup>myelinating oligodendrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Representative images of and quantification of immunofluorescent staining of Pdgfrα-Qki (<bold>A</bold>), Aspa-Qki (<bold>B</bold>), and Gstpi-Qki (<bold>C</bold>) in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and control mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4) 2 weeks after tamoxifen injection.

In agreement with this, immunofluorescent staining of Aapa in the corpus callosum tissue in mice at P21 revealed expression of Aspa in myelin sheaths in addition to the cell bodies of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Coupled with the observation that Aspa and Gstpi positivities represented the same mature oligodendrocyte population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), these data demonstrated that Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes represent a subset of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Of note, the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> (marker of oligodendroglial lineage) cells in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was 50.9% lower than that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that Qki loss partially blocks OPCs differentiation into Olig2<sup>+</sup>Aspa<sup>-</sup>Gstpi<sup>-</sup> oligodendroglial lineage cells.

Collectively, these data suggested that Qki loss in NSCs has minimal or no effect on the neuron and astrocyte populations in the brain, and hypomyelination induced by Qki loss is not secondary to defects in neurons or astrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Qki loss leads to defective myelin membrane assembly</title><p>The unexpected finding that <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice did not have reduced numbers of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes yet exhibited severe myelin defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggested that Qki loss impairs myelinating ability of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes without affecting the differentiation and survival of these cells. Consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Qki regulates the RNA homeostasis of myelin proteins, including MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darbelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larocque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larocque et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>), we found that expression of MBP in the corpus callosum tissues was greatly reduced upon Qki depletion. In addition, unlike the homogeneous MBP staining in control mice, an uneven and patchy MBP staining pattern was detected in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), implicating that MBP was not properly assembled in myelin sheaths other than a reduction in its expression. We also found that whereas MBP and PLP co-localized very well in the corpus callosum tissues in control mice, the MBP and PLP co-localization rate markedly decreased in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (45.7% vs. 88.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, the MBP and MAG co-localization rate in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was substantially lower than that in control mice (26.9% vs. 75.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that the proper interaction of myelin proteins such as PLP, MBP, and MAG with myelin lipids is required for formation of raft-like domains on myelin membrane, which is essential for myelin membrane assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozgen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simons et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether defective myelin assembly in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was the result of abnormal myelin lipid component(s), we measured the myelin lipid level in the corpus callosum tissues via staining with FluoroMyelin, a lipophilic dye with high selectivity for myelin lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monsma and Brown, 2012</xref>). The percentage of the FluoroMyelin<sup>+</sup> area was 88.7% in control mice but only 6.6% in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). More importantly, although the levels of both PLP and FluoroMyelin in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice were lower than those in control mice, the ratio of FluoroMyelin to PLP in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was only about one fourth of that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that the levels of myelin lipids were more profoundly reduced than were the levels of myelin proteins upon Qki depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Of note, the expression of Gstpi was strongly upregulated in the corpus callosum tissues of <italic>Qk</italic>-NSC-iCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since Gstpi has been implicated in stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolini and Galli, 2016</xref>), we reasoned that Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice might cope with imbalanced ratio of myelin lipids to myelin proteins by elevating Gstpi. Taken together, these data suggested that the myelin lipid components are disrupted by Qki loss in oligodendrocytes, which may consequently lead to defective assembly of myelin proteins with myelin lipids and inability to form compact myelin.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Qki loss leads to defective myelin membrane assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of immunofluorescent staining of MBP in the corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice and control mice 2 weeks after tamoxifen injection.

Overall, expression of 673 and 692 genes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice was significantly lower and higher than those in control mice, respectively (fold change &gt;1.2; p&lt;0.05). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed that the canonical pathways affected most by Qki depletion were cholesterol biosynthesis, mevalonate pathway, zymosterol biosynthesis, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>), which are all associated with de novo cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Similarly, transcriptomic analyses of the brains of <italic>Rosa26-CreER</italic><sup>T2</sup>;<italic>Qk</italic><sup>L/L</sup> mice and control mice that were treated with tamoxifen at P1 and collected at P7 revealed that lipid metabolism pathways, particularly concentration of sterol and concentration of cholesterol, were among the biological processes most affected by Qki depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, IPA-based upstream regulator analysis revealed that Qki loss led to inactivation of Srebp2 and Srebp cleavage-activating protein (Scap) as well as activation of insulin-induced gene 1 protein (Insig1), which inhibits Srebp2 function by interacting with Scap to retard the Scap/Srebp complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These transcription factors potentially play important roles in regulating their target genes by cooperating with Qki-5.

Cholesterol is an important functional component of myelin formation, and deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis is associated with various hypomyelinating diseases reported in human genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nwokoro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>). Brain cholesterol production mainly depends on de novo synthesis to fulfill the high demand for cholesterol due to the restriction of cholesterol entry into the brain by the blood-brain barrier. However, how cholesterol biosynthesis is regulated in oligodendrocytes, the primary myelinating cells in the CNS, is not clear. The present study revealed that Qki functions as a novel transcriptional co-activator of Srebp2 in oligodendrocytes to ensure supply of cholesterol for proper developmental myelination in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of Qki’s roles in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism during central nervous system myelination and myelin maintenance.</title><p>Qki regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in a Srebp2-dependent manner during de novo myelinogenesis but not during myelin maintenance.

However, the cell types primarily responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis in myelin formation were not clear. In the present study, we observed that Aspa and Gstpi were co-expressed with Srebp2, Fdps, and Hmgcs1 in oligodendrocytes, suggesting that Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> cells represent a subset of myelinating oligodendrocytes with highly active cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). Aspa has been shown to be more abundantly expressed in myelinating oligodendrocytes than in premyelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, Canavan disease caused by <italic>Aspa</italic> deficiency is accompanied by myelin deficiency with reduced level of myelin lipids, including cholesterol, as Aspa enzymatically produces acetate as a source of acetyl-CoA, a precursor for synthesis of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madhavarao et al., 2005</xref>). These lines of evidence, in combination with our observations, suggest that Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> cells represent a subset of myelinating oligodendrocytes. In addition to oligodendrocytes, previous studies reported that cholesterol generated by astrocytes also contributes to myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camargo et al., 2017</xref>). However, the uptake of cholesterol from astrocytes was not sufficient to compensate for the reduced cholesterol synthesis in oligodendrocytes with deletion of <italic>Scap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camargo et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Fdft1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saher et al., 2005</xref>), or <italic>Qk</italic> (current study), indicating that oligodendrocytes are the major cell types producing cholesterol for myelination during early development.</p><p>Previous studies showed that <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice had reduced myelin lipid content, including cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 1971</xref>). This phenomenon was previously thought to be secondary to loss of mature oligodendrocytes in <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice during development. However, in the present study, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized function of Qki in controlling transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis without affecting the differentiation of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes. Further studies are needed to elucidate how Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes specifically regulate cholesterol biosynthesis and how other cell types, including astrocytes, contribute to oligodendroglial myelination.</p><p>During the characterization of oligodendroglial lineage cell populations, we observed that the differentiation of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes was not impaired upon Qki depletion, but their cholesterol biosynthesis was severely defective. Previous studies showed that all three isoforms of Qki are essential for the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darbelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larocque et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> oligodendroglial lineage cells in <italic>QKI<sup>FL/FL</sup>;<sup>Olig2–Cre</sup></italic> mice was about 50% lower than that in control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darbelli et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we also checked whether oligodendroglial lineage cell populations other than Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes were affected by Qki loss in our <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice. We found that the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced by 50.9% in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice compared to that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that Qki loss affects OPCs differentiation into Olig2<sup>+</sup>Aspa<sup>-</sup>Gstpi<sup>-</sup> oligodendroglial lineage cells, whose function is unclear. Collectively, we found that Qki plays variable roles in the differentiation of different subpopulations of oligodendrocyte lineage cells, leading to an intriguing question what determines the specific roles of Qki during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis, which needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Mammalian <italic>Quaking</italic> (<italic>Qk</italic>) undergoes alternative splicing to express the RNA-binding proteins Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darbelli and Richard, 2016</xref>). In the current study, we showed that Qki-5 is required for transcriptional activation of Srebp2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes. Notably, we observed that expression of myelin proteins such as MBP, PLP, and MAG was greatly reduced upon Qki depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although we did not find these proteins to be direct transcriptional targets of Qki-5 and Srebp2, the stability and nuclear export of MBP mRNA may be regulated by Qki-6 and Qki-7 as shown in <italic>qk<sup>v</sup></italic> mice, where expression of Qki-6 and Qki-7 is predominantly depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larocque et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Another nonmutually exclusive explanation of decreased expression of MBP is that the reduction in cholesterol level induced by Qki depletion potentially leads to destabilization of myelin because protein:lipid ratio is crucial for proper integration of proteins and lipids in myelin membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozgen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simons et al., 2000</xref>), which is shown by the defect in co-localization of different myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Although we showed that Qki-5 transcriptionally regulates cholesterol biosynthesis, it is still unclear if Qki-6 and Qki-7 also play a role in the enhancement of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway by regulating mRNA of cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes as we observed more significant decrease of these genes at the protein level compared to the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine the specific roles of different Qki isoforms during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis in early brain developmental stages.</p><p>Previous studies showed that cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells could be regulated by transcriptional regulators such as Tcf7l2, Chd8, and Maf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). However, how Srebp2, the master transcription factor in cholesterol biosynthesis, is regulated in oligodendrocytes is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that Qki-5 functions as a co-activator of Srebp2 to enhance transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in myelinating oligodendrocytes and that depletion of Qki leads to reduced promoter occupancy of Srebp2 and Pol II and decreased transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine how Qki enhances transcriptional activity of Srebp2.</p><p>In this study, we found that Qki-5 functions as a co-activator of Srebp2 to regulate transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, which is essential for proper myelinogenesis during development. Although cholesterol biosynthesis was the major downstream of Qki-5, we noticed that the molecular functions related to fatty acid metabolism, concentration of fatty acid, and synthesis of fatty acid were also markedly inhibited after Qki depletion in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We assume that both disturbed cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism upon Qki depletion contributed to the hypomyelination and neurological deficits of <italic>Qk</italic>-iCKO mice during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, our recent study demonstrated that Qki-5 forms a complex with PPARβ-RXRα and coactivates transcription of the genes for fatty acid metabolism, which is essential for the maintenance of mature myelin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, continuous biosynthesis of cholesterol may not be necessary to maintain the homeostasis of mature myelin, probably due to the very slow turnover of myelin cholesterol in adult rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It remains unclear what is the determinant factor of Qki-5 interaction and co-activation of Srebp2 or PPARβ-RXRα on the chromatin under different contexts including the brains from mice of different ages, and whether Qki-5 can interact with other transcription factors. Taken together, the universal occupancy of Qki-5 on chromatin greatly expands our understanding of Qki itself, as well as the biology of transcriptional control by an RNA-binding protein.</p><p>Notably, we observed that Qki was depleted in nearly all Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> OPCs (92.6%) in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which led to the question of how most of the OPCs were targeted under the control of <italic>Nestin</italic>-Cre after birth. Cortically derived OPCs are considered to make up about 80% of all OPCs in the cortex, which are called late-born OPCs because they arise as a third wave of OPCs initiating at birth and reaching maximum in number 2–4 weeks after birth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Tilborg et al., 2018</xref>). This population of OPCs is known to replace the OPCs originating at embryonic stages in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergles and Richardson, 2015</xref>), suggesting an active generation of OPCs from NSCs during the first month after birth, potentially leading to highly efficient Qki depletion in NSC-derived Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> OPCs in our study. On the basis of these findings, it is not difficult to understand that although Qki was efficiently depleted in OPCs of <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice at P4 and P5, an active generation of WT OPCs from WT NSCs diluted the OPC pool, leading to Qki depletion in only a subset of OPCs in <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice at P18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, although both <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice and <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice showed dysmyelinating phenotype, <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice exhibited a more severe phenotype than did <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice.</p><p>In this study, the median survival duration in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice was 13 days after tamoxifen injection due to severe dysmyelination, yet in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shingu et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice could survive through adulthood. We believe that the difference in the survival times between these two cohorts of <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO was due to the background of the mice. In the present study, the mice were on a pure C57BL/6J background, whereas the mice in the previous study were on a mixed C57BL/6J and FVB background. OPCs have been shown to repopulate as a third wave of cortically arising OPCs from NSCs initiating at birth and reaching the maximum number around 2–4 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Tilborg et al., 2018</xref>). However, the exact time point of this wave of OPC generation can be greatly influenced by the mouse background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Tilborg et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in highly variable <italic>Qk</italic> deletion in OPCs with P7 injection of tam in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO cohorts of different backgrounds.</p><p>Effort has been made to treat hypomyelinating disorders such as SLOS, Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A with dietary supplementation of lipids, including cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fledrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tierney et al., 2010</xref>). However, challenges still remain, as cholesterol rarely crosses the blood-brain barrier, and long-term benefits of cholesterol supplementation have not been clearly examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tierney et al., 2010</xref>). Whether dietary supplementation of cholesterol can rescue hypomyelination in <italic>Qk</italic>-iCKO mice would be interesting to know. Of note, we previously demonstrated that Qki plays an important role in intracellular vesicle trafficking in NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shingu et al., 2017</xref>). If the same function of Qki exists in oligodendrocytes, cholesterol transport and uptake would be impaired due to defective intracellular vesicle trafficking in Qki-depleted oligodendrocytes, which may lead to inefficiencies in high-cholesterol diet-based therapy. The present findings will potentially provide understanding of brain-specific cholesterol biosynthesis and shed light on mechanism-based therapeutics for enhancing oligodendrocyte myelination. As <italic>QKI</italic> is one of the genes most associated with various neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darbelli and Richard, 2016</xref>), understanding the mechanisms

Mice were group-housed at MD Anderson’s animal facility under pathogen-free conditions, maintained under a 12 hr light-dark schedule, allowed free access to water and food, and monitored for signs of illness every other day. All mouse experiments were conducted according to the NIH guidelines, and protocols (IACUC Study #00001392-RN01) for mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>Beginning at P7, <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup>T2</sup>;<italic>Qk</italic><sup>L/L</sup> mice were injected subcutaneously with 20 μL of tamoxifen (10 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) for two consecutive days to induce the deletion of <italic>Qk</italic>.

After tamoxifen injection, the experimental mice were monitored daily, and their neurological impairments were recorded for further plotting of a quaking phenotype-free survival curve. When the <italic>Qk</italic>-iCKO mice reached the clinical endpoint, they had severe paralysis, significant weight loss, and hunched posture and were near death. Thus, they were euthanized for humanistic care.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Rotarod behavioral analysis</title><p>The tamoxifen-injected mice were trained for five trials at a constant 5 rpm using a rotarod apparatus (Harvard Bioscience) and then tested in a 120 s trial at a constant 5 rpm. The latency of mice of falling off the rotarod was recorded. If a mouse stayed on the rotarod for more than 120 s, it was recorded as 120 s. Three trials were tested for each mouse at intervals of at least 30 min. Statistical analysis was performed using the mean latency of mice falling off the rotarod of three trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tissue preparation and immunofluorescence</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 20 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Their brains and optic nerves were dissected, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 2 days, dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C until the tissues sank, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Alternatively, brains and optic nerves were postfixed in formalin at room temperature for 2 days and embedded in paraffin. Frozen sections of 10 μm and paraffin-embedded sections of 5 μm were quickly boiled in citrate buffer (Poly Scientific R&amp;D Corp.) for heat-induced epitope retrieval. They were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton for 10 min and blocked with 10% horse serum for 1 hr at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used for staining of the sections overnight at 4°C: anti-MBP (SMI-94R) and anti-β-amyloid (SIG-39220) were from BioLegend; anti-PLP (ab105784), anti-Iba1 (ab107159), anti-Hmgcs1 (ab155787), and anti-Fdps (ab153805) were from Abcam; anti-MAG (#9043), anti-GFP (#2555), anti-Pdgfrα (#3174), and anti-Ki67 (#9449) were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-Aspa (ABN1698), anti-Olig2 (AB9610), anti-NeuN (MAB377), and anti–CC-1 were from Merck Millipore; anti-Gstpi (311) was from MBL International; anti-Qki (SAB5201536), anti-AnkG (MABN466), anti-Sox9 (AB5535), and anti-Srebp2 (HPA031962) were from Sigma-Aldrich and Millipore Sigma; and anti-Gfap (556330) was from BD Biosciences; anti-Caspr and anti-PanNav (K58/35) were gifts from Matthew N. Rasband (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA). TUNEL positive cells were detected using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (11684795910) from Millipore Sigma. The sections were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr at room temperature. FluoroMyelin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was stained directly onto rehydrated slides for 20 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sections were mounted using a VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium with DAPI. A Leica DMi8 microscope was used to visualize most of the stained sections, and a Leica DFC345 FX digital monochrome camera was used to obtain fluorescent images of them. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> were taken using a Nikon Upright Eclipse Ni-E microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Beginning at P7, <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup>T2</sup>;<italic>Qk</italic><sup>L/L</sup> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and control mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were injected with 20 μL of tamoxifen (10 mg/mL) on two consecutive days.

Two weeks later, these experimental mice were transcardially perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde. Their optic nerves were then postfixed in a cold PBS solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde at 4°C and processed at the MD Anderson High Resolution Electron Microscopy Facility. In brief, these fixed optic nerves were washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, treated with 0.1% Millipore-filtered cacodylate-buffered tannic acid, postfixed with 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and stained <italic>en bloc</italic> with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and then infiltrated with and embedded in LX-112 medium. The samples were polymerized in a 60°C oven for about 3 days. Ultrathin sections of the samples were cut using a Leica Ultracut microtome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate in a Leica EM stainer, and examined using a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images of the sections were captured using an AMT imaging system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to measure the axonal calibers and diameters of myelinated fibers; the percentage of myelinated axons, g-ratio, axonal diameter, and density of axon in these optic nerves were quantified on the basis of these measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>NSC isolation and oligodendrocyte differentiation</title><p>The entire brains of <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup>T2</sup>;<italic>Qk</italic><sup>L/L</sup> mouse pups at P1 were dissected, sliced into small pieces, and dissociated enzymatically into single cells using Neural Tissue Dissociation Kits (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

IPA software (QIAGEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krämer et al., 2014</xref>) was used to analyze the significantly affected canonical signaling pathways, molecular and cellular functions, and upstream regulators associated with differentially expressed genes after Qki depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cholesterol measurement</title><p>The corpus callosum tissues in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and control mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5 mice) were homogenized in a lipid extraction buffer (chloroform:isopropanol:NP-40, 7.0:11.0:0.1). After centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4°C for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and air-dried to remove the organic solvent. Dried lipid was used to measure cholesterol levels using Total Cholesterol Assay Kits (Cell Biolabs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>IP and immunoblotting</title><p>The differentiated oligodendrocytes were washed once with PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. After quenching with 0.125 M glycine, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP-40 supplemented with freshly added protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4°C. The whole-cell lysate was then sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode) for 60 cycles (30 s on, 30 s off) on high-power setting. After centrifugation at 13,000 g at 4°C for 15 min to remove insoluble debris, the supernatant was incubated with antibodies against Qki-5 (immunizing rabbit with a short synthetic peptide [CGAVATKVRRHDMRVHPYQRIVTADRAATGN]; GenScript), Srebp2 (10007663; Cayman Chemical), or normal rabbit immunoglobulin G at 4°C overnight. The IP system was further rotated in the presence of magnetic recombinant protein G-coated beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at 4°C. Alternatively, co-IP was performed as described above except using anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hr, and co-IP using denatured anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads which were boiled at 95°C for 30 min was served as a control. Bound beads were then washed three times in cold NP-40 buffer by inverting the tubes, boiled in sample buffer at 95°C for 20 min, and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.</p><p>Corpus callosum tissue lysates were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in NP-40 buffer at 4°C as described above and quantified using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) prior to immunoblotting. Briefly, 20–40 μg of proteins was electrophoresed on 4–12% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk at room temperature for 1 hr and incubated with anti-Hmgcs1 (ab155787; Abcam), anti-Hmgcs2 (SAB2107997; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Hmgcr (PA5-37367; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Lss (ab80364; Abcam), anti-Fdps (ab153805; Abcam), anti-Flag (F1804; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-β-actin (A5441; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the bands were visualized using a SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were processed and quantified using ImageJ software, and β-actin was used for normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR</title><p>The ChIP assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lan et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, adherent differentiated oligodendrocytes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and quenched by 0.125 M glycine. Then, the cross-linked cells were suspended in ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate with freshly added protease inhibitors). Sheared chromatin from these cells was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate with freshly added protease inhibitors) at a ratio of 1:1 and then incubated with anti–Qki-5 (immunizing rabbit with a short synthetic peptide [CGAVATKVRRHDMRVHPYQRIVTADRAATGN]; GenScript), anti-Srebp2 (10007663; Cayman Chemical), or anti-Pol II (ab817; Abcam) antibodies overnight at 4°C. After immobilization on prewashed protein G agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the protein-DNA complexes were washed three times with high-salt buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate with freshly added protease inhibitors), twice with low-salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate with freshly added protease inhibitors), and once with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Elution and reverse cross-linking of DNA were carried out using elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 65°C for 4 hr. After digestion with RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteinase K (Promega) for 1 hr at 55°C, DNA samples were purified using a PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). Library preparation was performed using a KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X Ten system (Jiangxi Haplox Clinical Lab Cen, Ltd). FASTQ data were trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.4.4_dev) and mapped to the mouse genome (mm10 version) using Bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with the parameters ‘−1 R1.fastq −2 R2.fastq -X 1000’, then the PCR duplication was removed by SAMtools (v1.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Peaks were identified by MACS2 (v2.1.2) with the parameters ‘macs2 callpeak -f BAMPE -g mm -q 0.05 -t ChIP.bam -n NAME -c INPUT.bam’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Bedgraph files were generated by deeptools (v3.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) and uploaded to UCSC browser for visualization. Signal plots and heatmaps were generated using ngsplot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). ChIP-seq was normalized by total reads. Motifs enriched in Qki-5 peaks were identified by HOMER (v4.10.1) with the following parameters: findMotifsGenome.pl peaklist.bed mm10 –size given –len 6,8,10,12,14 –mis 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). IPA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krämer et al., 2014</xref>) was used to analyze canonical signaling pathways enriched in genes whose promoters were co-occupied by Qki-5, Srebp2, and Pol II; overlapping genes among Qki-5-bound genes in freshly isolated mouse oligodendrocytes according to ChIP-seq and significantly downregulated genes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice according to RNA-seq; overlapping genes among Qki-5-bound genes in differentiated oligodendrocytes according to ChIP-seq and significantly downregulated genes in <italic>Qk</italic>-Plp-iCKO mice according to RNA-seq; Srebp2-bound genes from Srebp2 ChIP-seq. ChIP-qPCR was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All qPCRs were performed in triplicate, and a complete list of the sequences of the primers used is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). No statistical methods were used for predetermining the sample size. The sample size was based on experimental feasibility, sample availability, and the number of necessary to obtain definitive results. The number of animals in each experiment is described in the corresponding figure legends. Numerical results are presented as means, with error bars representing standard deviation (s.d.). For comparison of two groups, a two-tailed, unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used. To compare three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was conducted. Animal survival durations were analyzed using the log-rank test. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but has not been formally tested. All values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. No randomization or blinding events occurred during the experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Shan Jiang, Kun Zhao, and Yanping Cao for mouse husbandry and care and all members of the Hu laboratory for helpful discussions.

mechanisms for temporal control of cholesterol biosynthesis during oligodendrocyte differentiation remain largely unknown. This study describes the role of Qki, commonly known as an RNA-binding protein, in controlling cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes by acting as a transcriptional co-activator. These findings establish a previously unrecognized function of Qki in controlling cholesterol metabolism for temporal regulation of myelinogensis in developing central nervous system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Qki regulates myelinogenesis through Srebp2-dependent cholesterol biosynthesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jian Xu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Q. Lu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers found the study of significant interest by reporting a new mechanism linking Qki, cholesterol biosynthesis, myelinogenesis, and Srebp2-mediated transcriptional activation in oligodendrocytes. The experiments were well executed and the data supported the conclusions.

Moreover, the studies uncovered a new function for Qki in regulating myelinogenesis by acting as a transcriptional co-activator for Srebp2 in developing brain. These findings provide new insights into the Qki regulation of myelinogenesis.

The authors found that Qki depletion in NSCs or OPCs impaired cholesterol biosynthesis and myelinogenesis without affecting differentiation into Aspa+Gstpi+ myelinating oligodendrocytes. They next performed RNA-seq-based transcriptomics and ChIP-seq-based chromatin occupancy studies, and identified Qki-5 as a transcriptional co-activator of Srebp2 to control the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biogenesis in oligodendrocytes. Qki depletion impaired Srebp2-mediated transcriptional activation of genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis, thus establishing a new function of Qki as a transcriptional co-activator beyond its known role as an RNA-binding protein.</p><p>Overall, this is an important and well-executed study reporting a new and interesting mechanism linking Qki, cholesterol biosynthesis, myelinogenesis, and Srebp2-mediated transcriptional activation in oligodendrocytes. The experiments related to the phenotypic analysis of Qki conditional KO in NSCs and OPCs, and the mechanistic studies of Qki in developing oligodendrocytes were appropriately designed, and the results were carefully analyzed. Another main strengths of this work are the use of multiple in vivo genetic models and orthogonal approaches for studying cellular and molecular changes upon Qki depletion, thus the technical rigor of this study was excellent. Moreover, the detailed functional and mechanistic studies uncovered a new function for Qki in regulating myelinogenesis by acting as a transcriptional co-activator for Srebp2 in developing brain. The manuscript was well written, and the results were carefully interpreted and discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper by Hu and colleagues, the role of the Quaking gene in developmental myelination is explored. Using temporal-lineage specific mouse genetics, they show that loss of Qk results in severe defects in myelination. Mechanistic studies show that cholesterol biosynthesis pathways are dysregulted and that Qk collaboratively regulates subsets of these gens with Srebp2, a known transcriptional regulator of cholesterol associated genes.</p><p>Overall, this paper is well executed and the data support the conclusions. The main issue with this manuscript is that the authors just published a very nice paper in JCI showing essentially the same role of Qk in the adult. The only real difference between the published JCI paper and this current manuscript is the timing of the administration of tamoxifen: in the JCI paper it was added at 8w of age, here its added at P7. One could imagine the P7 treatment being included as part of the original analysis conducted for the published JCI paper. The fact that Qk plays an important role in lipid/cholesterol in myelin has already been shown, making the findings contained within this paper incremental and not of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>For these reasons, I do not support publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>, as it's more appropriate for specialized journals that target glial biologists and those interested in demyelinating disorders. Below are a few comments meant to improve a well-executed, but incremental paper:</p><p>1. Regarding the Nestin-cKO studies. Is Qk expressed in astrocytes? The P7 Tm treatment will likely also eliminate Qk in astrocytes. Accordingly, the authors should confirm that astrocyte development is not impacted in this mouse line.</p><p>2. The fact that OPCs appear unaffected further supports the notion that Qk plays a role in myelin biosynthesis via the mechanisms described in their JCI paper (and in this paper). If they want to uncoupled their developmental studies, from their adult studies, a more in-depth analysis of OPC biology and transcriptome might help.</p><p>3. The introduction touches on tangential topics of psychiatric disorders and white matter, etc.</p><p>This manuscript does not endeavor to examine psychiatric disorders, thus introducing this topic is not necessary as its distracting and links between the current studies and this topic are non-existent.</p><p>4. One myelin related question. Does myelin ever properly form in these mice? Have the authors looked at Node formation? What about the AIS? The authors have nice EM data, but fail to show whether the myelin organization is affected and whether the axons themselves are impacted. If nodes and AIS forms, then it might be worthwhile to do a time course analysis to decipher when these structures breakdown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>QKI is essential for CNS myelination and myelin maintenance, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, Dr. Hu and colleagues defined the of QKI at different stages during oligodendrocyte development. They show that the loss of Qki results in defects in OPC differentiation and myelination but not OPC formation. They further show that Qki5 can interact with a crucial cholesterol biosynthesis regulator Srebp2 and that QKi5 and Srebp2 cooperate to regulate cholesterol biosynthesis genes. The findings that link QKi5 function to Srebp2 and cholesterol biosynthesis is interesting and provide a new insight into the Qki regulation of myelinogenesis. Following concerns need to be addressed to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>1. A cre-dependent reporter would need to confirm the impact of Qki loss on oligodendrocyte development in the tamoxifen-induced iCKO mice.</p><p>2. The authors should examine the proliferation and survival of OPCs and oligodendrocyte in iCKO lines to make sure that the differentiation defects are not due to the progenitor deficits.</p><p>3. Qk undergoes alternative splicing to express Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7. Qk deletion may also reduce other isoforms besides Qki-5. Could Qki-6 and Qki-7 have a role in OPC differentiation and myelination too?</p><p>4. Previous study suggested that nuclear-localized QKI-5 predominantly represses myelination while the cytoplasmic QKI-6 and QKI-7 are essential for promoting OL maturation and myelination (PMID: 20956316). The present study suggests a positive role QKI-5 in cholesterol synthesis and CNS myelination. Could the authors comment on these different observations on the QKI-5 function in OL maturation?</p><p>5. Could the authors show a significant reduction of Pol II or Srebp2 target occupancy upon Qki deletion with statistic tests in Figure 7D,E? Could Qki have a role in global gene transcription in addition to cholesterol biosynthesis genes?</p><p>6. Is there any evidence that Qki-5 functions as a co-activator of Srebp2 for cholesterol biosynthesis? Since the authors reported Qki-5 interact with PPARb-RXRa for lipid metabolism for myelination, could the authors define how Qki-5 coordinates PPARb-RXRa or Srebp2 for myelination?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60467.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers found the study of significant interest by reporting a new mechanism linking Qki, cholesterol biosynthesis, myelinogenesis, and Srebp2-mediated transcriptional activation in oligodendrocytes.

On the basis of the comments from the editors and reviewers, we have performed 11 experiments and added 20 new figure panels in the revised manuscript. Lastly, we included the following points to clarify the major differences between the current work and the published studies (in particular, Zhou et al., JCI, 2020) and summarize the major conceptual advances of the current study.</p><p>1. The focus of the current study is to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanism for de novo production of the major myelin lipid –cholesterol– in oligodendrocytes during early developmental stage, whereas the JCI paper (Zhou et al., 2020) focuses on the transcriptional regulation of biosynthesis of the unsaturated fatty acids and very-long-chain fatty acids (which are the main components of phospholipids, sphingolipid, and glycolipids) in oligodendrocytes of adult mice. Although both cholesterol and fatty acids are important lipids in lipid-rich myelin membrane, cholesterol specifically functions as a chaperone in proper sorting of newly synthesized hydrophobic myelin membrane proteins such as PLP during the developmental process (Simons and Trotter, 2007). Besides, cholesterol is a major component of microdomain on the myelin membrane that facilitates the proper localization of myelin proteins and the translation of MBP mRNA (Gielen et al., 2006; Hughes and Appel, 2016; Simons et al., 2000). In the current study, we showed that significant reduction in cholesterol level induced by Qki depletion leads to defect in myelin protein localization observed by patchy MBP staining and impairment of co-localization of myelin proteins such as MBP, PLP, and MAG (Figure 3A, B).</p><p>Importantly, the defects in myelin protein assembly in <italic>Qk</italic>Nestin-iCKO mice upon Qki loss were not observed in the JCI paper. In summary, compared to phospholipids, sphingolipid, and glycolipids, cholesterol plays a distinct role in facilitating myelin membrane formation; our current study is the first one to demonstrate that Qki regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendrocytes.</p><p>2. Molecular machineries that are involved in transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis are different from those in fatty acid metabolism. One of the major differences is the mechanisms through which the major transcription factors are regulated. For example, PGC1α is a critical regulator of PPARβ-RXRα, but it has no direct impact on Srebp2. In addition, Srebp2 is post-translationally processed and translocalized to the nucleus with the help of scaffold proteins such as Scap and Insig, which can sense the availability of cellular cholesterol. In contrast, the main regulatory mechanism of PPARβ-RXRα heterodimer is through ligand binding, which in turn facilitates the interaction with transcription co-factors and activates transcription of fatty acid metabolic genes. The biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids have to be coordinated, yet few co-factors have been identified to be shared by Srebp2 and PPARβ-RXRα. Our JCI paper and the current study discovered that Qki is actually a cofactor for both Srebp2 and PPARβ-RXRα, thereby functions as a major regulator that coordinates the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in myelination.</p><p>3. Although both cholesterol ((Saher et al., 2005) and the current study) and fatty acids (Dimas et al., 2019) are essential for de novo myelination, the stability of these types of lipids are quite different. In the JCI paper, we discovered that fatty acids in mature myelin undergo fast turnover, and Qki-5/PPARβ/RXRα is the major regulator for fatty acid metabolism in mature myelin. However, in the JCI paper, we didn’t identify cholesterol metabolism as a pathway that is regulated by Qki in the adult mice, and the reason is that unlike fatty acids, cholesterol is actually quite stable in mature myelin with a half-life of more than 5 years in human and more than 1 year in mouse (Ando et al., 2003; Russell et al., 2009; Smith, 1968), so the cholesterol metabolic genes are generally suppressed in adult oligodendrocytes because the constant biosynthesis of cholesterol is not needed due to its slow turnover rate. Therefore, developmental stage is the only period in which cholesterol metabolism can be effectively studied in oligodendrocytes, and this is why only the current study but not the JCI paper could discover Qki as a major regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis.</p><p>4. It has been known that reduced cholesterol level in <italic>qk</italic><sup>v</sup> mice is secondary to impairment of oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation during development (Baumann et al., 1968; Singh et al., 1971). However, in the current study, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized function of Qki in controlling transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis without affecting the differentiation of Aspa<sup>+</sup>Gstpi<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes, and we propose that cholesterol metabolism controlled by Qki-5 is a determinant for proper function of myelinating oligodendrocytes, and ultimately for temporal control of CNS myelinogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Does myelin properly form in these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To decipher whether myelin was properly formed in <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice, a time course analysis of MBP expression was performed in the corpus callosum. As shown in New Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Qki depletion slowed down the myelin formation during brain development observed from P12 (5 days after tamoxifen injection) to P21 (14 days after tamoxifen injection), during which myelin is initiated and actively generated, ultimately resulting in failure of proper myelination formation and motor deficit at P21 (Figure 1C, Video 1). We have included this result in text line “161-166” in the revised manuscript. In addition to the corpus callosum tissues, hypomyelination was observed in optic nerves of <italic>Qk</italic>-Nestin-iCKO mice (Figure 1G) at P21, suggesting that Qki depletion leads to global abnormalities in the CNS myelin formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What about Node formation and AIS? The authors have nice EM data, but fail to show whether the myelin organization is affected and whether the axons themselves are impacted.</p></disp-quote><p>To ask if the formation of node of Ranvier is affected by Qki depletion, we focused on examining the node formation in the optic nerve, where rapid and robust myelination occurs during development. By labeling the nodes using antibodies against paranodal protein (Caspr) and nodal proteins (AnkG or PanNav), we found that Qki depletion leads to defect in intact node formation at P21 (14 days after P7 tamoxifen injection) (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Consistently, paranodal defects were also observed in <italic>QKI<sup>FL/FL;Olig2–Cre</sup></italic> mice in a previous study (Darbelli et al., J. Neurosci, 2016).

We have included this result in text line “187-191” in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Although myelin formation was severely affected, we did not observe the alteration of thickness and number of axons (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J). In addition, no axonal damage was found, as shown in Figure 1I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If nodes and AIS forms, then it might be worthwhile to do a time course analysis to decipher when these structures breakdown.</p></disp-quote><p>As node formation was severely affected by Qki depletion at P21, we further examined when this occurred during early myelin development through a time course analysis. Previous studies showed that clustering of ion channels at the nodes requires proper myelination (Rasband and Peles, 2020; Rasband et al., 1999). As myelination is rapidly formed at its peak from P14 in the optic nerve (Mayoral et al., 2018), we monitored earlier times (P14 and P17) to ask if myelin defect induced by Qki depletion affects de novo formation of nodes. Defect in node formation was observed as early as P14, which cannot be overcome at P21 (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F), and this observation is in line with the defect in myelination (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Specifically, total number of nodes (including both intact and the incomplete nodes) in the optic nerve was decreased upon Qki depletion (New Figure 1figure supplement 1G). Importantly, the percentage of intact nodes among the total nodes was also significantly reduced with Qki depletion (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). Notably, Qki depletion at P14 showed streaks of Caspr<sup>+</sup> signals instead of clustering/localization of Caspr, a component of the axoglial junctions indicating the proper paranode formation (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F). As it was previously reported that paranode formation precedes node clustering in the CNS (Rasband et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2020), our observation suggests that failure of paranode formation due to defect in myelination upon Qki depletion ultimately leads to failure of node formation during the critical time of myelin development. We have included this result in text line “169-182” in the revised manuscript.</p><p>It has been shown that Qki depletion in oligodendrocyte lineage exhibits ultrastructural paranodal defects caused by reduced expression of neurofascin 155, an axoglial junctional protein (Darbelli et al., 2016). Additionally, myelin-specific lipid called galactolipids (GalC) has been studies to be essential for proper CNS node formation (Dupree et al., 1998), implying the importance of myelin lipid in node formation. Our study further sheds light on the understanding of the importance of myelin lipid metabolism (particularly cholesterol) regulated by Qki for proper myelination and formation of node of Ranvier.</p></body></sub-article></article>
