We show that Aurora-A mediated H3 T118ph occurs at pericentromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and is lost upon chromosome alignment. Expression of H3 T118E or H3 T118I (a SIN mutation that bypasses the need for the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler SWI/SNF) leads to mitotic problems including defects in spindle attachment, delayed cytokinesis, reduced chromatin packaging, cohesion loss, cohesin and condensin I loss in human cells. In agreement, overexpression of Aurora-A leads to increased H3 T118ph levels, causing cohesion loss, and reduced levels of cohesin and condensin I on chromatin. Normal levels of H3 T118ph are important because it is required for development in fruit flies. We propose that H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure during specific phases of mitosis to promote timely condensin I and cohesin disassociation, which is essential for effective chromosome segregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11402.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11402.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In every one of our cells, our DNA is wrapped together with histone proteins to make a structure called chromatin. When a cell divides, each newly formed daughter cell must receive an identical set of chromatin. As part of this process, the chromatin is copied and then compacted, which causes a characteristic “X”-shaped chromosome to form. This “X” shape is actually made up of two identical parts, or chromatids, that are joined together until a specific time during cell division. If chromosomes separate too early or too late, the DNA will not distribute evenly to daughter cells, which could lead to diseases including cancer.</p><p>Histone modifications are small chemical changes on the histone proteins that the DNA wraps around. Previous research identified a new histone modification that is located at an important contact point between the DNA and a particular histone protein. However, the role of this modification in living cells was not clear.</p><p>Wike et al. have now determined that in animal cells, this histone modification occurs immediately before the chromatids separate and at specific locations along the chromosomes. The amount of this histone modification is very important: in cells with too much of the modification, the chromosomes compacted incorrectly and the chromatids separated too soon. As a result, the chromosomes were incorrectly distributed among the daughter cells.</p><p>Wike et al. also show that an enzyme called Aurora-A kinase is responsible for making this histone modification. The next challenge will be to understand how the Aurora-A kinase knows when and where to add the histone modification to the chromosome. This will help us to understand how the overproduction of Aurora-A causes cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11402.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11402.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aurora-A</kwd><kwd>histone H3 phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>cohesion</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>chromosome congression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM64475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA95641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A histone modification that alters the nucleosome structure occurs in mitosis and promotes chromosome packaging and the timely removal of condensin I and cohesion, to achieve chromosome segregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin facilitates the temporal and spatial regulation of all genomic activities, including DNA repair, replication, transcription and mitosis. Chromatin comprises arrays of nucleosomes, where each nucleosome has ~146 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around a histone octamer composed of two molecules each of core histone H3, H4, H2A, and H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kornberg, 1974</xref>). Repetitive arrays of nucleosomes are then further compacted by higher-order folding, requiring additional proteins including linker histones. During mitosis, chromosome condensation plays a critical role in preventing DNA breaks during mitosis and enabling equal chromosome segregation to the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganem and Pellman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>One important means by which the cell achieves accurate regulation of genomic processes, including mitosis, is via post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>). The PTMs, usually occurring on the N- and C-terminal tails of the histones, generally serve to recruit reader proteins to the chromatin. PTMs also occur on the histone globular domains, but are much less well studied than the histone tail modifications. PTMs at the histone-DNA interface have been proposed to directly modulate nucleosome structure, without the need for reader proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cosgrove et al., 2004</xref>). Of all the histone PTMs that occur at the histone-DNA interface, one of the best positioned to disrupt the nucleosome structure is phosphorylation of threonine 118 (T118ph) of H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mersfelder and Parthun, 2006</xref>). In agreement with its important location within the nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), biochemical studies have confirmed that H3 T118ph causes reduced nucleosome stability, increased nucleosome mobility, and increased DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, H3 T118ph caused the formation of novel populations of alternate DNA-histone complexes that have DNA wrapped around two complete histone octamers arranged edge-to-edge, termed nucleosome duplexes and altosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">North et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with the biochemical data, a substitution of H3 T118 for isoleucine (T118I) was identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a dominant <underline>Swi-IN</underline>dependent (SIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kruger et al., 1995</xref>). The SIN H3 T118I substitution allows nucleosomes to slide along the DNA without the need for SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muthurajan et al., 2004</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamic mitotic phosphorylation of H3 T118.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The side chain of H3 T118 (red) is close enough to form a hydrogen bond with the DNA (grey).

Accordingly, we characterized H3 T118ph function in metazoan cells.

Here we show only the results obtained with the Abcam antibody, although similar results were obtained with our independently generated H3 T118ph polyclonal antisera (data not shown). The antisera were highly specific in dot-blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and recognize a single protein identical in size to histone H3 in western blot analysis of total protein extracts from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This signal in western blots was increased by treating the cells with the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor calyculin A for 3 hr, indicating that the H3 T118ph antibody recognized phosphorylated H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In concordance with previously published mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>), we observed a dramatic increase in H3 T118ph levels as cells entered mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The antibody also recognized H3 T118ph in its native conformation, because it immunoprecipitated H3 from cells released into mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using immunofluorescence analysis, we found that H3 T118ph was restricted to mitotic cells during prophase through anaphase and was greatly diminished in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Specifically, H3 T118ph signal was detected as discrete foci on chromatin only in prophase and pro-metaphase. Additionally, H3 T118ph co-localized with centrosomes through all phases of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is a consequence of non-chromatin bound histones localizing to the centrosomes for proteasome-mediated degradation during mitosis (C. Wike and J.K. Tyler, manuscript submitted). During anaphase, the H3 T118ph antibodies also detected the spindle mid-body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The localization pattern of H3 T118ph was not unique to HeLa cells, nor cancer cell lines, because it was similar in HMEC, WI-38 and MCF10A cells (data not shown). Finally, the H3 T118ph signal was specifically competed away by an H3 T118ph peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Together, these results show that the H3 T118ph antibody is specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3 T118ph localizes to centromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and pro-metaphase</title><p>Threonine 118 and the surrounding residues are highly conserved among metazoan H3 proteins. Therefore, we tested whether H3 T118 is phosphorylated in other metazoans and whether this occurs specifically during mitosis. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2 cells, H3 T118ph localized to chromatin and centrosomes during mitosis (data not shown). H3 T118ph localization was also conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. During pro-metaphase, H3 T118ph was localized along the outside edges of chromosomes, indicative of centromeric localization on holocentric chromosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine if the localization of H3 T118ph along the arms of chromosomes was dependent on the centromeric chromatin structure, we used siRNA to the centromeric histone variant CENP-A to abolish the centromeres. Upon CENP-A knockdown, H3 T118ph is diminished from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data demonstrate that mitotic enrichment of H3 T118ph is conserved amongst metazoans. Furthermore, H3 T118ph localizes to centromeres and its localization is dependent on intact centromeres.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>H3 T118ph localizes to pericentromeres and chromosome arms during prophase and pro-metaphase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence of two-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos Control (RNAi) (top) and centromeric protein A CENP-A (RNAi)-depleted (bottom) embryos were fixed and stained with α-tubulin (green) and H3 T118ph (red) antibodies.

Indeed, we found that H3 T118ph co-localized with CENP-A in human cells in prophase and pro-metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Noteworthy, the prophase to metaphase timing of the appearance and disappearance of H3 T118ph on centromeres is distinct from other mitotic H3 phosphorylation events. For example, H3 S10ph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crosio et al., 2002</xref>) and H3 T3ph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polioudaki et al., 2004</xref>) remain on chromosome arms and centromeres, respectively, through anaphase. CENP-A S7ph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeitlin et al., 2001</xref>) remains through metaphase, while H3 T118ph is lost from centromeres in metaphase coincident with chromosome alignment. H3 T118ph foci did not always perfectly colocalize with CENP-A, but sometimes appeared to be adjacent to CENP-A foci. Indeed, detailed inspection of mitotic spreads revealed that H3 T118ph localized to the inner centromere when cells were treated with the microtubule destabilizing drug colcemid while CENP-A remained on the outer-centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The distinct localization of CENP-A and H3 T118ph emphasizes that the H3 T118ph signal is not due to phosphorylation of CENP-A per se. Importantly, upon colcemid treatment, where microtubule attachment is lost, the interkinetochore distance is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>). The single foci that is detected by H3 T118ph antibody could be because of a single population of H3 T118ph localized to the inner-centromere or because the two adjacent centromeres are separated by less than the resolution of light microscopy, which is theoretically 200nm. Therefore we asked when there is dynamic microtubule attachment, promoting tension and kinetochore stretching, what is the true H3 T118ph signal at the centromere. H3 T118ph existed in two foci per chromosome that correlate well with, but are larger than, the two CENP-A foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) consistent with pericentromeric localization. We noted that H3 T118ph also appears to occur along the chromosome arms in mitotic spreads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, H3 T118ph was detectable at the centromere partially overlapping with CENP-A and at weaker foci at discrete intervals along the chromosome arms on extended chromatin fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aurora-A phosphorylates H3 T118</title><p>To gain insight into the function of H3 T118ph, we sought to identify the kinase responsible for its phosphorylation.

Aurora-A was the only cell cycle regulated kinase able to efficiently phosphorylate H3 T118 from among the three positive kinases, arbitrarily defined as having an activity above 3000 cpm.

To do this, we mutated T118 to alanine to prevent its phosphorylation. This serves as a negative control that is not expected to yield a phenotype, because there is still phosphorylation of the endogenous H3. We also mutated T118 to glutamic acid (E), although this mutation does not cause the nucleosome destabilization or altered nucleosome structures that result from T118 phosphorylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">North et al., 2014</xref>). As such, T118E is not an effective mimic of T118 phosphorylation, at least on mononucleosomes in vitro. We also mutated H3 T118 to isoleucine (I) to recapitulate the yeast sin mutant. Transient transfection of HEK 293TR cells with plasmids expressing histone H3:YFP where T118 was mutated to E or I led to a significantly increased incidence of lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Equal expression of the wild type and mutant H3 proteins was verified by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells expressing H3 T118E:YFP or H3 T118I:YFP had significant delays in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>, see Materials and methods). Furthermore, whenever a lagging chromosome was evident, there also was an accompanying delay in the subsequent cytokinesis, regardless of the transfected construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that expression of H3 T118I and T118E results in lagging chromosomes that delay cytokinesis.</p><p>An increase in lagging chromosomes is symptomatic of defects in chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thompson and Compton, 2011</xref>). This prompted us to investigate if phosphorylation of H3 T118 plays a role in correction of chromosome alignment errors, using an error correction assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampson et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). For this, we created a panel of stable 293TR cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged wild type H3, H3 T118E, T118I, or T118A from the same locus. All the H3:FLAG proteins were expressed to equivalent levels, at approximately 10% of the endogenous H3 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>) and all could be incorporated into chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We further verified that the H3 T118 mutations in H3:FLAG did not cause a delay in prophase to anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The error correction assay was as follows: Monastrol was used to induce a monopolar spindle and kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The cell lines were able to recover by washing out Monastrol if proper checkpoints and machinery are in place and the chromosomes will attach to bipolar spindles. Additionally, cells were released in the presence of MG132 to allow time to align the chromosomes to the metaphase plate by preventing cells from entering anaphase. Importantly, the H3 T118 mutations did not delay release from the pro-metaphase arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Expression of either H3 T118E or T118I significantly decreased the ability to align chromosomes compared to wild type H3 or T118A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). This result suggests that an over abundance of H3 T118E and T118I mutants may hinder chromosome congression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Normal levels of H3 T118 phosphorylation are essential for development</title><p>Our results suggest an important role for phosphorylation of H3 T118 in regulating chromosomal dynamics in metazoans. However, these studies were performed in a situation where only 10% of the histone H3 was mutant. In order to examine the consequences of having all or none H3 phosphorylated on T118, we introduced the T118 mutations into 12 copies of the H3 gene on transgenes and introduced them into <italic>Drosophila</italic> where the endogenous H3 gene copies were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>), such that the flies only expressed H3 T118A, T118E, or T118I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunesdogan et al., 2010</xref>).

Since cells expressing H3 T118I and T118E showed reduced chromosome congression, we asked if H3 T118ph remains at centromeres of misaligned chromosomes as the cells enter metaphase. Caffeine was used to induce misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuki et al., 2008</xref>). H3 T118ph remained at centromeres of misaligned chromosome along with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase BubRI, even in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that removal of H3 T118ph is triggered by chromosome alignment and led us to speculate that H3 T118ph plays a role in achieving efficient chromosome attachment. Accordingly, we investigated the potential molecular reasons for the defect in chromosome congression caused by H3 T118E and T118I. Outer-kinetochore proteins, spindle assembly checkpoint proteins and the heterochromatin landscape were indistinguishable between cells expressing H3 T118A, T118E, T118I or wild type H3 (data not shown).

Mitotic spreads from cells expressing wild type H3 or H3 T118A upon pro-metaphase arrest (induced by Monastrol) and metaphase arrest (Monastrol arrest released into MG132) mostly had closely associated sister chromatids with 'closed' or 'open' arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, H3 T118E or H3 T118I caused a higher incidence of chromosomes with “partially separated” arms, indicating loss of arm cohesion and partial loss of centromeric cohesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Similar defects in cohesion were observed for cells expressing T118E and T118I upon pro-metaphase arrest with the microtubule destabilizing drugs nocodazole and colcemid (data not shown). The loss of cohesion was most pronounced for H3 T118I, where partially separated sister chromatids were predominant in 50% of the cells versus 10% of the cells for wild type H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the proportion of cells where most of the sister chromatids were totally separated, indicating complete loss of cohesion, was 16% for H3 T118I versus 4% for wild type H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data indicate that H3 T118E or H3 T118I promotes loss of cohesion at the centromere and chromosome arms. Given the correlation between faulty cohesion and chromosome alignment defects, we propose that the faulty cohesion caused by expression of H3 T118I or T118E is responsible for the defects in chromosome alignment.</p><p>Aurora-A overexpression has been linked to aneuploidy and cancer, presumably through its role in centrosome duplication. Aurora-A overexpression has not been linked to cohesion loss previously, but this could provide an alternate explanation for aneuploidy. Therefore, we made isogenic cell lines overexpressing Aurora-A and kinase dead Aurora-A. The cell lines had equal expression of Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and proceeded relatively normally through the cell cycle (data not shown). Overexpression of Aurora-A increased levels of H3 T118ph along the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We asked if overexpression of Aurora-A recapitulates the loss of cohesion caused by expression of H3 T118I and T118E. Upon colcemid-induced pro-metaphase arrest, overexpression of Aurora-A caused 44% of the sister chromatids to be “partially separated” as compared to 20% for the control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Upon pro-metaphase arrest, chromosomes from the H3 wild type and T118A mutant cell lines were organized into loops and coils to form very tight compact structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). By contrast, mitotic chromosomes from the H3 T118E and T118I cell lines were less tightly packed with longer radiating DNA loops. These results indicate that H3 T118E and T118I disrupt the higher order chromatin packaging. This grossly altered mitotic chromosome structure led us to test whether the H3 T118I mutation causes the histones to be more readily removed from chromatin. In agreement, H3 T118I was more readily extracted from chromatin than wild type H3 at 600 mM salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Expression of H3 T118I also increased DNA accessibility to the nuclease DNase I in both asynchronous and mitotically arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Together, these results are consistent with biochemical studies that showed that mononucleosomes with H3 T118ph favor the removal of histone H3 from DNA compared to unphosphorylated mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given that overexpression of Aurora-A results in excess H3 T118ph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we asked if it also disrupts chromosome integrity. Overexpression of Aurora-A caused significant widening and shortening of the chromosome arms of metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) as was observed for H3 T118E and T118I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), while overexpression of Aurora-A KD did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Overexpression of Aurora-A also caused increased sister chromatid interkinetochore distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results further indicate that the H3 T118I and T118E mutations are functional mimics of H3 T118 phosphorylation in vivo, and show that H3 T118ph disrupts higher order chromatin packaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>H3 T118I and T118E cause premature removal of cohesin from DNA</title><p>The altered chromatin integrity and cohesion defect caused by excess H3 T118ph or mutations that mimic excess H3 T118ph led us to ask whether there was a dissociation of cohesin proteins from DNA due to excess H3 T118ph. During mitotic delay, the intensity of the Rad21/Scc1 component of the cohesion complex along chromosome arms and at centromeres was drastically reduced in cells expressing H3 T118E and T118I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mechanistically, the loss of cohesin and the resulting faulty cohesion phenotype that is caused by excess H3 T118ph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E</xref>) could result from multiple causes: premature activation of separase, premature removal of cohesion via cohesin phosphorylation, or improper establishment of cohesion. We set out to distinguish amongst these possibilities. To ask if cells expressing H3 T118I and T118E had premature activation of separase during mitotic delay, we analyzed mitotic spreads after incubation with MG132, which prevents degradation of Cyclin B and Securin and therefore inhibits separase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rock et al., 1994</xref>). The fact that the T118I and T118E mutants still displayed cohesion loss, despite inhibition of separase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicates that cohesin loss in the T118E/I mutants is not due to premature separase activity. The bulk of cohesion is removed in pro-metaphase by phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 by PLK-1 kinase or Aurora-B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hauf et al., 2005</xref>). We found that the PLK-1 inhibitor, BI2536, and the Aurora-B inhibitor, hesperidin, prevented cohesion loss in all the H3 expressing cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Sister chromatid cohesion is also facilitated by DNA catenation during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitiss, 2009</xref>). To prevent DNA decatenation, we used a specific inhibitor of Topo II, ICRF-193 and found that chromosomes became extremely tangled, indicative that DNA catenation is undisturbed by the H3 T118 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken, together, these data indicate the H3 T118I and T118E mutations do not disrupt the proper establishment of sister chromatid cohesion by both DNA and sister chromatid catenation, but are likely to lead to premature cohesion loss via the PLK-1 or Aurora-B mediated pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Premature cohesion loss in the phosphomimetic and SIN mutants is independent of separase activity, but dependent on proper centromere tension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitotic spreads following the error correction assay.

The histones carrying H3 T118ph generated not only canonical nucleosomes, but also altosomes and disomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>) as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">North et al., 2014</xref>). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) at higher levels of condensin 1, we found that condensin I could bind to nucleosomes and the altered histone-DNA forms, irrespective of the phosphorylation status of H3 T118. This result indicates that H3 T118ph does not directly affect condensin I binding to a mononucleosome. As such, we favor the idea that H3 T118ph promotes changes in global chromatin packaging that may indirectly reduce condensin I occupancy. Therefore, we asked if overexpression of Aurora-A recapitulates the loss of condensin I caused by expression of H3 T118I and T118E. Indeed, upon mitotic delay, there was a significant loss of condensin I from chromatin upon Aurora-A overexpression (25% of mitotic cells were GFP negative) as compared to the control (0% of mitotic cells were GFP negative) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This result shows that excess H3 T118ph leads to condensin I loss from chromatin.

In metazoans, H3 T118ph is dynamically regulated through mitosis by the Aurora-A kinase, occurring at pericentromeric regions and at discrete locations on chromosome arms. Excess H3 T118ph (achieved by overexpression of Aurora-A or mimicked by amino acid substitution) resulted in increased numbers of lagging chromosomes, defects in chromosome congression, delayed cytokinesis, altered chromosome compaction, cohesion loss and cohesin and condensin I loss. Normally, H3 T118ph disappears from each chromosome when chromosome alignment is achieved. Given that condensin I increases the rigidity at the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>), we propose a model where H3 T118ph alters the chromatin structure to limit condensin I and cohesin occupancy in order to enable efficient attachment to the mitotic spindle and effective chromosome compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the functions of H3 T118ph as explained in the text.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11402.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11402.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11402-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>Aurora-A is best known for its role in centrosome separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutertre et al., 2002</xref>).

Precedent exists for Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of centromeric proteins, on substrates including NDC80 (Ye, Deretic et al. 2015), CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunitoku et al., 2003</xref>) and CENP-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010a</xref>). In addition to being found at the centromere, H3 T118ph also occurred in a periodic punctuate pattern along the chromosome arms. As such, H3 T118 is the first known target for phosphorylation by Aurora-A along chromosome arms. This raises the question of how Aurora-A/TPX2 is directed to phosphorylate H3 T118 along the chromosome arms. In order to gain insight into this mechanism, we attempted to map exactly where H3 T118ph occurs on chromatin by ChIP-seq, but unfortunately the antisera against H3 T118ph failed in ChIP analysis (data not shown). This was disappointing since we were able to successfully immunoprecipitate H3 T118ph with the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), raising the possibility that the antibody immunoprecipitates only H3 T118ph on free histones. Regardless of how Aurora-A is targeted to chromatin, it is likely that the phosphorylation of H3 T118ph will also require nucleosome disruption by an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler given the buried location of this residue within the nucleosome structure. As such, this would provide an additional step to tightly regulate the function of this key histone post-translational modification.</p><p>In addition to the insight gained from the location and timing of H3 T118ph, much of our understanding of H3 T118ph function comes from the analysis of histone mutants. Given that we can only express the H3 mutants to be approximately 10% of the total histone H3 in human cells, it is not surprising that the H3 T118A loss of function mutant gave no detectable phenotype in the presence of endogenous H3 T118ph. In contrast, the H3 T118E and T118I mutants clearly had dominant effects on wild type histones in human cells. It should be noted that <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell clones expressing only H3 T118A, H3 T118E, or H3 T118I have significant defects in cell growth (Graves et al., submitted). H3 T118ph acts to physically distort the nucleosomal DNA at the nucleosome dyad in order to loosen the nucleosome structure and generate altered nucleosomal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">North et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that the alterations to the nucleosome structure that are induced by H3 T118ph impact higher order levels of chromosome packaging. This structural role of phosphorylation of H3 T118 can explain why the T118I mutant gave even more drastic phenotypes than T118E in our experiments. Although isoleucine is not the classic phosphomimetic substitution, it does have a large bulky side chain that would distort the trajectory of the nucleosomal DNA around the histone octamer to an even greater extent than the traditional phosphomimetic of glutamic acid. Furthermore, isoleucine mimics the rigidity of phosphate group compared to the flexible side chain of glutamic acid. Functional support for the idea that H3 T118I structurally mimics the effect of phosphorylation of T118 comes from the fact that overexpression of the T118 kinase, Aurora-A, leads to identical phenotypes to T118I.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>H3 T118ph function at the centromere</title><p>H3 T118ph appears at pericentromeric regions during prophase and disappears from each chromosome as it aligns at the metaphase plate. Furthermore, the H3 T118I and T118E mutants resulted in displacement of condensin I and cohesin from chromatin and generated chromosomes with looser chromatin packaging. Accordingly, we propose that H3 T118ph plays an important role in organizing the chromatin structure around centromeres to achieve optimal levels of cohesin and condensin I association to permit enough conformational flexibility for microtubule attachment. Condensin I is highly enriched at centromeres in mitosis in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and promotes the rigidity of the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, Aurora–A has been demonstrated to play a role in error correction by destabilizing microtubule connections of misaligned chromosomes. Upon knockdown or inhibition of Aurora-A the kinetochore, as well as their attachment to microtubules, become more rigid and stable (Chmatal, Yang et al. 2015, Ye, Deretic et al. 2015). As such, H3 T118ph at the centromere appears to act to limit condensin I occupancy in order to increase flexibility at the centromeres of misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This idea is supported by chromosomes from cells expressing H3 T118E, T118I or overexpressing Aurora-A having increased interkinetochore distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,G</xref>), which could be indirectly or directly related to the role of H3 T118ph in removal of cohesin and condensin I. However, upon attachment to mitotic spindles from opposite centrosomes, the centromeric regions have to be rigid enough to resist the forces that the microtubules exert on the centromere in order to prevent separation of sister chromatids until anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Removal of H3 T118ph as soon as tension is sensed across the kinetochores would allow for better centromere rigidity. Consistent with an important role for H3 T118ph in achieving appropriate microtubule attachment, H3 T118ph remained at centromeres of misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>H3 T118ph function on chromosome arms</title><p>H3 T118ph occurs in a punctate periodic pattern along chromosome arms in prophase and pro-metaphase. Excess H3 T118ph (due to overexpression of Aurora-A or mutations that mimic the effect of phosphorylation) leads to gross alterations in chromosome compaction, with wider and shorter chromosome arms and longer, less organized chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that H3 T118ph plays a role in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Mitotic chromosomes have been suggested to be packaged in a two phase process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>). In the first phase, a linear array of chromatin loops form at random, but consistent, positions along the chromosome. In the second phase, the loops longitudinally condense around the axes. These two different phases are mediated by the condensins, where condensin II is required for linear compaction along the chromosome axes while condensin I helps organize chromatin loops around the axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shintomi and Hirano, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green et al., 2012</xref>). Although the timing of appearance of H3 T118ph and condensin I on chromosome arms is similar, their spatial localization along the arms are distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As such, there is no evidence that H3 T118ph physically recruits or displaces condensin I from chromatin. Indeed, other proteins promote condensin recruitment in yeast including kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tada et al., 2011</xref>) and the Ku heterodimer complex, which functions in non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). Perhaps related to its recruitment mechanism, yeast condensin interacts with histone H2A and H2AZ in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tada et al., 2011</xref>) and cross-linking mass spectrometry studies have found interactions between condensin I and H2A and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barysz et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, our evidence indicates that H3 T118 phosphorylation is likely to regulate condensin I occupancy on the chromatin, given that expression of H3 T118I, T118E and overexpression of Aurora-A cause loss of condensin I from chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). This disruption of condensin I function is in agreement with the longer loops of chromatin that were observed by SEM in the T118E and T118I mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with the delayed cytokinesis that occurs upon condensin I knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>) the H3 T118I and T118E mutants caused a delay in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Given that condensin I interacts with chromosomes in a more dynamic manner than condensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>),we propose that the dynamic nature of the association of condensin I with chromatin enables H3 T118ph to regulate the levels of condensin I to shape the mitotic chromosomes as they condense. The ratio of condensin I to condensin II is very tightly controlled within cells, given that changes in the ratio profoundly alters the shape of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shintomi and Hirano, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakhrebah et al., 2015</xref>). As such, the removal of H3 T118ph from the chromosome arms by metaphase, either by dephosphorylation or by our preferred model of physical removal of T118 phosphorylated H3 from the DNA, is likely to regulate the ratio of condensin I:condensin II for appropriate chromosome compaction. This function is likely to occur in an indirect manner via H3 T118ph affecting chromatin structure, given that condensin I binding to mononucleosomes is not affected by H3 T118ph in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Similarly, we propose that the loss of cohesin is an indirect consequence of the altered packaging of the chromatin structure caused by excess H3 T118ph, which may expose the cohesin ring to PLK-1 mediated phosphorylation and subsequent removal of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hauf et al., 2005</xref>). However, we were unable to rule out the possibility that the cohesion phenotype may be due to loss of Sgo-1-mediated protection against PLK-1 and Aurora-B kinases.</p><p>Taken together, our work suggests a model where phosphorylation of H3 T118 at the nucleosome dyad by Aurora-A is a critical step to ensure chromosome congression, via its influence on chromosome compaction and cohesion through physically regulating nucleosome structure. These functions are likely to be conserved in metazoans, as we find similar localization and timing of H3 T118ph in nematodes, flies, and human cells. The importance of the ability to utilize H3 T118ph to alter the nucleosome structure to regulate mitosis is underscored by the embryonic lethality of flies where all of their histones are mutated to prevent T118 phosphorylation or to mimic persistent H3 T118 phosphorylation. Given that Aurora-A is overexpressed in many cancers, it is tempting to speculate that the carcinogenic effect of overexpressed Aurora-A may be mediated at least in part via altering the mitotic chromatin structure by phosphorylation at the nucleosome dyad.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and cloning</title><p>Plasmid expressing human H2B:RFP was a kind gift from Walter Hittelman (MDACC, Houston, TX).

The samples were then chemically dried in a graded series of increasing concentrations of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, Electron Microscopy Services) 2:1 (100% EtOH:HMDS), 1:1 (100% EtOH: 100% HMDS), then 1:2 (100% EtOH: HMDS), then 3 changes in pure HMDS where all steps were for 5 min each. Then the samples were air dried overnight. Samples were mounted onto an aluminum specimen mount (Ted pella, INC.) by carbon conductive double-stick tape (Ted Pella. Inc., Redding, CA). The samples were then coated under vacuum using a sputter system (208HR, Cressington Scientific Instruments, England) with platinum alloy for a thickness of 30 nm.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by the Tyler lab studies the role of H3T118 phosphorylation in mitosis. Histone H3-T118 is part of a network of amino acids that position a key arginine residue (H4-R45) for interaction with nucleosomal DNA near the dyad axis. Mutations in H3T118 were first identified by genetic screens in budding yeast, and subsequent biochemical studies showed that this residue was phosphorylated in cells and that substitutions in T118 or its phosphorylation destabilized nucleosomal structure. The present study is of general interest because the physiological function of H3T118-Phos is unknown.</p><p>H3T118-phos function is examined in human cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using an antibody that recognizes T118-phos, the authors find that this mark is cell cycle-regulated, appearing in early mitosis where it marks the centrosomes, centromeres, and chromosome arms. Using an in vitro kinase screen, they identify Aurora A as the likely kinase. Knockdown of Aurora A appears to eliminate T118-phos from mitotic chromosomes. Based largely on results in HeLa cell lines that express exogenous histones harboring substitutions of T118 (T118A, T118E, and T118I), the authors conclude that T118-phos is important for proper chromosome alignment, and that it controls chromatin association of cohesin and condensin. Although the mutant histones are only expressed at about 10% of the level of endogenous histones, the T118E and T118I derivatives indeed caused a range of mitotic defects: lagging chromosomes, mitotic delays, loss of cohesion and condensin, and altered mitotic chromosome structure. Confirming the authors’ model, similar defects are observed after over-expression of Aurora A.</p><p>The findings presented in the paper are of general interest, and the experiments are overall of good standard. However, there are a number of reservations, several of which will have to be addressed experimentally. We would, therefore, be interested in a revised manuscript that resolves the points outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical issue is to include a better characterization of the fly embryos with the mutated H3T118. This is important because much of this manuscript focuses on data where the ectopic H3T118 mutants are expressed at no more that 10% of the endogenous H3. The low percentage of mutant H3 might well explain why H3T118A has no clear phenotype. Nevertheless, to conclude that T118 phosphorylation is important for mitosis, this is a critical &quot;loss-of function&quot; mutant. This conundrum could be remedied by the studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where flies are engineered to express H3 derivatives as the sole source of H3. These flies die during embryogenesis as soon as the maternal histone deposits have been depleted. These embryos should be analyzed for a mitotic block or chromosome segregation defects. Does the H3T118A mutant cause segregation errors? And, do the H3T118E or H3T118I mutants display a different phenotype? These experiments may also ameliorate some of the other concerns raised below. Alternatively, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments may indicate that the histone substitutions lead to general loss of viability, not necessarily a specific mitotic defect. This would be similar to the case in budding yeast.</p><p>2) There are some concerns with respect to the antibody characterization presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). (1) Controls should include a T118 peptide that is not phosphorylated. (2) The exposure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is not sufficient to evaluate whether other proteins are recognized. Likewise, the complete gel should be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. (3) The immunoprecipitation data is not convincing.</p><p>3) The authors’ results suggest that H3T118 is phosphorylated by Aurora A, and that this is important for error correction. However, it would be prudent to ensure that this phosphorylation is not dependent on Aurora B in vivo. One could include a low dose of the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A/B</xref>. Error correction is known to be highly dependent on Aurora B, and the consensus sites are the same. It would then be necessary to verify that classical Aurora B targets are not phosphorylated in this case, while H3T118 is.</p><p>4) It is not clear why wild type histone H3 (and bulk H3) is removed from chromatin at only 90 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Removal of histone H3 from a nucleosome requires Na+ concentrations &gt; 1M. A concern is that the authors are looking at a pool of H3 that is weakly bound to DNA, but not nucleosomal. Related to this, the authors need to demonstrate that the exogenous histone substitution alleles are actually incorporated into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Fractionation into the chromatin pellet might only indicate nuclear import and nonspecific DNA association. A simple MNase digestion of nuclear chromatin, followed by a glycerol gradient fractionation step would test this.</p><p>5) In the second paragraph of the subsection “H3 T118I and T118E cause premature removal of cohesin from DNA”. The logic here is unclear. If H3T118-phos directly promotes cohesin removal, then one would predict no co-localization, as cohesin would be removed wherever there was T118-phos. The lack of T118-phos on heterochromatin seems inconsistent with the centromeric localization of this mark. Why would T118 phosphorylation need to promote cohesin dissociation at centromeres? Surely, Separase cleaves cohesin at anaphase onset?</p><p>6) Based on the presented data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>), one cannot conclude that T118 affects cohesion in a Shugoshin independent manner. Different sets of hands often get different results regarding partially separate vs. fully separate chromatids. If the authors wish to stress this point, they should include Sgo1 immune fluorescence to assess whether Sgo1 localisation is affected by the T118 mutations. It is likely though that Sgo1 is decreased, as cohesin is required for efficient Sgo1 docking at centromeres. Therefore, if Sgo1 is lost from centromeres, one cannot draw conclusions regarding the loss of cohesion. Considering that the loss of cohesion depends on the kinases Plk1 and Aurora B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), it could be argued that the phenotype is caused by loss of Sgo1-mediated protection against these kinases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The findings presented in the paper are of general interest, and the experiments are overall of good standard.

This would be similar to the case in budding yeast.</italic> </p><p>To answer the reviewers request for information on the effect of T118A in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have performed an extensive analysis of the H3 T118A mutants and have now added to the Discussion section “<italic>Drosophila</italic> cell clones expressing only H3 T118A have significant defects in cell growth and viability (Graves et al., submitted).” This is consistent with our proposed role of T118p in promoting timely removal of cohesin and condensin. Furthermore, the defects in cell growth for T118E and T118I are even more pronounced than for T118A (Graves et al., submitted), consistent with excess T118p driving premature cohesin and condensin loss. We were unable to directly examine whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos expressing T118A have mitotic defects because we found that in our hands the transgenes carrying the 12 wild type histone genes were not able to fully rescue the mitotic defect previously observed in Cycle 15 embryos lacking endogenous histones (EMBO Reports and <italic>eLife</italic>) although they do rescue viability. In addition, unfortunately the <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes in imaginal discs are too small to examine for mitotic defects in the clones of cells expressing T118A that we generated (Graves et al., submitted). Regardless, we have removed the conclusion that T118p is important for mitosis from the current text.</p><p> <italic>2) There are some concerns with respect to the antibody characterization presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

To make this more clear we have replaced “H3 115-125aa” with “unM T118” in the figure and updated the figure legends to explain that unM T118 is the unmodified 10 amino acid peptide spanning H3 115-125aa. As requested, we have now provided better images to address points (2), and (3). Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the complete gel of the western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors’ results suggest that H3T118 is phosphorylated by Aurora A, and that this is important for error correction. However, it would be prudent to ensure that this phosphorylation is not dependent on Aurora B in vivo. One could include a low dose of the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A/B</xref>. Error correction is known to be highly dependent on Aurora B, and the consensus sites are the same. It would then be necessary to verify that classical Aurora B targets are not phosphorylated in this case, while H3T118 is.</italic> </p><p>We had previously shown that knock down of TPX2 and Aurora A blocked H3 T118, while overexpression of Aurora A leads to more H3 T118p, and that Aurora A can phosphorylate H3 T118ph in vitro, suggesting that Aurora A is directly involved in the phosphorylation of H3 T118. However, as requested we treated cells with a variety of concentrations of ZM447439. As expected, we found that treatment of ZM447439, which decreased levels of the Aurora B target H3 S10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1A</xref>), additionally inhibited Aurora A function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1B</xref>), as evidenced by the loss of Aurora-A T288 phosphorylation. This is likely due to the fact that inhibiting Aurora B will inhibit PLK-1 [1] which in turn prevents TPX2 phosphorylation and that in turn prevents Aurora A localization to chromatin [2]. Therefore, we would expect to lose H3 T118ph when we inhibit Aurora B with ZM447439 (or by any means) because of this indirect effect on the activity of Aurora A. This is exactly what we saw. As such, the use of Aurora B inhibition with ZM447439 is not very informative.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11402.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11402.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11402.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11402-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p> <italic>4) It is not clear why wild type histone H3 (and bulk H3) is removed from chromatin at only 90 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Removal of histone H3 from a nucleosome requires Na+ concentrations &gt; 1M. A concern is that the authors are looking at a pool of H3 that is weakly bound to DNA, but not nucleosomal. Related to this, the authors need to demonstrate that the exogenous histone substitution alleles are actually incorporated into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Fractionation into the chromatin pellet might only indicate nuclear import and nonspecific DNA association. A simple MNase digestion of nuclear chromatin, followed by a glycerol gradient fractionation step would test this.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which alerted us to the fact that we labeled the gel wrong. The numbers were meant to be 600nm and 900nm NaCl and not 60nm and 90nm and we have now corrected this error. We have also added better experiment details in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>5) In the second paragraph of the subsection “H3 T118I and T118E cause premature removal of cohesin from DNA”. The logic here is unclear. If H3T118-phos directly promotes cohesin removal, then one would predict no co-localization, as cohesin would be removed wherever there was T118-phos. The lack of T118-phos on heterochromatin seems inconsistent with the centromeric localization of this mark. Why would T118 phosphorylation need to promote cohesin dissociation at centromeres? Surely, Separase cleaves cohesin at anaphase onset?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct, and based on a later comment where you suggest we make an effort to streamline our Results/excessive data, we decided to remove this section of the paper and the data related to it, because it does not improve the overall scope of the research article.</p><p><italic>6) Based on the presented data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>), one cannot conclude that T118 affects cohesion in a Shugoshin independent manner. Different sets of hands often get different results regarding partially separate vs. fully separate chromatids. If the authors wish to stress this point, they should include Sgo1 immune fluorescence to assess whether Sgo1 localisation is affected by the T118 mutations. It is likely though that Sgo1 is decreased, as cohesin is required for efficient Sgo1 docking at centromeres. Therefore, if Sgo1 is lost from centromeres, one cannot draw conclusions regarding the loss of cohesion. Considering that the loss of cohesion depends on the kinases Plk1 and Aurora B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), it could be argued that the phenotype is caused by loss of Sgo1-mediated protection against these kinases.</italic></p><p>The reviewers have a valid point and we have attempted to assess Sgo-1 levels by immunofluorescence in the T118 mutants. Unfortunately the analyses were not conclusive due to the low quality of the commercial antibodies that are available. Accordingly, we have removed the previous experiments that were deemed inconclusive and have removed the conclusion that T118 affects cohesion in a Shogoshin independent manner, and have noted the possibility in the Discussion, that the cohesion phenotype may be due to loss of Sgo-1 mediated protection against the PLK-1 and Aurora-B kinases.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Archambault, V. and M.
