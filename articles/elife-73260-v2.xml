Guiding the process are short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) cut by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) from double-stranded precursors of ~30 bp that are synthesized by NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV) and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2). We show that Pol IV’s choice of initiating nucleotide, RDR2’s initiation 1–2 nt internal to Pol IV transcript ends and RDR2’s terminal transferase activity collectively yield a code that influences which precursor end is diced and whether 24 or 23 nt siRNAs are produced. By diversifying the size, sequence, and strand specificity of siRNAs derived from a given precursor, alternative patterns of DCL3 dicing allow for maximal siRNA coverage at methylated target loci.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dicer endonuclease</kwd><kwd>dicer-like 3</kwd><kwd>siRNA biogenesis</kwd><kwd>RNA-directed DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>RNA silencing</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM077590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pikaard</surname><given-names>Craig S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator:Pikaard</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukudome</surname><given-names>Akihito</given-names></name><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Vibhor</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Pikaard</surname><given-names>Craig S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006733</institution-id><institution>Indiana University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Carlos O.

Pol IV associates with RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Law et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Haag et al., 2012</xref>) via direct physical interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) to form a multi-functional enzyme complex. The transcription reactions of Pol IV and RDR2 are tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>) with Pol IV’s inability to maintain processivity through double-stranded DNA regions proposed to results in Pol IV arrest and backtracking, coincident with DNA template-nontemplate strand reannealing and extrusion of the nascent transcript’s 3′ end for engagement by RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukudome et al., 2021</xref>). Resulting double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), ranging in size from ~25 to 40 bp in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ye et al., 2016</xref>) are then diced by DCL3. Biogenesis of 23 and 24 nt siRNAs can be recapitulated in vitro upon incubating purified Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 with single-stranded bacteriophage M13 template DNA and nucleoside triphosphates, indicating that no other activities are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although DCL3 generates both 23 and 24 nt siRNAs, immunoprecipitated AGO4 associates almost entirely with 24 nt siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Havecker et al., 2010</xref>), making the significance of 23 nt siRNAs unclear. We have proposed that when paired with 24 nt siRNAs, the 23 nt RNAs help specify the stable AGO4-association of the 24 nt strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we investigated the rules of DCL3 dicing, revealing how Pol IV and RDR2-encoded cues program DCL3 dicing patterns and account for the biogenesis of either 23 or 24 nt siRNAs. We show that DCL3 preferentially binds dsRNAs with 3′ overhangs and that overhangs are present at both ends of Pol IV-RDR2 dsRNA transcripts to facilitate dicing from either end, with two distinct activities of RDR2 accounting for these 3′ overhangs. The choice of nucleotide incorporated at the 5′ terminus of Pol IV transcripts also affects DCL3 activity, and which end of the dsRNA is diced. Our evidence indicates that DCL3 measures only one strand of its substrate dsRNAs, with RNase III domain B cutting the measured strand to produce 24 nt siRNAs and domain A cutting the non-measured strand to produce either 23 or 24 nt siRNAs. Collectively, our experiments reveal a code comprised of sequence and structural features intrinsic to paired Pol IV-RDR2 transcripts that programs alternative DCL3 dicing patterns, thereby diversifying the siRNA pool that guides RNA-directed DNA methylation to complementary target loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DCL3 preferentially dices double-stranded RNAs with 3′ overhangs</title><p>An untemplated nucleotide is often present at the 3′ ends of RDR2 transcripts and is enriched among 23 nt, but not 24 nt siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Singh and Pikaard, 2019</xref>). RDR2’s terminal transferase activity can account for the addition of these untemplated 3′ terminal nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>). These observations led to the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> in which DCL3 interacts with base-paired Pol IV-RDR2-transcripts, measures and cuts 24 nt from the 5′ terminus of the Pol IV strand (shown as the top strand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and throughout this paper), and makes a second cut of the RDR2 strand that is offset by 2 nt from the Pol IV-strand cut site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Singh and Pikaard, 2019</xref>). Because of the untemplated nucleotide added to the 3′ end of the RDR2 strand, the predicted dicing product is an asymmetric 24/23 nt siRNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To test whether DCL3 can, in fact, carry out the hypothetical reaction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, recombinant DCL3 produced in insect cells was purified to near-homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> -panel A) and incubated with a dsRNA generated by annealing 37 and 38 nt RNA strands (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> for RNA strand sequences). This dsRNA has a 3′ overhang of 1 nt on the left side, as drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, to mimic the overhang attributable to nucleotide addition by RDR2’s terminal transferase activity. DCL3 cuts the 37/38 nt dsRNA to yield 23 and 24 nt products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 1 and 5) as predicted by the model. Similarly, DCL3 cuts a dsRNA with a 2 nt overhang, formed by annealing 37 and 39 nt RNAs, generating two 24 nt RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 2 and 6). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DCL3 measures and cuts 24 nt from the 5′ end of the top strand, and makes an offset cut of the bottom strand to leave a 2 nt 3′ overhang, as expected from prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Takeshita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nagano et al., 2014</xref>). The results also suggest that the length of the bottom strand can vary, indicating that its 3′ end is not anchored at a fixed position within DCL3.</p><p>Given a dsRNA substrate with two blunt ends, DCL3 generates dicing products of diverse sizes, including 21, 22, 24, and 25 nt RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 7). Gel mobility depends on RNA sequence, thus RNAs of the same length, but from opposite strands of the dsRNA, differ in mobility, as is apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Importantly, 21, 22, and 25 nt dicing products are not observed at significant levels among siRNAs produced in vitro by Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>), nor have RNAs of these sizes been attributed to DCL3 activity based on analysis of <italic>dcl3</italic> mutants in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>). These considerations, combined with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, indicate that dsRNAs with 3′ overhangs, not blunt ends, best account for the 23 and 24 nt siRNAs generated by DCL3.</p><p>To more definitively test whether DCL3 prefers 3′ overhangs over blunt ends, we performed DCL3 cleavage assays using dsRNAs that have a 3′ overhang on the left side and a blunt end on the right side, with either the top strand or bottom strand end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). If the 3′ overhanging end is preferred by DCL3, a 24 nt <sup>32</sup>P-labeled dicing product is expected from the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled top strand and a 16 nt product is expected from the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled bottom strand. This is observed, with dsRNA substrates that have 3′ overhangs of 1 or 2 nt yielding nearly identical products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, compare lanes 1–4 to lanes 5–8) and reaction time-courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> – (B)). In contrast, if DCL3 is incubated with a dsRNA with two blunt ends, DCL3 dices from both ends, generating 16 and 24 nt products from both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that DCL3 will cut dsRNAs with 3′ overhanging ends or blunt ends but prefers 3′ overhanging ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DCL3 measures 24 nt from the recessed 5′ end of dsRNAs with 3′ overhangs</title><p>Experiments testing the dicing of dsRNAs formed by annealing RNA strands ranging in size from 22 to 25 nt yielded additional evidence that DCL3 measures only one strand of its dsRNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

This indicates that DCL3’s measurement of an interval equivalent to 24 nt is a consequence of interaction with the recessed 5′ end of the top strand.

A 24/24 nt duplex having 2 nt 3′ overhangs at both ends was also not cut by DCL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 5).

This suggests that dsRNAs whose strands are shorter than typical DCL3 dicing products do not fit into the enzyme in a way that fixes their position, allowing for cutting at variable positions.

We then tested the cutting of a dsRNA formed by annealing 26 and 27 nt RNAs, with a 1 nt 3′ overhang on the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). DCL3 with wild-type, unmutated RNase domains cut both strands of the dsRNA to yield 24 and 23 nt siRNAs (compare lanes 5 and 6).

Mutating RNase III domain A, while leaving domain B unchanged, resulted in top strand (26 nt) cutting to 24 nt, but no bottom strand (27 nt) cutting (lane 8). Conversely, mutating domain B, but leaving domain A unchanged, allowed bottom strand cutting, to 23 nt (lane 9). Repeating these experiments using a dsRNA substrate with a 2 nt overhang, instead of a 1 nt overhang, yielded equivalent results, the only difference being the generation of a 24 nt product from the bottom strand due to the additional overhanging nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the PAZ domain binds the recessed 5′ end of the top RNA strand, opposite the 3′ overhang of the bottom strand, and cuts that strand using RNase III domain B at a distance equivalent to 24 nt.

We tested whether monophosphate or triphosphate groups at the 5′ end of a dsRNA substrate affect DCL3 dicing. For this experiment, dsRNA substrates had 1 nt 3′ overhangs (uridines in each case) and 5′ adenosines at each end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), making both ends similarly conducive to dicing.

Dicing initiated by measuring 24 nt from the 5′ end of the top strand yields a 24 nt labeled product, whereas dicing measured 24 nt from the 5′ end of the bottom strand yields a 16 nt labeled product. The ratio of 24 versus 16 nt products thus provides a way to assess the relative affinity of DCL3 for dicing the alternative ends of the substrate dsRNA.

Scenarios 2 and 3 show how RDR2 transcription initiating either 1 or 2 nt internal to the 3′ end of Pol IV transcripts could generate 3′ overhangs of 1 or 2 nt, respectively, promoting right-side dicing. In scenario 2, a 23 nt siRNA can be generated from the Pol IV strand and a 24 nt siRNA can be produced from the RDR2 strand. In scenario 3, 24 nt siRNAs are generated from both strands. (<bold>B</bold>) 3′ overhangs are present at both termini of Pol IV-RDR2 transcribed dsRNAs. Pol IV-RDR2 transcription reactions were performed in either of two ways to selectively label either the Pol IV or RDR2 strand. To label Pol IV transcripts, a <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled RNA primer was used to initiate Pol IV transcription of a DNA template lacking thymidines (lanes 1–4). The presence of non-template DNA annealed to the template induces Pol IV arrest and RDR2 initiation of the complementary strand which can be selectively body-labeled using alpha-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP (lanes 5–8). Overhangs present in the dsRNA products generated by the coupled reactions of Pol IV and RDR2 are sensitive to digestion by S1 nuclease treatment (see diagram), generating the shorter labeled products observed for both Pol IV (lanes 2–4) and RDR2 (lanes 6–8) transcripts. Mock S1 nuclease treatment negative controls are shown in lanes 1 and 2. RNAs were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. (<bold>C</bold>) RDR2 initiates transcription 1 or 2 nt internal to the 3′ end of the template RNA strand. A 37 nt RNA labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at its 5′ end (50 nM) was used as template for second-strand synthesis by recombinant RDR2 (280 nM) (lanes 1 and 2). Half of the transcription reaction was then subjected to S1 nuclease digestion (lane 2). In parallel, controls in which the end-labeled template was hybridized with strands whose complementarity begins at the very end of the template or 1 or 2 nt internal were also generated and subjected to S1 nuclease digestion (lanes 3–8). RNAs were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. (<bold>D</bold>) 24 nt siRNAs are diced from the 5′ ends of Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts and 23 nt siRNAs are diced from their 3′ ends. In vitro transcription reactions using the template, non-template, and primer diagrammed in (<bold>B</bold>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for their sequences) were conducted in several ways in order to specifically end-label or body-label Pol IV or RDR2 transcripts.

The labeled band of ~25 nt in both lanes 1 and 2 is an RDR2-dependent, Pol IV- and DCL3-independent background RNA.

We then treated the transcripts with S1 nuclease, which digests single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For these experiments, Pol IV transcription was initiated using an RNA primer hybridized to a T-less (lacking thymidines) DNA template (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for oligonucleotide sequences). Downstream of the primer used to initiate transcription, a non-template DNA oligonucleotide is annealed to the template DNA to induce Pol IV arrest and RDR2 engagement of the Pol IV transcript’s 3′ end, enabling synthesis of the RDR2-transcribed strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). By 5′ end-labeling the RNA primer, only first-strand RNAs synthesized by Pol IV are labeled and detected. Conversely, by using an unlabeled RNA primer and including alpha-labeled <sup>32</sup>P-ATP in the reactions, second-strand RNAs synthesized by RDR2 are specifically labeled. Note that because adenosines are not present in first-strand RNAs generated by Pol IV transcription of a T-less DNA template, first strands are not labeled.</p><p>Treatment of transcription reaction products with increasing amounts of S1 nuclease resulted in a progressive 1–2 nt shortening of labeled Pol IV transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 1–4).

Body-labeled RDR2 transcripts were shortened by 1 nt upon digestion with S1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 5–8), a result consistent with the removal of the single untemplated nucleotide added to the 3′ end of RDR2 transcripts.

As a test of this hypothesis, we used a 5′ end-labeled synthetic RNA as a template for recombinant RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) and subjected resulting dsRNA products to S1 nuclease digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). S1 trimmed the 5′-labeled template strand of the RNA duplexes by 1–2 nt (lanes 1 and 2). As controls, we synthesized RNA strands with perfect complementarity to the template strand (lanes 3 and 4) or were shorter by 1 (lanes 5 and 6) or 2 nt (lanes 7 and 8) at their 5′ ends, annealed these RNAs to the 5′ end-labeled template RNA strand, and subjected resulting dsRNAs to S1 nuclease digestion. S1 digestion patterns for synthetic dsRNAs with 1 or 2 nt overhangs most closely resembled the digestion patterns observed for RDR2 transcription products (compare lanes 2, 6, and 8). We conclude that RDR2 initiates transcription 1 or 2o nt internal to the 3′ ends of the Pol IV transcripts it uses as templates, consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, scenarios 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, and the results of a different assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukudome et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Labeling Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts in different ways and observing how siRNAs were derived from the labeled precursor strands revealed that 24 and 23 nt siRNAs come from opposite ends of Pol IV and RDR2-transcribed RNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). By initiating Pol IV-RDR2 transcription with an RNA primer labeled with <sup>32</sup>P on its 5′ end, only the Pol IV strands of resulting dsRNAs are labeled (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Upon dicing of these dsRNAs into siRNAs, only labeled 24 nt siRNA products are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 2). Note that a labeled band of ~25 nt is also apparent in lanes 1 and 2, but this is a Pol IV- and DCL3-independent RNA that results from RDR2 transcription of the 16 nt RNA primer, generating an initial transcript that folds back on itself into a partial stem-loop structure, followed by further elongation upon transcription of the single-stranded portion of the stem.</p><p>Unlike the dicing results obtained using end-labeled Pol IV strands, in which only labeled 24 nt siRNAs were detected following dicing, body-labeling of Pol IV or RDR2 strands yields labeled 24 and 23 siRNAs upon dicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 4 and 6).</p><p>In a third labeling strategy, we initiated Pol IV transcripts using a dephosphorylated primer and unlabeled nucleotide triphosphates to generate Pol IV-RDR2 dsRNAs.

In this experiment, only 24 nt siRNAs were capped with <sup>32</sup>P-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 10), suggesting that only 24 nt siRNAs come from the 5′ ends of RDR2 transcripts.</p><p>Collectively, the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> reveal that the siRNAs derived from the 5′ ends of Pol IV transcripts and the 5′ ends of RDR2 transcripts are 24 nt, consistent with DCL3 measuring and cutting 24 nt from the 5′ end of either strand.

Likewise, determining which siRNA precursor strands are synthesized by Pol IV and which are synthesized by RDR2 is problematic in vivo, as the enzymes work as a complex and are co-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Our in vitro biochemical experiments circumvent these uncertainties. Several important insights came from recapitulating siRNA biogenesis by incubating purified Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 with single-stranded bacteriophage M13 as the source of template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). These experiments showed definitively that Pol IV acts first, transcribing the single-stranded template DNA to generate RNA transcripts whose 5′ to 3′ polarity is opposite that of the DNA. RDR2 acts second, using the Pol IV transcripts as templates to generate complementary RNAs that are oriented in the same 5′ to 3′ polarity as the DNA template strand, and thus could not have been directly transcribed from the DNA. This ability to unambiguously discriminate the Pol IV transcripts from the RDR2 transcripts, based on their polarity relative to the template DNA, also allowed strand-specificities of DCL3-diced siRNAs to be assigned. These studies showed that 24 and 23 nt siRNAs are generated from both the Pol IV and the RDR2-transcribed strands of siRNA precursors, with 24 nt siRNAs outnumbering 23 nt siRNAs by several fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, these studies showed that an untemplated nucleotide at the 3′ terminus is a characteristic of RDR2 transcripts, but not Pol IV transcripts. The untemplated 3′-terminal nucleotide persists in siRNAs derived from RDR2 transcripts and, importantly, is selectively enriched among 23 nt siRNAs but not 24 nt siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). However, 23 nt siRNAs also come from the 3′ ends of Pol IV transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), helping explain why not all 23 nt siRNAs possess an untemplated nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of an untemplated nucleotide at the end of 23 nt siRNAs derived from RDR2 transcripts led to the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. In this model, diced 23 nt siRNAs derived from the 3′ ends of RDR2 transcripts are paired with 24 nt siRNAs derived from the 5′ ends of Pol IV transcripts. However, the model did not account for how 24 nt siRNAs can come from the RDR2 strand, explain why RDR2-strand 24 nt siRNAs outnumber 23 nt siRNAs, or account for 23 nt siRNAs derived from the Pol IV strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Our current study provides the answers to these questions. A key finding is that RDR2 does not initiate second strand RNA synthesis precisely at the 3′ end of a Pol IV transcript, but instead initiates 1–2 nt internal to the transcript, as has also shown by a biochemical study of RDR2 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukudome et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, a 3′ overhang of 1–2 nt is generated upon RDR2 initiation. A second key finding is that the 3′ overhangs, attributable to RDR2’s mode of initiation or its terminal transferase activity, generate preferred DCL3 substrates. Pol IV-RDR2 dsRNAs are typically shorter than 40 bp, thus they can be diced only once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>), either from the left side or right side. Our experiments reveal that this left/right choice is influenced by the 5′ terminal nucleotide at the recessed end of an overhang, with adenosines or uridines favored over guanosines or cytosines. Importantly, Pol IV transcription tends to begin with a purine, with adenosine used somewhat more frequently than guanosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, our experiments suggest that if Pol IV initiates with an adenosine, left-side dicing is favored, with DCL3 generating a diced duplex consisting of a 24 nt siRNA from the 5′ end of the Pol IV strand paired with a 23 nt siRNA from the 3′ end of the RDR2 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, dicing scenario 1). By contrast, if Pol IV transcription begins with a G, we propose that this encourages right-side dicing, especially if the RDR2 strand has a 5′ A or U that is optimal for DCL3 engagement. Indeed, RNA-seq data have shown that RDR2 transcripts initiate most frequently with A or U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, consensus sequences of in vivo precursor 5′ and 3′ ends best matched consensus sequences for siRNA 5′ and 3′ ends by invoking left-side dicing for precursors that initiated with A and right-side dicing for precursors that initiated with G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>). Our current study shows that it is this right-side dicing that accounts for 24 nt siRNAs derived from the RDR2 strand and 23 nt siRNAs derived from the Pol IV strand. There are two ways to generate 24 nt siRNAs from each strand and only one way to generate 23 nt siRNAs from each strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), which fits with the fact that 24 nt siRNAs are more abundant than 23 nt siRNAs, both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary model for a DCL3 dicing code that diversifies the siRNA pool guiding RNA-directed DNA methylation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73260-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our study also provides new insight into the minimum length of Pol IV or RDR2 transcripts that can serve as siRNA precursors or siRNAs. The experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicate that Pol IV transcripts that are 24 nt or longer are sufficient to give rise to DCL3-dependent siRNAs. Moreover, if Pol IV were to generate a 24 nt transcript and RDR2 were to initiate 2 nt internal to this transcript and add an extra untemplated nucleotide to the 3′ end of its transcript, the result would be a 24/23 nt dsRNA duplex. This duplex would not need to be diced by DCL3 because it is already indistinguishable from a dicing product (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, in <italic>dcl2 dcl3 dcl4</italic> triple mutants, we detected Pol IV-dependent 24 nt RNAs at ~7% of the level found in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>). This may account for low levels of RNA-directed DNA methylation that persist in dicer mutants, suggesting an alternative explanation to putative dicer-independent pathways that have been proposed to be distinct from the canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway yet remain unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ye et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another prior finding in need of reconsideration is the observation that 24 nt siRNAs associated with AGO4 tend to begin with a 5′ adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mi et al., 2008</xref>), a finding that has been interpreted as evidence that AGO4 actively selects siRNAs that begin with an adenosine. We have shown that Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts most frequently begin with adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>) and our current study shows that DCL3 preferentially dices substrates with A at their 5′ ends. Thus Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3 activities could collectively account for much of the 5′ A-enrichment among siRNAs that become loaded into AGO4. Consistent with this interpretation, 24 nt RNAs that have a 5′ A, U, C, or G are assimilated into AGO4 with similar efficiency in vitro (Wang and Pikaard, unpublished).</p><p>Our results illustrate how siRNAs of different lengths can be produced by a Dicer endonuclease that measures a fixed length of RNA, an apparent paradox. This fixed length presumably corresponds to the distance from a phosphorylated or triphosphorylated 5′ terminal nucleotide, bound by the PAZ domain, as in other Dicers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>), to the RNase III domain B cleavage site of DCL3, a length equivalent to 24 nt. The siRNAs of alternative size (23 nt) come from the opposite strand of RNA. The 5′ end of the non-measured strand is generated by the RNase III domain A cleavage reaction, but the 3′ end of this strand is apparently not anchored at a set distance, unlike human dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Park et al., 2011</xref>), and can overhang the 5′ end of the measured strand by 1 nt, to yield a 23 nt siRNA, or 2 nt to yield a 24 nt siRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). A structural study of DCL3 bound to dsRNA, published while our study was in review, supports this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our study adds to our knowledge of how individual reactions within the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway specify what will happen in the next step. Pol IV and RDR2 physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) and their activities are tightly coupled such that Pol IV transcripts are channeled directly to RDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref>) by a proposed mechanism involving Pol IV backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukudome et al., 2021</xref>). Lack of Pol IV-interaction explains why the other five RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are not redundant with RDR2. Our current study now shows that idiosyncrasies of Pol IV and RDR2 transcription, including the choice of nucleotide used to initiate transcription, the alternative start site positions of RDR2 internal to Pol IV transcripts, and the non-templated addition of a nucleotide at the 3′ end of RDR2 transcripts, collectively inform DCL3 how to dice the dsRNAs at the next step of the pathway. This results in production of siRNAs that can be 23 or 24 nt, derived from either strand. Experimental evidence indicates that the specification of 23 and 24 nt siRNAs has functional significance, by specifying that the 24 nt RNA of a 23/24 nt RNA duplex becomes the siRNA stably associated with AGO4 (Wang and Pikaard, unpublished). Thus, by generating 24 and 23 nt siRNAs from either strand and either end of the Pol IV-RDR2 dsRNAs, DCL3 can diversify the set of siRNAs that can be derived from short dsRNA precursors, enabling siRNA base-pairing with Pol V transcripts transcribed from either strand of target loci DNA to maximize DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLAG-DCL3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Singh et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synthetic gene codon-optimized for insect cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High Five Cells in Express Five Medium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

Briefly, High Five insect cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) grown in Express Five serum-free medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to produce DCL3 using baculovirus mediated protein expression. The High Five cells that had been infected with bavculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.5 were collected, pelleted at 500×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C.

Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon filter (EMD Millipore) with a 30 kDa cutoff size and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4%–20% SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie Blue staining. Recombinant DCL3 was stored at –20°C in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 45% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% IPEGAL CA-630).</p><p>To generate point mutations in the two RNase III domains, the wild-type DCL3 cDNA construct in pUC57 were mutated using site-directed, ligase independent mutagenesis.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Toshiyuki Fukuhara (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that DCL3 activity does not require ATP should be revised or supported by further data. Specifically, to exclude the possibility that the DCL3 preparation was contaminated with cellular ATP during protein purification, DCL3 protein can be treated with hexokinase to deplete ATP.</p><p>2) The conclusion that Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 sequence preferences can account for the spectrum of sRNA bound to AGO4 should be revised or further supported. A plausible alternative is that Pol IV, DCL3 and AGO4 have co-evolved to increase specificity within the pathway.</p><p>Please also consider other Reviewer suggestions (especially those of Reviewer #2) for improving the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Two conclusions would benefit from elaboration or clarification:</p><p>1. The authors conclude that DCL3 activity does not require ATP. Can the authors exclude the possibility that their DCL3 preparations already contain ATP, for example pre-bound to DCL3?</p><p>2. The authors conclude that Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 sequence preferences can account for the spectrum of sRNA bound to AGO4. Would it not make as much (or more?) sense if AGO4 also has binding preferences for the types of sRNA produced by Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3, which would enhance specificity within the RdDM pathway?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following comments should be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Measurement of binding affinity of DCL3 to different types of dsRNA substrates (Figure 1C, Figure 4A, C) by EMSA or other methods will strengthen the conclusions drawn from the dicing assays.</p><p>2. More time points between 30 sec and 5 min are suggested to be assayed with excessive amounts of substrates and initial processing rates can be calculated to measure the activity of DCL3 with different substrates (Figure 4A-C) or at different conditions (Figure 5).</p><p>3. For Figure 5, in addition to repeating the experiment with more time points in the presence of excessive amounts of substrates, increasing amounts of ATP can be added to the reactions to test whether the addition of ATP increase the dicing activity. To exclude the possibility that DCL3 prep was contaminated with cellular ATP during protein purification, DCL3 protein can be treated with hexokinase to deplete ATP.</p><p>4. Page 9, line 214, &quot;monophosphates or triphosphates are similarly conducive to DCL3 engagement&quot;. It appears to me that monophosphate is more conducive to DCL3 engagement than triphosphate as more 16-nt products are produced when the bottom strand has a 5' monophosphate (Figure 4C, lane 5 and lane 6).</p><p>5. In the discussion (page 14, line 371-377), the authors suggest that the selectivity of 5'A siRNAs by AGO4 needs to be reconsidered. The authors stated that Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts most frequently begin with adenosine (Singh et al., 2019) and DCL3 preferentially dices substrates with A (actually A or U as shown in Figure 4A) at their 5' ends, and thus Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 activities can collectively account for much of the 5' A-bias among siRNAs that become loaded into AGO4, independent of AGO4-mediated selection. I think that this statement needs to be reconsidered for the following reasons: (a) RDR2 initiates from 1-2 nt internal to PolIV transcript ends and it appears to me that there are no direct evidence that RDR2 transcripts predominantly start with an A, if RDR2 transcripts do not have a 5' A, the siRNAs produced via right-side dicing cannot be loaded into AGO4 due to its selectivity;</p><p>(b) even if all siRNAs produced by Pol IV-RDR2-DCL3 have a 5' A, this only suggests that the initiation (production of 5' A siRNAs) and effector (specific binding to AGO4 that preferably accepts 5' A siRNAs) stages of RdDM have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of siRNA function. This is very similar to the case of miRNAs. miRNAs are processed from their precursors by DCL1 and predominantly have a 5' U. They are specifically loaded into AGO1 that has the highest binding affinity to 5' U sRNAs. Thus, sRNA precursor, DCLs and AGOs may have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of small RNA pathways.</p><p>6. The authors introduced that 23-nt siRNAs function as passenger strands to specify loading of 24-nt siRNAs into AGO4 (The third paragraph of the introduction and Singh et al., 2019, Mol Cell). What happens when 24-nt siRNAs are produced from both strands (Dicing Scenario 2 in Figure 7)? Which strand is loaded into AGO4?</p><p>7. The authors claimed that &quot;diversifying the size of siRNAs derived from a given precursor allows maximal siRNA coverage at methylated target loci&quot; (abstract). However, 23-nt siRNAs are not loaded into AGO4, as introduced by the authors, and may not direct DNA methylation.</p><p>8. Page 3, line 36, the cited reference showed that AGO4 is required for DNA methylation, but did not show its association with 24-nt siRNAs. The papers showing their association should be cited.</p><p>9. Page 3, line 41, He et al., 2009, Cell 137:498 should be also cited.</p><p>10. Figure 7, &quot;Pol transcripts tend to initiate with A or G&quot; should be &quot;Pol IV transcripts&quot;?</p><p>11. Page 18, line 495, &quot;0.5 M EDTA (8.0)&quot; should be &quot;0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)&quot;, the letters &quot;pH&quot; are missing for most of the buffers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no major comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A DCL3 dicing code within Pol IV-RDR2 transcripts diversifies the siRNA pool guiding RNA-directed DNA methylation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, please consider the comments of Reviewer #2 below to decide if the manuscript could be further improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am grateful that the authors have addressed most of my comments. Two concerns remain.</p><p>1) In Figure 4C, Figure 5 and Figure 5-supplement 1, no excess amounts of dsRNA substrates were added.</p><p>2) Discussion on the importance of the PolIV/RDR2/DCL3 specificity of making 5' A siRNA and AGO4 binding preference for 5' A siRNAs. I think that these two mechanisms are equally important for ensuring the efficiency and specificity of RdDM. I would suggest rewrite the whole paragraph as follows.</p><p>&quot;We have shown that Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts most frequently begin with adenosine (Singh et al. 2019) and our current study shows that DCL3 preferentially dices substrates with A at their 5' ends. Thus Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 activities could collectively lead to the production of 5'-A-enriched siRNAs. Interestingly, a previous finding indicated that 24 nt siRNAs initiated with a 5' A are preferentially associated with AGO4 (Mi et al. 2008). This suggest that the initiation (production of 5' A siRNAs) and effector (specific binding to AGO4 that preferably accepts 5' A siRNAs) stages of RdDM have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of siRNA function&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73260.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that DCL3 activity does not require ATP should be revised or supported by further data.

Following a third wash step without ATP, we then incubated the immobilized DCL3 with the enzyme Apyrase, which hydrolyzes ATP to AMP and inorganic phosphate. We demonstrate the activity of the Apyrase by confirming its hydrolysis of ATP using thin-layer chromatography in (Figure 5—figure supplement 2, panel A). In panel B of that supplemental figure, we also show that Apyrase addition prevents the end-labeling of an RNA by gamma-labeled <sup>32</sup>P-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Using the Apyrase-treated DCL3, we then performed a dicing assay using a five-fold molar excess of substrate dsRNA (25 nM) over DCL3 (5 nM), as suggested by reviewer 2, in the presence of either 5 mM ATP, 0 mM ATP, or 5 mM ATP-γ-S, a non-hydrolysable form of ATP. We also included shorter timepoints than in the experiment shown in the initial version of the manuscript. Because of substrate is present in 5-fold molar excess, complete dicing requires that each DCL3 protein carry out multiple dicing reactions. Thus, if ATP is required for DCL3 activity then in the absence of ATP or the presence of 5 mM ATP-γ-S we should see a significant inhibition of dicing relative to dicing in the presence of ATP. However, ATP has no discernible effect on dicing, using substrates with either blunt ends (new Figure 5A) or 3’ overhanging ends (new Figure 5B), confirming that ATP is not required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The conclusion that Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 sequence preferences can account for the spectrum of sRNA bound to AGO4 should be revised or further supported.

The authors conclude that Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 sequence preferences can account for the spectrum of sRNA bound to AGO4. Would it not make as much (or more?) sense if AGO4 also has binding preferences for the types of sRNA produced by Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3, which would enhance specificity within the RdDM pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion section to state that AGO4 may have co-evolved to prefer 24 nt siRNAs that initiate with a 5’ A, which are enriched as a consequence of Pol IV initiating nucleotide choice and preferential DCL3 dicing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following comments should be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Measurement of binding affinity of DCL3 to different types of dsRNA substrates (Figure 1C, Figure 4A, C) by EMSA or other methods will strengthen the conclusions drawn from the dicing assays.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that we do not attempt to separate substrate binding from substrate cleavage, but our tests of dicing involve the combination of the two.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. More time points between 30 sec and 5 min are suggested to be assayed with excessive amounts of substrates and initial processing rates can be calculated to measure the activity of DCL3 with different substrates (Figure 4A-C) or at different conditions (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>In the new experiments of new Figure 5, we now include 1 minute, 5 minute and ten minute timepoints and use substrate in five-fold molar excess over enzyme (25 nM dsRNA:5 nM DCL3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For Figure 5, in addition to repeating the experiment with more time points in the presence of excessive amounts of substrates, increasing amounts of ATP can be added to the reactions to test whether the addition of ATP increase the dicing activity. To exclude the possibility that DCL3 prep was contaminated with cellular ATP during protein purification, DCL3 protein can be treated with hexokinase to deplete ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this possibility as discussed above, as essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Page 9, line 214, &quot;monophosphates or triphosphates are similarly conducive to DCL3 engagement&quot;. It appears to me that monophosphate is more conducive to DCL3 engagement than triphosphate as more 16-nt products are produced when the bottom strand has a 5' monophosphate (Figure 4C, lane 5 and lane 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to write “similar” rather than “equivalent” because it is true that monophosphates appear to be slightly preferred over triphosphates, but the difference is small when compared to the dicing of a substrate with a hydroxyl group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the discussion (page 14, line 371-377), the authors suggest that the selectivity of 5'A siRNAs by AGO4 needs to be reconsidered. The authors stated that Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts most frequently begin with adenosine (Singh et al., 2019) and DCL3 preferentially dices substrates with A (actually A or U as shown in Figure 4A) at their 5' ends, and thus Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 activities can collectively account for much of the 5' A-bias among siRNAs that become loaded into AGO4, independent of AGO4-mediated selection. I think that this statement needs to be reconsidered for the following reasons: (a) RDR2 initiates from 1-2 nt internal to PolIV transcript ends and it appears to me that there are no direct evidence that RDR2 transcripts predominantly start with an A, if RDR2 transcripts do not have a 5' A, the siRNAs produced via right-side dicing cannot be loaded into AGO4 due to its selectivity;</p><p>(b) even if all siRNAs produced by Pol IV-RDR2-DCL3 have a 5' A, this only suggests that the initiation (production of 5' A siRNAs) and effector (specific binding to AGO4 that preferably accepts 5' A siRNAs) stages of RdDM have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of siRNA function. This is very similar to the case of miRNAs. miRNAs are processed from their precursors by DCL1 and predominantly have a 5' U. They are specifically loaded into AGO1 that has the highest binding affinity to 5' U sRNAs. Thus, sRNA precursor, DCLs and AGOs may have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of small RNA pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Discussion as suggested, and as discussed previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors introduced that 23-nt siRNAs function as passenger strands to specify loading of 24-nt siRNAs into AGO4 (The third paragraph of the introduction and Singh et al., 2019, Mol Cell). What happens when 24-nt siRNAs are produced from both strands (Dicing Scenario 2 in Figure 7)? Which strand is loaded into AGO4?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question for which we currently do not know the answer. It is possible that the choice is random when two 24s are paired.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors claimed that &quot;diversifying the size of siRNAs derived from a given precursor allows maximal siRNA coverage at methylated target loci&quot; (abstract). However, 23-nt siRNAs are not loaded into AGO4, as introduced by the authors, and may not direct DNA methylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that 24s and 23s can be made from either strand, with 23s proposed to serve as passenger strands that ensure the AGO4 loading of the paired 24 nt RNA. By loading 24s matching each strand, resulting AGO4-siRNAs can pair with Pol V transcripts transcribed from either strand of the DNA at a target locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Two concerns remain.</p><p>1) In Figure 4C, Figure 5 and Figure 5-supplement 1, no excess amounts of dsRNA substrates were added.</p><p>2) Discussion on the importance of the PolIV/RDR2/DCL3 specificity of making 5' A siRNA and AGO4 binding preference for 5' A siRNAs. I think that these two mechanisms are equally important for ensuring the efficiency and specificity of RdDM. I would suggest rewrite the whole paragraph as follows.</p><p>&quot;We have shown that Pol IV and RDR2 transcripts most frequently begin with adenosine (Singh et al. 2019) and our current study shows that DCL3 preferentially dices substrates with A at their 5' ends. Thus Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 activities could collectively lead to the production of 5'-A-enriched siRNAs. Interestingly, a previous finding indicated that 24 nt siRNAs initiated with a 5' A are preferentially associated with AGO4 (Mi et al. 2008). This suggest that the initiation (production of 5' A siRNAs) and effector (specific binding to AGO4 that preferably accepts 5' A siRNAs) stages of RdDM have co-evolved to achieve the specificity of siRNA function&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In the text, I fixed a few typographical errors and punctuation errors, fixed one reference (Fukudome et al) that only had the journal volume number, and added one sentence to the discussion that is relevant to the final suggestion made by reviewer #2. It is the final sentence of this paragraph:</p><p>“Another prior finding in need of reconsideration is the observation that 24 nt siRNAs associated with AGO4 tend to begin with a 5’ adenosine (Mi et al. 2008), a finding that has been interpreted as evidence that AGO4 actively selects siRNAs that begin with an adenosine. […] Thus Pol IV, RDR2 and DCL3 activities could collectively account for much of the 5’ A-enrichment among siRNAs that become loaded into AGO4. Consistent with this interpretation, 24 nt RNAs that have a 5’ A, U, C or G are assimilated into AGO4 with similar efficiency in vitro (Feng Wang and C Pikaard, unpublished).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
