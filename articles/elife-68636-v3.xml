in G2 during larval life and rekindle a mitotic program subsequently. G2 arrest is dependent on ataxia telangiectasia mutated and rad3-related kinase (ATR)-dependent phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that is actuated in the absence of detectable DNA damage. We are interested in the mechanisms that activate ATR/Chk1 (Kizhedathu et al., 2018; Kizhedathu et al., 2020). Here we report that levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high in arrested tracheoblasts and decrease upon mitotic re-entry. High ROS is dependent on expression of Duox, an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating dual oxidase. ROS quenching by overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1, or by knockdown of Duox, abolishes Chk1 phosphorylation and results in precocious proliferation. Tracheae deficient in Duox, or deficient in both Duox and regulators of DNA damage-dependent ATR/Chk1 activation (ATRIP/TOPBP1/claspin), can induce phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to micromolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in minutes. The findings presented reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates ATR/Chk1 in tracheoblasts by a non-canonical, potentially direct, mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila tracheoblasts</italic></kwd><kwd>G2 arrest</kwd><kwd>ATR</kwd><kwd>Chk1/grapes</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>Duox</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>inStem Core Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guha</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reactive oxygen species can activate the ATR/Chk1 pathway in the absence of detectable DNA damage and without a requirement for DNA damage response proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and rad3-related kinase (ATR, <italic>Mei-41</italic>) and its substrate, checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1, <italic>Grapes</italic>), are essential for DNA damage repair and for normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artus and Cohen-Tannoudji, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>). The mechanism by which ATR phosphorylates and activates Chk1 in response to DNA damage and the mechanism by which activated Chk1 induces cell cycle arrest have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu and Leffak, 2010</xref>). In contrast, the mechanisms for the activation of ATR/Chk1 during development, and the roles of these proteins therein, are less well understood. We reported recently that the ATR/Chk1 axis is co-opted during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development for inducing G2 arrest in progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kizhedathu et al., 2020</xref>). The current study was designed to shed light on the mechanism by which the pathway is activated in this context and to probe if it is distinct from the mechanism for DNA damage-induced activation.</p><p>The progenitors of the adult tracheal (respiratory) system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remain mitotically quiescent through larval life and rekindle cell divisions at the onset of pupariation. Progenitors of the tracheal branches of the second thoracic metamere (Tr2, hereafter referred to as tracheoblasts) are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle for ~56 hr and divide thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djabrayan et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, we have shown previously that G2 arrest in tracheoblasts is dependent on ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1. Two aspects of this process are striking and merit mention here. First, arrested tracheoblasts phosphorylate Chk1 (phosphorylated Chk1 [pChk1]) in the absence of detectable DNA damage. Second, Chk1 is upregulated by a Wnt signaling-dependent mechanism in arrested tracheoblasts and high levels of Chk1 expression are necessary to induce arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kizhedathu et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of detectable DNA damage, the mechanism for the activation of ATR/Chk1 pathway in tracheoblasts has been unclear from the studies so far.</p><p>Although ATR and the related kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-PK are the principal sensors of DNA damage and effectors of the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durocher and Jackson, 2001</xref>), there is evidence that these kinases can also be activated by non-canonical mechanisms that are not dependent on DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a group of oxygen-derived small molecules that interact avidly with macromolecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and alter their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corcoran and Cotter, 2013</xref>). Pertinently, there is evidence that ROS can directly activate ATM by stabilizing ATM homodimers through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). ROS-activated ATM can phosphorylate and activate substrates like checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). Whether ROS can activate ATR in the same manner is not known. There is evidence that ROS can activate ATR and lead to Chk1 phosphorylation via the induction of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Srinivas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willis et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study has shown that mechanical stress on the nuclear envelope, arising during DNA replication (S phase) or in response to osmotic stress or mechanical stimulation, can lead to ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). This implies that ATR can also be activated by a non-canonical mechanism.</p><p>ROS are now generally recognized as important regulators of developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The regulation of ROS levels in cells during development is orchestrated by altering rates of aerobic respiration in cells or by altering the levels of expression of ROS-producing enzymes like NADPH oxidases (NOXs). Interestingly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes two NADPH oxidases â NOX and dual oxidase (Duox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Lee, 2014</xref>) â and one of these, Duox, is expressed at high levels in the larval tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2013</xref> ). Duox catalyzes the oxidation of NADPH, leading to the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedard and Krause, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiszt et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our interest in the mechanism for activation of ATR/Chk1 led us to probe the role of ROS in this context. We found that ROS levels are high when the cells are arrested in G2 and low after the cells rekindle cell division. We quenched ROS in tracheoblasts via overexpression of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) to find that the cells started dividing precociously in a manner similar to Chk1 mutants. These findings led us to probe the role of Duox in the regulation of ROS and the mechanism by which ROS regulate the ATR/Chk1 axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High ROS is required for G2 arrest in larval tracheoblasts</title><p>The cells that comprise the tracheal branches of the second thoracic metamere (Tr2) of the larvae are differentiated adult progenitors that contribute to the development of pupal and adult tracheal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djabrayan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>). The cells that make up the dorsal trunk (DT) in Tr2, hereafter referred to as tracheoblasts, are the focus of our studies.

Analysis of the cell cycle phasing of tracheoblasts using the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>) has shown that the cells are in the G1 phase at the time the embryo hatches into a larva and that the cells transition from G1 to S to G2 in the first larval instar (L1). Tracheoblasts remain in G2 from the second larval instar (L2) till mid third larval instar (L3) (32â40 hr L3, ~56 hr) and divide rapidly thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kizhedathu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) activation and G2 arrest in tracheoblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of the third instar larva showing the dorsal trunk (DT) of the second thoracic metamere (Tr2, colored in green and marked by dashed line).

SOD1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that scavenges ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackney et al., 2014</xref>). We overexpressed SOD1 in trachea (<italic>btl-GAL4/UAS-SOD1,</italic> hereafter <italic>btl-SOD1</italic>) and examined the effects of SOD1 overexpression on ROS levels by H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA and DHE staining.

We counted the number of cells in Tr2 DT at L2, 0â8 hr L3, 16â24 hr L3, 32â40 hr L3, and wandering L3 (WL3) and quantified the frequencies of phospho-histone H3<sup>+</sup> (pH3<sup>+</sup>) mitotic figures in Tr2 DT at L2, 0â8 hr L3, and 16â24 hr L3. Analysis of the cell numbers and frequency of pH3<sup>+</sup> figures in Tr2 showed that SOD1 overexpression resulted in precocious cell division from 0 to 8 hr L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>, n â¥ 7 tracheae per timepoint, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>).

Second, we scored the frequencies of nuclear foci of RPA70, a protein that binds single-strand DNA breaks. To validate nuclear 8-oxodG as a marker of oxidative damage in tracheoblasts, tracheae from L2 larvae were dissected and treated ex vivo with different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 Î¼M, 500 Î¼M, and 1 mM) for 30 min and stained with an antibody against 8-oxodG.

An aspect of the 8-oxodG staining in tracheal cells merits mention here.

Breaks in DNA that are bound by single-strand DNA-binding proteins like RPA-1/RPA-70 recruit ATR via its partner ATRIP and, in turn, TOPBP1.

In this regard, both kinases are thought to serve as guardians of genomic integrity and loss of either is associated with increased genomic instability and catastrophic cell death. Our studies in the tracheal system reveal a different facet of ATR/Chk1 function . We have shown previously that the pathway is required to arrest tracheal progenitor cells in G2 and that the activation of ATR/Chk1 occurs in the absence of any detectable DNA damage. The findings presented here demonstrate that Duox-generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is required for the activation of ATR/Chk1 axis in this context (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). We discuss below the possible mechanisms by which ROS can activate ATR/Chk1, how ROS levels are regulated during tracheal development, and the clinical implication of the findings.</p><p>The precedence for ROS-based activation of PIKK-family kinases like ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK was set by studies on ATM. The formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between cysteine residues located at the C-terminus of ATM was found to be essential for ATM homodimerization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). The structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATR is not known, but the structure of human ATR in complex with ATRIP has been determined by cryoEM and the human ATR-ATRIP complex has been shown to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). Using SWISS-MODEL and the kinase domain of human ATR as template, we modeled the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATR monomer (the sequence range modeled was 855â2517, which has 33.6% sequence identity to human ATR). A model for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATR dimer was subsequently generated using the human ATR-ATRIP complex as the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guex et al., 2009</xref>). This model shows that there are no exposed cysteines that are close enough to form intermolecular disulfide bridges. Thus, there is a possibility that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> regulates ATR in a different way than what has been proposed for ATM. The possibility that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can directly activate ATR by other mechanisms seems likely. ROS can alter kinase activity either by modifying cysteine residues at or near the active site or more broadly, leading to conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corcoran and Cotter, 2013</xref>). As indicated in the Introduction, ATR can be activated in response to mechanical stress by a mechanism that is likely to be dependent on ATRIP. Although our studies show that activation of ATR/Chk1 by ROS does not require ATRIP, future experiments will investigate all possibilities for non-canonical activation. ATR aside, ROS may also regulate Chk1 activation by modifying Chk1 in some manner or via recruitment of other factors (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of the effects of ATR/Chk1 knockdown and SOD1 overexpression/Duox knockdown suggests that there may be other (ROS-independent) mechanisms for the non-canonical activation of ATR/Chk1. We have shown that loss of either ATR or Chk1 leads to slow rate of cell division post mitotic reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>). Since there is no evidence for any DNA damage post-mitotic re-entry and the knockdown of ATRIP, TOPBP1, and claspin does not recapitulate the ATR/Chk1 mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>, n â¥ 7 tracheae per timepoint), the mechanism for the activation of ATR/Chk1 post-mitotic re-entry is unclear. Interestingly, neither the overexpression of SOD1 nor the knockdown of Duox recapitulates the mitotic defect observed in ATR/Chk1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>). This suggests that there are other non-canonical-mechanisms of ATR/Chk1 activation that are relevant to the roles of these kinases during development.</p><p>How are ROS levels regulated during development? Analysis of Duox mRNA levels in tracheoblasts shows that expression is high in L2 and early L3 and drops significantly at 32â40 hr L3. This parallels the expression of Chk1. We have previously shown that the levels of Chk1 mRNA are regulated transcriptionally by the Wnt signaling pathway. We determined whether Wnt signaling also regulates Duox expression and ROS levels. This analysis showed that ROS levels are unaffected in Wnt pathway mutants (data not shown). We infer that Wnt signaling pathway does not regulate Duox nor ROS levels. Juvenile hormone (JH) has been shown to act as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in tracheae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djabrayan et al., 2016</xref>). Pertinently, the levels of JH are high in L2 and early L3 and drop mid L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubrovsky, 2005</xref>). Thus, the timecourse of JH levels parallels the timecourses of both Duox and Chk1 expression. Future experiments will test the possibility that JH signaling in trachea regulates Duox expression and potentially Wnt signaling/Chk1 expression as well.</p><p>The possibility that ROS can activate ATR/Chk1 without inducing DNA damage may be clinically relevant. It has been reported that ovarian cancer cells that express high levels of Duox1 and high levels of activated Chk1 are relatively Cisplatin-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). The authors suggest that high levels of Chk1 activation are critical for chemoresistance and that the high levels of Chk1 activation are likely the result of ROS-generated DNA damage. The findings presented here suggest that high ROS may independently activate Chk1 and contribute toward chemoresistance. Along the same lines, cancer cells that have high levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singh et al., 2020</xref>) and an active DNA damage repair pathway have been shown to be relatively radioresistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsubhi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Here again, the enhanced radioresistance has been attributed to ROS-dependent DNA damage priming of the DNA damage response. We suggest that the ROS-based activation of ATR/Chk1 activation evidenced here may also contribute toward the observed chemo-/radioresistance of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type(species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>btl-GAL4</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shiga et al., 1996</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB: FBtp0001208</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This line was a gift from Dr. Shigeo Hayashi</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-Chk1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VDRC</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">110076</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-Chk1<sup>S373D</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Please see Materials and methods for a detailed description.

Tyramide signal amplification was performed as per the manufacturerâs recommendations for pChk1 detection. The following reagents were used as part of this protocol: tyramide amplification buffer and tyramide reagent (Thermo Fisher), vectastain A and B (Vector Labs), and biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2340593">AB_2340593</ext-link>). Tracheal preparations were flat-mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and imaged on Zeiss LSM-780 laser-scanning confocal microscopes. All images were taken by adjusting the parameters (gain and laser power) such that there is no saturation in the positive control images.

Images were processed using ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). For quantification of cell number, fixed specimens were mounted in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI and the number of nuclei was counted from images collected with an Olympus BX 53 microscope.

Two well-known tumor suppressor genes, ATR and Chk1, are shown to have a new function in sensing oxidative stress agents. The identification of ROS as a developmental regulator of ATR activation is likely to be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Duox generated reactive oxygen species activate ATR/Chk1 to induce G2 arrest in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheoblasts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Amin S. Ghabrial as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Greg Beitel (Reviewer #2); Bruce A Edgar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Results</p><p>1) A number of key results are supported by photo-micrographs, with only one example shown. Quantify results for: Figure 1B-I, Figure 2F, Figure 5B-I. Also, concerns have been raised about the significance of some results&quot; &quot;The significance of the cell cycle changes shown is quite weak (*p&lt;.05; Figure 1JK, 2GH). The same is true for the Duox mRNA measurements (Figure 2A).&quot; These experiments should have a higher n, which may raise the p value, and the authors should also consider showing all their data using dot plots with mean and error whiskers rather than bars.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>2) H2DCFDA and DHE staining look different in the images shown, as the former appears to be from a glancing section and the latter a section that reveals the tube lumen. For non-specialists an explanation is needed in the figure legends, or better yet, comparable sections should be shown.</p><p>3) &quot;Levels of H2DCFDA and DHE were found to be significantly lower in Btl- SOD1 expressing animals compared to controls (Figure 1 H-I, compare with Figure 1 B, E, n â¥ 6 tracheae per condition per experiment, n = 3).&quot;</p><p>For Figure 1H and I, the stage examined has been moved above the panels, resulting in two of three reviewers concluding that stage examined was not described. Move the L2 label to the side as in B-G and also add this information to the figure legend.</p><p>4) The diameter of the tube and the nuclei shown in H, I appear much larger than in wild type L2 (1B). Does SOD1 overexpression alter tracheal size? Scale bar in 1H appears slightly longer than in 1B, so images can't be directly compared; however, both scale bars are 10 microns and the difference in size doesn't seem to be fully accounted for by difference in magnification. It would be helpful if images, especially of the same developmental stages, are shown at the same scale.</p><p>5) Should not the control late L3 have significantly more cell numbers than the early L3 or L2 as the cells re-enter mitosis? The number of animals checked should be more (at least 10 for each condition for better statistical confidence). Since the authors see a precocious mitotic re-entry of the tracheoblasts at 16-24h L3 time point, a corresponding imaging assay for the H2DCFDA/DHE in the control versus btl-SOD1 animals would have helped support the inverse association between ROS levels and mitotic re-entry.</p><p>&quot;Analysis of the frequencies of cells and pH3+ figures showed that SOD1 overexpression resulted in precocious cell division from 0-8 h L3 (Figure 1 J, K, n {greater than or equal to} 7 tracheae per timepoint, Figure 1 â Source data 1,2). &quot;</p><p>For the 0-8 hr timepoint, how many PH3 nuclei are observed? If n is approximately 7 trachea, it is not clear that more than a single PH3 nucleus is observed at the 0-8 hr timepointâ¦</p><p>6) In Figure 1 J-L, if pChk1 activity is reduced in L2 in btl-SOD1 condition, shouldn't we expect greater cell numbers or higher pH3+ cell frequency than the control in L2 or early L3?</p><p>Figure 1, Supplement 1:</p><p>7) It is hard to evaluate the mitochondrial data since it is not stated what the ratio would be if there is no or low ROS. Authors show a dramatic decrease from L2 to L3 and state that this differs from cytoplasmic ROS dynamics based on the presence of detectable ROS in early L3 that becomes undetectable by the time that cell are released from G2 arrest. Not clear that mitochondrial data could not be consistent with the observed change in cell cycle behavior.</p><p>The authors should clarify and comment.</p><p>Does sod1 overexpression alter mitochondrial ROS?</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>8) In Figure 2A, since the authors claim that differential effects of SOD1 starts earlier at 16-24hrs, they should show results for the Duox mRNA changes at this time point too.</p><p>9) In Figure 2B-E, exact time points for the images should be mentioned.</p><p>10) Figure 2F, there is an image duplication. The control images for Figure 1L and 2F are the same. Considering the time sensitivity of the results, each experiment should have an independent, paired control group.</p><p>11) Figure 2G, H and others. &quot;Tr2 Cell Number&quot; would be more informative than &quot;Cell number&quot;</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>12) The results in Figure 3D suggest that reduction in ROS levels leads to precocious mitotic re-entry, independent of Chk1 mRNA level. Since low ROS is associated with low pChk1 (Figure 1L), increased Chk1 mRNA levels should not matter because there is no increased ATR activity. A better experiment to show novel ATR/Chk1 regulation by ROS would have been to increase or decrease ATR levels in btl-DuoxRNAi or btl-Duox conditions.</p><p>The listed genotype for &quot;Btl-Duox[RNAi] Chk1&quot; looks like it has an unspecified Chk1 mutation rather than UAS-Chk1 overexpression. Clearer alternatives include &quot;Btl-Duox[RNAi], Btl-Chck1&quot; or &quot;Btl Gal4: UAS-Duox[RNAi] UAS-Chk1&quot;.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>13) In Figure 4E-H, the exact time range should be mentioned.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>14) &quot;Interestingly, there is evidence that these kinases can also be activated by non-canonical mechanisms that are not dependent on DNA damage (Guo et al., 2010)&quot; â this citation discusses just ROS, not other mechanisms.

Some of these should be cited and discussed in the context of the work in this study â for example &quot;APE2 is required for ATR-Chk1 checkpoint activation in response to oxidative stress&quot; by Willis et al.</p><p>16) The introduction seems to ignore existing literature about the mechanisms of G2 arrest and mitotic re-entry of the tracheoblasts in the Tr2 metamere. Relevant literature (e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.043) should have been discussed for a comprehensive state of the art of the field.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>17) The authors do not provide any data or discussion relevant to how Duox activity is developmentally regulated. This interesting point should be addressed, if not with experimental data, then at least with some discussion of potential mechanisms.</p><p>18) In addition, the authors should note in their conclusions and the discussion that these effects on the cell cycle are partial (i.e. the timing and amount of cell cycle re-activation is only mildly affected by Duox-RNAi or Chk-RNAi).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Duox generated reactive oxygen species activate ATR/Chk1 to induce G2 arrest in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheoblasts&quot; Kizhedathu and colleagues follow up on their previous findings that G2 arrest of larval tracheoblasts depends on phosphorylation of Chk1 downstream of ATR activation. Previous work showed that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 was occurring in the absence of DNA damage, raising the question of how ATR activity was controlled in this developmental context. The authors report here that G2 arrested tracheoblasts show high levels of ROS, which decrease as the cells initiate active cycling. They determine that high ROS is required for Chk1 phosphorylation and G2 arrest, and that ROS levels are dependent upon hydrogen peroxide production by Duox. The work establishes a novel mechanism for the developmental regulation of ATR-Chk1.</p><p>The authors first investigate the presence of ROS in tracheoblasts during larval life. They determine that ROS levels are elevated during stages when tracheoblasts are arrested in G2 and decline at about the point that cells re-enter the cell cycle. They demonstrate that ROS levels are relevant to G2 arrest by showing that overexpression of sod can reduce ROS and induce premature re-entry.</p><p>Authors next turn to the source of ROS generation in tracheoblasts. They examine duox as a candidate given that it produces hydrogen peroxide and was previously described to be expressed at high levels in trachea. They examine duox mRNA at different larval stages by qPCR and find that expression correlates with ROS levels. Knockdown of duox by RNAi resulted in decreased ROS, decreased pChk1 and premature re-entry.</p><p>To determine how ROS/duox regulate pChk1, authors tested whether Wnt expression, which acts on Chk1 at the transcriptional level, was affected; it was not. Likewise, ATR transcript levels were not affected. Overexpression of Chk1 could not rescue G2 arrest in the absence of ROS. Authors tested whether ROS levels were associated with DNA damage, as that would fit canonical ATR activation. Any DNA damage was below the threshold of detection. Because DNA damage-induced activation of ATR/Chk1 requires known co-factors, the authors were also able to genetically test a requirement for the DNA damage-sensing pathway in the developmental activation of ATR/CHK1. They found that knockdown of ATRIP, TOPBP1, and Claspin were able to block Î³-radiation induced pChk, but not ROS induced pChk in tracheoblasts. Authors also showed that exposure to hydrogen peroxide can induce pChk in the absence of Duox, but not in the absence of ATR. The authors also show that the kinetics of Chk phosphorylation in response to ROS is much more rapid than in response to DNA damage.</p><p>Overall, this study makes a valuable advance on the prior work. I favor publication subsequent to addressing the following issues:</p><p>Introduction: &quot;Interestingly, there is evidence that these kinases can also be activated by non-canonical mechanisms that are not dependent on DNA damage (Guo et al., 2010)&quot; â this citation discusses just ROS, not other mechanisms. If there are other mechanisms in addition ROS, authors should include them and the appropriate citations.</p><p>Also, there is considerable literature that supports ROS activation of ATR, although perhaps as part of a DNA damage response. Some of these should be cited and discussed in the context of the work in this study â for example &quot;APE2 is required for ATR-Chk1 checkpoint activation in response to oxidative stress&quot; by Willis et al.</p><p>&quot;Taken together, the analysis of ROS reporters showed that dynamics of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS are different. Pertinently, these studies showed that dynamics of cytoplasmic ROS paralleled G2 arrest and mitotic re-entry.&quot; Does sod1 overexpression alter mitochondrial ROS?</p><p>H2DCFDA and DHE staining look different in the images shown, as the former appears to be from a glancing section and the latter a section that reveals the tube lumen. For non-specialists an explanation is needed in the figure legends, or alternatively, comparable sections should be shown.</p><p>&quot;Levels of H2DCFDA and DHE were found to be significantly lower in Btl- SOD1 expressing animals compared to controls (Figure 1 H-I, compare with Figure 1 B, E, n {greater than or equal to} 6 tracheae per condition per experiment, n = 3).&quot; Neither the text nor the figure legends specify what stage is shown in H and I. The implication is that L2 larvae are shown given the comparison to B and E; however, the diameter of the tube in H, I appears consistent with L3. Authors must specify the stage shown and account for why the tube size appears off â I note that the scale bars are 10 microns in both images and that the bar is slightly larger in H, I; this may account for some of the differenceâ¦</p><p>It is hard to evaluate the mitochondrial data since it is not stated what the ratio would be if there is no or low ROS. Authors show a dramatic decrease from L2 to L3 and state that this differs from cytoplasmic ROS dynamics based on the presence of detectable ROS in early L3 that becomes undetectable by the time that cell are released from G2 arrest. Not clear that mitochondrial data could not be consistent with the observed change in cell cycle behavior.</p><p>&quot;Analysis of the frequencies of cells and pH3+ figures showed that SOD1 overexpression resulted in precocious cell division from 0-8 h L3 (Figure 1 J, K, n â¥ 7 tracheae per timepoint, Figure 1 â Source data 1,2).&quot; For the 0-8 hr timepoint, how many PH3 nuclei are observed? If n is approximately 7 trachea, it is not clear that more than a single PH3 nucleus is observed at the 0-8 hr timepointâ¦</p><p>&quot;the mechanism for the activation of ATR/Chk1 post mitotic re-entry is also non-canonical. &quot; This section needs more explanation. As I understand it, the observation is that btl&gt;chk1 RNAi cells, after precocious re-entry, begin to cycle more slowly as compared to btl&gt;sod1 overexpressing cells. However, it is not clear to me that this reflects another requirement for ATR/pChk. So far as I am aware the authors have not shown post-re-entry pChk1 staining or made clear why they think the difference between the two isn't due to an as yet unappreciated role of ROS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>All figures. The authors should check <italic>eLife</italic> policy on use of simple bar and error whiskers in graphs ( I haven't looked at that), but the authors are encouraged to show all their data using dot plots with mean and error whiskers rather than bars.</p><p>The authors use 100 Î¼m exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to rescue the Duox phenotype. Is this a relevant level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? The authors should indicate how this compares to the normal intracellular levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (or equivalent reactive species), and how it compares to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels used in ROS sensing pathways in typical experiments in this area? Some context for the reader would be very helpful.</p><p>The methods need to state that panels that show no signal were imaged using the same settings as the controls that did show an image. E.g. Figure 1B, C vs Figure 1 D,H.</p><p>For data in Figure 2, the authors are encouraged to quantify the degree of knockdown of Duox by the two RNAi lines to determine how sensitive the pathway is to Duox levels. For example, if knockdown is only 75%, this will underscore the importance of the pathway.</p><p>The blue &quot;DAPI&quot; label is invisible in many figures. The red pChk1 is frequently hard to read too. The authors are encouraged to use a white background behind the lettering as they did for Figure 4 B and Figure 4 Supplement 1.</p><p>P 5, paragraph 1, line 7.

Clearer alternatives include &quot;Btl-Duox[RNAi], Btl-Chck1&quot; or &quot;Btl Gal4: UAS-Duox[RNAi] UAS-Chk1&quot;.</p><p>In several cases, it would be helpful for the authors to better label their figures so the reader didn't have to dig into the legend to understand the figure.

What dye or fluorescent marker is this?</p><p>Figure 2G, H and others. &quot;Tr2 Cell Number&quot; would be more informative than &quot;Cell number&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper is a continuation of two related works on the same topic, from the same authors, also published in e<italic>Life</italic> (2018, 2020). The previous papers show the roles of ATR and WNT, but do not address ROS or Duox. While this new paper is generally convincing, it has some technical and presentational weaknesses that should be addressed in order to bring it up to accepted standards for this experimental system and field. These are described below.</p><p>1. A number of key results are supported by photo-micrographs, with only one example shown. These results should be quantified from multiple samples, and the data presented in graphical form with standard deviations and p values (in addition to the pictorial examples, which are quite good). Experiments that should quantified include: (1) Figure 1B-I (H2DCFDA, DHE); (2) Figure 2F (pChk1); (3) Figure 5B-I (pChk1).</p><p>2. The significance of the cell cycle changes shown is quite weak (*p&lt;.05; Figure 1JK, 2GH). The same is true for the Duox mRNA measurements (Figure 2A). These experiments should be repeated so as to have enough samples to derive p values of &lt;.001. In addition, the authors should note in their conclusions and the discussion that these effects on the cell cycle are partial (i.e. the timing and amount of cell cycle re-activation is only mildly affected by Duox-RNAi or Chk-RNAi).</p><p>3. The authors do not provide any data or discussion relevant to how Duox activity is developmentally regulated. This interesting point should be addressed, if not with experimental data, then at least with some discussion of potential mechanisms.</p><p>4. The introduction seems to ignore existing literature about the mechanisms of G2 arrest and mitotic re-entry of the tracheoblasts in the Tr2 metamere. Relevant literature (e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.043) should have been discussed for a comprehensive state of the art of the field.</p><p>5. In Figure 1 H, it is not clear at which stage the image was taken.</p><p>6. In Figure 1J, the numbers for WL3 stage do not really add any value in this graph. The WL3 numbers skew the graph and obscure the differences in the earlier stages, which the authors emphasize. Should not the control late L3 have significantly more cell numbers than the early L3 or L2 as the cells re-enter mitosis? The number of animals checked should be more (at least 10 for each condition for better statistical confidence). Since the authors see a precocious mitotic re-entry of the tracheoblasts at 16-24h L3 time point, a corresponding imaging assay for the H2DCFDA/DHE in the control versus btl-SOD1 animals would have helped support the inverse association between ROS levels and mitotic re-entry.</p><p>7. In Figure 1 L, if pChk1 activity is reduced in L2 in btl-SOD1 condition, shouldn't we expect greater cell numbers or higher pH3+ cell frequency than the control in L2 or early L3?</p><p>8. In Figure 2A, since the authors claim that differential effects of SOD1 starts earlier at 16-24hrs, they should show results for the Duox mRNA changes at this time point too.</p><p>9. In Figure 2B-E, exact time points for the images should be mentioned.</p><p>10. Figure 2F, there is an image duplication. The control images for Figure 1L and 2F are the same. Considering the time sensitivity of the results, each experiment should have an independent, paired control group.</p><p>11. The results in Figure 3D suggest that reduction in ROS levels leads to precocious mitotic re-entry, independent of Chk1 mRNA level. Since low ROS is associated with low pChk1 (Figure 1L), increased Chk1 mRNA levels should not matter because there is no increased ATR activity. A better experiment to show novel ATR/Chk1 regulation by ROS would have been to increase or decrease ATR levels in btl-DuoxRNAi or btl-Duox conditions.</p><p>12. In Figure 4E-H, the exact time range should be mentioned.</p><p>13. In Figure 5J, the model should reflect the fact the authors have not yet identified a direct mechanism for ROS-mediated ATR/Chk1 regulation. Use of a dotted line would be better. It could also be helpful to speculate about the developmental regulation of Duox (and Wnt) here in the figure, if the authors have a suggested mechanism for their regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68636.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Results</p><p>1) A number of key results are supported by photo-micrographs, with only one example shown.

Analysis of Duox mRNA levels in tracheoblasts shows that expression is high in L2 and early L3 and drops significantly at 32-40 h L3. This parallels the expression of Chk1. We have previously shown that the levels of Chk1 mRNA are regulated transcriptionally by the Wnt signallng pathway. We determined whether Wnt signalling also regulates Duox expression and ROS levels. This analysis showed that ROS levels are unaffected in Wnt pathway mutants (data not shown). We infer that Wnt signalling pathway does not regulate Duox nor ROS levels. Juvenile hormone (JH) has been shown to act as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in tracheae (Djabrayan and Casanova, 2016). Pertinently, the levels of JH are high in L2 and early L3 and drop mid L3 (Dubrovsky, 2005). Thus, the timecourse of JH levels parallel the timecourses of both Duox and Chk1 expression. Future experiments will test the possibility that JH signaling in trachea regulates Duox expression and potentially Wnt signaling/Chk1 expression as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) In addition, the authors should note in their conclusions and the discussion that these effects on the cell cycle are partial (i.e. the timing and amount of cell cycle re-activation is only mildly affected by Duox-RNAi or Chk-RNAi).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to (6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[â¦] Overall, this study makes a valuable advance on the prior work.

However, it is not clear to me that this reflects another requirement for ATR/pChk.
