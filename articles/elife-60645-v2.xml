Many variants that influence complex traits alter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding this regulatory genetic variation is critical for our knowledge of genetic disease, evolutionary change, and for applications of biology in agriculture and industry.</p><p>Regulatory genetic variation is typically studied by measuring mRNA abundance in genetically diverse populations to map regions of the genome that contain variants that cause variation in mRNA levels (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs). Many genes are influenced by <italic>cis</italic>-acting eQTLs that are caused by DNA variants in cis-regulatory elements. The proximity of <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs to the genes they affect has aided their identification in numerous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">GTEx Consortium, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clément-Ziza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Higgins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Morley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">West et al., 2007</xref>). However, most genetic variation in gene expression arises from the combined effects of many <italic>trans</italic>-acting variants throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Grundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic>-acting variants affect the activity or abundance of diffusible factors that in turn alter the expression of other genes that can be located anywhere in the genome. Therefore, the identification of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs requires a large number of tests for statistical association between genotypes and mRNA levels. This, combined with the fact that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs have smaller effects than <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs, has hampered the identification of individual <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in human association studies. By contrast, experimental crosses in organisms such as yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brion et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clément-Ziza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emerson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thompson and Cubillos, 2017</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">West et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Snoek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Viñuela et al., 2010</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Everett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">McManus et al., 2010</xref>), and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gerrits et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2016</xref> ) have quantified the global contribution of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation and identified thousands of <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs.</p><p>Post-transcriptional mechanisms can shape protein levels independently of mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buccitelli and Selbach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Csárdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McCarthy, 1998</xref>), raising important questions about how DNA variation shapes protein levels compared to mRNA abundance. It is unclear whether most eQTLs, which by definition affect mRNA, also affect the protein abundance of the same genes, such that they also result in a protein-QTL (pQTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Damerval et al., 1994</xref>). It is also unclear to what extent there are protein-specific pQTLs that influence protein abundance without affecting the mRNA of the same gene. Recent studies have begun to address these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cenik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Foss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ghazalpour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mirauta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Picotti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yao et al., 2018</xref>) and reported a wide range of observations.</p><p>Across several species, half or more of <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs were reported to also affect protein abundance, suggesting high levels of agreement between mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hause et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Skelly et al., 2013</xref>). However, other work found many <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs whose effects on protein were smaller than those on mRNA, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that buffer protein levels against variation in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ghazalpour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mirauta et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic>-acting QTLs were reported to show even greater differences between mRNA and protein. In mouse crosses and some yeast crosses, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mirauta et al., 2020</xref>) <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs and <italic>trans</italic>-pQTLs mapped for the same genes showed very little overlap, suggesting that while many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are buffered at the protein level, there are also many <italic>trans</italic>-pQTLs that affect proteins via mechanisms that do not affect mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Foss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ghazalpour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Williams et al., 2016</xref>). While more recent work in yeast showed somewhat higher agreement between <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs and <italic>trans</italic>-pQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>), yeast crosses also revealed instances of ‘discordant’ <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci that affect both mRNA and protein of the same gene, but in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>). In plants, many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs appear to be buffered at the protein level, with few protein-specific pQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fu et al., 2009</xref>). In human populations, about half of the identified pQTLs could be accounted for by underlying eQTLs, although the exact fraction varied between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Emilsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hause et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). In yeast and humans, genetic effects on translation as measured by ribosome profiling were similar to those on mRNA, suggesting that translation cannot account for protein-specific pQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cenik et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, protein-specific effects may arise from protein degradation, especially for proteins that are part of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">He et al., 2020</xref>). Together, this literature suggests that genetic variants can independently affect the different layers of gene expression regulation.</p><p>However, there are substantial caveats to this conclusion. First, small sample sizes of dozens to a few hundred individuals were used in most studies to date. Most eQTLs and pQTLs change the expression of the gene they affect by 10% or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). Detecting such small-effect loci requires high statistical power resulting from the analysis of large numbers of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ehrenreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Visscher et al., 2017</xref>). With limited sample size, real loci can be missed. For example, a locus that truly affects both mRNA and protein but happens to pass the detection threshold in mRNA but not in protein data could be incorrectly inferred to be buffered at the protein level. Thus, low statistical power can inflate discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs.</p><p>Second, experimental differences between studies may also inflate discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs. In nearly all cases, eQTLs and pQTLs were compared between experiments conducted in different laboratories, sometimes using different experimental designs, and, in the case of some human studies, comparing eQTLs and pQTLs mapped in different tissues. These comparisons are likely to be confounded by environmental influences, which can drastically alter the effects of regulatory variants. For example, stimulation of human immune cells can reveal new <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, many <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are specific to a specific culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lewis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>), and some <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs switch the sign of their effect in different media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>). Even when experiments aim to recreate the same conditions, subtle differences (for example, in the precise stage of cell growth, medium composition, temperature, or handling of the isolated mRNA or proteins) could influence measures of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gallego Romero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gibson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hayeshi et al., 2008</xref>), potentially inflating the discrepancy between eQTLs and pQTLs.</p><p>To date, no study of regulatory variation has measured mRNA and protein with high statistical power and in the same samples. This challenge is not easy to overcome, because combined application of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry in thousands of matched samples remains prohibitively expensive. While recent studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Williams et al., 2016</xref>), and human iPSC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mirauta et al., 2020</xref>) used RNA-seq and mass spectrometry on the same cultures or tissue samples, their sample sizes of less than 200 individuals limited QTL detection. As a result, the role of genetic variation on post-transcriptional processes remains unclear, especially for <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation.</p><p>Here, we addressed this challenge by developing a system for quantifying mRNA and protein from the same gene simultaneously, in the same, live, single yeast cells using two fluorescent reporters. We reasoned that such an approach would equalize all environmental confounders and most of the technical biases that could obscure the relationship between eQTLs and pQTLs. Our assay is sensitive enough to be used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), permitting the use of a well-powered bulk segregant QTL mapping approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Michelmore et al., 1991</xref>) that leverages millions of genetically different yeast cells to yield high statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parts et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic mapping across ten genes revealed 86 <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci. Although our approach was explicitly designed to maximize the chance of detecting similar genetic effects on mRNA and protein, the majority of the identified loci affected only mRNA or protein for a given gene, or had discordant effects on mRNA and protein. These results demonstrate considerable differences in the genetic basis of variation in mRNA vs protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A reporter system for quantifying mRNA and protein in single, live cells</title><p>We designed a dual reporter system for the simultaneous quantification of mRNA production and protein abundance of a given gene in single, live cells. In this system, protein abundance is measured via a fluorescent green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag fused to the C-terminus of the given protein of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). To measure mRNA, we reasoned that a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) guide RNA (gRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>) produced in equal molarity with the mRNA of interest would be able to drive proportional expression of a reporter gene via CRISPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>). To implement this idea, we created a gRNA tag located in the 3’UTR of the gene, downstream of the sequence encoding GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After transcription of the mRNA along with this tag, the gRNA is released from the mRNA by two flanking self-cleaving ribozymes (Hammerhead, Hh; and Hepatitis Delta Virus, HDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao and Zhao, 2014</xref>). Because gRNA cleavage separates the mRNA from its poly-adenylated (polyA) tail, we added a synthetic polyA tail between the GFP tag and the Hh ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao and Zhao, 2014</xref>). Once released, the gRNA directs a catalytically deactivated CRISPR associated enzyme (dCas9) fused to a VP64 activation domain (dCas9-VP64) to drive the expression of a red fluorescent <italic>mCherry</italic> gene integrated in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farzadfard et al., 2013</xref>). After gRNA release, stability and half-life of the mRNA no longer affects gRNA abundance, such that mCherry expression primarily reports on mRNA production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence-based quantification of mRNA and protein levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the dual quantification reporter.

The intensity of this autofluorescence was much lower than the GFP signal for the genes we studied (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), such that in those experiments, the signal from the GFP gene tags dominates over background fluorescence.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60645-fig4-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Across the ten genes, we detected 78 protein-QTLs and 44 mRNA-QTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). By design, all detected loci were <italic>trans</italic>-acting, and most were located on a different chromosome than the tagged gene. One locus located at ~450 kb on chromosome XIV affected mCherry levels in the same direction in all ten genes. This region was also observed in a control experiment, in which mCherry was expressed constitutively using an <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter, and without a gRNA present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

While the highly pleiotropic <italic>MKT1</italic> locus may truly affect all ten genes we tested, it could also affect mCherry fluorescence via mCherry maturation or degradation, independently of any tagged gene. We excluded this region from further analyses.</p><p>The number of protein-QTLs per gene identified here (median = 7) agrees well with results from a previous study using the same mapping strategy (median = 8 for the same genes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>), confirming that individual proteins are influenced by multiple <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci. The effects of individual protein-QTLs and pQTLs showed a positive correlation across studies (Pearson r = 0.73, p-value&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The number of mRNA-QTLs per gene in our study (median = 3 after removing the <italic>MKT1</italic> locus) was lower than th from a previous study using RNA sequencing in 1012 segregants (median = 8 for the same genes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). This difference could be due to using our reporter in single cells with high stochastic variation compared to RNA-seq in individually grown segregant cultures in the earlier study (see Discussion). However, while the mRNA-QTLs detected by our reporter primarily reflect influences on mRNA production, the RNA-seq-based eQTLs may reflect effects on transcription as well as mRNA degradation, which our system was not designed to capture. The effects of mRNA-QTLs were significantly correlated between studies (r = 0.44, p-value=5 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Some of the QTLs we detected harbored variants known to affect gene expression. For example, a region at ~650 kb on chromosome XII that contains the gene <italic>HAP1</italic> affected protein abundance and/or mRNA production of <italic>GPD1</italic>, <italic>CYC1</italic>, <italic>OLE1</italic>, and <italic>TPO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Most of these QTLs tended to have small-effect sizes, suggesting that they could have been missed due to incomplete power in either study. Alternatively, these QTLs may reflect experimental differences between studies, such as different growth media. For example, we observed a new, strong protein-QTL affecting Aro8 on chromosome XIV. The regulation of Aro8 expression by amino acid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Iraqui et al., 1998</xref>) suggests that this QTL could be due to the synthetic complete medium used here vs. YNB medium in earlier work.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs</title><p>Genetic mapping using our reporter enabled us to compare mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs, free from environmental or experimental confounders.

Such loci are expected for variants that alter a gene’s mRNA production such that, in the absence of other effects, they also result in a concordant effect on protein abundance. A majority of the loci corresponded to protein-QTLs that did not overlap an mRNA-QTL. These 52 protein-specific QTLs may arise from variants that affect translation or protein degradation, without an effect on mRNA production.</p><p>There were eleven mRNA-QTLs that did not overlap with a protein-QTL and seven loci where mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs overlapped but had discordant effects. These two categories may occur when protein abundance and mRNA production of the same gene are regulated separately, through two different <italic>trans</italic>-acting pathways. These two pathways could be affected by two distinct but genetically linked causal variants at the same locus, or by a single variant with distinct pleiotropic effects on the two pathways. Alternatively, buffering mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Großbach et al., 2019</xref>) may compensate for changes in mRNA production perfectly (resulting in an mRNA-specific QTL) or may overcompensate (resulting in a discordant QTL pair) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Genes differed widely in the complexity and specificity of <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci that influenced their expression.

To bypass this potential limitation, we compared effect sizes, expressed as ∆AF, at significant mRNA-QTLs or protein-QTLs, irrespective of the significance of the locus in the other data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When considering all loci, we observed a significant, positive correlation between mRNA and protein effect sizes (r = 0.41, p-value=8.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This overall correlation was almost exclusively driven by the concordant QTL pairs, whose effect sizes showed a strong correlation (r = 0.88 p-value=9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). In sharp contrast, neither protein-specific QTLs (r = 0.2, p-value=0.23) nor mRNA-specific QTLs (r = −0.05, p-value=0.9) had correlated effects across the two data types, as expected if these loci specifically affected only mRNA or only protein. Considerable differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs were also observed when simply considering effect directions. Overall, only 64% of QTLs affected mRNA and protein in the same direction. While this was more than the 50% expected by chance (binomial test p-value=0.006), it left 36% of loci with discordant effects. Protein-specific QTLs showed similar directional agreement (63%) at lower significance (p-value=0.04), while only 55% of mRNA-specific QTLs had an effect in the same direction in the protein data, which was not significantly different from chance (p-value=0.5). Together, these results are consistent with the existence of many QTLs that specifically affect mRNA production or protein abundance.</p><p>Several loci were shared across the ten genes.

This system enabled the use of a statistically powerful mapping strategy to identify genetic loci that affected mRNA production or protein abundance in <italic>trans</italic>. Because mRNA and protein were quantified in exactly the same condition, mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs could be compared without environmental confounding. This reporter system and mapping strategy were explicitly designed to maximize the chance of detecting concordant effects on mRNA and protein. Nevertheless, of the 86 <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci that contributed to variation in the expression of ten genes, 84% did not have concordant effects on mRNA production and protein abundance. This result demonstrates the importance of variants that act on specific layers of gene expression.</p><p>The genes <italic>ARO8</italic>, <italic>BMH2</italic>, <italic>GPD1</italic>, <italic>MTD1</italic>, and <italic>UGP1</italic>, which we had selected for high discrepancy between previous mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs, showed many QTLs (89%) that were not shared between mRNA and protein in our data. In contrast, <italic>CYC1</italic>, <italic>OLE1</italic>, and <italic>TPO1</italic>, which we had selected for higher agreement between published QTLs, showed fewer discrepant QTLs in our data, although even for these genes the majority of QTLs was not shared between mRNA and protein (58%). These three genes showed fewer QTLs overall and all had one locus with strong effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; the <italic>HAP1</italic> locus for <italic>CYC1</italic> and <italic>OLE1</italic>, and the <italic>IRA2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>) for <italic>TPO1</italic>). Based on these results, strong <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci may be more likely to cause concordant effects on mRNA and protein, while loci with smaller effects could be more likely to be specific to mRNA or protein.</p><p>While half of the mRNA-QTLs we detected had concordant effects on protein (16 out of 34), most protein-QTLs had no effects on mRNA (52 out of 75), in line with observations from prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foss et al., 2011</xref>). That 70% of our protein-QTLs had protein-specific effects suggests that the causal variants underlying many of these loci affect post-transcriptional processes, <italic>i.e.</italic> mRNA stability, translation, or protein degradation. The indirect nature of our mCherry reporter and its lower signal intensity compared to GFP fluorescence are potential sources of measurement noise, which could have reduced detection power for mRNA-QTLs compared to protein-QTLs. However, our analyses of the magnitudes and directions of effects on mRNA and protein, which did not require loci in the other data to meet a significance threshold, also suggested that many protein-QTLs specifically influence protein.</p><p>We found seven loci that had discordant effects on mRNA production and protein abundance of the same gene. For example, at the <italic>HAP1</italic> locus, the BY allele increased Gpd1 protein abundance but decreased <italic>GPD1</italic> mRNA production, as had been seen when comparing QTLs across different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). The highly pleiotropic effects of <italic>HAP1</italic> on mRNA and protein levels of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>) reinforces the hypothesis that <italic>HAP1</italic> alleles influence Gpd1 protein abundance and mRNA production via two separate <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanisms.</p><p>QTLs with discordant effects on mRNA and protein, as well as mRNA-specific QTLs, may be caused by buffering of mRNA variation at the protein level. A well-studied example of this phenomenon is the regulation of expression of genes that encode members of a protein complex, in which excess protein molecules that cannot be incorporated in the complex are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taggart et al., 2020</xref>). Among the genes we investigated, <italic>RPS10A</italic> encodes a part of the ribosome small subunit complex. <italic>RPS10A</italic> showed the highest number of mRNA-specific QTLs, possibly because Rps10a is subject to buffering mechanisms.</p><p>The nonsense mutation (Q578*) we identified in the <italic>YAK1</italic> gene provides an informative example of the complexity with which <italic>trans</italic>-acting variants can shape the transcriptome and the proteome. <italic>YAK1</italic><sup>Q578*</sup> changed protein abundance for many genes more strongly than mRNA abundance, but also affected mRNA but not protein for many other genes. Thus, the consequences of this mutation span mechanisms that affect mRNA as well as protein-specific processes. A reduction of ribosomal gene transcription may account for some of these observations by reducing the translation of multiple genes.</p><p>The <italic>YAK1</italic><sup>Q578*</sup> variant likely arose as a new mutation in the BY4741 ancestor of the GFP and TAP-tagged collections. Its relatively large effect and rarity in the global yeast population are consistent with population genetic expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eyre-Walker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gibson, 2012</xref>) and observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fournier et al., 2019</xref>) for a deleterious variant that may have drifted to fixation in this specific background, as has been suggested for many causal variants in natural yeast isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Warringer et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, faster growth of a strain carrying the <italic>YAK1</italic><sup>Q578*</sup> variant during osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) may have contributed to adaptive fixation of this variant in this specific isolate of BY4741. While the large effect of <italic>YAK1</italic><sup>Q578*</sup> aided our ability to fine-map it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rockman, 2012</xref>), we suspect that its diverse, mRNA-specific as well as protein-specific mechanistic consequences may be representative of more common <italic>trans</italic>-acting variants with smaller effects.</p><p>To simultaneously quantify mRNA and protein and eliminate potential environmental confounders in expression QTL mapping, we developed a system in which a gRNA drives CRISPR activation of a fluorescent reporter gene in proportion to a given mRNA of interest. Standard methods for mRNA quantification require lysis of cell cultures or tissues, constraining sample throughput and statistical power for mapping regulatory variation. Single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Picelli, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tang et al., 2009</xref>) and in situ fluorescent hybridization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Player et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rouhanifard et al., 2018</xref>) are improving rapidly, including in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Li and Neuert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wadsworth et al., 2017</xref>). However, these approaches still have throughput that is orders of magnitude below that available using FACS. Further, they involve cell lysis or fixation, precluding bulk segregant approaches that rely on growing cells after sorting. By contrast, our reporter allows quantification of mRNA production of a given gene within millions of single, live cells by flow cytometry. Because mCherry production in our system amplifies mRNA abundance signals, it is able to quantify genes with mRNA levels that would likely be hard to detect by FACS using in situ hybridization methods. The readout of our system is driven by a gRNA after it detaches from its mRNA. Therefore, the resulting signal is independent of the fate of the mRNA after gRNA release. Given the hammerhead ribozyme has a rate constant for self-cleavage of 1.5 per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wurmthaler et al., 2018</xref>), gRNA abundance is not expected to reflect the half-life and stability of most yeast mRNAs, which have a median half-life of 3.6 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, standard methods usually used in eQTL mapping quantify mRNA at steady state, which may explain some of the differences we observed between our mRNA-QTLs and known eQTLs identified by RNA-seq.</p><p>Future versions of our reporter could be improved in several ways. The mCherry used here has a maturation time of about 40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Merzlyak et al., 2007</xref>), which limits the temporal resolution at which we can observe dynamic expression changes. Fluorescent proteins with faster maturation times and shorter half-lives, could enable precise investigation of rapid temporal change in mRNA production. Using brighter fluorescent proteins or multiple copies of mCherry and its gRNA-targeted promoter could increase fluorescence and increase mRNA detection further. Finally, we observed that beyond a certain mRNA level, the abundance of gRNA no longer follows that of the tagged mRNA. Nevertheless, we estimated that our CRISPR-based reporter can be used to quantify the mRNA production of most <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes. Like other reporters that tag the 3’ end of genes, our system decouples the native 3’ UTR from the gene of interest. 3’ UTRs can influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shalem et al., 2015</xref>), and genetic <italic>trans</italic>-effects that involve mechanisms that target the 3’ UTR would be missed by our system. However, loss of the native 3’ UTR is not expected to inflate differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs. Instead, 3’ UTR removal may reduce differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs because it eliminates an element of the mRNA that could be a target for mRNA-specific processes. Finally, CRISPR activation has been demonstrated in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Long et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Park et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that similar reporters for RNA production could be developed in other species.</p><p>Our reporter system for quantifying mRNA and protein of a given gene in the same live, single cells combined with a mapping strategy with high statistical power was deliberately designed to minimize technical or environmental confounders that may have inflated differences between the genetics of mRNA and protein levels in earlier work. Yet, fewer than 20% of the detected <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci we detected had concordant effects on mRNA and protein levels, providing strong support for the existence of discordant <italic>trans</italic> effects on mRNA vs proteins. Whether <italic>cis</italic> effects show similar degrees of specificity will be a topic of future work. The fact that the majority of <italic>trans</italic>-QTLs identified here were protein-specific suggests that protein abundance is under more complex genetic control than mRNA abundance.</p></sec><sec

Both strains carried auxotrophic markers, and RM had been engineered earlier to facilitate laboratory usage (BY: <italic>his3∆one leu2∆0 met15∆0 ura3∆0</italic>; RM: <italic>can1Δ::STE2pr-URA3 leu2Δ0 HIS3(S288C allele) ura3Δ ho::HYG AMN1(BY allele)</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Most strains were built using conventional yeast transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gietz and Schiestl, 2007</xref>) and DNA integration based on homologous recombination. Integrated DNA fragments were produced by PCR (Phusion Hot Start Flex NEB M0535L, following manufacturer protocol, annealing temperature: 57°C, 36 cycles, final volume: 50 µl) and gel purified (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit, NEB T1020L), with primers carrying 40 to 60 bp overhanging homologous sequence as required. All primers are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. For transformation, fresh cells from colonies on agar plates were grown in YPD media (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, 20 g/l glucose) overnight at 30°C. The next day, 1 ml of the culture was inoculated in an Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of YPD and grown under shaking at 30°C for 3 hr to reach the late log phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with pure sterile water and twice with transformation buffer 1 (10 mM TrisHCl at pH8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M lithium acetate). We resuspended the cells in 100 µl of transformation buffer 1, added 50 µg of denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA (Sigma #D7656) and 1 µg of the DNA fragment to be integrated, and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Alternatively, when transforming a replicative plasmid, we used 0.1 µg of plasmid DNA and skipped this first incubation. We added 700 µl of transformation buffer 2 (10 mM TrisHCl at pH8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M lithium acetate, 40% PEG 3350) and performed a second incubation for 30 min at 30°C. A heat shock was induced by incubating the cells at 42°C for 15 min. The transformed cells were then washed twice with sterile water. If the selective marker for the transformation was an antibiotic resistance gene, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of YPD, allowed to recover for 2 hr at 30°C, and spread on a YPD plate (2% agar) containing the antibiotic (200 ng/l G418, 100 ng/l nourseothricin sulfate/CloNAT, or 300 ng/l hygromycin B). Alternatively, if the transformation was based on complementation of an auxotrophy, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water and spread on a plate containing minimal media lacking the corresponding amino acid or nucleotide (YNB or Synthetic Complete (SC): 6.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base (VWR 97064–162), 20 g/l glucose, with or without 1.56 g/l SC -arginine -histidine -uracil -leucine (Sunrise science 1342–030), complemented as needed with amino acids: 50 mg/l histidine, 100 mg/l leucine, 200 mg/l uracil, 80 mg/l tryptophan). After two to three days of incubation at 30°C, colonies were streaked on a fresh plate containing the same selection media to purify clones arising from single, transformed cells. DNA integration in the correct location was confirmed by PCR (Taq DNA Polymerase NEB M0267L, following manufacturer protocol, annealing temperature: 50°C, 35 cycles, final volume: 25 µl, primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To store the constructed strains, we regrew the validated colony on a new selection media plate overnight at 30°C, scraped multiple colonies, resuspended the cells in 1.4 ml of YPD containing 20% glycerol in a 2 ml screw cap cryotube and froze them at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>We constructed seven plasmids: three plasmids that do not replicate in yeast and that carry the GFP-gRNA tag, the CRISPR reporter, and Z<sub>3</sub>EV system, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and four yeast-replicating plasmids to investigate the quantitative properties of our reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These plasmids were constructed through multiple rounds of cloning using DNA fragments from yeast DNA or plasmids acquired from Addgene (kind gifts from John McCusker: Addgene #35121–22, from Michael Nick Boddy: Addgene #41030, from Benjamin Glick: Addgene #25444, from Timothy Lu: Addgene #64381, #64389, #49013; complete list of plasmids in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Plasmids were assembled using Gibson assembly (NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit, NEB E5520S). Fragments were either PCR amplified with a least 15 bp overlap at each end (Phusion Hot Start Flex NEB M0535L, manufacturer protocol, annealing temperature: 57°C, 36 cycles, final volume: 50 µl, primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) or obtained by restriction digestion of already existing plasmids (also shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The fragment encoding the gRNA tag, containing the two ribozymes and the gRNA sequence itself, was purchased as a 212 bp double-stranded DNA oligo from IDT (we used the ‘C3’ gRNA from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farzadfard et al., 2013</xref>, as it was reported to provide the highest reporter gene expression). The synthetic polyA tail following the GFP sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was introduced by using a PCR primer containing 45 thymines in its overhang sequence (primer OFA0038 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Fragments for assembly were purified using agarose electrophoresis and gel extraction (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit, NEB T1020L). For assembly, the given fragments were mixed at equi-molar amounts of 0.2–0.5 pM in 10 µl. Assembly was done by addition of 10 µl of NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix and incubation at 50°C for 60 min. From this reaction, 2 µl of the final products were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> competent cells (10-beta Competent E.coli, NEB C3019I) through an incubation of 30 min on ice and a heat shock of 30 s at 42°C. Transformed cells were spread on LB plates (10 g/l peptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l sodium chloride, 2% agar) containing 100 mg/l ampicillin and grown overnight at 37°C. After cloning, the final plasmids were extracted (Plasmid Miniprep Kit, Zymo Research D4036) and verified by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR (Taq DNA Polymerase NEB M0267L, 30 cycles, 25 µl final volume, primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also verified by Sanger sequencing that the gRNA tag in the plasmid had no mutation. To store the plasmids, the host bacteria were grown in LB with ampicillin overnight at 37°C and 1 ml of the culture was mixed with 0.4 ml of a sterile solution containing 60% water and 40% glycerol. The cells were stored at −80°C. The three plasmids containing the different parts of the reporter are available on Addgene (ID #157656, #157658, and #157659) along with their full DNA sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plate reader-based fluorescence measurements</title><p>Yeast fluorescence was measured in 24 hr time courses during overnight growth in a BioTek Synergy H1 plate-reader (BioTek Instruments). Fresh cells from agar plates were inoculated in 100 µl of minimal YNB media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or SC media (all other figures) containing any complements necessary for growth of auxotrophic strains, at an initial optical density at wavelength 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.05 in a 96-well flat bottom plate (Costar #3370). We conducted the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the presence of G418 (which requires the use of YNB + glutamate) because, at the time, we were concerned about potential loss of the reporter construct from the genome due to recombination between its flanking sequences. This concern later turned out to be unfounded. The plates were sealed with a Breathe Easy membrane (Diversified Biotech). Cells were grown in the plate reader at 30°C and with circular agitation in between fluorescence acquisition. During each acquisition, performed every 15 min, we recorded OD<sub>600</sub>, GFP fluorescence (read from bottom, excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm, 10 consecutive reads averaged, gain set to ‘extended’) and mCherry fluorescence (read from bottom, excitation 502 nm, emission 532 nm, 50 consecutive reads averaged, gain set to a value of 150).

OD<sub>600</sub> was log-transformed and manually inspected to identify the late log phase, i.e. a time point about 3/4 into the exponential growth phase. This stage was identified separately for each well, and usually corresponded to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1–0.3. We extracted the OD<sub>600</sub> and fluorescence measurements at the five time points centered on our selected time point. The mCherry and GFP fluorescence ratios were calculated as the ratio between the fluorescence and the OD<sub>600</sub> at these five time points (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–CB</xref>), allowing us to estimate fluorescence while correcting for culture density. Focusing on the late log phase allowed measurements at higher cell density to provide more robust fluorescence reads. Growth rates were estimated as the slope of a linear fit of the log of OD<sub>600</sub> over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA quantification by qPCR</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Cell harvest</title><p>We quantified mRNA and gRNA abundance by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR of RNA extracted from exponentially growing cells.

At this point, GFP and mCherry fluorescence ratios were recorded in a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek Instruments). Cells were then harvested immediately.

Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 800 μl RNA Lysis Buffer one from the kit and transferred to a ZR BashingBead Lysis Tube. The cells were shaken in a mini-bead beater (BioSpec Products) for ten cycles of one minute in the beater, one minute on ice. Cell debris and beads were centrifuged for one minute at full speed and 400 µl of supernatants were transferred into Zymo-Spin IIIC Columns. The columns were centrifuged for one minute, and 400 µl 100% ethanol was added to the flow-through. After mixing, the flow-throughs were transferred into Zymo-Spin IIC Columns and centrifuged for 1 min to bind the RNA and DNA to the columns. The columns were washed with 400 μl RNA Wash Buffer from the kit.

Growing cells were streaked on the same medium, and a single hybrid colony was kept for storage and for generating the segregant population. For sporulation, hybrid strains were incubated in sporulation medium (2.5 g/l yeast extract, 2.5 g/l glucose, 15 g/l potassium acetate, 200 mg/l uracil, 100 mg/l methionine) at room temperature under vertical rotation in a glass tube for seven days. After verifying sporulation under a light microscope, 1 ml of medium containing the tetrads was pelleted (13,000 rpm for 5 min) and resuspended in 300 µl of sterile water containing about 15 µg of zymolyase. The resulting ascii were digested at 30°C for 30 min with agitation. Spores were separated by vortexing for about 15 s, and 700 µl of pure sterile water was added to the tube. We spread 250 µl of this spore suspension on a plate containing segregant selection media (SC agar, 50 mg/l canavanine, -uracil -leucine) allowing growth of haploid segregants carrying the following three alleles: (1) cells with mating type <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, selected via the SGA marker with <italic>URA3</italic> under control of the <italic>STE2</italic> promoter, which resulted in a ura+ phenotype only in <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> cells, (2) the SGA marker integrated at the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene (whose deletion conferred canavanine resistance), which also selected for the CRISPR reporter that we had integrated at <italic>NPR2</italic>, the gene next to <italic>CAN1</italic>, (3) the given gene of interest tagged with the GFP-gRNA tag and <italic>LEU2</italic> selectable marker. We used SC because this medium complemented a growth defect of strains with an <italic>NPR2</italic> deletion in YNB medium. After three days of incubation at 30°C, segregants were harvested by scraping the entire plate in 10 ml of sterile water. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 3 ml of segregant selection media, and incubated at 30°C for 1.5 hr.

The next day, 1 ml of the growing culture was transferred to a new tube containing 4 ml of segregant selection medium (see above) and grown for an additional two hours before cell sorting, roughly corresponding to the middle of the exponential growth phase.</p><p>Cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria II P0287 (BSL2) instrument at the University of Minnesota Flow Cytometry Resource (UFCR), without compensation. Cells were gated to exclude doublet and cellular fragments. To focus on cells in approximately the same stage of the cell cycle, an additional gate selected cells in a narrow range of cell size as gauged by the area of the forward scatter signal (FSC). From the cells within this gate, we sorted five populations per experiment, each comprising 10,000 cells: (1) a control population from the entire gate without fluorescence selection, (2) the 3% of cells with the lowest GFP fluorescence, (3) the 3% of cells with the highest GFP fluorescence, (4) the 3% of cells with the lowest mCherry fluorescence, and (5) the 3% of cells with the highest mCherry fluorescence. Each population was collected into 1 ml of segregant selection medium. After overnight growth at 30°C, 0.9 ml of culture was mixed with 0.4 ml of a sterile solution containing 60% water and 40% glycerol, and frozen at −80°C until sequencing. The remaining 0.1 ml were inoculated into 0.9 ml of segregant selection medium and grown for 3 hr before analyzing the population using flow cytometry (see below). In total, we obtained 125 sorted populations from 25 experiments across the ten tagged genes, with 1 to 6 biological replicates per gene, as well as the untagged population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Biological replicates were performed as independent sporulations of the stored diploid hybrids, and thus represent independent populations sorted in separate experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Single-cell fluorescence analysis was performed using cultures in the late log growth phase. We used a BD Fortessa X-30 H0081 flow cytometer at UFCR equipped with blue and yellow lasers and 505LP and 595LP filters to measure green (GFP) and red (mCherry) fluorescence, respectively. We did not use compensation. Forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), GFP, and mCherry fluorescence were recorded for 50,000 cells, excluding doublets and cellular debris. The voltaic gains were set as follows: 490 for FSC, 280 for SSC, 500 for GFP, and 600 for mCherry. We monitored for possible cross-contamination from cells retained in the instrument using strains expressing either only GFP or mCherry, and observed no cross-contamination. Recorded data on. fsc files were analysed using R and the flowCore package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hahne et al., 2009</xref>).

Fragments were amplified with index primers (8 Nextera primers i5 and 12 Nextera primers i7, for up to 96 possible multiplex combinations) on 10 µl tagmented DNA by adding 1 µl of each primer solution (10 µM), 5 µl of 10X ExTaq buffer and 0.375 µl of ExTaq polymerase (Takara) and water to a final volume of 50 µl.

Briefly, for plotting the results, the allele frequency of the reference (that is, BY) allele was calculated at each position in each population. Random counting noise was smoothed using loess regression, and the allele frequency of a given ‘low’ fluorescence population subtracted from its matched ‘high’ fluorescence population to generate ΔAF. A deflection from zero indicated the presence of a QTL. To identify significant QTLs, we used an R script that implemented the MULTIPOOL algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edwards and Gifford, 2012</xref>), which calculates LOD score based on ΔAF and depth of read coverage in bins along the genome. We used MULTIPOOL output to call QTLs as peaks exceeding a given significance threshold (see below), along with confidence intervals for the peak location corresponding to a 2-LOD drop from the peak LOD value. We applied the MULTIPOOL algorithm using the following parameters: bp per centiMorgan: 2,200; bin size: 100 bp, effective pool size: 1000. We excluded variants with extreme allele frequencies of &gt;0.9 or &lt;0.1. We initially set a permissive detection threshold of LOD &gt;3.0 to identify a set of candidate QTLs, which we then integrated across replicates (507 QTLs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). A second, more stringent, threshold of LOD &gt;4.5 was then applied to retain only significant QTLs based on our estimated false discovery rate (FDR).</p><p>To estimate FDR, we applied the multipool QTL detection algorithm to pairs of populations sorted into the same gates in different replicates. Any ‘QTLs’ in such comparisons must be due to technical or biological noise. We restricted these analyses to replicates sequenced on the same instrument, resulting in 80 inter-replicate comparisons. From these data, we calculated the FDR as a function of the significance threshold (<italic>thr</italic>): FDR<italic><sub>thr</sub></italic> = (<italic>N</italic>repQTL<italic><sub>thr</sub></italic>/<italic>N</italic>rep) / (<italic>N</italic>fluoQTL<italic><sub>thr</sub></italic>/<italic>N</italic>fluo), where <italic>N</italic>repQTL<italic><sub>thr</sub></italic> is the number of false ‘QTLs’ from comparing the same gate across replicate populations at a LOD score threshold of <italic>thr</italic>, <italic>N</italic>rep is the number of such inter-replicate comparisons (<italic>N</italic>rep = 80), <italic>N</italic>fluoQTL<italic><sub>thr</sub></italic> is the number of fluorescence-QTLs at a LOD threshold of <italic>thr</italic>, and <italic>N</italic>fluo is the number of high vs. low fluorescence comparisons (<italic>N</italic>fluo = 48; the untagged experiment was excluded). At a significance threshold of LOD = 4.5, the estimated FDR was 7.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which we used to call significant QTLs. For some overlap analyses (see below), we used a threshold of LOD = 3.0, which corresponded to an FDR of 13%.</p><p>To call significant QTLs across replicates, we first scanned each replicate for QTLs at a permissive threshold of LOD &gt; 3.0. Second, at each resulting QTL peak position, we averaged ΔAF and LOD scores across all available replicates without applying a LOD filter to each replicate. Third, we collapsed groups of overlapping QTLs, which we defined as QTLs whose peaks were within 75,000 bp of each other in the different replicates. For each group of these overlapping QTLs, we averaged the LOD scores, the ΔAFs, the peak positions, and the location confidence intervals to form one merged QTL. Of the resulting merged QTLs, we retained those that exceeded our stringent significance threshold of LOD ≥ 4.5.</p><p>To gauge reproducibility of these significant QTLs, we counted the number of replicates in which a given QTL had been detected at the permissive LOD &gt;3.0, using the same definition of positional overlap as above. The majority (74%) of significant QTLs were shared across all the corresponding replicates. Two tagged genes had more than two replicates (<italic>GPD1</italic> and <italic>UGP1</italic>). For these genes, requiring <italic>all</italic> replicates to be significant is conservative. Therefore, we also estimated the average reproducibility of all mRNA-QTLs or all protein-QTLs by calculating the average fraction of replicates that had a QTL at a given merged QTL:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">_</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, <italic>NshareQTL<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the number of replicates for which the QTL <italic>i</italic> is detected for the tagged gene <italic>j</italic> at LOD &gt; 3, and <italic>Nrep<sub>j</sub></italic> is the number of replicates performed for the tagged gene <italic>j</italic>. Note that if only a single replicate has a QTL at a given merged QTL, this fraction takes on a value of zero because in such a case, there is no overlap among replicates at this QTL. The observed <italic>fraction_overlap</italic> was 0.76 for the protein-QTLs and 0.78 for the mRNA-QTLs.</p><p>As a measure of effect size for a QTL, we used ΔAF. Briefly, in the presence of a QTL, there are two subpopulations of segregants that carry the two QTL alleles. The effect of the QTL is given by the difference in mean between these two subpopulations, assuming identical standard deviations for the two alleles. During FACS of the combined population with both alleles, cells that exceed the threshold for inclusion in the high population are enriched for the allele that increases expression, and vice versa for the low population. The ratio of cells that carry the two alleles in each extreme population determines the allele frequency at the locus in that population, and subtracting these allele frequencies for the two populations gives the ΔAF metric. For QTLs with larger effect sizes, the two subpopulations are further apart in phenotype. This increases the degree of genotype enrichment in the two extreme populations, as reflected in a larger ΔAF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Comparison of mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs</title><p>To compare mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs of the same gene, we first considered all merged QTLs that exceeded a permissive threshold of LOD &gt; 3.0 (after merging replicates as described above). We considered an mRNA-QTL and a protein-QTL for the same gene with overlapping confidence intervals as a QTL pair across mRNA and protein. We manually curated the result of this overlap analysis for six cases; after curation, QTLs on chromosomes XV (<italic>ARO8</italic>), VIII (<italic>MTD1</italic>), XIII (<italic>CYC1</italic>) and XIII (<italic>RPS10A</italic>) were considered to be pairs, and QTLs on chromosome V (<italic>GPD1</italic>) and XIV (<italic>MTD1</italic>) were considered to be mRNA-specific.</p><p>From this initial set, we retained those QTL pairs at which the given mRNA and/or protein QTL met a more stringent LOD score of &gt;4.5 (FDR = 7.2%). Applying this higher threshold only after the more permissive overlap analysis allowed us to consider QTL pairs even if one of the paired QTLs did not pass the strong significance threshold of LOD &gt;4.5. As an example, we considered overlapping QTLs on chromosome XI that affected <italic>OLE1</italic> expression (mRNA-QTL LOD = 4.4, protein-QTL LOD = 15.5) to be a pair even if the mRNA LOD score was below the stringent significance threshold. In such cases, we deemed it more conservative to assume that the weaker QTL exists but narrowly failed to reach significance than to declare the stronger QTL as specific for mRNA or protein. We discarded all QTLs located between 350 and 550 kb on chromosome XIV, as this region may affect mCherry fluorescence independently of the tagged gene.</p><p>We distinguished four types of QTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The shared QTL pairs either had similar effects on mRNA and protein abundance (16 QTL pairs, defined as having the same sign of ΔAF), or discordant effects on mRNA and protein (7 QTL pairs, different sign of ΔAF). All QTLs that were not part of a pair were considered to be specific (11 mRNA-specific QTLs, 52 protein-specific QTLs).</p><p>Finally, we conducted an analysis of mRNA or protein QTL effect sizes and directions that avoided having to define potentially paired QTLs as significant or not. For each mRNA-QTL (or protein-QTL), we extracted the ΔAF from the protein-QTL (or mRNA-QTL) data at the same exact position, irrespective of significance in the other data. We used these values to compute correlations of effects and to examine shared directionality of effects between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Allelic engineering for <italic>YAK1</italic> fine-mapping</title><p>To obtain strains with scarless allelic swaps in haploids, we used a strategy based on double-cut CRISPR-swap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lutz et al., 2019</xref>). We flanked each of the four tiles to be switched by two resistance markers (<italic>hphMX</italic> and <italic>KanMX</italic>) using our regular yeast transformation protocol (see above). The yeast were then transformed with 100 ng of CRISPR-Swap plasmid (pFA0055-gCASS5a, Addgene plasmid # 131774) and 1 µg of DNA repair template amplified either from BY, BY <italic>GPD1-GFP</italic>, or RM. The transformed cells were spread on SC -leucine plates, selecting for the presence of the plasmid expressing <italic>CAS9</italic> and a gRNA targeting and cleaving a sequence present in both of the two resistance cassettes. We used strains in which <italic>GPD1</italic> was tagged with <italic>GFP</italic> but not the gRNA tag, as the gRNA in our tag would likely have directed <italic>CAS9</italic> to cleave the mCherry promoter. Cleavage of both cassettes resulted in the region in between the resistance cassettes to be replaced by the repair template.

We used ZR Fungal/Bacterial RNA mini-prep kit with DNase I digestion (Zymo Research R2014), following the kit manual. RNA was eluted in 50 µl of RNase/DNase free water, quantified, and checked for integrity on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation. All RNA Integrity Numbers were higher than 9.5 and all concentrations were above 120 ng/µl. The RNA samples were stored at −20°C until use. Poly-A RNA selection was done using 550 ng of total RNA using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB E7490L), processing all samples in one batch. We prepared the library using NEB Ultra II Directional RNA library kit for Illumina (NEB E7760) used dual index primers (from NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina, NEB E7600S) for multiplexing, and amplified the library for ten cycles. The libraries were quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Q32854) and pooled at equal mass for sequencing using 75 bp single-end reads on Illumina NextSeq 550 at UMGC. The sequencing reads are available on NCBI GEO via BioProject PRJNA644804. Using the trimmomatic software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>), reads were trimmed of adapters and low quality bases and filtered to be at least 36 bp long. Reads were then pseudo-aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcriptome (Ensembl build 93) and counted using kallisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray et al., 2016</xref>). We used RSeQC to calculate Transcript Integrity Numbers (TIN) which provided an estimation of alignment quality for each gene of each sample. We excluded any gene with at least one read count of zero or at least one TIN of zero across the ten samples. After filtering, 5755 genes remained for analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Love et al., 2014</xref>), using the extraction batch information as covariate. DESeq2 provided, for each gene, the log<sub>2</sub>-fold-change (<italic>YAK1</italic><sup>Q578*</sup> vs. <italic>YAK1</italic><sup>wt</sup>) and the p-value adjusted for multiple-testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-3"><title>Protein extraction and mass spectrometry</title><p>Protein extraction and quantification using mass spectrometry was performed by the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics at the University of Minnesota.

The proteins were extracted using pressure cycling (Barocycler Pressure Biosciences NEP2320, 60 cycles of 20 s at 20 kpsi and 10 s at 0 kpsi), purified by centrifugation in 8 mM iodoacetamide (10 min at 12000 rpm), and quantify by Bradford assay. For each sample, 40 µg of extracted proteins were fragmented by trypsin digestion (Promega Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin V5111), and labeled by tandem mass tag isotopes (TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set, Thermo Scientific 90110). All the tagged samples were pooled. Peptides were separated first based on hydrophobicity through two consecutive liquid chromatographies, followed by separation based on mass per charge after ionization in the first mass spectrometry step. The second mass spectrometry step after high-energy collision-induced dissociation allowed for the identification of the peptide and the quantification of the TMTs. MS-MS analysis was conducted on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid instrument (Thermo Scientific). Database searches were performed using Proteome Discoverer software, and post-processing and differential expression analysis was done using Scaffold 4.9.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Gresham (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>This paper presents a creative, novel strategy for quantifying expression of RNA and protein of the same genes in the same cells. While some concerns were raised about the mRNA level plateau that will need to be addressed, the methods and analyses were generally felt to be sound. Using this clever method, levels of mRNA and protein were used to simultaneously map QTL affecting mRNA and protein expression levels.

Either way, how different trans-factors can interact with target genes and be responsible for expression and protein differences?</p><p>We have left the full set of reviewer comments below in this case because they contain detailed, specific, and complementary comments and reflect this range of opinions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Brion et al. performed expression QTL mapping in a budding yeast cross using two methods for quantifying gene expression at the level of transcript abundance and protein abundance. Previous eQTL studies have been performed separately for transcript abundance and protein abundance using separate experimental procedures. These studies have found that there is a largely unique set of trans QTL that underlie interindividual variation in mRNA and protein abundance. However, these comparative analyses have a number of limitations that the authors outline. To rigorously address the extent to which these loci overlap the authors developed a method that enables simultaneous detection of protein and mRNA levels in single cells. Protein expression is detected using GFP fusions. mRNA expression is quantified using a novel, and clever, CRISPR-based system that uses self-cleaving ribozymes to generate a guide RNA that directs a dCas9 to drive expression of mCherry. Using this approach the authors performed bulk segregant mapping in a cross between two yeast strains to map loci that underlie differences in expression of mRNA and protein. Consistent with prior studies, they find little overlap between eQTL affecting the two levels of expression. They follow up on one locus, YAK1, in detail using RNAseq and mass spec.</p><p>This is an interesting study that presents a very clever method of quantifying mRNA and protein expression simultaneously. The experiments and analysis are well-performed. Although the result is consistent with previous studies, it greatly strengthens those observations and thus is an important addition to the field. Prior to publication the authors should address the following:</p><p>– The authors state that &quot;most genetic variation in gene expression arises from trans-acting variants…&quot; and cite several studies from model organisms that support this. However, my understanding is that this is not the case in human studies. The authors should expand on their explanation as to why they haven't been found in humans, beyond the fact that they can occur anywhere in the genome.</p><p>– The authors refer to the poor correlation between mRNA and protein levels, but should mention the issues identified with this comparison in Csardi et al., 2015 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25950722/</p><p>– Figure 1 states the cells were grown in YNB + glutamate. Why was this media used for the study?</p><p>– Figure 3—figure supplement 3 aims to show the heritability of the phenotype of sorted cells. This would be more convincing if scatter plots were presented that show that after the sorting there is no correlation between the green and red signal, or if there is, an explanation as to why.</p><p>– It would be easier to read the paper if after the method has been introduced the text referred to mRNA and protein expression rather than the color of the reporter.</p><p>– The authors refer to the protein QTL as &quot;post-transcriptional&quot;, but I think that term makes one think of mRNA stability, which is not what is measured. Perhaps &quot;translational control&quot; would be more correct and clearer.</p><p>– What is the rationale for showing δ-allele frequencies in Figure 4A? Showing LOD scores in this figure would make more sense to me for reporting QTL.</p><p>– It is not intuitive to me that δ-allele frequencies correspond to effect sizes and this should be more clearly explained.</p><p>– It is not clear to me if there is any compensation used in the FACS analysis. Is there any correlation between the green and red channels when controls containing only green or only red are used?</p><p>– Why is a loess regression used to correct for cell size? Wouldn't dividing by FSC be simpler and have the desired effect of normalizing for cell size?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors used a novel approach to simultaneously measure mRNA and protein levels and identify trans-acting genetic variants affecting both or either of both. The authors present a fast and accurate novel strategy, taking advantage of a CRISPR strategy, and FACS analysis in a highly used yeast cross. Unfortunately, this work does not provide novel genetic, neither biological insights and conclusions are similar to previous findings. I would recommend the authors try to extend their work to a higher number of genes/environments and obtained novel biological insights that could explain how trans-acting factors, including post-transcriptional and post-translation modifications, impact mRNA, protein and traits. Furthermore, a time course would be interesting to analyse and determine how trans-acting variants affect mRNA and protein levels over time and whether they correlate or not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Brion Lutz and Albert detail the simultaneous mapping of trans-acting QTLs influencing mRNA production and steady-state protein level differences between yeast strains BY4741 and RM-11 for ten genes. While much work has previously been done evaluating mRNA-QTLs in this system and others, the simultaneous comparison of transcription and protein QTLs, even for a relatively small set of genes, is significant and timely. The authors used a clever experimental system that converts transcription rates of test genes into mCherry expression by CRISPR activation. Notably, the authors find most QTLs affect protein levels, but not mRNA levels, and that mRNA-QTLs do not always have the same effects on protein levels. They also report genome-wide comparisons of a YAK1 kinase allele-swap on steady-state protein and mRNA levels. Overall, the manuscript describes important results that suggest more study of pQTLs is needed to better model the impact of transcription regulatory variation. While generally solid, the authors should further evaluate the effects of the mCherry plateau and examine protein-protein interactions for each of the ten genes to evaluate how these might contribute to the disparities between RNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs. They are also missing important citations that should be included for scholarly accuracy. Numbered issues (chronological):</p><p>1) Introduction: the authors should include Emerson et al., 2010 for yeast, and references of similar work in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including McManus et al., 2010; Coolon et al., 2014 and Huang et al., 2015 and potentially others.</p><p>2) Introduction paragraph three: Cenik et al., 2015 also used ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry to examine post-transcriptional variation amont human LCLs and should be cited.</p><p>3) One caveat to the experimental approach is the plateau in mCherry measurements at high transcription rates. The authors argue that this plateau does not affect most genes, by comparing qPCR signal from inducible GFP and ACT1. However, this seems problematic because the PCR efficiency of GFP and ACT1 may not be identical. Thus it's possible the mRNA plateau occurs at a lower level. If this were the case, one would expect to see fewer mRNA-QTLs for highly expressed genes than for low-expression genes. Is there any relationship between expression levels (RNA-seq) and number of mRNA-QTLs among the 10 genes tested? If high mRNA genes are artifactually missing mRNA-QTLs, it's possible more pQTLs also affect mRNA levels.</p><p>4) A related complication of the assay system is that the tested genes do not have native 3' UTRs or cleavage and polyadenylation sites (CPS). The &quot;strength&quot; of CPS, has an important impact on mRNA levels and may influence both mRNA stability and transcription (See Shalem et al. PMID: 25875337). The 3' UTR issue should be discussed.</p><p>5) &quot;A majority of the loci corresponded to protein-QTLs that did not overlap an mRNA-QTL&quot;. Were these non-matching QTLs more common in genes with high mRNA levels (i.e. could this reflect the mCherry plateau)?</p><p>6) Figure 5 shows variation among the number of pQTLs and mRNA-QTLs for the 10 studied genes. In the Discussion, the authors note that some p-QTLs could result by changes in protein complex members. Is there any relationship between the number of pQTLs for genes and the number of protein-protein interactions each gene has?</p><p>7) The YAK1 mutation was identified as altering protein (but not mRNA) levels of ARO8, BMH2 and GPD1. The genome-wide RNA-seq and Mass-spec comparison of YAK1 alleles appears to only show this affect for GPD1. Were the other genes also significantly altered in mRNA or protein levels in this orthogonal experiment?</p><p>8) The paper ends with the suggestion that protein abundance is under more complex genetic control than mRNA abundance. While this seems very likely in general (before the results presented in this paper) due to protein turnover and post-translational modifications, I think the authors should reiterate at the end of the paper that this is for trans-QTLs specifically. I expect that cis-QTLs have more consistent influences on mRNA and protein levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60645.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper presents a creative, novel strategy for quantifying expression of RNA and protein of the same genes in the same cells.

Either way, how different trans-factors can interact with target genes and be responsible for expression and protein differences?</p></disp-quote><p>1) The plateau in mRNA levels has been addressed as follows:</p><p>– As requested by reviewer #2, we examined the robustness of our chosen threshold of half the abundance of <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA by comparing the abundance of <italic>ACT1</italic> we had used to that in another RNA-Seq dataset. In both datasets, the expression of the vast majority of genes are below this threshold, which is consistent with our prior interpretation of these data in the paper. We have also reworded the manuscript to make clear that we view this “threshold” as a broad guideline rather than a hard, numerically precise threshold.</p><p>– As requested by reviewer #3, we asked whether mRNA abundance as measured by external RNA-Seq data correlates with the number of mRNA-QTLs or protein-specific QTLs we detected. We found no such relationship, suggesting that the mCherry plateau does not greatly influence our results.</p><p>2) Our manuscript presents several novel advances:</p><p>First, and most obviously, we introduce a novel method. We anticipate that the reporter system we describe will find uses well beyond QTL mapping. To name just one example, at conferences where we have presented this work, we had discussions with bioengineers who were considering our method for real-time monitoring of the production of compounds or peptides in yeast bioreactors, in cases where large protein tags such as GFP would interfere with compound production. While detailed discussion of these possibilities is out of the scope of the current manuscript, we are confident that our method will be useful in many applications.</p><p>Regarding a perceived lack of biological insight, we believe that this was largely an issue with our previous presentation of the background literature. We have now addressed this with a completely rewritten Introduction (see point 3 below) to highlight the lack of consensus in the field on the relationship between eQTLs and pQTLs. We started this study believing this lack of consensus is mostly due to technical limitations of prior work (small sample size and experimental variability). We explicitly designed our system to be as free from these issues as possible. Thus, a possible outcome of our work was that in our well-controlled system, most discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs would disappear. The fact that these discrepancies did not disappear is an important and novel result.</p><p>Finally, we want to stress that our manuscript includes fine-mapping of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting pQTL to the causal variant. Fine-mapping causal variants is not a trivial task, making this fine-mapped variant a novel result in its own right.</p><p>3) To help readers appreciate the novelty of our results, we have followed the editor’s suggestion to clarify expectations regarding the discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs. To do so, we rewrote the Introduction entirely. It now includes an expanded review of the eQTL/pQTL literature in multiple species (human, mouse, plants, and yeast). The new Introduction details discrepancies between the results reported by different studies. Briefly, different studies report different degrees to which a typical eQTL is also a pQTL for the same gene. There is also a range of reports on what fraction of pQTLs arises from protein-specific processes. We see no consensus in the literature on these questions, and our Introduction now makes this point more forcefully.</p><p>We go on to describe in more detail than before exactly how the technical shortcomings of earlier work (i.e., small sample size and / or comparisons across studies) may have inflated discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs. We believe that this rewritten Introduction makes it clear why the work we describe here was necessary, and why our results matter: although our system controlled for environmental factors and had high statistical power, we still found many discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs.</p><p>4) Regarding the comment “Authors claim that [it] is not statistical, however large effect trans-QTLs are conserved across e-pQTLs.”: This is a fair point, and we discuss this below in more detail in our response to reviewer #2. To briefly restate here, we cannot formally rule out that incomplete power to detect mRNA-QTLs may have contributed to some apparent protein-specific QTLs, just like we cannot rule out the inverse scenario for mRNA-specific QTLs. Our manuscript explicitly acknowledges this possibility, includes analyses that aim to address limited statistical power, and provides evidence that while incomplete power undoubtedly leads to some false calls of specific QTLs, it is unlikely to account for all of them.</p><p>5) Regarding the comments “the molecular mechanisms responsible for different mRNA and pQTLs” and “how different trans-factors can interact with target genes and be responsible for expression and protein differences?”. To our knowledge, the only protein-specific <italic>trans</italic>-pQTLs that have been reported in some detail are effects on protein complex stoichiometry (although we are not aware of experimental confirmation of these causal relationships). This mechanism is discussed in the revised Discussion section. We agree that experimental dissection of additional protein-specific <italic>trans</italic>-pQTLs would help to elucidate the mechanistic nature of eQTL and pQTL; however, we believe this is out the scope of the present paper, given the considerable challenges in identifying the causal genes and variants in QTL regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>This is an interesting study that presents a very clever method of quantifying mRNA and protein expression simultaneously.

This would be more convincing if scatter plots were presented that show that after the sorting there is no correlation between the green and red signal, or if there is, an explanation as to why.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. First, we’d like to emphasize that these experiments, in which we measured the response to phenotypic selection after a few generations of growth, are informed by the breeder’s equation in quantitative genetics. This equation relates the strength of selection that is applied to a population (defined as the difference in mean phenotype between selected and unselected individuals) to the phenotypic response to selection (defined as the shift in mean of the population after one generation). The breeder’s equation is usually applied to a single generation of sexually reproducing diploid organisms, making its use in our haploid segregants (which undergo multiple mitotic cell divisions but no meiosis after FACS) imperfect. Nevertheless, it provides a framework for interpreting the shifts in mean phenotypes that we reported.</p><p>Second, our selection scheme would not necessarily be expected to result in a strong reduction in correlation between mRNA and protein. Specifically, the effects of each individual locus are small compared to the nongenetic cell-to-cell noise in gene expression, which can reach up to 100-fold variation even in isogenic yeast cell populations. This means that our selections are most likely not strong enough to result in pure populations, in which every cell carries all alleles that increase (or decrease) protein or mRNA at all or even most loci across the genome. Instead, we fully expect that our sorted extreme populations still contain alleles for high and low expression at many QTLs. This expectation is confirmed by the fact that complete fixation of opposite alleles in high vs low populations was almost never observed in this work, consistent with our previous bulk-segregant studies.</p><p>Therefore, each of our extreme populations still segregates at multiple QTLs. Because a portion of these QTLs do influence both mRNA and protein, these loci are expected to create a correlation between mRNA and protein even after selection. To confirm this, we computed the correlations between red and green fluorescence in each population, and compared their magnitude before and after sorting:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the y-axis shows the difference between the mCherry/GFP correlation coefficients measured after FACS and growth of an unsorted population (“all_pop”) or the fluorescence-based sorted population (“sorted_pop”). The numbered populations are: 1=low mCherry, 2=high mCherry, 3=low GFP, 4=high GFP. There is one subplot per gene, with lines connecting the four populations from a given biological replicate. The “NA” population refers to untagged cells (as explained in Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60645-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In most populations, there is not a consistent difference in correlation coefficients between cells during FACS and after growth. The only consistent exception is the gene <italic>CYC1</italic>, where the post-growth cells do show reduced correlation. This gene is affected by a strong QTL, such that FACS can create relatively “pure” populations of cells that all share one of the alleles at this locus. Note that even here, the other QTLs affecting this gene do still segregate and create correlations among single cells. We hope that these explanations address this comment. We have chosen to keep our presentation of the results in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be easier to read the paper if after the method has been introduced the text referred to mRNA and protein expression rather than the color of the reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point, and one that we had discussed extensively while preparing our manuscript. As the reviewer will appreciate, there is a tradeoff here between slightly greater ease of reading and more exact language. Specifically, while we certainly assume (and believe to have shown) that “red” mCherry corresponds to mRNA and “green” GFP to protein, we ultimately can only say with certainty that we measure fluorescence signals during flow cytometry. Therefore, when describing flow cytometry, we had opted to refer to the observed quantities (i.e. fluorescence) rather than the molecules they report on. For example, we do feel it is more appropriate to say that sorting was performed based on “mCherry”, rather than, say “mRNA”. However, note that as the text progresses to presenting the QTL results, it already has a transition in terminology to “mRNA-QTLs” and “protein-QTLs”, as opposed to “mCherry-QTLs” and “GFP-QTLs”.</p><p>We have reworded some instances of where this terminology may have been confusing (e.g. Figure 4 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors refer to the protein QTL as &quot;post-transcriptional&quot;, but I think that term makes one think of mRNA stability, which is not what is measured. Perhaps &quot;translational control&quot; would be more correct and clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Our use of “post-transcriptional” was intended to be understood very literally, to refer to any process that may affect protein abundance after transcription. As the reviewer correctly notes, because our mCherry system stops reporting on the fate of the mRNA after the gRNA has been released, it indeed cannot report on mRNA degradation (other than for some mRNAs that are degraded before gRNA release is complete). However, GFP-tag signal is sensitive to mRNA degradation, to the extent that mRNA degradation limits the time available for translation and therefore the number of protein molecules that can be generated from a given mRNA molecule. Further, we feel that “translational control” is too specific, since it omits possible influences of protein degradation on protein abundance. For these reasons, we think that the term “post-transcriptional” is appropriately specific [because it only excludes the one process (transcription) that will have the strongest influence on mCherry signal] but also sufficiently broad (because it captures any mechanism that can shape protein abundance downstream of transcription). Therefore, we have decided to keep this term in the paper. We have added a brief statement to the Discussion that makes clear that we take “post-transcriptional” to mean “mRNA stability, translation, or protein degradation”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the rationale for showing δ-allele frequencies in Figure 4A? Showing LOD scores in this figure would make more sense to me for reporting QTL.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for showing δ-AF is four-fold. First, LOD scores would not show the direction of effect at a given QTL (i.e., whether the BY or the RM allele increases expression), while δ-AF does show this. Second, the relationship between δ-AF and LOD scores is not linear: as δ-AF approaches fixation, the LOD score rises quickly. From a visualization standpoint, this creates the issue that strong QTLs, if shown at full scale, “blow out” the display, such that weaker loci become very hard to see. These two points are the main reason we chose to use δ-AF in this figure.</p><p>Third, LOD scores estimated by the “Multipool” algorithm we use are sensitive to the depth of sequencing coverage. At higher coverage, LOD scores increase for a given effects size, because deeper sequencing provides more certainty to the model that the allele frequencies in the two populations are not the same. We acknowledge that this is not a major concern for our present work, because sequencing coverage is fairly similar across our samples. Fourth, the δ-AFs are a more “raw” display of the data than LOD scores; these allele frequencies are directly derived from the actual measurements (i.e. allele counts in Illumina data). Together, these points led us to use δ-AF as the more appropriate choice for displaying the data visually.</p><p>Note that our supplementary tables do of course report LOD scores, along with many other characteristics of each QTL, such that interested readers have full access to this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not intuitive to me that δ-allele frequencies correspond to effect sizes and this should be more clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We illustrate the relationship between effect size and δ AF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, which is based on simulated bulk segregant mapping experiments. We have also added a brief explanation of these considerations to the Materials and methods, at the end of the “QTL mapping” section.</p><p>Consider a population of cells made up of two subpopulations that each carry one of two alleles at a QTL that affects the given trait (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The effect of the QTL is given by the difference in mean between the two subpopulations. When we use FACS on the combined population, we use the indicated thresholds for picking “high” vs “low” cells. Note that in the high population defined by the “high” threshold, the fraction of cells with the BY allele is lower than the cells with the RM allele, and vice versa for the low population. The ratio of BY to RM alleles in the extreme populations determines the allele frequencies, and subtracting these from each other gives the δ AF metric that we use as a measure of effect size.</p><p>If we increase the effect size of the QTL, the two subpopulations are being pushed further apart, and the degree of genotype enrichment in the two extreme populations increases. This increases δ AF, as shown on the right for a range of simulated effect sizes. Note that the relationship between effect size and δ AF is not linear, especially for strong QTLs, but that δ AF rises monotonically as a function of effect size.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60645-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear to me if there is any compensation used in the FACS analysis.

The authors present a fast and accurate novel strategy, taking advantage of a CRISPR strategy, and FACS analysis in a highly used yeast cross. Unfortunately, this work does not provide novel genetic, neither biological insights and conclusions are similar to previous findings. I would recommend the authors try to extend their work to a higher number of genes/environments and obtained novel biological insights that could explain how trans-acting factors, including post-transcriptional and post-translation modifications, impact mRNA, protein and traits. Furthermore, a time course would be interesting to analyse and determine how trans-acting variants affect mRNA and protein levels over time and whether they correlate or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our method. While we look forward to applying our reporter system to additional proteins and questions in future work, we consider the scale of experiments suggested by the reviewer to be out of the scope of the present manuscript. In addition, we politely disagree that our work has not provided novel insights, but do acknowledge that our presentation of the background literature for this work may have obscured some novelty, as also pointed out by the editor.</p><p>To address this, we have worked to improve our presentation of the background literature as well as our new insights in the paper. Specifically, we have rewritten the entire Introduction to provide a more detailed review of existing comparisons between eQTLs and pQTLs from several species (human, mouse, plants, and, of course, yeast). In our opinion, the literature is far from settled on how well eQTLs and pQTLs agree. For example, while some studies have shown that most <italic>cis</italic>-acting eQTLs are also pQTLs, others have reported systematic buffering of the effects of <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs such that they have smaller, if any, effects on the proteins of the same gene. Likewise, for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs, some studies report nearly complete lack of overlap (indeed, Foss et al., 2011 even pointed out that <italic>trans</italic>-QTLs may show less overlap than expected by chance), while others focus on relatively strong correlations of effect sizes to indicate that most <italic>trans</italic>-acting variants have consistent effects. Whether or not eQTL/pQTL discrepancies exist is an important and open question. Among other implications for the biology of gene expression, this question raises the practical issue of how informative existing studies of mRNA expression variation are, including many large-scale projects in human genetics, if mRNA expression changes do not correlate with changes in protein expression.</p><p>Our revised Introduction now stresses more explicitly technical considerations in earlier work related to 1) low statistical power and 2) experimental differences between studies across which eQTLs and pQTL are almost always compared. These two issues have the potential to create the impression of discrepant eQTLs and pQTLs, even if eQTLs and pQTLs were consistent in reality.</p><p>Our new approach here was explicitly designed to directly address both of these issues. We aimed to create a system that maximizes the chance of detecting consistency between eQTLs and pQTLs. The fact that we nevertheless detected considerable discrepancies between eQTLs and pQTLs is an important result. In addition to our rewritten Introduction, we have also emphasized these points more in the Discussion section.</p><p>On a more technical level, we are convinced that our reporter system could find uses outside of mapping regulatory genetic variation. Finally, we stress that fine-mapping QTLs to the causal variant remains a difficult challenge. That we were able to accomplish it here for the <italic>YAK1</italic> gene adds further novelty to our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Brion Lutz and Albert detail the simultaneous mapping of trans-acting QTLs influencing mRNA production and steady-state protein level differences between yeast strains BY4741 and RM-11 for ten genes. While much work has previously been done evaluating mRNA-QTLs in this system and others, the simultaneous comparison of transcription and protein QTLs, even for a relatively small set of genes, is significant and timely. The authors used a clever experimental system that converts transcription rates of test genes into mCherry expression by CRISPR activation. Notably, the authors find most QTLs affect protein levels, but not mRNA levels, and that mRNA-QTLs do not always have the same effects on protein levels. They also report genome-wide comparisons of a YAK1 kinase allele-swap on steady-state protein and mRNA levels. Overall, the manuscript describes important results that suggest more study of pQTLs is needed to better model the impact of transcription regulatory variation. While generally solid, the authors should further evaluate the effects of the mCherry plateau and examine protein-protein interactions for each of the ten genes to evaluate how these might contribute to the disparities between RNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs. They are also missing important citations that should be included for scholarly accuracy. Numbered issues (chronological):</p><p>1) Introduction: the authors should include Emerson et al., 2010 for yeast, and references of similar work in Drosophila, including McManus et al., 2010; Coolon et al., 2014 and Huang et al., 2015 and potentially others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. As part of our revised Introduction, we have added the requested references, along with others. Some of the references suggested by the reviewer examined F1 hybrids and parent strains, but did not perform linkage analysis in segregants (which was the intended topic of this sentence) and in some cases examined divergent species rather than strains of the same species. For these reasons, we had not cited these papers before. To accommodate these references in the revision, we have changed the sentence in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“By contrast, experimental crosses in organisms such as yeast (Albert et al., 2018; Brem et al., 2002; Brion et al., 2020; Clément-Ziza et al., 2014; Emerson et al., 2010; Thompson and Cubillos, 2017), plants (Fu et al., 2013; West et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011), worms (Snoek et al., 2017; Viñuela et al., 2010), flies (Coolon et al., 2014; Everett et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2015; McManus et al., 2010), and mouse (Gerrits et al., 2009; Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2016) have quantified the global contribution of cis and trans-acting variation and identified thousands of trans-eQTLs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction paragraph three: Cenik et al., 2015 also used ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry to examine post-transcriptional variation amont human LCLs and should be cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this reference, as well as Wu et al., 2013 as an early application for mass spectrometry for pQTL mapping in human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One caveat to the experimental approach is the plateau in mCherry measurements at high transcription rates. The authors argue that this plateau does not affect most genes, by comparing qPCR signal from inducible GFP and ACT1. However, this seems problematic because the PCR efficiency of GFP and ACT1 may not be identical. Thus it's possible the mRNA plateau occurs at a lower level. If this were the case, one would expect to see fewer mRNA-QTLs for highly expressed genes than for low-expression genes. Is there any relationship between expression levels (RNA-seq) and number of mRNA-QTLs among the 10 genes tested? If high mRNA genes are artifactually missing mRNA-QTLs, it's possible more pQTLs also affect mRNA levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted the analysis reviewer suggested, and found no relationship between a gene’s mRNA expression in the Albert, Bloom et al., 2018 data and the number of mRNA-QTLs (or any other type of QTL). Specifically, while the correlation between the number mRNA-QTLs and mRNA abundance did have a negative coefficient (rho = -0.15), the correlation was not significant (p = 0.67). Thus, this analysis suggests that the mCherry plateau does not cause systematic underestimation of the number of mRNA-QTLs in our data.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer’s point that the comparison of <italic>ACT1</italic> qPCR and RNA-seq is not without problems, as also noted by reviewer 2 above.

The &quot;strength&quot; of CPS, has an important impact on mRNA levels and may influence both mRNA stability and transcription (See Shalem et al. PMID: 25875337). The 3' UTR issue should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have added a discussion of the possible consequence of 3’ UTR removal to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Like other reporters that tag the 3’ end of genes, our system decouples the native 3’ UTR from the gene of interest. 3’ UTRs can influence gene expression, and genetic trans-effects that involve mechanisms that target the 3’ UTR would be missed by our system. However, loss of the native 3’ UTR is not expected to inflate differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs. Instead, 3’ UTR removal may reduce differences between mRNA-QTLs and protein-QTLs because it eliminates an element of the mRNA that could be a target for mRNA-specific processes”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;A majority of the loci corresponded to protein-QTLs that did not overlap an mRNA-QTL&quot;.

We do not think that the mCherry plateau is responsible for these protein-specific QTLs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5 shows variation among the number of pQTLs and mRNA-QTLs for the 10 studied genes. In the Discussion, the authors note that some p-QTLs could result by changes in protein complex members. Is there any relationship between the number of pQTLs for genes and the number of protein-protein interactions each gene has?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we extracted physical protein/protein interactions from the bioGRID database (https://thebiogrid.org/). Genes with more of these interactions tended to have a higher number of protein-QTLs (rho = 0.51) as well as protein-specific QTLs (rho = 0.55) but neither of these results was statistically significant (p-values: 0.13 and 0.10, respectively). We suspect that ten genes is likely not enough to test this question rigorously. Future analyses with more genes may well strengthen the significance of this relationship.
