disease-carrying vectors. Assessment of current and future risks associated with the mosquito population requires knowledge of the full repertoire of pathogens they carry, including novel viruses, as well as their blood meal sources. Unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of individual mosquitoes offers a straightforward, rapid, and quantitative means to acquire this information. Here, we profile 148 diverse wild-caught mosquitoes collected in California and detect sequences from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, 24 known and 46 novel viral species. Importantly, sequencing individuals greatly enhanced the value of the biological information obtained. It allowed us to (a) speciate host mosquito, (b) compute the prevalence of each microbe and recognize a high frequency of viral co-infections, (c) associate animal pathogens with specific blood meal sources, and (d) apply simple co-occurrence methods to recover previously undetected components of highly prevalent segmented viruses. In the context of emerging diseases, where knowledge about vectors, pathogens, and reservoirs is lacking, the approaches described here can provide actionable information for public health surveillance and intervention decisions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>viral discovery</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>mosquito</kwd><kwd>blood meal reservoir</kwd><kwd>xenosurveillance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Batson</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Retallack</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ratnasiri</surname><given-names>Kalani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>How large-scale single mosquito metatranscriptomics can define the mosquito’s complex microbiota and its blood meal sources, and contribute critical epidemiological information needed to control vector borne disease transmission, is shown.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mosquitoes are known to carry more than 20 different eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral agents that are pathogenic to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">WHO, 2017</xref>). Infections by these mosquito-borne pathogens account for over half a million human deaths per year, millions of disability-adjusted life years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">GBD 2017 Causes of Death Collaborators, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">GBD 2017 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018</xref>), and periodic die-offs of economically important domesticated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pagès and Cohnstaedt, 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent studies of global patterns of urbanization and warming, as well as the possibility of mosquito transport via long-range atmospheric wind patterns point to an increasing probability of a global expansion of mosquito habitat and a potential concomitant rise in mosquito-borne diseases within the next two to three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huestis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kraemer et al., 2019</xref>). While mosquito control has played a major role in eliminating transmission of these diseases in many parts of the world, costs and resources associated with basic control measures, combined with emerging pesticide resistance, pose a growing challenge in maintaining these gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Female mosquitoes take up blood meals from humans and diverse animals in their environment and serve as a major source of trans-species introductions of infectious microbes. For well-studied mosquito-borne human pathogens such as West Nile virus, an understanding of the transmission dynamics between animal reservoir, mosquito vector, and human hosts has been essential for public health monitoring and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmeister, 2011</xref>). In contrast, transmission dynamics are less clear for emerging microbes with pathogenic potential. Metagenomic sequencing of individual mosquitoes offers a potential single assay to comprehensively identify mosquito species, the pathogens they carry and the animal hosts that define a transmission cycle.</p><p>We also lack a comprehensive understanding of the composition of the endogenous mosquito microbiota, which has been suggested to impact the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of pathogenic mosquito-borne microbes. For example, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, a highly prevalent bacterial endosymbiont of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Werren et al., 2008</xref>) has been shown to inhibit replication of various mosquito-borne, human-pathogenic viruses when introduced into susceptible mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>). These observations have led to the development of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based mosquito control programs for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, which vector yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus. Experimental releases of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes transinfected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of dengue virus infections in local human populations. Laboratory-based studies have identified additional endogenous mosquito microbes, such as midgut bacteria and several insect-specific flaviviruses. Greater knowledge of these endogenous microbes could inform their potential use in interfering with mosquito acquisition of and competence to transmit pathogenic <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species and human flaviviruses, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the composition of endogenous microbes and the viruses in individual mosquitoes would be needed to establish a role for these agents in naturally occurring infections and/or transmission of known human pathogens.</p><p>Several recent, unbiased metagenomic analyses of batches of mosquito pools collected around the world have begun to address these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fauver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pettersson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sadeghi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao et al., 2018b</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atoni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao et al., 2018b</xref>). These studies, which have primarily focused on analysis of viruses, have expanded our understanding of the breadth of viral diversity present in mosquito populations worldwide. More recently, similar approaches have been applied to examine the mosquito virome across different life stages of both lab-reared and wild-caught <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, providing intriguing insights to the potential stability and diversity of the mosquito virome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these insights, key epidemiologic information needed to direct interventions is still lacking. This includes the measurement of viral prevalence within mosquito populations, their potential reservoir sources, or the impact that additional bacterial and eukaryotic microbes carried by mosquitoes might have on virus carriage, transmission, and pathogenesis.</p><p>Single mosquito analyses are required to link blood meal sources, endogenous microbes, and co-occurring pathogens. A handful of small-scale studies have demonstrated that it is possible to identify divergent viruses and evidence of other microbes in single mosquitoes via metagenomic next-generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bigot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we analyzed the metatranscriptomes of 148 individual mosquitoes collected in California, USA. We characterized the composition of their co-infecting microbes, quantified the prevalence and load of detectable viruses and selected bacterial and eukaryotic microbes, and identified blood meal sources and their associated pathogens. Crucially, sequencing a large number of individuals allowed for simple co-occurrence analyses that extended the sensitivity to detect missing or as-yet unidentified viral genome segments with no recognizable homology to previously described sequences. Our findings demonstrate how large-scale single mosquito metatranscriptomics can define both the mosquito’s complex microbiota, including mosquito-borne pathogens, and its blood meal sources, thus contributing critical epidemiological information needed to control transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mosquito host speciation by comparative whole transcriptome analysis</title><p>Adult <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic>, and <italic>Culiseta</italic> mosquito species circulating in California in late fall of 2017 were collected to acquire a diverse and representative set of 148 mosquitoes for metatranscriptomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis. We targeted collections across a variety of habitats within five geographically distinct counties in Northern and Southern California (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Visual mosquito species identification was performed at the time of collection (Materials and methods, results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Primarily female mosquitoes were included to enrich for blood-feeding members of the population responsible for transmission of animal and human diseases. Total RNA extracted from each mosquito was used as the input template for mNGS to capture both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated host, viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic RNAs (Materials and methods; overall sequence yields for each mosquito are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Given the important role of accurate identification of mosquito species for understanding geospatial mosquito circulation and vector-pathogen interactions, and the potential for human error in visual inspection, we investigated if single mosquito mNGS could provide a complementary, unbiased molecular method for identifying mosquito species. Because complete genome sequences were not available for all mosquito species identified visually in this set, we applied a reference-free, kmer-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris, 2018</xref>) to compute pairwise genetic distances between the complete metatranscriptomes acquired for each of the 148 mosquitoes. Samples were grouped using hierarchical clustering and the most common visually identified species within each group was taken as a consensus species call for that group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for detailed alignment of visual calls with the clustered genetic distance matrix, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s2sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref> for underlying data). These molecular groupings of mosquito genera and species agreed the visual calls for 95% of the specimens (n = 140/147, one sample had no visual identification). The discordant calls occurred in two contexts reported to present challenges to morphology-based speciation: (1) within the <italic>Culex</italic> genus in which genetic hybridization among species members has been documented and reported to confound accurate morphological speciation in California <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kothera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McAbee et al., 2008</xref>; and (2) between samples belonging to the <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Culiseta</italic> genera that share some overlap in morphology, and require detection of features (perspiracular bristles and subcostal wing vein bristles) that can be lost or damaged during trapping and handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darsie and Ward, 2016</xref>). Thus, we used the transcriptome-based species calls for this study. There is additional within-species structure visible on the hierarchical clustering tree that, for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Culex erythrothorax</italic>, coincides with geographic structure, raising the possibility that molecular methods may also provide insight into the distribution of subspecies as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Taken together, these data show that comparative transcriptome analysis of single mosquito mNGS data can provide critical information regarding the identity and diversity of circulating mosquitoes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Whole transcriptome analysis for mosquito species identification.</title><p>Hierarchical clustering of pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances between whole transcriptome sequences from the 148 mosquitoes included in this study estimated using SKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris, 2018</xref>).

We first filtered host, low quality, and low complexity sequences from each transcriptome dataset. A total set of 26.9 million reads passed all of these filters. A set of 891,00 contigs were de novo assembled from 21.8 million of these reads (81%). To classify and quantify the reads assembled into the contigs into viral, eukaryotic or prokaryotic taxa, we aligned each contig to the NCBI nucleotide and non-redundant protein databases. 17.1 million reads were assembled into contigs that yielded plausible BLAST alignments, while 4.7 million reads were assembled into contigs corresponding to metagenomic ‘dark matter’, that is contigs without recognizable homology to previously published sequence data. After lowest common ancestor analysis (LCA) and decontamination filtering (see Materials and methods for details), final contig assignments were assigned. Ambiguous contigs correspond to a class of 0.55M reads assembled into contigs that did not readily align to microbial species or plausible bloodmeal hosts. For eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa, only a fraction of a genome was generally detected among contigs. Here, the LCA analysis was generally applied to infer the corresponding taxon assignments of non-host reads assembled into contigs. Within the 4.9 million reads identified as <italic>Eukaryota</italic>, 4.1 million reads contributed to contigs classified as <italic>Hexapoda.</italic> These likely correspond to mosquito host sequences too diverged from available mosquito genome reference sequences to be recognized at the initial host filtering step. Excluding these reads left 12.65 million reads assembled into contigs that were identifiable non-host reads. These were assigned to eukaryotes, bacteria, and viral species based on alignment as diagrammed in the flow chart. Recovery of complete or near complete genomes of RNA viruses facilitated viral taxonomic assignment directly from the BLAST results. We further curated contigs likely to code for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and contigs that were physically unlinked but showed evidence of co-occurrence with viral RdRps (0.34M reads, labeled ‘co-occurrence analysis’, above; details in Materials and methods and manuscript text).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2s1sdata1"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Data underlying counts summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68353-fig2-figsupp1-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68353-fig2-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of all reads in each mosquito.</title><p>A breakdown of reads for each sample, into unassembled (those which did not assemble into contigs), dark (those which assembled but were not identifiable taxonomically), Ambiguous (those with LCA at root or cellular organisms), Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota, Metazoa, Viruses (via alignment to reference), and Viral via co-occurrence analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Of these, only 24 were closely related or identical to previously identified mosquito viruses. The remaining 46 viral genomes shared less than 85% amino acid sequence identity to any publicly available viral sequences (See ‘Virus’ contigs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata2">Table 1—source data 2</xref>). Despite this divergence, family-level sequence conservation of genomic features allowed us to confirm complete genome sequence recovery. For example, conserved sequences were identified at the 5’ and 3’ ends of bunyavirus segments in a novel peribunya-like virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Udune virus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s4sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 4—source data 1</xref>) with 28% to 76% amino acid identity to its closest relative. Only a single mosquito harbored this virus, and at a relatively low abundance of reads (0.02% of total reads). Combining this approach with the co-occurrence investigation detailed below (Figure 6 and main text), we were able to identify and assign the 45 additional novel genomes to specific viral taxa. Thus, single mosquito analysis provides a highly sensitive approach to detect new and divergent viral species circulating in mosquito populations, even when present at low prevalence or abundance.</p><p>Single mosquito analysis also shed light on the variability in the composition and number of viral reads both within and across mosquito species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel), and their corresponding collection sites (indicated by colored bar plot at the bottom of the plots). Importantly, among single mosquitoes, co-infections predominated, with 88% of mosquitoes harboring two or more (median 3) distinct viral taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Focused analysis of viral species within single mosquitoes provides the opportunity to examine the proportion of viruses within each of these co-infections, which in turn can inform and extend our understanding of the distribution patterns of known and emerging novel viruses within the mosquito population, and the frequency of associated co-infecting viruses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, shows the wide range in the number and type of viruses that are detected across individual mosquitoes. For instance, several <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito species stand out as outliers harboring only a single viral species encompassing a large proportion of the non-host reads assembled into contigs in that mosquito (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel: <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> species [dark green bars] in <italic>Culex tarsalis; Tombusviridae</italic> and <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> species [light blue bars] in <italic>Culex erythrothorax</italic>). At the other end of the spectrum are multiple examples of individual mosquitoes that do not stand out with regard to the proportion of non-host reads assembled into viral contigs, yet still harbor a mixture of 4 or more viruses present at &gt;1% of the non-host reads assembled into contigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel - see especially <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> and <italic>Culiseta</italic> species plots). Other viruses are detected broadly across diverse mosquito species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel, see the <italic>Solemoviridae/Luteoviridae</italic> [yellow bars], <italic>Narnaviridae</italic> [blue bars], <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> [light blue bars], and <italic>Dicistroviridae/Iflaviridae</italic> [dark green bars]). Interestingly, in some mosquito species, these viruses are the predominant proportion of the non-host reads assembled into viral contigs, while in other mosquito species where these viruses are detected, they make up only a minor fraction. For example, compare <italic>Solemoviridae/Luteoviridae</italic> [yellow bars] in <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> species, or <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> [light blue bars] in <italic>Culex erythrothorax</italic> and <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> species.

These distinct patterns of viral distribution point to potentially testable hypotheses as to their causes, such as mosquito species susceptibility or competence to vector a virus, the potential pathogenicity of a given virus (or mixture of viruses), or factors in the environment, such as food sources or weather. Regardless of the ultimate source of this variability, such insights are only possible by analyzing mosquitoes individually rather than in bulk.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Quantifying viral diversity in and prevalence among single mosquitoes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of mosquitoes within the study in which no, one, or multiple viral lineages were detectable. The sample with 13 distinct viral lineages is sample CMS002_053a that contains six Botourmia-like viruses thought to primarily infect fungi and in which evidence of an ergot fungus was detected.

For the 25 samples collected in or near the marshlands of Coyote Hills Regional Park, we compare our calls to the wildlife observations in iNaturalist, a citizen science project for mapping and sharing observations of biodiversity. iNaturalist reports observations consistent with all five categories, including various species of squirrel, rabbit, raccoon, muskrat, and mule deer.

This striking co-occurrence suggests a possible burden of anaplasmosis in the local deer population. Additionally, we detected evidence for three other bloodborne pathogens which, because of the small number of observations, could not pass the threshold of statistical significance. These included an orbivirus closely related to those known to infect deer, a <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species previously found in birds, and the apicomplexans <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Eimeria</italic> from species known to infect birds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). The likely hosts of these pathogens were also concordant with the blood meal calls. Thus, sensitive and comprehensive metagenomic analysis of single mosquitoes not only provides information as to paths of transmission, it also provides a tool to detect emerging pathogens within animal communities in their environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Recovery and assignment of previously unrecognizable viral genome segments and species within the orthomyxovirus family</title><p>Although many new viruses can be identified in bulk samples, the majority of these are identified only via their conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recovering complete genomes for segmented viruses from bulk samples is challenging, as genes that are not highly conserved may be unrecognizable by sequence homology. Moreover, the assignment of putative segments to a single genome can be confounded if the pooled libraries are derived from mosquitoes with multiple infections of related segmented viruses.</p><p>By sequencing many individual mosquitoes, we can exploit the fact that all segments of a segmented virus will co-occur in the samples where that virus is present and be absent in samples where the virus is absent. Applying these criteria to our data analysis should enable the identification of previously unidentified viral genome segments. To do this, we first grouped all contigs that were longer than 500 nucleotides into clusters of highly homologous contigs, then grouped these clusters by co-occurrence across all of the 148 individual mosquitos sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, this required only the sequence information from the study, without using any external reference. We then scanned each cluster for sequences containing a viral RdRp domain (see Materials and methods). For each RdRp cluster, we consider any other contig cluster whose sample group overlaps the set of samples in the viral RdRp cluster above a threshold of 80% as a putative segment of the corresponding virus. A cluster-by-sample heatmap for all segments co-occurring with RdRps resulted in 27 candidate complete genomes for segmented viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s1sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s1sdata2">Figure 6—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). Out of a total of 145 contig clusters, 75 were non-RdRp segments. Of these 75 non-RdRp segments 60 bore recognizable homology (colored in black) to their expected counterparts, based on associated RdRp segments and 15 were linked to recognizable partial genomes via co-occurrence. This supports the notion that the remaining 15 putative segments (colored in red), which lack homology to any known sequences at either nucleotide or amino acid level, may indeed be part of viral genomes.

Only validation of the last dark segment we recovered, RNA 8 of Elemess virus, can thus be called cursory in comparison. As a cypo-like virus (<italic>Reoviridae</italic>), Elemess virus is expected to have at least ten segments. The co-occurrence of a random bit of RNA with consistent length across the same five samples where recognizable segments of Elemess virus were found is quite unlikely in its own right, and its lack of recognizable homology to any non-viral species on GenBank or via HHpred, makes it more likely to be a genuine viral segment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate how mNGS of single mosquitoes, together with reference-free analyses and public databases, provides – in a single assay – critical and actionable epidemiological information. This includes quantitative information regarding circulating mosquito species, pathogen prevalence, and co-occurrence of diverse known and novel viruses, as well as prokaryotes, eukaryotes, blood meal sources and their potential pathogens. We are able to identify and confirm, using public data, the existence of previously unknown segments of both known and novel viruses, focusing on four quaranjaviruses and Culex narnavirus one as examples. In the context of an emerging disease, where knowledge about vectors, pathogens, and reservoirs is lacking, the techniques described here can be applied to rapidly provide actionable information for public health surveillance and intervention decisions. While unbiased sequencing of individual mosquitoes is not currently practical or appropriate in all contexts, advances in lab automation and rapidly decreasing costs of mNGS technologies are expected to increase the affordability and practicality of single mosquito sequencing in the near future.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Inferring biology from sequence in the context of an incomplete reference</title><p>The power of metatranscriptomic NGS depends on the ability to extract biological information from nucleic acid sequences. For both bulk and single mosquito sequencing studies, the primary link between sequence and biology is provided by public reference databases, and thus the sensitivity of these approaches will depend crucially on the quality and comprehensiveness of those references. In practice, even the largest reference databases, such as nt/nr from NCBI, represent a small portion of the tree of life. Consequently, sequences derived from a sample of environmental or ecological origin, often exhibit only a low percent identity to even the best match in a database. Here, we manage that uncertainty by assigning a sequence to the lowest common ancestor of its best matches in the reference database. However, there is a fundamental limit to the precision of taxonomic identification from an incomplete reference.</p><p>An advantage of single mosquito sequencing is that it offers an orthogonal source of information: the ability to recognize nucleic acid sequences detected in many samples even when they have no homology to a reference sequence. This allowed us to associate unrecognizable sequences with viral polymerases, generating hypothetical complete genomes. The strategy of linking contigs that co-occur across samples is utilized in analysis of human and environmental microbiomes, where it is referred to as ‘metagenomic binning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breitwieser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roumpeka et al., 2017</xref>). Using this approach, we identified previously unknown genome segments establishing that the genome of a large clade of quaranjaviruses (those descended from the common ancestor of WMV6 and GMQV1), like distantly related influenza A and B viruses, consists of 8 segments. We also discovered a second ambigrammatic RNA encoded by the Culex narnavirus that in retrospect was identifiable in multiple previously published mosquito datasets. In sum, we pulled 7% of the reads in the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ fraction of our dataset into the light. The putative complete genomes we identified were supported retrospectively by public datasets and can be further validated by biological experiments or approaches such as short RNA sequencing that indicate a host antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waldron et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another advantage of single mosquito sequencing is the ability to supplement, or potentially circumvent, visual species identifications using molecular data. Accurate mosquito species identification is essential for the control of mosquito-borne diseases, as pathogen competence is often limited to a range of species, such as various <italic>Aedes</italic> species for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses, and <italic>Anopheline</italic> species for malaria. Also, the primary mosquito species responsible for vectoring a disease can vary geographically – West Nile virus has been detected in 65 mosquito species, but a narrow range of <italic>Culex</italic> species drives transmission of the virus. Field validation of which mosquito species carry which pathogens in a specific geographic area informs targeted analysis and control of that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>). Here, though only 3 of the 10 collected mosquito species had complete genome references, it was possible to estimate pairwise SNP distances between samples in a reference-free way and perform an unsupervised clustering. The clusters were 95% concordant with the visual mosquito species calls, and discordant outliers were easy to detect and correct. This approach generalizes to any collection of metatranscriptomes containing multiple representatives of each species. Accurate mosquito identification is essential for selecting the appropriate strategy and materials to control viremic mosquitoes. In a bulk pool of mosquitoes, the microbiota from any miscalled specimens would be blended in with the correctly labeled ones, making it difficult or impossible to deconvolute host species after the fact. By correctly identifying the host range of a known or novel pathogen in a given area, vector control can be appropriately targeted for the prevention of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Distribution of microbes within mosquito populations</title><p>Once sequences have been mapped to taxa, it is relatively straightforward to characterize the composition of the microbes within a circulating population of mosquitoes. This information can inform basic research and epidemiologic questions relevant for modeling the dynamics of infectious agents and the efficacy of interventions. A key parameter is the prevalence of a microbe, which cannot be inferred from bulk data. The 70 viruses identified in this study provide a compelling example. We found the prevalence of viruses ranged from detection in one mosquito (peribunya-like Udune virus) to detection in all 36 <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> samples in the study (Marma virus).</p><p>A significant fraction (n = 46) of the 70 viral genomes we identified in this study correspond to novel divergent viruses. Further studies will be required to understand each of these viruses, and whether they correspond solely to microbial cargo (i.e. non-infecting viral species hitching a ride on the mosquito exterior or via ingestion of blood or nectar), versus insect specific viruses, or potentially transmissible human or animal pathogens. Among the 24 previously described viral genomes we recovered, we did not detect any of the known mosquito-borne human pathogens known to circulate in California (West Nile Virus, St. Louis Encephalitis Virus, Western Equine Encephalitis Virus). The lack of detection of these arboviruses likely reflects their low rate of circulation in the participating control districts during the sample collection period for the study. Indeed, both viruses were detected only sporadically and in only two of the five participating sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for an alignment of data from reports for mosquito pools testing positive for WNV and SLEV and sample collection statistics). In contrast, 10 of the 24 previously described viruses we recovered in this study correspond to viral agents described in a recent bulk mNGS of approximately 12,000 mosquitoes collected in California in 2016 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sadeghi et al., 2018</xref>) or an mNGS study of seven single mosquitoes collected in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandler et al., 2015</xref>). The remaining 15 previously described viral genomes have been observed outside of the state of California, in some cases on completely different continents. While technical differences in study design, types of mosquito populations examined, sample processing prior to RNA extraction, and sequencing approaches likely play a major role in the distinct set of viral genomes we report here, it is also likely that additional broader factors related to less well-understood aspects of the wild-caught mosquito virome and disease ecology – mainly the variability in the prevalence and distribution of mosquito viruses across locations, time, and mosquito host species – form the basis for these observations.</p><p>For some questions, the prevalence data supplied by single mosquito sequencing is helpful for experimental design. For example, in our dataset, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was either absent or endemic in each mosquito species sampled. Thus, although a trend between the amount of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> relative to viral diversity was detectable across samples that harbored <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, it was not possible to detect a statistically significant effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on virome composition or abundance within any species. Nonetheless, our data establish that single mosquito sequencing could address such questions via more extensive, targeted sampling of mosquito populations where <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (or any other agent of interest) is expected to have an intermediate prevalence. This information would be invaluable, as the introduction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> might be a useful biological agent to suppress viral transmission by mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Blood meal sources and xenosurveillance</title><p>The identification of blood meal hosts is important for understanding mosquito ecology and controlling mosquito-borne diseases. Early field observations were supplemented by serology, and, more recently, molecular methods based on host DNA. Currently, the most common method of blood meal identification is targeted PCR enrichment of a highly-conserved ‘barcode’ gene, such as mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I, followed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reeves et al., 2018</xref>). To monitor specific relationships between mosquito, blood meal, and pathogen, studies have combined visual identification of mosquitoes, DNA barcode identification of blood meal, and targeted PCR or serology for pathogen identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batovska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boothe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tedrow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomazatos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we extend the spectrum of molecular methods and show that unbiased mNGS of single mosquitoes can identify blood meal hosts, while simultaneously validating the mosquito species and providing an unbiased look at the pathogens. For these analyses, it is crucial that single mosquitoes were sequenced—if the mosquitoes had been pooled, it would not have been possible to associate potential vertebrate pathogens with a specific blood meal host. This allows for both reservoir identification, which seeks to identify the unknown host of a known pathogen, and xenosurveillance, which seeks to identify the unknown pathogens of specific vertebrate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grubaugh et al., 2015</xref>). For example, in this study, we found a high prevalence of the tick-borne pathogen <italic>Anaplasma</italic> in mosquitoes that had likely ingested a blood meal from deer. Likewise in one of the deer-fed mosquitoes, we detected Lobuck virus, a novel orbivirus isolate that belongs to a clade of viruses implicated in a disease of commercially farmed deer reported in Missouri, Florida, and Pennsylvania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahasan et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahasan et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>), but not California. This sort of novel virus-blood meal host observation provides a starting point to inform an understanding of the interplay between viruses and microbes circulating within the animal and insect populations in a given location. Ultimately, directed analyses in the lab and the field would be required to establish if potential virus-host observations like this Lobuck virus – deer example are (a) indeed present in the putative animal host populations, and (b) can be taken up via blood meal, and maintained and transmitted by mosquitoes.</p><p>Detection of a potential blood meal host in 45/60 of the blood engorged mosquitoes via RNA-based mNGS analysis is encouraging, especially in light of additional evidence of accompanying microbial cargo. The lack of success across all blood engorged mosquitoes may reflect factors that contribute to insufficient blood meal host RNA in the final extracted samples, such as variability in actual blood engorgement between mosquitoes, insufficient amounts of RNA circulating in the blood of certain types of animal hosts, or degradation/digestion of the blood meal RNA within the mosquito prior to extraction. Second, there may be too little information content in the RNA present, that is if it is from a highly conserved portion of a universal gene, there may not be an LCA below ‘cellular organisms' or ‘eukaryota’. A hybrid approach, in which primers for the enrichment of conserved, highly expressed ‘barcode’ genes described above are incorporated at the reverse transcription step (similar to metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment strategy (MSSPE) that has been applied to enrich specific viral species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2020</xref>) may provide a path forward to boost both the recovery rate and resolution of blood meal host identification in the context of RNA-based mNGS analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A critical role for public data in public health</title><p>This study would have been impossible without rich public datasets containing sequences, species, locations, and sampling dates. These provided the backbone of information allowing us to identify the majority of our sequences. Citizen scientist resources, such as the iNaturalist catalog of biodiversity observations, was a valuable complement, providing empirical knowledge of species distributions in the mosquito collection area that resolved the ambiguity we detected in sequence space.</p><p>In sum, complementing conventional analyses of mosquito pools and field observations of mosquitoes and the animals they bite with single mosquito mNGS can provide valuable complementary information to enhance the evidence base for distinct interventions to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases. As shown here, single mosquito mNGS can map an uncharted landscape related to the movement of pathogens between mosquitoes and their reservoirs. This can inform the deployment of targeted detection or surveillance assays for both established and emerging mosquito-borne pathogens across large geographical areas or animal reservoir populations. As mosquitoes and their microbiota continue to evolve and migrate, posing new risks for human and animal populations, these complementary approaches will empower scientists and public health professionals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquito collection</title><p>The 148 adult mosquitoes included in this study were collected at sites indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> using encephalitis virus survey (EVS) or gravid traps that were baited with CO<sub>2</sub> or hay-infused water, respectively.

Due to much higher coverage in Australian samples, Magic-BLAST detected potential RNA splice sites for the smallest segment (hypothetical 3) which would extend the relatively short open reading frame to encompass most of the segment. Sequences of each segment were aligned with MAFFT (Auto setting) and trimmed to coding regions. For the hypothetical 3 segment, we inserted Ns into the sequence near the RNA splice site to bring the rest of the segment sequence into frame.</p><p>PhyML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guindon et al., 2010</xref>) was used to generate maximum likelihood phylogenies under an HKY+<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guindon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasegawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang, 1994</xref>).

The authors demonstrate that they can distill valuable information on the vector species, the source of the blood meals and the microbiome/virome using a simple experimental approach and using single mosquitoes. A highlight of the work is that the paper is very comprehensive with an overwhelming dataset and thoughtful analysis. It is a showcase how sequencing data from a relative compact number of mosquitoes specimens can be used to conduct sophisticated computational analysis leading to meaningful conclusions. The authors make a strong case for the power of mNGS of mosquitoes that may be applicable to other (invertebrate) species. Especially the phylogenetic analysis based on SNP distance without have reference genomes and the grouping of contigs by means of co-occurence in datasets is original. We feel that the work deserves to be published.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>We have a number of comments that the authors may consider in further improving the quality of their manuscript:</p><p>What is the impact of this paper?</p><p>I think it is possible that the paper will have a decent impact on the mosquito arbovirus field, because it adequately shows the possibilities that individual mosquito sequencing can bring (e.g. co-occurrence analysis). It may shift the balance to doing more individual mosquito sequencing instead of pools. The paper is also very extensive in the analyses that it does on this very rich data set. Below, some suggestions are given for additional analysis, which should be interpreted as a compliment to the interesting data set acquired. It should however be noted that the ideas and approaches taken are not entirely new. Sequencing individual mosquitoes, co-occurrence analysis and metagenomic sequencing have been done before, although not to this extent and not in this field. Several novel possibilities:</p><p>1. An unbiased way to check if you have the correct mosquito species and the ability to detect subspecies. Using the genetic distance of the transcriptomes they have likely corrected the missed identification in some samples, where these calls had a logical mistake made. The fact that subspecies overlapped with the sites of capture is very interesting and confirms the relevance of looking at the genetic distance also within species.</p><p>2. Blood-meal analysis from sequence data. Here they can get to species level for 10 out of 40 blood-engorged mosquitoes. The idea is interesting, as you would be able to get a lot more information if you can determine blood-meal origin from RNA-seq data (as shown in this paper).However, I feel that in the current paper (and this may be intentional) they do not properly show that RNA-seq is an adequate alternative to DNA sequencing of the blood. To convince me, I would have liked to have these results compared to DNA sequencing and see how much overlap there is. I understand however that the choice was made not to do this, but I do have a small note for the information given now.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 correctly infers that our intention for this manuscript was not to demonstrate that RNA mNGS is a comparable or superior alternative to DNA sequencing. Rather, our aim was to perform an exploratory investigation to determine if insights into blood meal sources could actually be detected via RNA-based mNGS analysis, as we stated in the second sentence of Blood meals and associated microbes: “Therefore, we next investigated the possibility of identifying the blood meal host directly from mNGS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was mentioned that 1 contig with an LCA of vertebrates is enough for a 'blood-meal origin' call. I am however left to wonder how reliable is 1 read?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not pursue analysis of single reads for the blood meal analysis. In our study, we used short read sequencing technology whereby a single read provides only a limited amount of sequence information (146bp). This presents a high probability of significant ambiguity in taxonomic assignment. Focusing on contigs as the unit of analysis, rather than reads, provided additional input sequence lengths for the blastn alignment steps of our analyses that we use for taxonomic assignment. Having longer input sequences at this step increases the probability of an informative and statistically significant blastn alignment result and associated taxonomic assignment.</p><p>Overall, for a sample to be included in the blood meal analysis, we required a minimum of 1 contig with a <italic>Vertebrata</italic> LCA assignment. Among the 60 samples collected based on a visually blood engorged state, we identified 45 samples from which we could recover between 1 and 11 contigs with <italic>Vertebrata</italic> LCAs. While the read depth coverage of those contigs varied, the majority of samples contained contigs supported by &gt;500 reads. We also found that many of the contigs supporting bloodmeal calls were highly homologous between different samples, consistent with multiple mosquitos having fed on the same species of blood meal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there really no contigs with an LCA in vertebrates in the non blood-fed mosquitoes?</p></disp-quote><p>After excluding any samples with LCAs corresponding to the order Primates (because of the possibility of contamination with human DNA), we identified 1 additional sample among the non blood-fed mosquitoes with a clear signal for a <italic>Vertebrata</italic> LCA.

We have added a final paragraph to the Blood meal sources and xenosurveillance section of the Discussion to address these issues and raise a possible strategy to enhance blood meal host recovery via RNA-based mNGS:</p><p>“Detection of a potential blood meal host in 45/60 of the blood engorged mosquitoes via RNA-based mNGS analysis is encouraging, especially in light of additional evidence of accompanying microbial cargo. The lack of success across all blood engorged mosquitoes may reflect factors that contribute to insufficient blood meal host RNA in the final extracted samples, such as variability in actual blood engorgement between mosquitoes, insufficient amounts of RNA circulating in the blood of certain types of animal hosts, or degradation/digestion of the blood meal RNA within the mosquito prior to extraction. Second, there may be too little information content in the RNA present, that is if it is from a highly conserved portion of a universal gene, there may not be an LCA below “cellular organisms” or “eukaryota”. A hybrid approach, in which primers for the enrichment of conserved, highly expressed “barcode” genes described above are incorporated at the reverse transcription step (similar to metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment strategy (MSSPE) that has been applied to enrich specific viral species (Deng et al., 2020)) may provide a path forward to boost both the recovery rate and resolution of blood meal host identification in the context of RNA-based mNGS analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The study of co-occurrence, although not novel, is a nice addition to the mosquito virome/microbiome determination field. Identifying novel segments and missed segments of viruses is very nice. I do however wonder: did it ever occur that co-occurrence finds a 'linked' fragment that was clearly wrong? Were some post-analyses done to check if the results make sense? It seems, especially because the paper elaborates on examples, that you need some follow-up. This is not problematic, but a nice addition to the paper would be (as is also described below) to mention which segments were added to viral genomes by co-occurrence and if some checks were done to verify these hits.</p><p>4.

In this study they use % of non-host reads as a measure for the abundance of a pathogen (see e.g. Figure 3). I don't understand this at all… If you have more pathogens, then the amount of non-host reads would have to go up right? It seems to assume that the amount of non-host reads you have is similar in all samples? It becomes even more problematic when the trend is mentioned that having a higher % of non-host reads for Wolbachia is related to a lower % of non-host reads for viruses. This seems to be trivial as the amount of non-host reads goes up with increased Wolbachia infection, and therefore the % of non-host reads for viruses goes down due to the larger denominator.

We have revised the Results section to include an additional “Validation of dark segments” to address the questions raised here. Further, upon review of our BLAST results we found that some segments identified as “dark” actually did have BLAST hits (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> totivirus and Nuyav virus), and the sole “dark” segment left (other than overwhelmingly supported <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> or <italic>Narnaviridae</italic> segments) was RNA 8 of Elemess virus (<italic>Reoviridae</italic>). We have updated all figures and data files to reflect this. We also lay out a modest case for why we believe that numerous contigs co-occurring with Elemess virus which we called RNA 8 are genuine segments in the “Validation of dark segments” paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the most relevant questions you are left with?</p><p>1. I am curious about the limited overlap with Sadeghi et al., 2018, who sequenced so many Culex mosquitoes in California. I would suggest to say a little but more about these discrepancies and their potential causes in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in the Discussion section Distribution of microbes within mosquito populations, as follows: “In contrast, 10 of the 24 previously described viruses we recovered in this study correspond to viral agents described in a recent bulk mNGS of approximately 12,000 mosquitoes collected in California in 2016 (Table 1, Sadeghi et al., 2017) or an mNGS study of 7 single mosquitoes collected in 2013 (Chandler et al., 2015). The remaining 15 previously described viral genomes have been observed outside of the state of California, in some cases on completely different continents. While technical differences in study design, types of mosquito populations examined, sample processing prior to RNA extraction, and sequencing approaches likely play a major role in the distinct set of viral genomes we report here, it is also likely that additional broader factors related to less well-understood aspects of the wild-caught mosquito virome and disease ecology-- mainly the variability in the prevalence and distribution of mosquito viruses across locations, time and mosquito host species -- form the basis for these observations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What do the authors think are in those 'dark reads'? Is the amount of dark reads the same across the different samples? Similarly, are the 'tetrapoda' reads reduced/absent in mosquitoes with a reference genome available?</p></disp-quote><p>For the first question: As these correspond to reads assembled into contigs with no discernable sequence similarity to any published sequences via BLAST, it is very hard to say beyond “dark”. It’s clear that the vast majority of contigs are unlikely to be coding (the longest ORF in more than 50% of contigs are &lt;64 amino acids long and in 95% the longest ORF is &lt;102 amino acids) and tend to be poorly supported (more than 50% of contigs have &lt;7 reads to support them and more than 95% have &lt;24 reads). While mining these dark contigs for meaningful data is a departure from the primary goal of our study, we can say that cursory searches with HHpred amongst the longest ORFs in dark contigs covered with highest numbers of reads tend to indicate that dark contigs appear to be a mix of potentially viral and eukaryotic genes, albeit with extremely low E-values.</p><p>For the second question: the amount of “dark” reads varies across the different samples; the data related to this are available in contigs.stats.all.tsv. Reads in “dark contigs” as a proportion of all reads in contigs range from 0.001 to 0.957 across samples, with a mean of 0.292 and standard deviation of 0.260.</p><p>For the third question: Yes, we observe a trend of slightly higher yield of <italic>Hexapoda</italic> reads remaining in the initial non-host reads output from IDseq among samples derived from mosquito species without a reference genome. This is most pronounced for the more divergent <italic>Culiseta</italic> species. On average, &gt; 0.2 of the total <italic>Hexapoda</italic> reads in among the <italic>Culiseta</italic> samples were identified as <italic>Hexapoda</italic> after the IDseq host filtering steps. In contrast, in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> samples, on average &lt; 0.05 of the total <italic>Hexapoda</italic> reads were identified after the initial IDseq host filtering steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the first part of the results, mention is made to being able to characterize to kingdom level 77% of the 13 million non-host reads (also see comment on non-host reads below). I am however puzzled with the description in the text and supplemental figure 3: which 3 million contigs were not able to be characterized? Where in supplemental figure 3 are they? This is especially puzzling as the main text mentions that 11 million non-host reads are from complete viral genomes, 0.9 million to eukaryotic taxa and 0.7 million to prokaryotic taxa?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing out a confusing typo in the Results section this should have read “…77% of the 21.8 million non-host reads assembled into contigs with &gt; 2 reads” and we have corrected this in the revised version. This refers to the 13M reads assembled into contigs. We have corrected this error and reviewed all read numbers summarized in the text of the Results section and in the more detailed data outlined in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to ensure they are harmonized throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There seem to be 131 bars, corresponding to individual mosquitoes, in figure 3? Where arethe remaining 17?</p></disp-quote><p>The remaining 17 samples fell into 1 of 3 possible categories: (1) they did not harbor viral contigs from family categories shown or Wolbachia contigs supported by &gt;1% non-host reads, (2) they did not harbor Wolbachia, Trypanosomatidae, Apicomplexa, or Nematoda contigs supported by &lt; 1% of non-host reads, or (3) they fell into both of the above categories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are your tips (in addition to responses to above questions)?</p><p>1. I think the definition of 'non-host reads' needs to be clearly made and used consistently across the document. At the end of the paragraph 'Comprehensive and quantitative analysis of non-host sequences detected in single mosquitoes' the concept of &quot;…13 million non-host reads…&quot; is introduced. At first glance of supplemental figure 3 it seems that &quot;non-host reads&quot; could also be defined as the 16.7 aligned reads that are left after putative host sequences are removed. Although it is true that the derivation of 13 million is explained in the figure text of supplemental figure 3, it may be easier for the reader (as it cost me some time) to explain this in the main text. In addition, is the definition of 'non-host reads' (corresponding to 13-million reads) corresponding to &quot;classified non-host reads&quot; in the following excerpt: &quot;For every sample, &quot;classified non-host reads&quot; refer to those reads mapping to contigs that pass the above filtering, Hexapoda exclusion, and decontamination steps. &quot;Non-host reads&quot; refers to the classified non-host reads plus the reads passing host filtering which failed to assemble into contigs or assembled into a contig with only two reads.&quot;? This caused some confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for these helpful comments. We have revised the Materials and methods section to streamline the read on contig/read filtering and nomenclature, and harmonized the terms for different classes of non-host reads throughout the manuscript to minimize this sort of confusion in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Where possible, complete viral genome recovery was inferred via identification of canonical (for viral family or genus) gene and segment presence/absence in assembled contigs.

Their results show that majority of their sequenced data assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes. In their data, 7.4 million viral reads clustered as +ssRNA viruses including Solemoviridae, Luteoviridae, Tombusviridae, Narnaviridae, Flaviviridae, Virgaviridae, and Filovirida whereas 2.25 million viral reads identified as -ssRNA viruses comprising of Peribunayviridae, Phasmaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Chuviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Ximnoviridae. With 0.94 million viral reads, dsRNA viruses formed the third most abundant virus category with viruses under families Chrysoviridae, Totiviridae, Partitiviridae, and Reoviridae. Under the prokaryotic taxa, Wolbachia species was the dominant group, followed by other lower abundance bacterial taxa that includes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Terrabacteria group, and Spirochaetes. Trypanosomatidae was the most dominant eukaryotic taxa, followed up by reads from Bilateria and Ecdysozoa taxa. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that single mosquito meta-transcriptomic analysis has potential in identifying vectors of human health significance, potent emerging pathogens being transmitted by them and their reservoirs all in one assay.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1.

In short, WNV and SLEV were reported at low frequency and in only 2 of the collection sites during the study period (Placer and San Diego; range 0-10 mosquito pools tested positive for WNV, and 0-1 pools positive for SLEV). Seven samples from Placer were collected on 11/21/17 and 11/28/17 and overlapped with a reporting period spanning 11/18/17-12/1/17 during which a single mosquito pool was found positive for SLEV.

This may make it difficult to discriminate between internal and external microbiota as well as lead to cross-contamination of surface microbiota between mosquitoes collected in the same trap.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #3 is correct, the mosquitoes sequenced in this study were not washed prior to RNA extraction. We have altered the text to acknowledge the possibility of externally sourced microbes in the Results section, final paragraph of Diverse known and novel RNA virus taxa dominate the mosquito microbiota:</p><p>“We cannot rule out that the known and novel viral species that correspond to viral families previously thought to only infect plants and fungi, (e.g., the Chrysoviridae, Totiviridae, Luteoviridae and Solemoviridae, Table 1) could potentially be explained by an environmental exposure retained on the surface of the mosquito.”</p><p>We have also addressed this limitation of our study more broadly in Distribution of microbes within mosquito populations in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Intriguingly, a significant fraction (n=46) of the 70 viral genomes we identified in this study correspond to novel divergent viruses. Further studies will be required to understand each of these viruses, and whether they correspond solely to microbial cargo (i.e., non-infecting viral species hitching a ride on the mosquito exterior or via ingestion of blood or nectar), versus insect specific viruses, or potentially transmissible human or animal pathogens.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This work currently would be of interest to other research groups examining the co-occurence of pathogens, other microbiota, and blood meals for field collected mosquitoes. While of great potential application to public health surveillance, the current cost is likely prohibitive.</p><p>My field of expertise is virology and vector biology with minimal background in NGS.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
