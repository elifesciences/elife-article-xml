activated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to various stress conditions. Phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2-P) inhibits eIF2’s nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, a twofold symmetric heterodecamer assembled from subcomplexes. Here, we monitor and manipulate eIF2B assembly in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of eIF2B’s α-subunit, the ISR is induced because unassembled eIF2B tetramer subcomplexes accumulate in cells. Upon addition of the small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB, eIF2B tetramers assemble into active octamers. Surprisingly, ISRIB inhibits the ISR even in the context of fully assembled eIF2B decamers, revealing allosteric communication between the physically distant eIF2, eIF2-P, and ISRIB binding sites. Cryo-electron microscopy structures suggest a rocking motion in eIF2B that couples these binding sites. eIF2-P binding converts eIF2B decamers into ‘conjoined tetramers’ with diminished substrate binding and enzymatic activity. Canonical eIF2-P-driven ISR activation thus arises due to this change in eIF2B’s conformational state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eIF2B</kwd><kwd>ISR</kwd><kwd>ISRIB</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Faculty Scholar Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calico Life Sciences LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The George and Judy Marcus Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>Rosalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001491</institution-id><institution>Belgian American Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boone</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>eIF2-P activates the integrated stress response by inducing a conformational change in eIF2B that decreases substrate (eIF2) binding and reduces eIF2B's catalytic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells must cope with stress, ranging from nutrient deprivation to viral infection to protein misfolding. Cell stress may arise from cell-intrinsic, organismal, or environmental insults, yet often converges on common regulatory nodes. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved eukaryotic stress response that senses and integrates diverse stressors and responds by reprogramming translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). ISR activation has been linked to numerous human diseases, including cancer and neurological diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). While acute ISR activation largely plays a cytoprotective role, its dysregulation (both aberrant activation and insufficient activation) can negatively affect disease progression. In many pathological conditions, for example, the ISR is constitutively activated and maladaptive effects arise that worsen the disease outcome. Many conditions of cognitive dysfunction, for example, have been linked causally to ISR activation in mouse models, including brain trauma resulting from physical brain injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sen et al., 2017</xref>), familial conditions including Vanishing White Matter Disease and Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Knaap et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), and even the cognitive decline associated with normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krukowski et al., 2020</xref>). Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of ISR regulation therefore is of profound importance.</p><p>Translation reprogramming upon ISR induction results as a consequence of reduced ternary complex (TC) levels. The TC is composed of methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA<sup>i</sup>), the general translation initiation factor eIF2, and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>). At normal, saturating TC concentrations, translation initiates efficiently on most mRNAs containing AUG translation start sites; however, translation of some mRNAs is inhibited under these conditions by the presence of inhibitory small upstream open reading frames (uORF) in their 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>). When TC levels are sub-saturating, translation is repressed on most mRNAs. In contrast, some mRNAs that contain uORFs in their 5′ UTRs are now preferentially translated, including mRNAs encoding stress-responsive transcription factors, such as ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, TC availability emerges as a prime factor in determining the translational and, consequentially, transcriptional programs of the cell.</p><p>The central mechanism that regulates TC levels in response to stress conditions concerns the loading of eIF2’s γ subunit with GTP. Without GTP, eIF2 cannot bind Met-tRNA<sup>i</sup> and hence does not assemble the TC. Loading is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B, a large decameric and twofold symmetric enzyme that is composed of two copies each of five different subunits, eIF2Bα, β, δ, γ, and ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashiwagi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>). Stress sensing is accomplished by four upstream kinases (PKR, PERK, GCN2, and HRI) that are activated by different stress conditions and, in turn, phosphorylate eIF2 as a common target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 1998</xref>). Phosphorylation by each of these kinases converges on a single amino acid, S51, in eIF2’s α subunit (eIF2α). As a profound consequence of eIF2α S51 phosphorylation, eIF2 converts from eIF2B’s substrate for GTP exchange into a potent eIF2B inhibitor.</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of eIF2B•eIF2 complexes show that eIF2 snakes across the surface of eIF2B in an elongated conformation, contacting eIF2B at four discontinuous interfaces, which we here refer to as IF1–IF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordiyenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>). IF1 and IF2 engage eIF2γ (containing eIF2’s GTPase domain) with eIF2Bε, sandwiching eIF2γ between eIF2Bε’s catalytic and core-domain, respectively. This interaction pries the GTP binding site open, thus stabilizing the apostate to catalyze nucleotide exchange. IF3 and IF4 engage eIF2 via its α subunit across eIF2B’s twofold symmetry interface, where two eIF2Bβδγε tetramer subcomplexes are joined. The eIF2α binding surfaces line a cleft between eIF2Bβ (IF3) and eIF2Bδ′ (IF4) (the prime to indicate the subunit in the adjoining tetramer). Upon S51 phosphorylation, eIF2α adopts a new conformation that renders it incompatible with IF3/IF4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogorad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordiyenko et al., 2019</xref>). Rather, phosphorylation unlocks an entirely new binding mode on the opposite side of eIF2B, where eIF2α-P now binds to a site between eIF2Bα and eIF2Bδ. We and others previously proposed that, when bound to eIF2B in this way, the β and especially the γ subunits of eIF2-P could sterically block eIF2γ of a concomitantly bound unphosphorylated eIF2 substrate from engaging productively with eIF2Bε’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>). Such a blockade could explain the inhibitory effect of eIF2-P, and this model predicts that GEF inhibition should depend on eIF2γ as the entity responsible for causing the proposed steric clash.</p><p>Both eIF2 and eIF2-P binding sites span interfaces between eIF2B subunits present in the decamer but not in the subcomplexes from which it is assembled. The eIF2B decamer is built from two eIF2Bβδγε tetramers and one eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). These subcomplexes are stable entities that, when mixed in vitro, readily assemble into decamers. The eIF2Bβδγε tetramer has a low, basal GEF activity as it can only engage with eIF2 through IF1–IF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craddock and Proud, 1996</xref>). As expected, eIF2B decamer assembly results in a greater than twentyfold rate enhancement of nucleotide exchange, presumably due to enhanced substrate binding caused by the completion of the eIF2α binding site through the addition of IF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craddock and Proud, 1996</xref>). Assembly of the eIF2B decamer is driven by eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub>, which acts as an assembly-promoting factor. Thus, eIF2B assembly into a decamer allows the modalities of (i) full GEF activity on eIF2 and (ii) inhibition by eIF2-P to manifest.</p><p>The activity of the ISR can be attenuated by ISRIB, a potent small drug-like molecule with dramatic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, ISRIB corrects with no overt toxicity the cognitive deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2017</xref>), Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krukowski et al., 2020</xref>), and other brain dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2018</xref>) with an extraordinary efficacy, indicating that the molecule reverses the detrimental effects of a persistent and maladaptive state of the ISR. ISRIB also kills metastatic prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). ISRIB’s mechanistic target is eIF2B to which it binds in a binding groove that centrally bridges the symmetry interface between eIF2Bβδγε tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). As such, it acts as a ‘molecular staple’, promoting assembly of two eIF2Bβδγε tetramers into an enzymatically active eIF2B(βδγε)<sub>2</sub> octamer. Here, we further interrogated the role of ISRIB by engineering cells that allow us to monitor and experimentally manipulate eIF2B’s assembly state. These experiments led to the discovery of a conformational switch that negatively couples the eIF2 and eIF2-P binding sites and the ISRIB binding site by allosteric communication in the eIF2B complex. This conformational switch is the central mechanism by which ISR activation occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>eIF2B assembly state modulates the ISR in cells</title><p>To investigate the role of eIF2B’s assembly state in controlling ISR activation, we developed ISR reporter cells that enable experimental modulation of the eIF2B decamer concentration. To this end, we tagged eIF2Bα with an FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> degron in human K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the endogenous locus. The cell-permeable small molecule dTag13 induces selective degradation of the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-tagged eIF2Bα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabet et al., 2018</xref>). We also engineered a genomically integrated dual ISR reporter system into these cells. The reporter system consists of the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein placed under translational control of a uORF-containing 5′UTR derived from ATF4 (‘ATF4 reporter’) and the mScarlet-i fluorescent protein containing a partial ATF4 5′ UTR from which the uORFs have been removed (‘general translation reporter’). To optimize the signal of these reporters, we fused both fluorescent proteins to the ecDHFR degron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This degron drives the constitutive degradation of the fusion proteins unless the small molecule trimethoprim is added to stabilize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwamoto et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, the reporters allow us to monitor only de novo translation. Unless otherwise stated, trimethoprim was added concurrently with other treatments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular eIF2B assembly state in cells modulates the integrated stress response (ISR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of eIF2B assembly state modulation via the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>/dTag13 system used to induce degradation of eIF2Bα.

Overlay of the apo decamer with structures of eIF2B bound to one or two copies of its enzymatically engaged substrate eIF2 also revealed unremarkable changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordiyenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>).

In the I-State, the two symmetrically opposed eIF2B tetramers have undergone a rocking motion that changes the angle between them by 7.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The ISRIB pocket, consequentially, is lengthened by ~2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

The central ISR regulatory hub is the decameric guanine nucleotide exchange complex eIF2B, which activates eIF2 by loading it with GTP. Upon ISR activation in response to a variety of stress conditions, eIF2 becomes phosphorylated, converting it from eIF2B’s substrate into an eIF2B inhibitor. Both eIF2 and eIF2-P are elongated protein complexes that contact eIF2B through multi-subunit, composite interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>). The binding mode appears to be determined mainly by eIF2’s α subunit, which anchors eIF2 and eIF2-P to their respective binding sites. For the substrate eIF2, binding aligns eIF2γ with eIF2B’s catalytic site via IF1 and IF2 for nucleotide exchange. By contrast, for the inhibitor eIF2-P, binding positions its γ-subunit such that it could orthosterically prevent nonphosphorylated eIF2 substrate from engaging the catalytic machinery in eIF2Bε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>). While this model was appealing based on the cryo-EM structures of eIF2B•eIF2-P complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwagi et al., 2019</xref>), the eIF2α C-terminal domain may retain sufficient flexibility to allow eIF2γ to avert the proposed clash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Expanding from this notion, in this work we show that allosteric rather than clash-based orthosteric competition contributes significantly to eIF2-P-mediated inhibition. We show that eIF2 and eIF2-P binding are negatively coupled, even when only the α subunit of eIF2-P is present. Thus, eIF2α-P binding impairs substrate binding even though the two binding sites are ~50 Å apart. Further, the phosphorylated form of eIF2’s α subunit alone inhibits GEF activity both through reduced substrate affinity and reduced eIF2B catalytic efficiency. Indeed, depending on the concentration regime, this change in eIF2B’s intrinsic catalytic activity may be the main driver of lowered TC levels. With these data, we demonstrate that the eIF2γ subunit, which would be required for eIF2 inhibition via the clash-based orthosteric model, is mechanistically dispensable for eIF2-P’s inhibitory role, although the added binding energy it contributes is certainly of importance in a cellular context.</p><p>Cryo-EM reconstructions support this model. They reveal a rocking motion of the two eIF2Bβδγε tetramers with eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> acting as the fulcrum of the movement, akin to a butterfly raising and lowering its wings. These changes are induced by eIF2α-P alone. In the active or ‘wings-up’ A-State, eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bδ′ subunits are sufficiently close to fully shape the eIF2α binding site, thus allowing nonphosphorylated substrate engagement. The A-State also contains a properly sized ISRIB binding pocket, thus rendering eIF2 and ISRIB binding synergistic. In contrast, the eIF2α-P binding site is misshapen and lacking properly positioned side chains critical for eIF2α-P binding. In the inhibited wings-down I-State, the eIF2α-P binding site is shaped correctly, while both the eIF2α (specifically IF4) and ISRIB binding sites are disrupted.</p><p>Prior to this work, models describing the molecular function of the drug-like small molecule ISRIB were exclusively focused on ISRIB’s activity to promote eIF2B complex assembly. In vitro work from our and other labs demonstrated that eIF2Bβδγε tetramers assemble in the presence of ISRIB into eIF2B(βδγε)<sub>2</sub> octamers that approach the enzymatic activity of the eIF2B decamer, explaining how ISRIB could promote eIF2B assembly to restock the pool of active eIF2B when depleted by eIF2-P during ISR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). However, because eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> likewise has assembly-promoting activity, ISRIB can only exert this function when eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> is limiting. We here validated this conjecture in living cells. Experimental depletion of eIF2Bα turned on ISR signaling in the absence of eIF2 phosphorylation, and ISRIB functionally substitutes for eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub>. In the context of saturating eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub>, we were thus left with a paradox regarding ISRIB’s mechanism of action, which we resolve by showing that beyond a role in eIF2B assembly ISRIB antagonizes eIF2-P binding.</p><p>Previous works investigating the effects of compromising eIF2Bα (deletion, mutation, knockdown) did not report on eIF2B complex assembly and were predominantly performed in non-human model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pavitt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hannig and Hinnebusch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elsby et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, it is conceivable that eIF2B subcomplexes (and the role for these complexes in full heterodecamer assembly) are distinct between species. For example, in the fungus <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum,</italic> eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bδ appear to form heterotetrameric subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuhle et al., 2015</xref>), whereas we see no evidence for such stable assemblies in our work with human eIF2B. Thus, in other organisms enzymatically active octamers may form, and eIF2Bα’s role may thus be primarily to allow eIF2-P binding. Another intriguing possibility is that in the long term, cells may enact mechanisms to compensate for the drop in TC levels that accompanies eIF2Bα depletion, consequent decamer disassembly, and decreased eIF2B GEF activity.</p><p>While our data clearly show that eIF2B is predominantly a decamer in K562 cells, this leaves open the possibility that the assembly state differs by cell type and/or is regulated physiologically. In principle, eIF2Bα could become limiting by regulation of its biosynthesis or degradation, post-translational modification, and/or sequestration into an unavailable pool. It is also important to note that an ISRIB-stabilized eIF2B(βδγε)<sub>2</sub> octamer is inert to inhibition by eIF2-P. Such inhibition would require eIF2α-P to bind at the eIF2Bα/eIF2Bδ interface, which does not exist in complexes lacking eIF2Bα. We speculate that endogenous eIF2B(βδγε)<sub>2</sub> octamers could be stabilized by putative alternate assembly factors, which could be metabolites or proteins that, like ISRIB, can substitute for eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> in this regard.</p><p>In the course of this study, the demonstration that ISRIB still has a profound effect even in the context of fully assembled eIF2B led to the discovery of allosteric eIF2B regulation. While this manuscript was in preparation, a paper from Takuhiro Ito’s and David Ron’s laboratories was published that reached similar conclusions regarding ISRIB’s effect on allosteric eIF2B regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zyryanova et al., 2021</xref>). The work from these groups focuses almost exclusively on the allosteric effects promoted by the drug. Our results agree with their conclusions and demonstrate physiological significance. We show that substrate (eIF2) and inhibitor (eIF2-P) binding are negatively coupled. We additionally show that inhibitor binding reduces eIF2B’s catalytic activity. Moreover, we show that by binding to the same binding site on eIF2B, ISRIB can affect the ISR in two modalities: (i) by promoting eIF2B assembly under conditions where eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> is limiting or decamer stability may be compromised and (ii) biasing allosterically the conformational equilibrium of fully assembled decameric eIF2B towards the A-State, rendering inhibition by eIF2-P more difficult. Conceptually, these two modalities of ISRIB function are quite similar. In both cases, ISRIB promotes the completion of the eIF2α binding site by properly positioning IF4, so that it can cooperate with IF3 to anchor eIF2α. Indeed, in the I-State, the widening of the cleft between eIF2Bβ and eF2Bδ′ effectively renders the available interaction surfaces on eIF2B equivalent to those on eIF2Bβδγε tetramers, limiting eIF2 engagement to IF1–IF3 as IF4 is pulled ‘out of reach’ as it would be in fully dissociated tetramers. In this way, we can think of eIF2B’s I-State as ‘conjoined tetramers’ that remain tethered by eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> but are functionally separate entities.</p><p>Considering the potential pharmacological applications of ISRIB, the relevant modality of ISRIB function may vary between different disease pathologies. In the case of vanishing white matter disease, for example, point mutations destabilize the eIF2B complex and ISRIB, therefore may provide primarily a stabilizing effect to recover eIF2B function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, in traumatic brain injury, sustained cognitive dysfunction is caused by persistent canonical ISR activation through eIF2-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, ISRIB would primarily counteract the aberrant ISR activation by predisposing eIF2B to the A-State. Other diseases are likely somewhere along the spectrum of purely assembly-based versus purely eIF2-P-based ISR activation. Our illustration of the differences between ISRIB’s ability to resolve assembly-based stress versus eIF2-P-based stress should therefore inform how these different diseases are studied and ultimately treated.</p><p>The discovery of allosteric control of eIF2B activity raises intriguing possibilities. Indeed, we can envision that cell-endogenous modulators exist that work as activators (stabilizing the A-State) or inhibitors (stabilizing the I-State). Such putative ISR modulators could be small molecule metabolites or proteins and either bind to the ISRIB binding pocket or elsewhere on eIF2B to adjust the gain of ISR signaling to the physiological needs of the cell. Precedent for this notion comes from viruses that evolved proteins to counteract ISR-mediated antiviral defenses. The AcP10 protein in the Bw-CoV SW1 virus, for example, interacts with eIF2B to exert an ISRIB-like effect, likely predisposing eIF2B to the A-State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rabouw et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding the observed changes in the ISRIB binding pocket, the newly gained structural insights can be applied to engineer novel pharmacological ISR modulators that may be effective in opening new therapeutic opportunities in different diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of tagged human eIF2B expression plasmids</title><p><italic>eIF2B2</italic> (encoding eIF2Bβ) and <italic>eIF2B4</italic> (encoding eIF2Bδ) had previously been inserted into sites 1 and 2 of pACYCDuet-1, respectively (pJT073) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>).

Measurements were taken using the ClarioStar PLUS plate reader (BMG LabTech) at room temperature. mNeonGreen was excited (470 nm, 8 nm bandwidth), and mNeonGreen (516 nm, 8 nm bandwidth) and mScarlet-i (592 nm, 8 nm bandwidth) emission were monitored. FRET signal (E<sub>592</sub>/E<sub>516</sub>) is the ratio of mScarlet-i emission after mNeonGreen excitation and mNeonGreen emission after mNeonGreen excitation.

Then, 10 μl of 2× ISRIB, eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub>, or ISRIB + eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> stocks were placed in wells of the above-described assay plate. Also, 10 μl of 100 nM (2×) eIF2Bβγδε-F was then added and mixed with the contents of each well using a 20 μl 12-channel multichannel pipette. Measurements were taken using the above instrument every 18 s for the first 24 cycles and then every 45 s for the next 60 cycles. mNeonGreen was excited (470 nm, 16 nm bandwidth), and mNeonGreen (516 nm, 16 nm bandwidth) and mScarlet-i (592 nm, 16 nm bandwidth) emission were monitored. After this association phase, 18 µl was removed from each well using a multichannel pipette and mixed with 1 μl of 20 μM (20×) untagged eIF2Bβγδε pre-loaded into PCR strips. The material was then returned to the original wells and measurement of dissociation began. Measurements were taken every 18 s for the first 24 cycles and then every 45 s for the next 120 cycles. Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 8. Association and dissociation phases were fit separately using the one-phase association and dissociation–one phase exponential decay models, respectively. Global fits were performed on the ISRIB titrations or eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> titrations. When modeling dissociation, the median buffer signal at assay completion was used to set the bottom baseline for conditions where full dissociation was not observed (eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> and eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> + ISRIB conditions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>GDP exchange assay</title><p>In vitro detection of GDP binding to eIF2 was adapted from a published protocol for a fluorescence intensity–based assay describing dissociation of eIF2 and nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>). We first performed a loading assay for fluorescent BODIPY-FL-GDP as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>).

The GEF mix was prepared by incubating a 10× solution of eIF2B(αβγδε)<sub>2</sub> with 10× solutions of eIF2-P or eIF2α-P. For analyzing the effect of ISRIB, the 10× GEF mixes were pre-incubated with 2% NMP or 10 µM ISRIB in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), such that the final NMP and ISRIB concentration was 1 µM and the final NMP concentration was 0.2%. To compare nucleotide exchange rates, the 10× GEF mixes were spiked into the 384-well plate wells with a multichannel pipette, such that the resulting final concentration of eIF2B(αβγδε)<sub>2</sub> was 10 nM, and the final concentration of other proteins and drugs are as indicated in the figures. Subsequently, in the same wells, we performed a ‘GDP unloading assay’ as indicated in the figures. After completion of the loading reaction, wells were next spiked with 1 mM GDP to start the unloading reaction at t = 0. Fluorescence intensity was recorded every 10 s for 60 min using a Clariostar PLUS (BMG LabTech) plate reader (excitation wavelength: 497 nm, bandwidth 14 nm; emission wavelength: 525 nm, bandwidth: 30 nm).

compound, ISRIB (Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor). The major conceptual advance of this work is the discovery that ISRIB can inhibit the integrated stress response using two different modalities. This study and the recently published work from Zyryanova et al. in Molecular Cell (2021) complement one another and provide clear insights into how ISRIB confers resistance to the phosphorylation of initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and downstream effects on the Integrated Stress Response.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;eIF2B Conformation and Assembly State Regulates the Integrated Stress Response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers considered your work of interest and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after revisions in response to their criticisms. The reviewers have provided many thoughtful and constructive comments. We are therefore enclosing the full reviews, but we are listing below the comments which ought to be addressed, as follows:</p><p>1) It is important to calculate a K1/2 constant of association/inhibition concentrations for the plots shown in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 4D the Ki constant for inhibiting FAM-ISRIB binding by eIF2aP alone appears significantly weaker than that for the full eIF2P complex shown in Figure 4C. This would suggest that eIF2 complex components in addition to eIF2alpha do have an impact on competition with ISRIB (point #10 of reviewer #2). If eIF2alpha's affinity is much weaker, it may explain differences when comparing with in vivo experiments as commented by reviewer #3.</p><p>2) The comparisons shown in Figures 1E, 3D, and 5 need to be supported by statistics (reviewer #1).</p><p>3) Using a novel in vivo fluorescence assay the authors find no evidence for complexes lacking eIF2Balpha in the cells they tested. The authors suggest that when eIF2Balpha is compromised in VWM/CACH disease, promoting complex stability may be an additional mechanism of ISRIB action. The authors should provide some direct evidence to support this, for example by testing a VWM mutation that reduces eIF2Balpha association with eIF2B complex (https://elifesciences.org/articles/32733) (reviewer #2). In the latter paper in <italic>eLife</italic> the eIF2Balpha-V183F mutation destabilizes the decamer and reduces eIF2B activity in extracts, but does not activate the ISR. Addition of ISRIB restores GDP release and suppresses Tg-induced ISR in the mutant cells. As this eIF2Balpha mutant had no phenotype in the absence of stress (Figure 4C,D,F), the authors are not expected to see an effect. However, their new fluorescence assay could be a more accurate reporter than the assays used in the Wong paper which rely on biochemical fractionations- which likely report destabilization upon dilution/extraction.</p><p>4) There is a considerable amount of prior excellent work on this topic (starting with the discovery of ISRIB by the Walter group, and the recent paper of Ron's group in Molecular Cell). Therefore, some further references could be included in the Introduction and further discussed (see for example, reviewer #2)</p><p>5) The timelines for the addition of dTag13, trimethoprim, ISRIB and/or Tg to cells should be described in better detail, as it is unclear in most experiments for how long trimethoprim is added prior to the stated other treatments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this paper Schoof et al. describe the allosteric communication between the physically distant eIF2, eIF2-P, and ISRIB binding sites. The paper documents a series of well-designed experiments that shed light on the mechanism of action of ISRIB, a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR). The authors report that ISRIB inhibits the ISR using two mechanisms of action. By revealing an allosteric communication between the physically distant eIF2, eIF2-P, and ISRIB binding sites, the new findings significantly extend the findings of Zyryanova et al., 2020. In addition, the authors show that ISRIB promotes eIF2B assembly under conditions where eIF2Bα is limiting or decamer stability is compromised. Thus, ISRIB negate the ISR using two, likely not mutually exclusive, different modalities.</p><p>The following are comments which the authors should consider.</p><p>1) The comparisons shown in Figures 1E, 3D, and 5 need to be supported by statistics.</p><p>2) For the experiments described in Figure 3, n = X (see legend). Please indicate the correct n and specific for all of the experiments whether &quot;n&quot; represents biological and/or technical replicates.</p><p>3) Does dTag13 trigger translation of ATF4 in control cells?</p><p>4) Previous work in yeast, insect and mammalian cells has led to the conclusion that inhibition of eIF2Balpha failed to activate the ISR as determined by measuring general translation of translation of specific mRNAs (Fabian et al., JBC, 1997; Kimball et al., JBC, 1998; Pavitt et al., MCB, 1997, Elsby et al., 2011; Dever et al., Cell, 1992). Moreover, inhibition of eIF2Bα and its yeast orthologue GCN3, make eIF2B less sensitive to inhibition by eIF2-P. In contrast, Figure 1 shows that degradation of eIF2Balpha triggers the ISR. How can these apparent contradictory results be explained? A discussion is necessary.</p><p>5) The degron-mediated degradation of eIF2Bα leads to a similar phenotype to that observed with mutations in eIF2B in VWMD. Could the authors speculate the mechanism by which degradation of the α subunit of eIF2B activates the ISR?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The existence of a recent study describing an allosteric model for ISRIB action should be acknowledged much earlier in the manuscript, it only appears very late in the Discussion. It would be appropriate to discuss in the Introduction and perhaps modify some of the experimental rationale to take this into account.</p><p>2) “Both eIF2 and eIF2-P binding sites span interfaces between eIF2B subunits present in the decamer but not in the subcomplexes from which it is assembled.”</p><p>The authors are selective in their proposed eIF2B assembly pathway options which are stated as a fact. There is ample evidence that eIF2Babd hexamer and eIF2Bge dimers can assemble, yet these intermediates are not discussed or evaluated anywhere in the manuscript. An 2Babd hexamer should have both binding sites for eIF2a and 2aP and its assembly could be assessed in the authors in vitro fluorescence complex assembly assay.</p><p>3) The first section headings of the Results are misleading/overstating the results, because the assembly state of eIF2B is not monitored in the assays described. The data may be consistent with the interpretation, but they should be re-worded. The assembly state is first tested in Figure 2.</p><p>4) Figure 2. Was in vitro assembly with eIF2Bbd and 2Ba alone in the absence of eIF2Bge ever investigated in the in vitro system? Other studies (as indicated above) have indicated eIF2Bbd tetramer and 2Babd hexamers can form.</p><p>5) Can the authors separate whether ISRIB at sub-saturating concentrations primarily promotes the formation of octamers from tetramers or instead binds to and stabilises octamers that form independently and so acts to retard the rate of disassembly of octamers back into tetramers that can otherwise occur in the experiment? My reading of the data suggests the latter is more consistent with these experiments rather than the former, but that the text is written to imply that promoting assembly is the mechanism.</p><p>6) The experimental timelines for the addition of dTag13, trimethoprim, ISRIB and/or Tg to cells are not well described in the Materials and methods (in contrast to the detailed information for western blots), and is therefore currently unclear in most experiments for how long trimethoprim is added prior to the stated other treatments.</p><p>7) Does dTag13 act to degrade free eIF2Ba only, assembled decamers only or both equally well?</p><p>8) Figure 3 B-D derive from population data, but the error bars are extremely tight. How variable are the signals from individual cells? By showing box or violin plots the variation in the population would be clear. Here the analysis is simply relying on the mean. It is unclear from the figure legend how many times these experiments have been done. It should also be possible to calculate a K1/2 constant concentration for th</p><p>9) Recent experiments have identified eIF2B foci in a range of human cells termed eIF2B bodies that respond to the ISR and ISRIB (Hodgson et al., 2019, doi: 10.1091/mbc.E18-08-0538). Are similar foci detected within the cells examined here? and if so, how do these bodies impact on the data analysis performed?</p><p>10) It should also be possible to calculate a K1/2 constant association/inhibition concentrations for the relevant plots shown in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 4D the Ki constant for inhibiting FAM-ISRIB binding by eIF2aP alone appears significantly weaker than that for the full eIF2P complex shown in Figure 4C. This would suggest that eIF2 complex components in addition to eIF2a do have an impact on competition with ISRIB, while the authors' conclusion is ness nuanced.</p><p>11) The authors previously proposed that the binding of eIF2P to eIF2B provided a steric block through a clash between the eIF2beta-γ subunits. Now here they propose a different mechanism that is more plausible and based primarily on eIF2alphaP binding to eIF2B. Lines of published evidence that did not fit their previous model have not been cited in this context. (i) the large flexibility of eIF2alphaCTD observed many years ago in NMR experiments (the Ito et al., 2004 reference) suggests the bound eIF2g will not be in one position and (2) more recent cryoEM studies of eIF2-eIF2B complexes (Adomavicius et al., 2019 reference) that shows eIF2P anchored via the α subunit can indeed flex and move eIF2g to a range of positions that do not clash.</p><p>12) “A titration of eIF2 into this reaction allowed FAM-ISRIB polarization to recover, indicating that eIF2 binds and competes off eIF2α-P, which restores FAM-ISRIB binding.”</p><p>Are the authors suggesting that eIF2 can bind to eIF2B/eIF2P complexes forming transient complexes with &gt;2 eIF2 molecules bound before promoting release of eIF2aP?</p><p>Is this experiment done with competing eIF2 complex or eIF2a alone?</p><p>Data in Figure 4 indicate that the eIF2 complex binds with higher affinity to eIF2B than eIF2a alone. To this reviewer, this experiment in Figure 5 is simply showing that the eIF2 complex can bind with higher affinity than the isolated eIF2a to eIF2B. What happens when both eIF2 and eIF2P complexes are used and also when both eIF2a/eIF2aP subunit only combinations are used in this assay?</p><p>13) The validation report for the EM structure indicates many regions where the level of discrepancy between the map and model is very high. The Ramachandran plot shows no unfavoured geometry, which is very unusual. This suggests that the atomic model may not be reliable. Some presentation of the model in the density in relevant regions could convince readers otherwise. There are some very badly fitting chains: I, J and A are 30 to 57% in red. It is not immediately clear which chain relates to which subunit.</p><p>14) Figure 6—figure supplement 2 the apo-structure appears to be green not grey as indicated in the legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few comments on the paper:</p><p>1) Introduction section final paragraph: &quot;grove&quot; should be &quot;groove&quot;</p><p>2) Subsection “eIF2α-P is sufficient to impair ISRIB binding to eIF2B”: the authors' conclusion that phosphorylated eIF2alpha subunit is sufficient to inhibit eIF2B is interesting. This might be consistent with the ability of overexpressed eIF2alpha-S51D to stimulate the ISR in cells. It would be interesting to know if overexpression of an eIF2alpha-S51D mutant that lacks its C-terminus and thus cannot assemble into eIF2 complexes can inhibit eIF2B in mammalian cells. Alternatively, phosphorylated eIF2alpha might only inhibit in vitro but not in vivo.</p><p>It might be worthwhile to note that the situation is likely different in yeast. Obviously, we know that yeast eIF2B is different than mammalian eIF2B in that yeast eIF2B is not activated by ISRIB. However, it was also previously shown that overexpressed eIF2alpha is readily phosphorylated in yeast (see original paper from the Hinnebusch lab, Cell 1992), but this does not lead to hyper-induction of GCN4. These yeast results were interpreted to indicate that phosphorylated eIF2alpha does not inhibit eIF2B on its own.</p><p>3) Legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 2: should &quot;light grey&quot; be &quot;green&quot;?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65703.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers considered your work of interest and worthy of publication in eLife after revisions in response to their criticisms.

Regarding Figures 3 and 4, we have added E/IC<sub>50</sub> values as appropriate for all panels in the figure legends. Regarding the comparison between eIF2-P and eIF2α-P, we now provide a better explanation to this critical issue in the text. In particular, the eIF2α-P vs. eIF2-P data show that for the modalities of ISRIB competition or eIF2B inhibition, eIF2 β and γ subunits are dispensable. These subunits, however, do contribute additional binding interactions, and hence their presence or absence explains different IC<sub>50</sub>s observed in Figure 4C and 4D. Nevertheless, we show eIF2α-P ultimately achieves the same effects as eIF2-P (both in the assays that monitor ISRIB competition and GEF inactivation). To further validate this conclusion, we now performed Michaelis Menten kinetic analyses, varying the concentrations of eIF2α-P (Figure 6A-B). We added these new data to the manuscript to further illuminate how eIF2α-P inhibits eIF2B GEF activity. We fully agree that, in the context of a cell, the extra binding energy from γ/β is important for ISR activation, yet, on mechanistic grounds, it is amply clear from our data that eIF2α-P binding is sufficient to i) change eIF2B’s conformation (Figure 7), ii) inhibit the complex (Figure 5B, 6A-B) and iii) compete off ISRIB (Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The comparisons shown in Figures 1E, 3D, and 5 need to be supported by statistics (reviewer #1).</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 1E, 3D, and 5 now include appropriate error bars (s.e.m.) and the legends correctly denote this fact.

The VWMD mutations are thoroughly investigated in the cited paper, and ISRIB’s ability to stabilize mutant eIF2B is convincingly shown. In our view, further in vitro workup would be extraneous to the presented work and unlikely to provide significant additional information to affect our interpretation. Moreover, the generation of VWMD cells containing the reporters would be a major time- and labor-intensive endeavor that we consider well beyond the scope of this work. Such investigations are certainly of interest and should be pursued but would constitute an entire new project in its own right.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a considerable amount of prior excellent work on this topic (starting with the discovery of ISRIB by the Walter group, and the recent paper of Ron's group in Molecular Cell).

By revealing an allosteric communication between the physically distant eIF2, eIF2-P, and ISRIB binding sites, the new findings significantly extend the findings of Zyryanova et al., 2020. In addition, the authors show that ISRIB promotes eIF2B assembly under conditions where eIF2Bα is limiting or decamer stability is compromised. Thus, ISRIB negate the ISR using two, likely not mutually exclusive, different modalities.</p><p>The following are comments which the authors should consider.</p><p>1) The comparisons shown in Figures 1E, 3D, and 5 need to be supported by statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Taken care of; see above (Essential revision 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the experiments described in Figure 3, n = X (see legend).

This property was actually used to screen cells to uncover clones with the integrated degron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Previous work in yeast, insect and mammalian cells has led to the conclusion that inhibition of eIF2Balpha failed to activate the ISR as determined by measuring general translation of translation of specific mRNAs (Fabian et al., JBC, 1997; Kimball et al., JBC, 1998; Pavitt et al., MCB, 1997, Elsby et al., 2011; Dever et al., Cell, 1992). Moreover, inhibition of eIF2Bα and its yeast orthologue GCN3, make eIF2B less sensitive to inhibition by eIF2-P. In contrast, Figure 1 shows that degradation of eIF2Balpha triggers the ISR. How can these apparent contradictory results be explained? A discussion is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to our Discussion to cover this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The degron-mediated degradation of eIF2Bα leads to a similar phenotype to that observed with mutations in eIF2B in VWMD. Could the authors speculate the mechanism by which degradation of the α subunit of eIF2B activates the ISR?</p></disp-quote><p>It does indeed lead to a similar phenotype as VWMD mutations. In Figures 1-3 we demonstrate that eIF2Bα regulates eIF2B complex assembly state and that destabilizing the complex (decamers turning into tetramers after eIF2Bα degradation), induces the ISR, and ISRIB can assemble tetramers into octamers. Thus eIF2B GEF activity is intimately tied to its assembly state, and VWMD mutations that impair complex assembly state likely activate the ISR by this mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The existence of a recent study describing an allosteric model for ISRIB action should be acknowledged much earlier in the manuscript, it only appears very late in the Discussion. It would be appropriate to discuss in the Introduction and perhaps modify some of the experimental rationale to take this into account.</p></disp-quote><p>While recent work from the Ron and Ito labs came to similar conclusions regarding antagonism between eIF2-P and ISRIB, we respectfully disagree with the assessment that the Introduction and in particular our experimental rationale should be modified. Our research project and experiments were conceived long before the Ito/Ron work was publicly disclosed and published. Indeed, we asked the Ron and Ito labs to coordinate publication of our independent projects, but this proposal was not accepted. Also, our paper covers a broader scope of work. Thus we feel strongly that the current discussion is entirely appropriate and truthfully reflects the history of these discoveries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) “Both eIF2 and eIF2-P binding sites span interfaces between eIF2B subunits present in the decamer but not in the subcomplexes from which it is assembled.”</p><p>The authors are selective in their proposed eIF2B assembly pathway options which are stated as a fact. There is ample evidence that eIF2Babd hexamer and eIF2Bge dimers can assemble, yet these intermediates are not discussed or evaluated anywhere in the manuscript. An 2Babd hexamer should have both binding sites for eIF2a and 2aP and its assembly could be assessed in the authors in vitro fluorescence complex assembly assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer raising this nuanced point, and we have added a section to our Discussion, in which we discuss the possibility of other eIF2B subcomplexes. While we agree that the existence of other subspecies is of potential interest, in the context of the current manuscript and human eIF2B the eIF2Bβδγε tetramer, eIF2Bα<sub>2</sub> dimer, and eIF2B(αβδγε)<sub>2</sub> decamer appear to be the most abundant and physiologically relevant (Wortham et al., 2014). Further study of subcomplexes will undoubtedly be pursued in the future but is outside the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The first section headings of the Results are misleading/overstating the results, because the assembly state of eIF2B is not monitored in the assays described. The data may be consistent with the interpretation, but they should be re-worded. The assembly state is first tested in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that the assembly state of eIF2B is first measured in Figure 2, there is ample evidence discussed in our Introduction, and other prior work, showing that eIF2Bα and ISRIB modulate eIF2B’s assembly state in vitro. This work puts these previous observations into a cellular context and the headings accurately describe the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2. Was in vitro assembly with eIF2Bbd and 2Ba alone in the absence of eIF2Bge ever investigated in the in vitro system? Other studies (as indicated above) have indicated eIF2Bbd tetramer and 2Babd hexamers can form.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not investigate assembly of this potential subcomplex, partially owing to our inability to purify human eIF2Bβδ, which in our hands is not a stable subcomplex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors separate whether ISRIB at sub-saturating concentrations primarily promotes the formation of octamers from tetramers or instead binds to and stabilises octamers that form independently and so acts to retard the rate of disassembly of octamers back into tetramers that can otherwise occur in the experiment? My reading of the data suggests the latter is more consistent with these experiments rather than the former, but that the text is written to imply that promoting assembly is the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous work with eIF2B tetramers, and indeed the work in this paper, show that octamers without ISRIB present are an exceedingly minor, if not non-existent, species even at high concentrations of eIF2B subunits. Therefore, the logic of ISRIB stapling two tetramers into an octamer appears far more plausible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experimental timelines for the addition of dTag13, trimethoprim, ISRIB and/or Tg to cells are not well described in the Materials and methods (in contrast to the detailed information for western blots), and is therefore currently unclear in most experiments for how long trimethoprim is added prior to the stated other treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Materials and methods and Results section to make clear when drugs are added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Does dTag13 act to degrade free eIF2Ba only, assembled decamers only or both equally well?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and one that is tough to address experimentally — but we can intuit a reasonable answer. Based on the data shown in Figure 2E, we know that eIF2Bα dissociates quite slowly from the assembled decamer (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3 h). We also see that essentially all eIF2Bα has been degraded by 3 h (and indeed happens much faster than that). So based on these data it is fair to assume that both free eIF2Bα and decameric eIF2Bα must be degraded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3 B-D derive from population data, but the error bars are extremely tight. How variable are the signals from individual cells? By showing box or violin plots the variation in the population would be clear. Here the analysis is simply relying on the mean.

Are similar foci detected within the cells examined here? and if so, how do these bodies impact on the data analysis performed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is certainly something of interest that we hope to pursue in more appropriate cells. K562 cells (a suspension cell line with rounded morphology) are poor for microscopy work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It should also be possible to calculate a K1/2 constant association/inhibition concentrations for the relevant plots shown in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 4D the Ki constant for inhibiting FAM-ISRIB binding by eIF2aP alone appears significantly weaker than that for the full eIF2P complex shown in Figure 4C. This would suggest that eIF2 complex components in addition to eIF2a do have an impact on competition with ISRIB, while the authors' conclusion is ness nuanced.</p></disp-quote><p>See above (Essential Revision 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors previously proposed that the binding of eIF2P to eIF2B provided a steric block through a clash between the eIF2beta-γ subunits. Now here they propose a different mechanism that is more plausible and based primarily on eIF2alphaP binding to eIF2B. Lines of published evidence that did not fit their previous model have not been cited in this context. (i) the large flexibility of eIF2alphaCTD observed many years ago in NMR experiments (the Ito et al., 2004 reference) suggests the bound eIF2g will not be in one position and (2) more recent cryoEM studies of eIF2-eIF2B complexes (Adomavicius et al., 2019 reference) that shows eIF2P anchored via the α subunit can indeed flex and move eIF2g to a range of positions that do not clash.</p></disp-quote><p>We have inserted a sentence in the Discussion to reference this flexibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) “A titration of eIF2 into this reaction allowed FAM-ISRIB polarization to recover, indicating that eIF2 binds and competes off eIF2α-P, which restores FAM-ISRIB binding.”</p><p>Are the authors suggesting that eIF2 can bind to eIF2B/eIF2P complexes forming transient complexes with &gt;2 eIF2 molecules bound before promoting release of eIF2aP?</p><p>Is this experiment done with competing eIF2 complex or eIF2a alone?</p><p>Data in Figure 4 indicate that the eIF2 complex binds with higher affinity to eIF2B than eIF2a alone. To this reviewer, this experiment in Figure 5 is simply showing that the eIF2 complex can bind with higher affinity than the isolated eIF2a to eIF2B. What happens when both eIF2 and eIF2P complexes are used and also when both eIF2a/eIF2aP subunit only combinations are used in this assay?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fairly complicated experiment that could have been explained better. The flaw in our previous description likely contributed to a misinterpretation of the data. In brief, we show that eIF2α-P can compete off FAM-ISRIB and that a titration of eIF2 restores FAM-ISRIB binding, presumably by antagonizing eIF2α-P binding. In order to further support these claims, we have now performed Michaelis Menten kinetic analyses to examine how eIF2α-P inhibits the eIF2B, and we have performed an in vitro IP experiment to directly show antagonism between eIF2 and eIF2α-P binding to eIF2B. In aggregate, these new data show that eIF2α-P converts decameric eIF2B into “conjoined tetramers” where decameric eIF2B takes on the binding affinity and enzymatic activity of a tetramer owing to a distortion of the eIF2α binding site and an overall change of eIF2B’s conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The validation report for the EM structure indicates many regions where the level of discrepancy between the map and model is very high. The Ramachandran plot shows no unfavoured geometry, which is very unusual. This suggests that the atomic model may not be reliable. Some presentation of the model in the density in relevant regions could convince readers otherwise. There are some very badly fitting chains: I, J and A are 30 to 57% in red. It is not immediately clear which chain relates to which subunit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the atomic model for the apo eIF2B decamer since the initial submission and notably diminished the number of atoms that were formerly outside the map density threshold. As shown in the updated validation report and revised figures, the updated model is a reliable interpretation of the EM density. We also note the models are consistent with multiple independent structures of eIF2B determined by different labs. Chains A and B correspond to the epsilon subunits; chains I and J correspond to the γ subunits. Unlike the high-resolution core of the eIF2B complex, these subunits include peripheral domains that are more flexible – an observation that is also consistent across diverse structures of eIF2B. These regions are less well resolved (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1, panel E), resulting in worse map-to-model correlations at the periphery and more uncertainty about the precise conformations of the side chains. In prior structures, we decided to &quot;stub&quot; ambiguous side-chains and only modeled the backbone atoms in these challenging regions. In this case, while the peripheral regions remain challenging, we decided it was both possible and warranted to retain the side-chains during refinement. Per the reviewer's request, we added a new panel (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, panel F) to illustrate the map quality for different regions (from high to low local resolution) and how well the representative segments of the model correspond with the map in these different regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 6—figure supplement 2 the apo-structure appears to be green not grey as indicated in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this mistake – it has been corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only a few comments on the paper:</p><p>1) Introduction section final paragraph: &quot;grove&quot; should be &quot;groove&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this – fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “eIF2α-P is sufficient to impair ISRIB binding to eIF2B”: the authors' conclusion that phosphorylated eIF2alpha subunit is sufficient to inhibit eIF2B is interesting. This might be consistent with the ability of overexpressed eIF2alpha-S51D to stimulate the ISR in cells. It would be interesting to know if overexpression of an eIF2alpha-S51D mutant that lacks its C-terminus and thus cannot assemble into eIF2 complexes can inhibit eIF2B in mammalian cells. Alternatively, phosphorylated eIF2alpha might only inhibit in vitro but not in vivo.</p><p>It might be worthwhile to note that the situation is likely different in yeast. Obviously, we know that yeast eIF2B is different than mammalian eIF2B in that yeast eIF2B is not activated by ISRIB. However, it was also previously shown that overexpressed eIF2alpha is readily phosphorylated in yeast (see original paper from the Hinnebusch lab, Cell 1992), but this does not lead to hyperinduction of GCN4. These yeast results were interpreted to indicate that phosphorylated eIF2alpha does not inhibit eIF2B on its own.</p></disp-quote><p>The S51D work is very interesting, but based on the data presented in this paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350553/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350553/</ext-link>) it seems impossible to tell whether ISR activation was driven by eIF2α-S51D alone or by the subunits that were incorporated into the full heterotrimer. The experiment suggested by the reviewer of S51D overexpression lacking the C-terminus is a good one and can directly address this question. We will look into investigating it further in our systems but the outcome will not add substantially to the conclusions of the present manuscript. Regarding the point about eIF2α-P inhibiting in vitro but not in vivo, in a cellular context, the amount of free eIF2α-P may never rise to a high enough concentration to activate the ISR as the full heterotrimer binds tighter and free eIF2α-P is unlikely to ever be a major species in cells. Nevertheless, we show that a conformational change in eIF2B is responsible for a drop in eIF2B’s GEF activity and ISR activation, and this conformational change is induced by eIF2-P or eIF2α-P alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 2: should &quot;light grey&quot; be &quot;green&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this – fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
