The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats, the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded—predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of anesthesia was a significant advance in medicine. It allows individuals to undergo surgery without feeling pain or remembering the experience. But scientists still do not know how anesthesia works. During anesthesia, scientists have measured brain activity using electroencephalograms (EEG) and found that the brain appears to turn on and off. Comatose patients also have similar switches between bursts of electrical activity and periods of silence. This burst-suppression pattern may be related to unconsciousness.</p><p>But scientists still have many questions about how anesthesia causes burst-suppression.

Most anesthetics lead to a dose-dependent transition from mild sedation to deep unconsciousness, accompanied by a progression of distinct electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). This progression is well characterized for halogenated volatile agents, like isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroeger et al., 2013</xref>). Low isoflurane concentrations lead to high-amplitude low-frequency activity, whereas at higher concentrations, the ongoing activity is quasi-periodically interrupted by quiescent periods that can last from seconds to minutes. This alternation between bursts of activity and gaps of quiescence is termed burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swank, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Swank and Watson, 1949</xref>). As anesthesia deepens, suppression periods become longer and ultimately culminate in complete electrical silence. The same sequence unfolds for many other anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akrawi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleischmann et al., 2018</xref>) and even during deep hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Westover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Burst-suppression also appears in comas of various etiologies, for which it holds diagnostic and prognostic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cloostermans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmeijer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Young, 2000</xref>). Clinically, burst-suppression is often used as the target EEG pattern for intended neuroprotection as well as pharmacological control of intracranial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Westover et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The presence of burst-suppression in a variety of unconscious conditions has led some researchers to propose that it represents a common low-order ‘attractor’ state—a hallmark of a profoundly inactive brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching et al., 2012</xref>). Several models have focused on the temporal bistability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bojak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liley and Walsh, 2013</xref>), while many open questions surround the spatial properties of bursts—namely, their origin and propagation across brain areas. Bursts have traditionally been viewed as globally synchronous events, based on their simultaneous occurrence across EEG electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark and Rosner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swank, 1949</xref>). However, recent findings from electrocorticogram in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>) and widefield calcium imaging in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>) have challenged this view by demonstrating considerable spatial variation in burst origin and propagation. Furthermore, it is yet unclear whether burst-suppression is intrinsically cortical or is influenced by subcortical sources. According to one hypothesis, the cortex spontaneously falls into burst-suppression upon anatomical or functional disconnection from other brain areas. This view is supported by observations of burst-suppression in isolated neocortical slice preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lukatch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lukatch and MacIver, 1996</xref>), but contradicted by the ability of sensory stimuli to evoke bursts indistinguishable from the spontaneously occurring ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartikainen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hudetz and Imas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Land et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Incorporating detailed spatial information into burst-suppression models could reduce the pool of possible mechanisms. Such information, in the form of three-dimensional whole-brain maps, can be provided by blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Logothetis and Pfeuffer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ogawa et al., 1990</xref>). The two distinct phases of burst-suppression correspond to different energy consumption levels, which should—through neurovascular coupling—translate into noticeable changes in blood flow and oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hillman, 2014</xref>). This premise has been confirmed in several species. In rats, a combination of EEG with optical imaging of cerebral blood flow revealed that bursts are coupled with strong hemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). The same effect was demonstrated in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>) using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. These two studies have shown that the burst timing from EEG can be used for fMRI mapping of burst-suppression.</p><p>While the preservation of neurovascular coupling during burst-suppression holds promise for clinical research, it creates pitfalls for the increasingly popular animal fMRI studies. About four of five such studies are conducted under anesthesia, most commonly with isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mandino et al., 2020</xref>). Given that medium-to-high concentrations of isoflurane lead to burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroeger et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that many animal fMRI experiments have been conducted during this state. This assumption is supported by reports of global BOLD signal synchronization in isoflurane-anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalthoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>), as is expected during burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Animal fMRI researchers typically try to avoid this confounding effect by using low concentrations of isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), opting for different anesthetic regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalthoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>), or applying global signal regression during fMRI preprocessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalthoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, burst-suppression is not a nuisance variable, but a biologically and clinically significant neural phenomenon. Here, we show that fMRI data from anesthetized humans and animals can be exploited to map the spatial distribution of burst-suppression using a data-driven approach. Unlike previous studies, our strategy applies the same methodology across species, allowing us to examine whether specific brain regions are involved universally across mammals. To achieve this, we first implemented a simple heuristic algorithm for identifying the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in a human EEG-fMRI dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ranft et al., 2016</xref>). We then used this algorithm to detect instances of burst-suppression in fMRI data from anesthetized animals (macaques, marmosets, and rats) and constructed species-specific whole-brain maps of burst-suppression. These maps provide a detailed spatial account of burst-suppression in some of the most widely used animal models and reveal crucial differences between primates and rodents. The maps will serve as a guide for identifying promising target regions and facilitate translational research into the mechanisms of burst-suppression and its role in brain pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>fMRI signatures of EEG-defined burst-suppression in anesthetized humans</title><p>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are ideal for constructing a whole-brain map of burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). EEG supplies the timing of burst and suppression phases, which is convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF) and correlated with fMRI to produce voxel-wise statistical parametric maps. However, simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are challenging, particularly at high magnetic field strengths. Knowing the exact hemodynamic correlates of burst-suppression may circumvent the need for concurrent EEG, especially if these correlates are specific enough to serve as a unique fMRI signature.</p><p>To explore this approach, we revisited an EEG-fMRI dataset acquired in anesthetized human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ranft et al., 2016</xref>), which contains task-free measurements at three different concentrations of the anesthetic sevoflurane: 3.9–4.6% (‘high’), 3% (‘intermediate’), and 2% (‘low’). Importantly, this concentration range spans across EEG states, allowing us to examine how they differ in their fMRI patterns. We categorized the EEG recordings as one of two states—burst-suppression or continuous slow-wave activity (uninterrupted by suppressions). The high sevoflurane concentration had been intentionally chosen in the initial study to induce burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ranft et al., 2016</xref>), and indeed 19/20 subjects exhibited the typical bistable EEG alternation at this concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The same applied to 4/20 subjects at the intermediate concentration, albeit with shorter suppression phases. The remaining intermediate-concentration recordings as well as all low-concentration recordings showed uninterrupted slow-wave EEG activity. These results are consistent with the known dose-dependency of burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pilge et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signatures of electroencephalogram (EEG)-defined burst-suppression in anesthetized humans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Burst and suppression phases are marked on an EEG spectrogram of a human participant under sevoflurane anesthesia.

The carpet plot is a heatmap of BOLD signal intensity, where each row represents a normalized (z-score) voxel time series. Upon examining carpet plots from fMRI runs with EEG-defined burst-suppression, we identified pronounced signal fluctuations that spanned almost the entire cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, fMRI runs with continuous slow-wave EEG activity showed no such cortex-wide fluctuations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to quantify the exact correspondence between widespread BOLD fluctuations and EEG burst-suppression. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the 2D matrix of cortical voxel time series, extracted the first five temporal components, and correlated them with the voxel time series. In fMRI runs with cortex-wide fluctuations, the bistable pattern visible on the carpet plot was captured by one of the principal components (PCs)—in most cases the first PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This component was strongly correlated with most cortical voxel time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), shifting the histogram of Pearson’s correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) away from zero—unlike the symmetric zero-centered histograms of other PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Due to this property, we will hereafter refer to such components as ‘asymmetric’ PCs and use the median of the cortex-wide <italic>r</italic> values as a measure of asymmetry. The presence of asymmetric PCs proved to be a reliable signature of burst-suppression, as we demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> across subjects. The two EEG-defined states (burst-suppression vs continuous slow waves) were linearly separable based on the median <italic>r</italic> value alone. Every run with EEG burst-suppression had a single PC with median <italic>r</italic>&gt;0.45, which was not the case for any of the runs with continuous slow waves. A single recording was an exception to this rule (subject 15 at high sevoflurane concentration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), exhibiting no asymmetric PC. The EEG of this recording showed near-constant suppression interrupted by only one short burst.</p><p>So far, we have seen that burst-suppression is uniquely associated with an asymmetric PC that captures a widespread fluctuation in the cortical BOLD signal. Notably, this asymmetric PC closely follows the alternating burst-suppression pattern of EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) and likely is a direct hemodynamic correlate. To verify this last observation, we compared each asymmetric PC with a neurovascular model derived from the concurrent EEG recording. For constructing the model, we convolved the EEG pattern (1 for burst, 0 for suppression) with a canonical HRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover, 1999</xref>) and passed the resulting time series through the bandpass filter used for fMRI preprocessing (0.005–0.12 Hz, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The BOLD signal of the asymmetric PCs was indeed strongly correlated with the EEG-derived model (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>=0.73 ± 0.11, mean ± SD), but with a notable time-lag between the two. A cross-correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) showed that the asymmetric PC was delayed by 3.71 ± 2.22 s (mean ± SD) compared with the neurovascular model. This lag can be attributed to a slowing of the HRF—an expected effect of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). We accounted for this lag by comparing the asymmetric PCs to the EEG-derived models at the time lags that maximized their cross-correlation and found that the correlation increased to <italic>r</italic>=0.84 ± 0.06.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mapping burst-suppression in anesthetized humans without EEG</title><p>Since asymmetric PCs are the hemodynamic correlates of burst-suppression, their spatial distribution should represent a whole-brain map of burst-suppression.

One study described the potential fMRI correlate of burst-suppression in rats: widespread BOLD synchrony across the cortex and the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we anticipated at which isoflurane concentrations burst-suppression might occur, and how the maps might look like. To replicate these findings, we obtained rat fMRI data covering the concentration range between 1.5 and 2.5% isoflurane. The animals (11 adult female Wistar rats) were mechanically ventilated and imaged at 9.4T. We first acquired three fMRI runs at 2% isoflurane—each covering 12 min, and then switched to either a lower (1.5%, in 6/11 rats) or a higher (2.5%, in 5/11 rats) concentration before acquiring three additional fMRI runs.</p><p>We followed the same analysis procedure as in primates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows an example fMRI run with an asymmetric PC (a counterexample can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The most prominent and unambiguous example is V1, which in primates showed no correlation to the asymmetric PCs. This finding cannot be attributed to a fluke of thresholding (see unthresholded <italic>T</italic> statistic maps in figure supplement 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) or to regional differences in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR, see figure supplement 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The visual cortex of the macaque brain did exhibit lower tSNR compared with more anterior areas, but this fact alone cannot account for its sparing. Other macaque brain areas with comparably low tSNR values, such as area TE of the inferior temporal cortex, were significantly correlated with asymmetric PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The sparing of V1 prompted us to look more closely at its activity and to compare it with an area strongly engaged in burst-suppression. In each of the four species, we defined two regions-of-interest—one in V1 and another in the cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 24 in primates, primary cingulate cortex in rats)—and extracted their mean BOLD signal time series from fMRI runs, previously identified as burst-suppression. We then computed the SD of the time series, as a measure of BOLD signal amplitude, and its power spectral density (PSD). We also performed seed-based correlation analysis using the extracted time series as GLM regressors. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> across species. As expected, the cingulate exhibited the same bistable fluctuation as the asymmetric PCs, and its seed-based correlation map was identical to the species-specific asymmetric PC maps.

Conversely, V1 activity in primates was very different from the cingulate: BOLD signal amplitude was reduced (p&lt;0.001 in humans, p=0.004 in macaques, p=0.008 in marmosets; paired samples two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), PSD was lower across all frequencies, and seed-based correlation maps were confined to the V1 itself, barely extending beyond the seed borders.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Primate V1 is uncoupled from the rest of the cortex during burst-suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal time series extracted from two regions-of-interest, the cingulate (Cg) area 24cd and the primary visual cortex (V1), are shown for an example human subject during burst-suppression (<bold>A1</bold>).

In the previous analysis of the human dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>), the occipital electrodes of the EEG showed the same bursts as the more anterior electrodes, which might imply a true uncoupling between the electrical activity and the BOLD signal in V1. However, EEG may simply lack the spatial resolution to record a different electrical activity originating in V1: the small V1 area on the lateral cortical surface is dwarfed by non-visual areas engaging in burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Lacking invasive neural recordings, we cannot dissect the above possibilities with certainty.</p><p>Nevertheless, we tried to get a hint from the human fMRI data by examining whether V1 BOLD activity differs between the EEG-defined states of burst-suppression and continuous slow waves. We focused on 12 human subjects, in which the EEG showed clear burst-suppression at the high sevoflurane concentration (3.9–4.6%) and continuous slow waves at both the intermediate (3%) and the low (2%) concentrations. For each of V1 and cingulate seeds, we examined the effects of sevoflurane concentration on BOLD signal amplitude and PSD. The detailed results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. In summary, both V1 and cingulate exhibited a reduction in BOLD signal amplitude from low to intermediate concentrations. During the high concentration (burst-suppression), the signal amplitude rose significantly in cingulate, but stayed the same as during the intermediate concentration in V1—albeit with a slight shift toward lower frequencies. Assuming the presence of continuous slow waves in V1 during the intermediate concentration, they are likely sustained through the high concentration as well. In case of a complete suppression of slow-wave activity, a noticeable further reduction in BOLD signal amplitude would be expected. A local change in neurovascular coupling, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out with the current data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified the fMRI signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and constructed comparable maps in four mammalian species: humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), marmosets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The maps exhibited homology across the three primate species; burst-suppression engaged the striatum and a large part of the neocortex, with some exceptions mostly at unimodal primary areas. The primary visual area (V1) was the predominant exception, appearing entirely decoupled from the rest of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Contrary to primates, burst-suppression was pancortical in rats, including all sensory and motor areas. In the following discussion, we first consider the limitations and potential applications of our method for identifying the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression, and then explore the implications of inter-species differences for existing models of burst-suppression and for future translational efforts.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>fMRI signatures of burst-suppression</title><p>We determined that EEG-defined burst-suppression in humans manifests on fMRI as an ‘asymmetric PC,’ which can be used as this state’s fMRI signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The asymmetry refers to the distribution of correlation coefficients between the PC and cortical voxels and reflects profound cortical synchrony. The threshold for PC asymmetry (median cortex-wide <italic>r</italic>) is arbitrarily defined, which constitutes a weakness, since the appropriate value is expected to vary depending on animal species, anesthetic agent, and imaging parameters. To create the animal burst-suppression maps, we conservatively selected only fMRI runs that presented a single clear asymmetric PC candidate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We have several reasons to be confident in our selection, despite the manually chosen thresholds. First, the isoflurane concentration range at which these asymmetric PCs were detected closely matches previous reports of burst-suppression in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Detsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stenroos et al., 2021</xref>). In this regard, our findings in rats are especially encouraging, because almost all asymmetric PCs were found at a concentration of 2% and less so at 1.5 or 2.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, the detected widespread fluctuations cannot be attributed to known non-neural sources, such as physiology or motion. The asymmetric PCs displayed quasi-periodicity and were overwhelmingly correlated with gray matter areas. Physiological noise related to mechanical ventilation or heartbeat would have been strictly periodic, while motion artifacts are known to distribute along image edges. In summary, all evidence points toward burst-suppression as the underlying cause of the selected asymmetric PCs in the investigated animals.</p><p>Given the arbitrary threshold limitation, our method should not be viewed as an automated fMRI-based classification of burst-suppression but instead as a heuristic algorithm for identifying this state. Nevertheless, the method can find applications within the growing animal fMRI community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mandino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Milham et al., 2020</xref>) and potentially also in clinical settings. Animal fMRI researchers could use the algorithm to screen datasets for the presence of burst-suppression—as we did in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>. That said, the generalization of the method to other animal species and anesthetic agents warrants caution, keeping in mind that the amplitude and duration of bursts vary across anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akrawi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleischmann et al., 2018</xref>). One potential clinical application concerns the management of comatose patients, where burst-suppression is often present—either transiently or throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cloostermans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmeijer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Young, 2000</xref>). After appropriate validation, our method could map burst-suppression in these patients, even at centers lacking the capacity for simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. An fMRI readout of burst-suppression, with its high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage, could provide clinicians with information inaccessible by EEG. The implications of this additional information for the management of comatose patients remain to be examined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Burst-suppression across mammalian species</title><p>How do our maps fit in what we know about the spatial distribution of burst-suppression? The apparent exclusion of V1 replicates the previous analysis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>) and corroborates an existing report in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Still, our macaque map constitutes an important generalization, as it is based on seven long-tailed macaques—compared with only two rhesus individuals in the previous study. The marmoset burst-suppression map is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind and suggests that V1 exclusion may be a general primate feature. The pancortical distribution of burst-suppression in rats agrees with all previous findings in this species by fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aedo-Jury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paasonen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>) or calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>). The strength of our approach lies in computing all maps with the same data-driven approach, thus allowing us to make direct cross-species comparisons.</p><p>The main inter-species difference was the exclusion of visual areas (and parts of other unimodal cortices) in primates, but not in rats. While bursts were traditionally viewed as synchronous cortex-wide events, recent work rather describes them as complex waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bojak et al., 2015</xref>) emerging from a spatially shifting focus and rapidly spreading through the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>). Electrocortical recordings in propofol-anesthetized human patients revealed that some electrodes could display continuous activity while others engaged in burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>). Together with our results, this implies that brain areas may vary in their propensity for generating and/or propagating bursts. Regional metabolic differences could underlie such variability, according to a proposed neurophysiological-metabolic model of burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching et al., 2012</xref>). This model posits that suppressions occur when metabolic resources can no longer sustain neuronal firing, whereas bursts constitute transient recoveries of activity—enabled by slow metabolic replenishment. The visual cortex of primates could impose special metabolic demands and thus find itself at an extreme end of the spectrum for burst propensity. Such special demands could arise from its many distinctive characteristics—including cytoarchitecture, neurotransmitter receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Froudist-Walsh et al., 2021</xref>), functional connectivity profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>), and cortical myelin density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Van Essen et al., 2019</xref>). We particularly suspect cortical myelin to play a role, considering that many areas excluded from our primate burst-suppression maps—V1, MT, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices—are among the richest in myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Van Essen et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, rodents exhibit a more uniform myelin distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fulcher et al., 2019</xref>), which could translate in a likewise uniform propensity for bursting.</p><p>Whatever the cause, the non-correlation of V1 and other primary sensory areas with burst-suppression challenges existing ideas about the origin of bursts. Studies in isoflurane-anesthetized humans, cats, rats, and mice showed that bursts can be evoked by incoming sensory stimuli, including flashes of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartikainen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hudetz and Imas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Land et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, burst-suppression has been described as a state of cortical hypersensitivity, during which even subliminal sensory stimuli can trigger a burst excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>). In that case, bursts would be expected to originate at the stimulated sensory area and then spread throughout the cortex indiscriminately, like ripples on a pond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>). The pancortical rodent map is fully compatible with this view, but the exclusion of sensory areas in primates seems paradoxical: why would the areas of origin not be a part of the ripple? A possible explanation is that the bursts captured in our data were internally generated or evoked through a non-excluded sensory modality (e.g., auditory areas in non-human primates). Nevertheless, a closer investigation of sensory-evoked bursts in primates is warranted—especially with visual stimuli.</p><p>So far, we have discussed cortical aspects of burst-suppression, but fMRI also offers access to subcortical structures. Among these, the striatum displayed the strongest correlation with burst-suppression across all four species—showing that the cortex does not act in isolation. Cortico-striatal loops may play an important—but yet unexplored—role in burst propagation. The thalamus, on the contrary, was only partly correlated with burst-suppression, and to a varying extent across species. Interestingly, anteromedial parts were more likely to be involved than posterolateral parts, possibly reflecting a differential role played by thalamic primary relay centers and higher-order nuclei, as previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>). Regional variations in thalamic activity could even shape cortical differences since the thalamus may be important for driving burst onsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steriade et al., 1994</xref>). Similar to the thalamus, the hippocampus and amygdala were partially correlated with burst-suppression. However, we refrain from concrete conclusions, since in primates, these two structures are located in low signal-to-noise areas and often suffer from susceptibility-induced distortions (see figure supplement 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The cerebellum also suffered from low signal-to-noise in our non-human primate data and was only partly captured in marmosets and rats. Nevertheless, the non-correlation of the cerebellar cortex with burst-suppression is likely a true effect, given its consistency across all species.</p><p>At this point, we wish to address a potentially confusing issue of terminology. We employ the term ‘burst-suppression,’ preferred by clinical anesthesiologists. It has been pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming et al., 2020</xref>) that several rodent studies may refer to the same phenomenon as ‘slow oscillation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aedo-Jury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>)—meaning a&lt;1 Hz alternation between a depolarized ‘UP’ state of neural activity and a hyperpolarized ‘DOWN’ state of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steriade and Nunez, 1993</xref>). In the slow oscillation context, suppressions can be viewed as prolonged DOWN states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>). However, the line between the two is blurry, given the gradual dose-dependent lengthening of quiescent periods. This distinction is even harder if one considers potential inter-species differences in the timescale of burst-suppression. We noticed that bursts and suppressions alternate faster when moving from humans to non-human primates to rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Within the framework of the neurophysiological-metabolic model of burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ching et al., 2012</xref>), such differences in timescale could reflect the faster metabolic rate of smaller animals. Verifying this hypothesis would require further studies involving direct neural recordings.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Burst-suppression timescales across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal time series extracted from the cingulate cortex are shown for all runs classified as burst-suppression across the four species. This region—also used for the seed-based analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)—was selected because of its strong correlation with burst-suppression (i.e., asymmetric principal components) in all species. The time series are shown min-max scaled to emphasize differences in time, not in amplitude. The time series peaks appear shorter in duration and occur more frequently as we move from humans to non-human primates and finally to rats. (<bold>B</bold>) This effect is reflected on the power spectral density (PSD) plots of the time series, with increasingly higher frequencies being present from top to bottom. PSD was computed from time series normalized to percent-signal-change (relative to the mean) prior to min-max scaling. Vertical dashed lines indicate the cutoffs of the bandpass filter that was used for fMRI preprocessing.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74813-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A caveat concerning our cross-species comparison of burst-suppression maps and timescales might be that the depth of anesthesia was not standardized across species. For example, the three concentrations of sevoflurane delivered to human participants did not correspond to the three isoflurane levels used in rats. In humans, the highest sevoflurane concentration led to burst-suppression, with suppressions occupying roughly 50% of the time. In rats, burst-suppression was most reliably produced at the intermediate concentration of 2% isoflurane, while the 2.5% concentration probably corresponded to a near-constant isoelectric state. The non-human primate studies did not involve graded levels of anesthetic concentration; we rather analyzed the observed instances of burst-suppression. An additional complication is that our non-human primate studies covered a wide age range (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), extending well into old age. This is expected to influence the concentration at which burst-suppression occurs since anesthetic requirements decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nickalls and Mapleson, 2003</xref>). In future studies, it would be of interest to systematically assess the dose-dependent evolution of burst-suppression across species.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Datasets of the present study.</title><p>For age and weight, mean and range values are reported.

By contrast, burst-suppression in rats appears to be pancortical—prompting an investigation into the cause of this primate-rodent difference and raising questions about the validity of rodent models for anesthesia and coma. Addressing these issues will necessitate invasive neural recordings during burst-suppression, in both primates and rodents, with V1 being the target of highest interest. Our findings also point toward several other promising research directions: clarifying the exact relationship between spontaneous and sensory-evoked bursts, investigating the role of the striatum and thalamus, and examining inter-species differences in the timescale of burst-suppression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental subjects and anesthesia</title><p>Five datasets from three research sites were used for this manuscript (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

When clinically indicated, a laryngeal mask was inserted and mechanical ventilation was started. Following that, sevoflurane concentration was increased until the EEG showed suppression about 50% of the time, with suppression periods lasting at least 1 s (reached at end-tidal concentrations of 3.9–4.6%). At this point, 700 s of simultaneous EEG-fMRI were recorded. This recording was repeated at two lower fixed concentrations, 3 and 2%, each following an equilibration period of 15 min.

The animals were intubated using an endotracheal tube and placed in a sphinx position inside a custom-made MRI-compatible stereotaxic frame to minimize movement artifacts. The ear bars also served as hearing protection and were dabbed with a lidocaine-containing ointment (EMLA 5%, AstraZeneca) for local anesthesia. Dexpanthenol eye ointment (Bepanthen, Bayer) was applied for corneal protection. Body temperature was maintained constant at 37°C with the help of a circulating warm water system. Monitoring equipment was attached, including a pulse oximeter (NONIN model 7500FO, SANIMED GmbH, Germany), a respiratory belt, surface electrodes for electrocardiogram (MRI ECG electrodes, CONMED, USA), and an anesthetic gas analyzer (Philips M1026A Anesthesia Gas Module) for measuring CO<sub>2</sub> and isoflurane concentrations.

Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, with the concentration being continually adjusted to ensure physiological stability. The goal was to sustain an anesthetized depth that would ensure endotracheal tube toleration. The needed end-tidal isoflurane concentrations varied between 0.9 and 2% across animals. Each imaging session lasted for up to 5 hr, during which multiple structural MRI contrasts were acquired, as well as task-free BOLD fMRI (one or two runs per animal, each lasting 600–1200 s).

Rectal temperature was kept within 36.5 ± 1°C using a pad heated by circulating water. The rat was placed at the isocenter of the MRI system and structural MRI data were acquired. These were followed by three task-free fMRI runs, each 360 s long. After that, isoflurane was either decreased to 1.5% (6/11 animals) or increased to 2.5% (5/11 animals). Following an equilibration period of 30 min, three additional task-free fMRI runs were acquired (six runs per animal in total). In one rat, only four fMRI runs could be obtained due to an early interruption of the imaging session (disconnection of the endotracheal tube). At the end of the imaging session, isoflurane was stopped, and the rats were extubated as soon as spontaneous breathing had recovered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Rat 2</title><p>The six adult male Wistar rats included in the Rat 2 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paasonen et al., 2016</xref>) weighed 265–350 g (mean 307 g).

For visualization purposes, results were resampled from the MNI152 volumetric space to the fsaverage surface template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischl et al., 1999</xref>, part of Freesurfer v6.0.0) using the registration-fusion approach (RF-ANTS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Cortical regions-of-interest were taken from the Human Connectome Project multimodal parcellation 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) and transformed to the MNI152 and fsaverage spaces. Subcortical regions were defined based on the Harvard-Oxford subcortical structural atlas (distributed with FSL v5.0.1). For marmoset data, we used the NIH v3.0 population template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) as a standard coordinate system. The volumetric results were visualized on the template’s cortical surface (Connectome Workbench <italic>volume-to-surface-mapping</italic>, ribbon-constrained method). Regions-of-interest were taken from the Marmoset Brain Mapping V1 MRI-based parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). For the macaque and rat data, we built our own study-specific volumetric templates using a validated template creation process implemented in ANTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avants et al., 2010</xref>). This process relies on iterative nonlinear registration to produce an unbiased average of the population. Our workflow was constructed similarly to the NMT template of the rhesus macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seidlitz et al., 2018</xref>). For each species, the anatomical images (T1-weighted for macaques, T2-weighted for rats) were corrected for variations in image intensity (ANTs <italic>N4BiasFieldCorrection</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tustison et al., 2010</xref>) and rigidly aligned using ANTs (<italic>antsRegistration</italic>). The voxel-wise average of the rigidly aligned images served as the initial target for the iterative template creation process (ANTs <italic>buildtemplateparallel.sh</italic>). The resulting template images were segmented semi-manually with ITK-SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yushkevich et al., 2006</xref>) to create masks for brain and cortex. Macaque regions-of-interest were defined based on the cortical hierarchical (CHARM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jung et al., 2021</xref>) and subcortical (SARM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartig et al., 2021</xref>) atlases of the rhesus macaque, which were transformed from the NMT V2 space to our macaque template space.

The rat brain surface was reconstructed by extracting the isosurface of the brain mask (Freesurfer) and smoothing it (Connectome Workbench). For representing volumetric results on the rat cortical surface, we adapted a method previously used for the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huntenburg et al., 2021</xref>). In short, we first computed the surface normals, vectors perpendicular to each face of the surface mesh. We then generated line segments along those normals, with each segment stretching from the inner edge of the cortical mask toward the pial surface. Finally, we averaged the cortical voxels overlapping with each of these line segments and assigned their mean value to the corresponding surface point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Human</title><p>Images were converted from PAR/REC to NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format using <italic>dcm2niix</italic> v1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

The 3D Gaussian kernel’s FWHM was set to 0.6 mm, and the preprocessed fMRI time series were resampled into the template space at a resolution of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Bandpass temporal filtering was initially applied using the same cutoffs as for the other species (0.005–0.12 Hz). However, we later realized that bursting activity in rats also occurred at faster timescales (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and reanalyzed the data using higher bandpass cutoffs (0.008–0.15 Hz). This gave a richer representation of burst-suppression in the temporal domain, without qualitatively altering the resulting maps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Carpet plots and PCA</title><p>This part of the analysis was performed using in-house python code, which we have made publicly available through GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sirmpilatze, 2021</xref>) and archived on Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5545695). We imported the preprocessed fMRI time series (in their native space) into python and computed the mean and SD images across time as well as their ratio (tSNR). Voxels with tSNR &lt;15 were omitted from further analysis. We then applied cortical masks, which we transformed from the species-specific templates to the native fMRI space and retained only cortical voxels. Subsequently, we reshaped the data from 4D to a 2D matrix (voxels × frames), with each voxel time series (row) normalized to zero mean and unit variance (z-score). To make global signal fluctuations more apparent on the 2D carpet plot, we reordered the voxels according to decreasing correlation with the mean cortical time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aquino et al., 2020</xref>). We then performed PCA on the carpet matrix using singular value decomposition. We extracted the first five temporal PCs and correlated them with all retained cortical voxels (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>). If a PCs’ cortex-wide median <italic>r</italic> value was negative, we sign-flipped the PC and its correlation values to force the PC polarity to match the polarity of BOLD signal fluctuations for most voxels. We visualized the correlation values as heatmaps and as histograms per PC (50 bins between –1 and 1). The PCs with cortex-wide median <italic>r</italic> value above a certain species-specific threshold (human 0.45, macaque 0.15, marmoset 0.22, and rat 0.2) were classified as ‘asymmetric PCs’. The threshold was selected so that at most one prominent PC would exceed them for each fMRI run, with other PCs far below the threshold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). A few fMRI runs in the Rat 1 dataset had more than one PC close to or above the threshold and were thus excluded from downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Correspondence to EEG</title><p>The human EEG acquisition and preprocessing has been described in past manuscripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ranft et al., 2016</xref>). To identify burst and suppression epochs, we calculated the PSD of frontopolar electrodes using Welch’s method (6 s Hann windows, each centered on a single fMRI volume). fMRI volumes with low EEG power (&lt;100 µV<sup>2</sup>) in the 0.5–8 Hz band were designated as suppressions and assigned value 0. Non-suppression epochs, which displayed high amplitude activity mainly in the delta band, were designated as bursts and assigned value 1 (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This process was performed for all anesthetized EEG-fMRI recordings—not just for the ones acquired with the high sevoflurane concentration (as in the previous analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>), which led us to discover that four intermediate-concentration recordings also contained suppression epochs. Recordings in which no fMRI volume was designated as suppression were classified as being in a continuous slow-wave state.</p><p>For runs defined as burst-suppression by EEG, we convolved the boxcar envelope (bursts 1, and suppression 0) with a canonical two-gamma HRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glover, 1999</xref>) and applied the same bandpass filter as for fMRI preprocessing (0.005–0.12 Hz, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To compare the resulting EEG-derived hemodynamic model of burst-suppression with the asymmetric PC derived from the simultaneous fMRI recording, we computed their cross-correlation. We extracted each pair’s correlation at zero lag, their maximum cross-correlation, and the time lag at which the maximum was achieved. Two runs acquired with the high sevoflurane concentration were excluded from the cross-correlation analysis: subject 15 (EEG contained only one short burst and fMRI contained no asymmetric PC) and subject 7 (burst-suppression could be seen on EEG, but part of the recording was corrupted).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Burst-suppression maps</title><p>For each fMRI run with an asymmetric PC, we used the PC as a regressor in a first-level GLM analysis to get its distribution across the brain. The GLM was carried out with FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool Version 6.00, part of FSL) using local autocorrelation correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woolrich et al., 2001</xref>). Resulting <italic>Z</italic> statistic images were masked for the brain and thresholded non-parametrically using clusters determined by <italic>Z</italic>&gt;3.1 and a corrected cluster significance threshold of p=0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Worsley, 2001</xref>). In the case of the human dataset, we also conducted the same analysis using the EEG-derived hemodynamic models as regressors. We compared the unthresholded <italic>Z</italic> statistic maps resulting from the two analyses by computing their spatial cross-correlation (ANTs <italic>Measure Image Similarity</italic>, neighborhood cross-correlation metric within the brain mask). We wish to emphasize that no nuisance signals (e.g., global or CSF signal) were regressed out or included as covariates in the GLM. Since the burst-suppression fluctuation is very widespread, it is expected to be a major contributor in the global signal and hence be highly correlated with it. Similarly, the CSF signal is also related to burst-suppression activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and cannot be considered a nuisance variable.</p><p>For each of the four species, we computed group-level burst-suppression maps using the resulting parameter estimate images from first-level GLMs. For subjects having more than one fMRI run with asymmetric PCs, the images were first averaged within each subject. Subsequently, a non-parametric one sample T-test was computed on the list of subject-level images using FSL randomise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>) with TFCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>). The permutation-based randomise algorithm allows for control of false positives with minimal assumptions about the data, while TFCE has the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding—without the need for arbitrary decisions on cluster-forming thresholds. We thought these advantages to be important, given our goal to compare maps across dissimilar datasets, with varying spatial scales and signal-to-noise ratios. The resulting unthresholded group maps are given in figure supplement 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> across species.

The former was chosen because of its exclusion from primate burst-suppression maps; the latter because of its strong correlation with burst-suppression across species. We extracted each region’s average BOLD signal time series from all preprocessed fMRI runs with asymmetric PCs and normalized them as percent-signal-change relative to the temporal mean. We quantified the SD of the normalized time series as a measure of BOLD signal amplitude. For each species, we compared the BOLD SD between the two regions using a paired samples two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test (jamovi v1.8 statistical software). We also computed the PSD of the normalized time series using Welch’s method (as implemented in <italic>scipy.signal.welch</italic>, segments of 100 timepoints, with 50 overlapping points between segments). Finally, each normalized time series was used as a regressor in a seed-based GLM analysis. The GLM statistics and thresholding were carried out exactly as described above for burst-suppression maps. A total of eight seed-based group-level analyses were carried out (4 species × 2 seeds).</p><p>In the human dataset, we further examined whether the BOLD signal SD and PSD of the two regions differed significantly between the two EEG-defined states. We focused on 12 human subjects, in which the EEG showed clear burst-suppression at the high sevoflurane concentration (3.9–4.6%) and continuous slow waves at both the intermediate (3%) and the low (2%) sevoflurane concentrations. For each of V1 and cingulate seeds, we examined the effects of sevoflurane concentration on three response variables: BOLD signal amplitude (SD), low-frequency log<sub>10</sub>PSD (integrated between 0.005 and 0.05 Hz), and high-frequency log<sub>10</sub>PSD (integrated between 0.05 and 0.12 Hz). The lower frequency range corresponded to the timescale of burst-suppression in the human dataset. The effect of sevoflurane concentration on each of the three response variables was probed with repeated-measures ANOVA (sevoflurane concentration as the within-subject repeated-measures factor, jamovi v1.8). The Greenhouse-Geisser sphericity correction was applied when needed (Mauchly’s sphericity test with p&lt;0.05). In cases of significant ANOVA effects (p&lt;0.05), we performed Tukey post-hoc pairwise comparisons between sevoflurane concentration levels (jamovi 1.8). Least-squares means were estimated for the three levels of sevoflurane concentration. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The human data were acquired for a previous study and have been described elsewhere (Ranft et al., 2016), including information on participant recruitment and the exclusion criteria.

The Rat 2 dataset was acquired for a previous study and has been described elsewhere (Paasonen et al., 2018, 2016). The relevant experiments had been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Provincial Government of Southern Finland. The experiments for the three novel animal datasets were carried out at the German Primate Center (Deutsches Primatenzentrum GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) with the approval of the ethics committee of the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety and in accordance with the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The relevant approval numbers are: 33.19-42502-04-16/2278 (Macaque), 33.19-42502-04-17/2496 and 33.19-42502-04-17/2535 (Marmoset), 33.19-42502-04-15/2042 (Rat 1).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shuntaro Sasai (Reviewer #2); Cornelius Faber (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers were in general positive about the research and the paper, a number of issues were raised by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2. Below are the main points, which are considered essential revisions and the authors should address point-by-point.</p><p>1) As seen in the tSNR map for macaques and marmosets, the tSNR around the primary visual cortex was much weaker than other cortices. Moreover, in marmosets, the EPI slices did not cover the entire brain and actually left most of the V1 uncovered. It would be better to analyze and discuss how the tSNR differences affect the present findings. For example, the author may consider including the tSNR as covariance in their map analysis.</p><p>2) Strengthen validity of the results: look into the EEG signals around the sensory cortex (e.g., V1) to see whether the findings in fMRI could be confirmed.</p><p>3) Clarifications:</p><p>a) As seen in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, there was a significant anticorrelation with burst-suppression at the ventricular borders. It is unclear whether the authors have done physiological or white matter/CSF/global nuisance regression as most of the rest-fMRI studies did.</p><p>b) Three different concentrations of the anesthetic sevoflurane were chosen for human participants. The authors found that the high concentration (3.9-4.6%) induced burst-suppression much better than the other two lower concentrations as expected. However, in rats, almost all asymmetric PCs were found at an intermediate concentration (2%) of isoflurane less at the low (1.5%) or high (2.5%) concentration in Rat 1. At the same time, all fMRI runs from Rat 2 with a 1.3% concentration of isoflurane had a prominent asymmetric PC. That is, it seems that only the high concentration of isoflurane could not induce burst-suppression well in rats, which was opposite to those findings in humans. Authors may explain what reasons may cause such differences and whether such differences may affect the major findings in differences between primates and rodents.</p><p>c) Authors found that some sensory areas in primates are excluded from those highly synchronized during the burst suppression. Clarify if each voxel in such areas shows burst suppression-like activity that is not synchronized with others. If this is the case, burst suppression can still be a global phenomenon. Because that in-ROI averaged time-series were used, it remains possible that each voxel inside the ROI is not synchronized but the ROI average shows burst suppression. Similarly, since that burst suppression should be defined by the existence of burst and suppressed periods, why not simply use this definition to check whether each voxel shows such an intermittent activity to evaluate whether it is a global phenomenon or not. We understand that this might be difficult to examine using non-human fMRI data, however, voxelwise analysis of human fMRI data should be conducted.</p><p>d) Why is there no synchronization during the slow-wave states under light anesthesia? During the slow-wave sleep, it is shown that the entire cortical network is decomposed into a modular-like network structure. Is there synchronization inside each module while no synchrony between modules?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74813.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers were in general positive about the research and the paper, a number of issues were raised by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2.
