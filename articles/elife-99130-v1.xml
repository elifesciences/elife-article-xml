Previously, artesunate (AS) has been reported to exert antibacterial enhancement activity in combination with β-lactam antibiotics via inhibition of the efflux pump AcrB. However, combination of AS and colistin (COL) revealed a weak synergistic effect against a limited number of strains, and few studies have further explored its possible mechanism of synergistic action. In this article, we found that AS and EDTA could strikingly enhance the antibacterial effects of COL against <italic>mcr-1</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>mcr-1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains either in vitro or in vivo, when used in triple combination. The excellent bacteriostatic effect was primarily related to the increased cell membrane damage, accumulation of toxic compounds and inhibition of MCR-1. The potential binding sites of AS to MCR-1 (THR283, SER284, and TYR287) were critical for its inhibition of MCR-1 activity. Additionally, we also demonstrated that the CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of the triple combination. Selectively targeting CheA, SpvD, or MCR using the natural compound AS could be further investigated as an attractive strategy for the treatment of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Collectively, our work opens new avenues toward the potentiation of COL and reveals an alternative drug combination strategy to overcome COL-resistant bacterial infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>triple combination</kwd><kwd>colistin resistant</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32102716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Yajun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32373069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Gongzheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combination therapy of colistin, artesunate, and EDTA could serve as a promising approach to combat colistin-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections by disrupting bacterial membranes, collapsing proton motive force, and increasing reactive oxygen species levels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is globally recognized as a major zoonotic foodborne pathogen that is responsible for food poisoning, gastroenteritis, and even life-threatening in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galán-Relaño et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gangathraprabhu et al., 2020</xref>). Antibiotics are commonly used to shorten the duration of illness and reduce infectivity. However, with the increasing use of antibiotics, the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, especially the carbapenemase-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, have become a major source of public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foletto et al., 2021</xref>). The shortage of new antibiotics for these MDR bacteria strains has led to the reuse of polymyxins as the ‘last resort’ antimicrobial drug with the inevitable risk of emerging resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falagas and Kasiakou, 2005</xref>). Colistin (polymyxin E, COL), a fatty acyl oligopeptide antibiotic, is an active agent against Gram-negative (G<sup>-</sup>) pathogens, and has been widely used to combat <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections. Generally, COL kills bacteria through a detergent-like effect, which the polycationic ring of COL electrostatically interacts with the cell envelope components, causing the competitive displacement of divalent cations calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), destabilizing the membrane, thus killing the bacterium via the ‘self-promoted uptake’ pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaye et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond that, other models for the antibacterial activity have been reported, including vesicle–vesicle contact, hydroxyl radical death, inhibition of respiratory enzymes, and anti-endotoxin COL activity pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El Sayed Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>). Until now, numerous chromosomally or plasmid-mediated mechanisms underlying polymyxins resistance in G<sup>-</sup> bacteria have been identified, including intrinsic, mutation (e.g., PmrAB, PhoPQ, or AcrAB-TolC mutants), adaptation mechanisms, or horizontally acquired resistance via the phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase genes <italic>mcr-1</italic>–<italic>9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poirel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To tackle the increasing emergence of MDR pathogens, many alternative therapies, less costly and time-consuming than drug discovery, have been new areas of current research interest, involving the combination therapy of existing agents, the drug discovery from natural products, and the evaluation of drug resistance reversers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenthal, 2003</xref>). A variety of antibiotic adjuvants that may or may not have direct antibacterial effects have been widely investigated to increase the effectiveness of current antibiotics or delay the emergence of drug resistance, such as β-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and efflux pump inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laws et al., 2019</xref>). Several promising inhibitors, for example, zidebactam and pyrazolopyrimidine compounds, have been described as the β-lactam and aminoglycoside enhancers against G<sup>-</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stogios et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, numerous synthetic antimicrobial peptides and plant-derived natural products have been shown to possess membrane permeabilizing or efflux pump inhibitory activity, with the combination of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aron and Opperman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su and Wang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Artesunate (AS) is a semi-synthetic derivative of antimalarial compound artemisinin that is extracted from the traditional Chinese herb <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>. Beyond remarkable antimalarial action, AS and other artemisinin derivatives, for example, dihydroartemisinin, have been proven to restore the antibacterial effect of COL against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, while they themselves did not exhibit intrinsic antimicrobial activity against clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates as well as ATCC 25922 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, AS has also been proven to enhance the effectiveness of various β-lactam and fluoroquinolones antibiotics against MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> via inhibiting the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the synergistic effect between AS and COL was only observed in a limited number of strains, with a modest reversal effect. Therefore, few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its underlying mechanism. Under this circumstance, it is meaningful to explore new drug combinations between AS and COL against MDR bacteria. Encouragingly, in this study, we confirmed the prominent synergistic effects of AS and EDTA to restore the antimicrobial activity of COL and its possible molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Artesunate and EDTA could enhance the effects of colistin against <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains</title><p>The antimicrobial activities of AS, EDTA, or COL alone were initially investigated in the COL-sensitive strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (JS, S34), COL-resistant clinical strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (S16, S20, S13, and S30), <italic>E. coli</italic> (E16), and intrinsically COL-resistant species (<italic>Morganella morganii</italic> strain M15, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> strain P01). Results showed that AS or EDTA alone had no direct antibacterial activity against these strains, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 1250 or &gt;125 mg/L (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Except for the two intrinsically COL-resistant strains M15 and P01, there was only a slight decrease in COL MICs for other strains (fold changes ranging from 0 to 133), when the subinhibitory concentrations (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 MIC) of AS or EDTA were combined with COL (namely AC or EC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Whereas we found a marked decrease in COL MICs (up to 60,000-fold) after three drug combinations (namely AEC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results indicated that when used simultaneously with COL, AS, and EDTA exerted antibacterial enhancement activity for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, but not the intrinsically COL-resistant species. Thus, AS and EDTA could be considered adjuvants to reverse COL resistance in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The

Overall, the fluorescence signals of NPN and PI increased progressively with increases in the concentration of COL. After the treatment of AEC, S16, and S30 both showed the strongest fluorescence signals of NPN compared to those of other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Nevertheless, AS treatment group also exerted a significant increase in fluorescent signal, although it is not as strong as that of the AEC-treated group. Meanwhile, there were rapid and significant increases in the fluorescence of PI when AEC or EC as added to bacterial cultures, and the two regimens played dominant roles in low or high concentrations of COL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). Therefore, these results indicated that the bacterial cell surfaces were severely damaged after the AEC treatment via the rapid perturbations of OM and IM. Subsequently, the morphological changes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain S16 treated with different regimens were further investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis to confirm the above membrane-damaging effect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, SEM micrographs of control and solvent-treated groups revealed that cells were short and rod-shaped, with rounded ends and intact cell membranes. As expected, after exposure to COL alone and different regimens, noticeable damage to the OM was observed, especially in the AC and AEC-treated groups. Exposure to AC and AEC leads to cell damages characterized by folds, crevices, and depressions, which further suggested that AS and EDTA combined with COL resulted in remarkable bacterial membrane injury for antibacterial activity.

against G<sup>-</sup> bacteria by cell membrane lysis, we hypothesized that alterations in bacterial membrane lipid composition may also be a possible Achilles’ heel to increase the efficacy of COL after the AEC incubation in this article. The metabolomic results of AEC vs. C group in this study showed a significant decrease in prostaglandins (PGs) in arachidonic acid metabolism pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Arachidonic acid is a highly abundant long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in vertebrates, which have been proposed to have antibacterial roles. Exogenous arachidonic acid has been reported to be readily incorporate into the synthesis pathways of membrane phospholipids, and exert detrimental effects on membrane integrity by perturbing membrane ordering, altering membrane composition, and increasing fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eijkelkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacDermott-Opeskin et al., 2022</xref>). PGs are lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid, which has been demonstrated to enhance biofilm development and fungal load in the murine vaginae of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ells et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the downregulated lipid compounds PGs may lead to perturbation of membrane phospholipids in cell membranes and reduce microbial viability.</p><p>Accumulation of toxic compounds may also be held responsible for the membrane damage. We noted that there was a significant accumulation of styrene in both S16 and S30 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Styrene is naturally present as a minor metabolite that can be synthesized at low levels by several microorganisms, like <italic>Pencillium camemberti</italic> and members of the <italic>Styracaceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2022</xref>). However, styrene itself is toxic to most cell types, and its hydrophobic molecules could readily partition into bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane disruption and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lian et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, we found that the taurocholic acid and protocatechuic acid were upregulated respectively in S16 and S30 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taurocholic acid is usually a major component of the selective culture medium, for example, MacConkey agar, for G<sup>-</sup> bacteria, which has also been confirmed as a secondary metabolite of marine isolates and the soil bacterium <italic>Streptococcus faecium</italic>. Sannasiddappa et al. proved that taurocholic acid was able to inhibit the growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> by increasing membrane permeability and disruption of the PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sannasiddappa et al., 2017</xref>). Protocatechuic acid has been demonstrated to exert antimicrobial effects by disrupting the cell membranes and preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernal-Mercado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stojković et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, these toxic compounds were anticipated to accelerate the destruction of cell membrane and thus enhance the antibacterial activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effect of AEC combination</title><p>Flagellar motility is intimately connected to chemotaxis, biofilm formation, colonization, and virulence of many bacterial pathogens. It is generally regulated by a chemotactic signaling system, which enables their movement toward favorable conditions and invade their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolton, 2015</xref>). The chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) have already been identified as core components and present in all chemotaxis systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minamino et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellum is composed of about 30 different proteins, such as FliD (the filament cap), FlgK and FlgL (the hook-filament junction), etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minamino et al., 2022</xref>). We found an extensive downregulation of chemotaxis and flagellar assembly-related genes in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). Meanwhile, the swimming motility of the strains was decreased after AEC incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

we also noted that there was a relatively large number of SDEGs, most of them were downregulated, enriched in the ABC transports pathway in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). ABC transporters are a class of transmembrane transporters that mediate the uptake of micronutrients, including saccharides, amino acids, and metal ions, and have also been shown to protect bacteria from hazardous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen and Götz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The <italic>opuBB</italic> and <italic>opuBA</italic> encode components of the ABC-type proline/glycine betaine transport system, and their upregulation was proved to promote accumulation of proline that acted as an osmoprotectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupre et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the OsmU osmoprotectant systems, consisting of OsmV, OsmW, OsmY, and OsmX, were identified to enable bacterial survival at high osmolarity through the accumulation of glycine betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frossard et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>gltI</italic> gene encodes glutamate/aspartate transport protein, and its deletion in <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown to result in attenuated survival under antibiotics, acid, and hyperosmotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niu et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the dipeptide permease operon (<italic>dpp</italic>), especially <italic>dppA</italic>, has been reported as an essential enzyme for the survival of <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> under nutrient starvation conditions, and was associated with reduced bacterial burden in chronically infected mice in knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernando et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the overexpression of <italic>opuBB</italic>, <italic>gltI</italic>, <italic>dppB,</italic> and <italic>dppC</italic> genes caused no detectable changes in MICs for S16 strain after AEC incubation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Thus, these observations suggest that overexpression of these SDEGs in ABC transporters was not sufficient enough for causing changes in COL susceptibility, and additional factors may be required for the excellent bactericidal activity of AEC.</p><p>Besides, we also noticed that the expression levels of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection-related genes <italic>sseJ</italic>, <italic>spvD,</italic> and ribosomal protein genes <italic>rpmJ</italic>, <italic>rpmE</italic> were all strikingly changed in the S16 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). SseL and SpvD are effectors of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2), which are required for full virulence during animal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coombes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>).

The overexpression of <italic>spvD</italic> gene in S16 strain could attenuate the antibacterial activity of AC and AEC regimen with fourfold increase in MICs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>), which indicated that the virulence-related protein SpvD contributed to the increase in COL susceptibility after AEC incubation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Artesunate can be considered a potential MCR-1 inhibitor that enhances the efficacy of colistin</title><p>During our research, several phenomena caught our attention such as the synergistic effect of AEC combination was irrelevant to whether the <italic>mcr-1</italic> gene exists or not, and the <italic>mcr-1</italic><sup>-</sup> strain S16 exhibited more robust changes than that of <italic>mcr-1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain S30 in different KEGG pathways. These results indicated that AS and EDTA were possible to exert synergistic effects by blocking the broad-spectrum resistance mechanisms (e.g., efflux pumps, membrane damage), and coupling with the drug-specific resistance mechanisms (e.g., MCR-1, β-lactamase). Previously, AS was capable of significantly enhancing the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics against <italic>E. coli</italic> via inhibition of the efflux pumps such as AcrB, NorA, NorB, and NorC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular docking experiments showed that AS could dock into AcrB very well by forming five hydrogen bonds with Ser46, Gln89, and Gln176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).

The active site contains a concentration of metal-binding residues to accommodate between one and four zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Several crystal structures of the soluble domain have been well studied, and six residues GLU246, THR285, HIS395, ASP465, HIS466, and HIS478 were found to be conserved among pEtN transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Especially the THR285 residue, which was highly conserved and provided a distinct electronegative potential to attract and bind the substrate pEtN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Son et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, we performed the molecular docking between AS and MCR-1 to predict if there were possible interactions and found that AS could bind to the residues surrounding the reported key residues within MCR-1 of <italic>E. coli</italic>, forming seven hydrogen bonds with THR283, SER284, TYR287, PRO481, and ASN482 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2e</xref>). The interaction between AS and MCR-1 was further proved by competitive inhibitory assays that the binding of AS with MCR-1 was blocked after the addition of polypeptide P<sub>u</sub> (containing unmutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) and led to significant increases of MICs by eightfold after AC or AEC treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). Nevertheless, we also noticed that the blocking effect could not be removed by peptide P<sub>m</sub> (containing mutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) when EDTA exists. We supposed that EDTA may chelate zinc ions that are required for MCR-1 activity. Thus, we suggested that AS could be developed as an MCR-1 inhibitor, and coupled with the chelating agent EDTA may favor additionally magnifying its inhibitory effect.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of colistin against S30 strain after the incubation of polypeptides.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Strains</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Drug</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">MICs (mg/L)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Control</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">+P<sub>u</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">+P<sub>m</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">S30<break/>(<italic>mcr-1</italic><sup>+</sup>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AC</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AEC</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.125</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>P<sub>u</sub> and P<sub>m</sub> indicate the unmutated and mutated peptide at THR 283, SER 284, and TYR 287 sites, respectively.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A mixed blessing: The excellent antibacterial activity and potential toxicity of AEC combination</title><p>In the preceding years, several studies have reported on the synergistic effects of COL with different candidates, such as antimicrobial agents, natural compounds, and synthetically prepared molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yi et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the potential toxicity of the combination therapy will be the prime concern affecting their clinical application, and a similar concern has also been raised for the AEC combination in this study. Although in vitro studies have determined that with increasing doses of AS and EDTA the antibacterial synergistic activity was gradually enhanced, and meanwhile, may also result in more toxic side effects. Thus, in our study, the 1/8 MICs of AS and EDTA were selected to ensure excellent antibacterial activity whereas minimizing the potential toxicity. The toxic side effects of AEC combination may be most probably caused by COL, which is well known to present several adverse toxic effects, and the dose-dependent nephrotoxicity is the most reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Visentin et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, EDTA and AS may be low toxicity. When used in combination with COL or AB569, EDTA has been proven to synergistically overcome the COL-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and MDR <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> with the concentration of 12,000 mg/L and 73 mg/L, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogue et al., 2021</xref>). These concentrations were reported to be nontoxic to primary adult human skin (dermal) fibroblasts and other normal body cells, which may also apply to the lower concentrations of EDTA (15.6 mg/L) used in AEC combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shein et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, AS has been found to exert multiple pharmacological actions including antimalaria, antitumor, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects, which has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile with the LD<sub>50</sub> values being 4223 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheong et al., 2020</xref>). However, the potential toxic effects of AEC combination are still unknown and require further investigations.</p><p>In summary, our results established that the combination of COL with AS and EDTA was a promising candidate for combating infections caused by MCR-negative and -positive COL-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The membrane-damaging effect, accumulation of toxic compounds, and inhibition of MCR-1 were supposed to play synergistic roles in reversing COL resistance of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of AEC combination.

The researchers aim to explore whether these combinations can restore the effectiveness of colistin and understand the underlying mechanisms. The study used a combination of microbiological and molecular techniques to evaluate the antibacterial activity and mechanisms of action of COL, AS, and EDTA. Key methods included: (i) Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing: Determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of COL, AS, and EDTA, both alone and in combination, against various <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains; (ii) Time-Kill Assays: Measuring bacterial growth inhibition over time with different drug combinations; (iii) Fluorescent Probe-Permeability Assays: Assessing cell membrane integrity using fluorescent dyes; (iv) Proton Motive Force Assay: Evaluating the impact on the electrochemical proton gradient (PMF); (v) Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement: Quantifying intracellular ROS levels; (vi) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): Observing morphological changes in bacterial cells; and (vii) Omics Analysis: Transcriptome and metabolome profiling to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significant differential metabolites (SDMs). The combination of COL, AS, and EDTA (AEC) showed significant antibacterial activity against colistin-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, reducing the MICs and enhancing bacterial killing compared to individual treatments. The AEC treatment caused extensive damage to both the outer and inner bacterial membranes, as evidenced by increased fluorescence of membrane-impermeant dyes and SEM images showing deformed cell membranes. AEC treatment selectively collapsed the Δψ component of PMF, indicating disruption of vital cellular processes. The combination therapy increased intracellular ROS levels, contributing to bacterial killing. Transcriptome data revealed changes in genes related to two-component systems, flagellar assembly, and ABC transporters. Metabolome analysis highlighted disruptions in pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism. The findings suggest that AS and EDTA can potentiate the antibacterial effects of colistin by disrupting bacterial membranes, collapsing PMF, and increasing ROS levels. This combination therapy could serve as a promising approach to combat colistin-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The study employs a wide range of techniques to thoroughly investigate the antibacterial mechanisms and efficacy of the drug combinations.</p><p>- The results are consistent across multiple assays and supported by both in vitro and in vivo data.</p><p>- Combining AS and EDTA with COL represents a novel strategy to tackle antibiotic resistance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The methodology used for interpreting and reporting time-kill assay results.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Overall, the authors have adequately addressed the suggestions provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99130.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The study by Zhai et al describes repurposing of artesunate, to be used in combination with EDTA to resensitize <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. to colistin. The observed effect applied both to strains with and without mobile colistin resistance determinants (MCR). It is known since earlier that EDTA in combination with colistin has an inhibitory effect on MCR-enzymes, but at the same time both colistin and EDTA can contribute to nephrotoxicity, something which is also true for artesunate. Thus, the triple combination of three nephrotoxic agents has significant challenges in vivo, which is not particularly discussed in this paper.</p><p>The study is sound from a methodological point of view and has many interesting angles to address mechanistically how the three compounds can synergize.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>After having read the revised version, I have the following comments:</p><p>(1) The antimicrobials tested in Figure 9 are not really very relevant. I would want to see carbapenems and novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors rather than many old drugs with a debatable role in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. At least the authors should be able to test carbapenem resistance</p><p>(2) The genomics analysis of the strains should be fairly quick - both in terms of characterizing the mobile resistome and the sequence types. There are publicly available databases for this purpose</p><p>The rest of my comments have been addressed in the revised version. There are still some remaining valid points from other reviewers that could be debatable whether they should be address. The authors refer to plans of studying these aspects in subsequent studies, but it could be discussed whether some of the data could be expected already in this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99130.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Yajun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peiyi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xueqin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Changjian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Xiaodie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Qibiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Dandan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Xiaoyuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Gongzheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Yajun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment:</bold></p><p>This study provides valuable insights, addressing the growing threat of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens by focusing on the enhanced efficacy of colistin when combined with artesunate and EDTA against colistin-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains.

The observed effect applied both to strains with and without mobile colistin resistance determinants (MCR). It was already known that EDTA in combination with colistin has an inhibitory effect on MCR-enzymes, but at the same time, both colistin and EDTA can contribute to nephrotoxicity, something which is also true for artesunate. Thus, the triple combination of three nephrotoxic agents has significant challenges in vivo, which is not particularly discussed in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of potential toxicity of triple combination has been added in line 318 to 337.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The selection of strains is not very clear.

It can cause a range of diseases, from gastroenteritis to more severe systemic infections like typhoid fever and invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis. In veterinary medicine, Salmonella infections can lead to significant economic losses in livestock industries due to illness and death among animals, as well as through the contamination of animal products.</p></disp-quote><p>The description has been added in the introduction section in line 47 to 53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Results and Discussion:</p><p>(1) While the combination of EDTA, artesunate, and colistin shows promising in vitro results against <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the clinical application of this combination warrants careful consideration due to potential toxicity issues associated with these compounds. Colistin is known for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, limiting its use to severe cases where the benefits outweigh the risks. EDTA, as a chelating agent, can disrupt essential metal ions in the body, posing risks of metabolic imbalances. Although it has clinical applications, primarily in cases of heavy metal poisoning, its use as an adjuvant in antibiotics may present risks. Although generally well-tolerated for malaria, interactions of artesunate with other drugs and long-term safety in combined therapies require thorough investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion of potential toxicity of triple combination has been added in line 318 to 337.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Table 1: The manuscript mentions that some strains used in the study are mcr-positive and mcr-negative.

After incubated with AC for 8 h, the survival CFUs of JS and S16 strains showed a slightly reduction, but there were still living cells. Since the bactericidal activity of AC is not strong enough to exert sustained bactericidal activity, these remaining living cells will resume growth after treatment with AC for 12 h. The “positive control group” in the legend of Figure 2 has been indicated in line 724.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) What is the authors' hypothesis for the differences observed in the transcriptome and metabolome?</p></disp-quote><p>The changes in gene transcription level may cause corresponding changes in protein level, but these proteins are not all involved in the bacterial metabolic process. For example, MCR protein is encoded by the COL resistance related gene <italic>mcr</italic>, which mediates the modification of lipid A, but are not involved in the cellular metabolic process. Therefore, the transcriptome change of <italic>mcr</italic> gene may affect the protein production of MCR, nor the bacterial metabolic processes, so there are differences observed in the transcriptome and metabolome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In some parts of the text, the authors state that artesunate and EDTA potentiate the action of colistin, which is a bacteriostatic drug. However, in other parts, the authors describe the effect of the AEC combination as bacteriostatic (Abstract: line 32; Results: line 179). How do the authors explain this inconsistency?</p></disp-quote><p>The artesunate and EDTA could be regarded as “adjuvants” for the bacteriostatic drug colistin. Adjuvants itself act no or weak antibacterial effect on bacteria. For antimicrobial drugs, the “adjuvants” are compounds that generally used in combination with antibacterial drugs to re-sensitizing bacteria that have developed drug resistance. Thus, in this paper the AEC combination could be regared as bacteriostatic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) According to Brennan &amp; Kirby (2019; doi: 10.1016/j.cll.2019.04.002), to evaluate the synergism between different drug combinations, bacterial growth curves need to be assessed over 24 hours. If the colony count is {greater than or equal to} 2 log10 lower than that of the most active antimicrobial alone, the combination is considered synergistic. Based on the growth curve results shown in Figure 1, the experiment was conducted for 12 hours, and in some cases, only a small reduction in growth was observed, even at the maximum concentration of colistin. Moreover, in some cases, the curve resumes rising between 8 and 12 hours. What is the authors' hypothesis in this case? It is important to conduct the assay over 24 hours to confirm the synergism between these drugs.</p></disp-quote><p>The time-kill experiment of 24 hours have been re-executed and could be used to replace the Figure 1 in the original paper. Additionally, the phenomenon that “the curve resumes rising between 8 and 12 hours” has been explained in the response to comment of “Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors), Results and Discussion, (3) Figure 2”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To prove that CheA and SpvD play a critical role in the effect of the AEC combination, deletion of these genes should be performed, and the mutant strains should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The deletion of <italic>cheA</italic> and <italic>spvD</italic> will be carried out in our next study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) To demonstrate that the flagellum is no longer assembled, a transmission electron microscopy image using antibodies against flagellin should be performed, along with motility tests.</p></disp-quote><p>The motility assays have been performed and displayed as Figure supplement 5 in the revised supplement materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 7: In the X-axis legend, specify what &quot;model&quot; refers to.</p></disp-quote><p>The “model” refers to the PBS control group that mice were treated with PBS after the intraperitoneal injection of 100 µL bacterial solution (1.31 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 8 Legend: In the legend of Figure 8 (line 717), are the authors referring to <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Salmonella</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>It referred to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, which has already been illustrated in the headline of Figure 8 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Materials and Methods:</p><p>(1) Bacterial Strains and Agents: It would be beneficial to include in the table the species of the strains used in the study, as well as the concentrations of colistin, artesunate, and EDTA utilized (lines 321 - 332).</p></disp-quote><p>We have ever tried to add the above information to Table 1, but the addition of this information would make the table too large and beyond the margins, which is not conducive to the layout design of the table, so we chose to display these information in the materials and methods section instead of the table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Antibacterial Activity In Vitro: Ensure clarity and well-defined ranges for the concentrations of colistin, EDTA, and artesunate used separately and in combinations (lines 335 - 344).</p></disp-quote><p>The drug concentrations have been listed in line 369 to 371.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Time-Kill Assays: Clarify the criteria for selecting concentrations, whether based on MICs or peak and trough concentrations relevant to human and animal treatments with colistin (lines 345 - 351).</p></disp-quote><p>Although in vitro studies have determined that with increasing dose of AS and EDTA, the antibacterial synergistic activity was gradually enhanced, and meanwhie, may also resulting in more toxic side effects.
