and nervous systems. HER4 activation is regulated by a diverse group of extracellular ligands including the neuregulin (NRG) family and betacellulin (BTC), which promote HER4 homodimerization or heterodimerization with other HER receptors. Important cardiovascular functions of HER4 are exerted via heterodimerization with its close homolog and orphan receptor, HER2. To date structural insights into ligand-mediated HER4 activation have been limited to crystallographic studies of HER4 ectodomain homodimers in complex with NRG1β. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of near full-length HER2/HER4 heterodimers and full-length HER4 homodimers bound to NRG1β and BTC. We show that the structures of the heterodimers bound to either ligand are nearly identical and that in both cases the HER2/HER4 heterodimer interface is less dynamic than those observed in structures of HER2/EGFR and HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In contrast, structures of full-length HER4 homodimers bound to NRG1β and BTC display more large-scale dynamics mirroring states previously reported for EGFR homodimers. Our structures also reveal the presence of multiple glycan modifications within HER4 ectodomains, modeled for the first time in HER receptors, that distinctively contribute to the stabilization of HER4 homodimer interfaces over those of HER2/HER4 heterodimers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinases</kwd><kwd>membrane signaling</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd><kwd>growth factors</kwd><kwd>HER receptors</kwd><kwd>cancer biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM139636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54AI170792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GZ: TR 1668/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trenker</surname><given-names>Raphael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30CA247147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diwanji</surname><given-names>Devan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structures uncover glycosylation in the ectodomains of full-length HER4 homodimer and HER2/HER4 heterodimer complexes, revealing how the binding of various growth factors alters dynamics at the dimerization interface.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HER4 is a ubiquitously expressed receptor functioning in heart, mammary, and neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plowman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muraoka-Cook et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gassmann et al., 1995</xref>).

While HER4 activation is linked to signaling pathways activated by other HER receptors, including Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, HER4 is the only HER with documented growth inhibitory effect on cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muraoka-Cook et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sweeney and Carraway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this observation, and in contrast to other HER receptors for which genetic alterations are widely linked to oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arteaga and Engelman, 2014</xref>), HER4 is more commonly observed to be lost or downregulated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muraoka-Cook et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arteaga and Engelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naresh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Segers et al., 2020</xref>).

Aberrant activation of HER4 is associated with neurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), schizophrenia, and other psychological disorders, where inhibitory missense mutations in HER4, and either increased or decreased levels of the HER4 ligand NRG1, can lead to various disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mei and Nave, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2012</xref>).

Early crystal structures of HER4/NRG1β, EGFR/EGF and EGFR/TGFα ectodomain (ECD) homodimers revealed that ligand binding between extracellular domains I and III causes a substantial conformational change that exposes the dimerization arm in domain II, allowing for the formation of active dimers stabilized through dimerization arm exchange between the monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferguson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>). In these symmetric ectodomain dimers, most of the interaction surface between the two receptors falls within the dimerization arm regions.</p><p>The orphan HER2 adopts an extended conformation in its apo state, thus being dimerization-competent without ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tzahar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2003</xref>). However, HER2 does not form stable homodimers under physiological expression levels and relies on heterodimerization with another ligand-bound HER receptor for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tzahar et al., 1996</xref>). The inability to efficiently homodimerize might be encoded in the non-optimal manner with which HER2 engages a dimerization arm of a partner receptor, as illustrated in the recent structures of the NRG1β-bound HER2/HER3 and EGF-bound HER2/EGFR ectodomain heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). When complexed with NRG1β-bound HER3, HER2 fails to engage the HER3 dimerization arm leaving only the HER2 arm engaged at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>). The dispensability of the HER3 arm at the interface is corroborated by the observation that its deletion does not impact HER2/HER3 dimerization and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>). In the EGF-bound EGFR/HER2 structure, the EGFR dimerization arm binds HER2 but in a non-canonical manner characterized by increased dynamics and interactions of the arm with HER2 domains II and III instead of domain II and I observed in most other HER ECD dimers. As in the HER2/HER3 complex, the dimerization arm of the HER2 partner (in this case EGFR) is not required for heterodimerization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Together, the HER2-containing heterodimer structures reveal a dynamic mode with which HER2 engages a dimerization arm from a partner receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>). These dynamics suggest that HER homodimers are more stable and might preferentially form over HER2-containing heterodimers or heterodimers in general. This is consistent with repeated findings in cells expressing EGFR and HER2 in which a strong preference for EGFR homodimerization is observed over heterodimerization with HER2 upon EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Lengerich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Further evidence comes from biophysical studies in which isolated HER ectodomains were shown to form strong homodimers and only weakly detectable heterodimers in the presence of their cognate growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>). However, this is not always the case and EGFR was reported to form heterodimers more favorably when stimulated with another ligand, betacellulin (BTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rush et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, HER4 seems to engage equally as homodimers or as heterodimers with HER2, at least when interactions between isolated receptor ectodomains were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>). These receptor and dimer-specific idiosyncrasies highlight the importance of investigating HER receptor complexes with different ligands and a particular need for understanding how HER2 engages with HER4 – the final structure missing among HER2-containing HER complexes.</p><p>HER4 is activated by a diverse set of growth factor ligands including the neuregulin 1–4 family (NRG1-4), amphiregulin, epiregulin (EREG), and BTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plowman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trenker and Jura, 2020</xref>). These ligands differ widely in their tissue expression and biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falls, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>). For example, NRG1β plays essential roles in the development and functioning of the cardiovascular system and nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falls, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer and Birchmeier, 1995</xref>), while BTC is implicated in the differentiation of pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>). Even in the same cells, these ligands induce distinct signaling outputs. In the human T lymphoblastic CEM cells stably expressing HER4, NRG1β (and NRG2β) are the most potent activators of AKT signaling, while BTC induces the strongest activation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>). These differential effects are likely due to a combination of factors. First, ligands are cross-reactive: NRG1βis also a ligand for HER3 while BTC also binds to EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falls, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>). Second, they might form structurally different HER4 ectodomain dimers, which in turn will affect dimer stability and downstream signaling, as observed for EGFR and its different cognate ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freed et al., 2017</xref>). Third, the ligands might differentially modulate the degree of HER4 heterodimerization versus homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beerli and Hynes, 1996</xref>). In particular, BTC appears to be uniquely poised to promote signaling by a wide range of HER heterodimers, including HER2/HER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alimandi et al., 1997</xref>), EGFR/HER3 and HER2/HER4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alimandi et al., 1997</xref>). The mechanism for BTC-based dimerization of HER receptors remains unknown without structures of their complexes.</p><p>Whether HER4 dimers adopt different conformations while bound to different ligands, as seen in EGFR, has remained an open question as only crystal structures of NRG1β-bound HER4 dimers have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). A spectrum of ligand-bound EGFR structures, including high-affinity (EGF and TGFα) or low-affinity (EREG), revealed different dimerization interfaces and underscored that the dimerization arm plays an important role in communication between the ligand binding pocket and EGFR dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we investigated these relationships for HER4, and its complexes with HER2. We focused on the comparison of NRG1β with BTC due to lack of structural insights into interactions of BTC with HER receptors, and its documented aptitude for promoting receptor heterodimerization in contrast to other ligands. Both ligands are known to promote HER4-dependent activation of HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunbar and Goddard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alimandi et al., 1997</xref>). We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the first high-resolution structures of the NRG1β− and BTC-bound HER4/HER2 and HER4/HER4 ectodomain dimers in a full-length receptor context. Our analysis shows that there are no major differences between NRG1β− and BTC-bound complexes, but surprisingly in each case HER4 homodimers displayed large-scale dynamics compared with HER2/HER4 heterodimers. We also show that glycan modifications within the HER4 ectodomain extensively contribute to the HER4 homodimer interface, a feature previously not recognized in any other HER receptor complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of the NRG1β- or BTC-bound HER2/HER4 heterodimers</title><p>To reconstitute the active HER2/HER4 complex for high-resolution structural analysis by cryo-EM, we introduced a G778D mutation in HER2 that prevents Hsp90 binding to the HER2 kinase domain and promotes HER2 heterodimerization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Citri et al., 2004</xref>). Both HER2 and HER4 receptors were truncated to remove their long, presumably unstructured, tails located C-terminal to the kinase domains and were transiently expressed in Expi293F cells individually. HER2 was expressed in the presence of canertinib, a covalent type-I kinase inhibitor that stabilizes the active conformation of the HER2 kinase. Cell lysates were pooled and in the first purification step, HER4 was affinity-purified via FLAG-tagged NRG1β or BTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trenker et al., 2022</xref>).

Eluted proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and dimeric fractions were frozen on graphene-oxide coated (GO) grids for cryo-EM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We observed that HER2/HER4 dimers constituted only a small fraction of complexes purified using both ligands, indicating that in each case HER4 favored self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref> + 1d). HER receptor kinases asymmetrically dimerize in an active receptor complex, with one kinase adopting the function of an allosteric activator of the second kinase (receiver) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). To increase the yield of HER2/HER4 heterodimers vs HER4 homodimers, we introduced specific mutations that render the kinases activator only (N-lobe IQ mutation) or receiver only (C-lobe VR mutation). These mutations disrupt kinase homodimers but do not interfere with heterodimers in which the N-lobe mutant combined with the C-lobe mutant reconstitutes the asymmetric dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>By introducing the relevant mutations, we designed HER2 and HER4 mutants to be compatible with two opposite activator /receiver configurations: HER4 activator (IQ)/HER2 receiver (VR) and HER2 activator (IQ)/HER4 receiver (VR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We first tested the signaling competency of these combinations, by transiently transfecting full-length HER2 and HER4 carrying respective mutations in COS7 cells and assessing receptor phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation by Western blot analysis of cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). The HER2 constructs in these experiments do not feature the G778D mutation present in the constructs used for structure determination. Strikingly, the active heterodimer was only reconstituted in the HER4 activator (IQ)/ HER2 receiver (VR) configuration pointing to stereotyped roles that these two receptors play in the active complex irrespective of the activating growth factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We used this set of interface mutations to enrich for the fraction of functional HER2-G778D-V956R/HER4-I712Q heterodimers in large-scale purification for structural studies.

recently reported HER2 heterodimeric complexes. As in the HER2/HER3/NRG1β, HER2/EGFR/EGF, and HER2/EGFR/EREG structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>), in the HER2/HER4 complexes the ligand-free HER2 enforces an asymmetric geometry within the heart-shaped ectodomain complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6a</xref>). The conformation adopted by HER2 is nearly identical in all complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6b</xref>, pairwise RMSD within HER2s 1.1–1.6 Å across different complexes), and is the same as observed in structures of an isolated HER2 ectodomain alone or in complex with therapeutic antibodies with only minor variations at the tip of the dimerization arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6b</xref>). Thus, our structures are consistent with previous findings that HER2 does not undergo observable conformational changes upon heterodimerization with other HER receptors. The conformation adopted by HER4 in our structure is identical to a previously observed conformation in the crystal structure of isolated HER4 extracellular domain bound to NRG1β (RMSD 1.7 Å – 4.4 Å across different structures). This conformation also closely matches the extended state of HER3 and EGFR in their respective heterodimers with HER2 (RMSD 2.2 Å, RMSD 2.6 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite the diverse sequences of the NRG1β and BTC ligands, the larger-scale domain conformation of the HER2/HER4 heterodimers stabilized by each ligand is identical with only small differences in the ligand binding pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Due to the lower resolution of the HER2/HER4/BTC complex, we cannot exclude the possibility of differences in side-chain arrangements between the two structures. However, we attribute the lower resolution to variability in data collection on GO grids, rather than differences in conformational heterogeneity of HER2/HER4/BTC. Recently published structures of EGFR homodimers induced by binding of the two high-affinity ligands, EGF, and TGFα, revealed that binding of these two different ligands results in distinct ensembles of EGFR dimer conformations, specifically within domains IV, seemingly coupled to scissor-like movements around the dimerization arm region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate whether NRG1β and BTC might lead to similar effects in the HER2/HER4 structures, we have performed an equivalent analysis. Extensive 3D variability and 3D classification analysis of the HER2/HER4/NRG1β and HER2/HER4/BTC datasets did not reveal any defined conformational heterogeneity within domains IV or dimerization arm regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differences between HER2-containing heterodimers</title><p>Like other HER receptor dimers, HER2 and HER4 heterodimerize mainly via interactions between domains II, with significant contributions from the dimerization arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>), which carry conserved sequence features across HER family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The total buried surface area (BSA) at the HER2/HER4 heterodimer interface (domains I-III, measured using UCSF ChimeraX) encompasses 2784 Å<sup>2</sup> and is comparable to HER4 and EGFR homodimers (2768–2866 A<sup>2</sup>, PDB: 3U7U; 3006 A<sup>2</sup>, PDB: 3NJP, respectively) and the EGFR/HER2 heterodimer (2864 A<sup>2</sup>, PDB: 8HGO), while the HER2/HER3 heterodimer interface is significantly smaller (2066 A<sup>2</sup>, PDB: 7MN5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

HER2 and HER4 dimerization arms are resolved in both NRG1β and BTC-bound HER2/HER4 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The HER2 dimerization arm is stabilized by several polar and Van-der-Waals interactions with the dimerization arm-binding pocket of HER4, which involve two conserved aromatic residues, specifically Y274 and F279 in HER2 that interact with HER4 G286, C304, and R306 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> box B). The equivalent residues in the HER4 dimerization arm, Y268 and F273, are engaged in reciprocal interactions with the backbone atoms of HER2 G292, C311, and L313 via a network of hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> box C). These aromatic dimerization arm residues are strictly conserved as phenylalanine or tyrosine residues in all HER receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and participate in the same interactions in the structures of the symmetric EGFR/EGF and HER4/NRG1β ectodomain homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In the EGFR/HER2 and HER3/HER2 heterodimers, only the HER2 dimerization arm makes these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The EGFR dimerization arm is rotated out of the canonical dimerization arm binding pocket of HER2, preventing such interactions, and the dimerization arm of HER3 is not even resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in this regard, HER2/HER4 heterodimers are more similar to known structures of HER homodimers (NRG1β-bound HER4 and EGF-bound EGFR homodimers) than to heterodimers.</p><p>These similarities are also reflected in the interactions that the tips of both dimerization arms at the HER2/HER4 interface make with domains I of their respective dimerization partners. The D277 in the HER2 tip hydrogen bonds with T108 in domain I of HER4, while the T271 in the HER4 tip hydrogen bonds with T105 in HER2 domain I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The HER2/HER4 complex is the only HER2 heterodimer that involves domain I of both receptors in the dimer interface via the tip of the dimerization arms in a near-symmetric fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Other HER2 heterodimers and, incidentally also the EGFR/EREG dimer, exhibit an asymmetric dimerization arm configuration with one dimerization arm being less engaged, evidenced by increased B-factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Thus, the relative orientation of two HER monomers varies among all HER heterodimer structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6c</xref>). EGFR and HER3 exhibit a hinging motion in the direction of the HER2 dimerization arm in comparison to HER4, which is rotated slightly away from it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6c</xref>). Interestingly, the only other instance when a HER2-containing heterodimer is observed to make symmetric interactions is when HER2 carries an oncogenic mutation, S310F, in the heterodimeric complexes with HER3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that HER2/HER4 heterodimers are the most stable among HER2 heterodimers. Consistent with this notion, previous studies showed that the recombinant HER2 and HER4 ECDs form the most stable heterocomplex among all other HER heterodimers, with efficiency similar to HER4 homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The dimerization arm of HER2, but not HER4, is required for HER2/HER4 activation</title><p>The EGFR and HER3 dimerization arms are dispensable for signaling within their respective heterodimers with HER2, a property attributed to their high flexibility and disengagement from the HER2 dimerization arm binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). The canonical binding mode of the HER4 dimerization arm in the HER2/HER4 dimer structures raises the question whether it is required for signaling by this complex. To test the role of HER4 arm, we transduced full-length HER2-VR (V956R) and HER4-IQ (I712Q) constructs into murine NR6 cells. Dimerization arm sequences were replaced either in HER2 or HER4 with a flexible loop of alternating glycine and serine residues as previously described (GS-arm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). NRG1β-induced phosphorylation of HER2, HER4, ERK, and AKT was not notably affected by the substitution of the HER4 dimerization arm to a GS-arm relative to receptors featuring wild-type dimerization arm sequences, indicating that the HER4 dimerization arm is not required for assembly and activation of HER2/HER4 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In contrast, the substitution of the HER2 dimerization arm sequence fully abolished the activation of the heterocomplex, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). Small increases in pERK levels in cells expressing the HER4-IQ construct are consistent with previous observations that the IQ mutation in HER kinase domains has small residual activity through homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, despite full engagement at the interface of both dimerization arms in the HER2/HER4 complexes, the HER4 arm is still dispensable for activation, and it is the HER2 arm that potentiates the formation of the active complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HER4 homodimers display higher large-scale conformational flexibility than HER2/HER4 heterodimers</title><p>Our cryo-EM structures of the full-length HER2/HER4 complexes bound to either NRG1β or BTC, did not reveal discernible differences at the receptor dimerization interface and larger-scale domain arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In other cryo-EM structures of the full-length HER2 heterodimers, EGFR/HER2 bound to a high-affinity EGFR ligand, EGF, or a low-affinity EREG, any differences are also imperceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). Ligand-specific differentiation of structural states becomes only evident in EGFR homodimers. The most drastic example is the breaking of C2 symmetry in the crystal structures of EGFR ectodomain homodimers bound to EREG vs symmetric structures of EGFR with EGF or TGFα (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6a</xref> for symmetry axes in HER receptor dimers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freed et al., 2017</xref>). However, even in the symmetric crystal structures of EGFR bound to two high-affinity ligands, EGF and TGFα, there are differences in intermonomer EGFR angles between the two ligand complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>). As mentioned above, cryo-EM analysis of the full-length EGFR homodimers, extensive 3D classification, and variability analysis revealed that both EGF and TGFα stabilize a range of EGFR dimer shapes with different intermonomer angles, but they differ in their ability to stabilize conformations with large intermonomer angles in which membrane-proximal domains IV are separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>These comparisons raise the question of whether HER homodimers explore a wider range of conformations compared to heterodimers, specifically those singly-liganded heterodimers that contain the orphan HER2 receptor. To test this hypothesis for HER4 complexes, we determined the cryo-EM structures of full-length HER4 homodimers bound to NRG1β or BTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

As observed in a previous HER4/NRG1β crystal structure of isolated ECDs, liganded HER4 assembles into homodimers with near-perfect C2 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The two receptors in the HER4/NRG1β dimer adopt an angle of 37 degrees compared to 33 degrees for HER4/BTC. Detailed 3D classification analysis revealed substantial scissor-like movements around the dimerization arm in both data sets with the concerted intermonomer movement of domains I and IV, varying from 35 to 39 degrees for HER4/NRG1β and 30–35 degrees for HER4/BTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Nevertheless, there are unique residue interactions within the ligand-binding pockets that correlate with changes in dimerization arm positioning, which might ultimately dictate the angle at which the two receptors engage with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref>). While both pockets bury a similar surface area (NRG1β: 2967–3068 A<sup>2</sup>, BTC: 3142–3163 A<sup>2</sup>), the HER4/NRG1β pocket is characterized by a larger network of ionic interactions. In the HER4/NRG1β pocket, HER4 K438, K35, E112 and D376 form salt bridges with NRG1β E215, D219, R207 and R220, respectively.

Thus, substitutions into small, apolar residues in BTC result in a more ‘compressed’ ligand-binding pocket in HER4/BTC homodimers than in HER4/NRG1β homodimers, which may allosterically determine different intermonomer angles via modulation of dimerization arm positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HER4 glycosylation reveals structural stabilization via glycans that bridge extracellular subdomains and receptor dimers</title><p>The conformation of the HER4/NRG1β cryo-EM homodimer deviates slightly from the three crystallographic HER4/NRG1β homodimers present in the asymmetric unit (PDB ID: 3U7U) in which each monomer adopts a different orientation of the domain IV relative to the rest of the ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a</xref>, RMSD: 5.438 Å, 5.435 Å, and 3.662 Å).

RMSDs for monomers within the cryo-EM dimers are 1.42 Å in the HER4/NRG1β homodimer and 1.58 Å in the HER4/BTC homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4b</xref>+c), as compared to the three crystallographic dimers in which the HER4 monomers align with RMSDs of 1.67 Å, 5.76 Å, and 2.38 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Several reasons could account for this variation, including consequences of crystal packing or lack of intracellular and transmembrane domains, which are present in our constructs, albeit not resolved in cryo-EM density. Another explanation is differences in HER4 glycosylation in our cryo-EM sample purified from human cells as compared to deglycosylated HER4 ectodomains used for crystallography, which only maintain the first N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on asparagine residues that are N-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our cryo-EM analysis of full-length HER4 homodimers reveals multiple well-resolved N-linked glycans in receptor ectodomains and points to their role in stabilizing interactions between two receptor monomers.

The N253-linked glycan in domain II has a well-resolved density that appears to be continuous with a density coming from the N138-linked glycan in domain I. The trees up of five sugars can be reasonably placed into each density pointing towards direct glycan-glycan and glycan-protein interactions across HER4 sub-domains I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> box A and B).

This points to a direct contribution of N-linked glycosylation towards the HER4 homodimer interface that, given the low resolution, is likely structurally heterogenous and involves complex glycosylation trees attached to the respective asparagine residues. Indeed, 3D classification of the particles in our final reconstruction uncovered at least one class with more defined N548-N576-N358 glycan networks in the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, our analysis of the HER4/NRG1β homodimer cryo-EM density uncovers an important role of receptor glycosylation in stabilizing the active HER4 monomer by bridging its two distal domains, domain II and IV and domains I and II, and likely both monomers within the HER4 homodimer through direct inter-receptor connections.</p><p>N-linked glycosylation is also resolved in the cryo-EM maps of the HER2/HER4 heterodimers (NRG1β and BTC bound), with HER4 glycosylation patterns being the same as seen in homodimers. HER2 has seven N-linked glycosylation sites (as defined in Uniprot (ID: P04626): N68, N124, N187, N259, N530, N571, and N629), five of which are visible in the cryo-EM maps (N68, N187, N259, N530, and N517) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, shown for the HER2/HER4/NRG1β heterodimer). As in the case of HER4, some glycans on HER2 mediate direct interdomain contacts within HER2, similar to the ones previously observed in the crystal structure of HER2 with pertuzumab, albeit more sugar moieties can be built in our structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franklin et al., 2004</xref>). The first three sugar moieties on N259 in domain II are particularly well-resolved and appear to directly engage the domain I polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> box B). However, in contrast to the HER4 homodimers, we do not observe continuous density connecting the two heterodimer monomers indicating that glycan-mediated interfaces seen in HER4 homodimers cannot be established in HER2/HER4 heterodimers. This is because HER2 does not have glycosylation consensus sites equivalent to HER4 N358, N548, and N576 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> box C). Based on these observations, it is tempting to speculate that the higher propensity for HER4 to homodimerize rather than heterodimerize with HER2 observed in our pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>) is at least partially rooted in the stabilization of the homodimer by glycan-mediated interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>First structures of HER2/HER4 and BTC complexes</title><p>We present here the first cryo-EM reconstructions of both the homodimer and heterodimer complexes of the HER4 receptor in its full-length form, bound to two different high-affinity HER4 cognate growth factors, NRG1β and BTC. This is also the first time that a betacellulin growth factor has been resolved bound to a HER receptor. The HER2/HER4 heterodimer structures now complete the ensemble of possible HER receptor heterodimer structures that involve the orphan HER2 receptor. Only the ectodomains are resolved in our structures, as repeatedly has been the case for any full-length receptor tyrosine kinase reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nielsen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uchikawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krimmer et al., 2023</xref>). While not resolved, interactions contributed by the intracellular domains appear to be essential for the stabilization of the receptor complexes in our cryo-EM reconstructions. In our previous analysis of the HER2/HER3/NRG1β complex, the introduction of oncogenic mutations in the HER3 pseudokinase that increase its dimerization affinity with HER2, and the presence of HER2 kinase inhibitors was essential for efficient heterodimer reconstitution and improved resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trenker et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, for HER4 structures reported here, selective enrichment of kinase heterodimers via the introduction of activator/receiver mutations in HER2/HER4 and the introduction of kinase inhibitors to homo- and heterodimer complexes improved the resolution of cryo-EM reconstructions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conserved features of HER2 heterodimers</title><p>Across the family, the three HER2-containing heterodimers adopt an asymmetric heart-shaped ectodomain structure and in each one of them the HER2 conformation is identical while the dimerization interface is unique. The main difference centers on the engagement of the dimerization arm extended to HER2 by the partner receptors. The HER2/HER3 interface is most dynamic with the HER3 dimerization arm not being resolved at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>). In the HER2/HER4 and the HER2/EGFR structures, HER4 and EGFR dimerization arms are resolved but make unique interactions with HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). The EGFR dimerization arm engages HER2 via non-canonical interactions with domain III that resemble those only observed in the crystal structure of the EGFR/EREG ectodomain complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freed et al., 2017</xref>). In comparison, the HER4 dimerization arm in the HER2/HER4 heterodimer presented here is engaged with HER2 via several canonical interactions, observed across most of the HER receptor homodimer structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). This binding mode might explain HER2/HER4 heterodimer seems to be most stable among HER2-containing heterodimers, as measured by studying associations between isolated HER ectodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>While the positioning of the HER2 and HER4 dimerization arm appears almost symmetric, the number of hydrogen bonds formed by the HER4 dimerization arm is reduced compared to that of HER2. In addition, HER2 fails to engage its partner receptors via a conserved cation-π interaction that is exchanged by both monomers in all symmetric EGFR and HER4 homodimers, which in HER4 involves a dimerization arm phenylalanine (F273) and a domain II arginine (R306). The arginine is a leucine in HER2 (L313). It had been speculated previously that the inability of HER2 to form this interaction may be the reason for the non-canonical placement of HER3 and EGFR dimerization arms in their respective heterodimers with HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). However, our HER2/HER4 heterodimer structure shows that even without the cation-π interaction, the HER4 dimerization arm can be placed in a canonical position. Lastly, the overall weaker interactions that HER2 makes with the dimerization arms of its partner receptors are likely the reason why these partner arms are not needed for the stabilization of the active signaling HER2 heterodimers. This has been observed for the HER2/HER3 and HER2/EGFR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>), and we show here that the same is true for the HER2/HER4 heterodimer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Homodimerization vs heterodimerization</title><p>The extent of HER receptors propensity to form homodimers versus heterodimers, and their functional significance, are topics of ongoing debate. Some ligands, like EGF, are well documented to favor homodimers of their cognate receptors (EGFR in this case), while others, like BTC, have been shown to more readily promote hetero-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beerli and Hynes, 1996</xref>). While in a cellular context, there might be many factors that shape these equilibria, including relative levels of receptor expression, their localization within membrane microdomains, and/or interaction with other, yet unknown, factors that might stabilize certain dimer combinations, our studies bring insights into these interactions in a simplified in vitro system. We note that both NRG1β and BTC favor HER4 homo-association, and only a small fraction of complexes purified using pulldowns with these ligands immobilized on beads yielded HER2/HER4 heterodimers. This was the case even when HER2 and HER4 kinase domains carried mutations designed to prevent their homo-associations and to favor heterodimerization. This phenomenon has been previously observed for the EGFR/HER2 system, where co-expressed receptors stimulated with EGF formed almost exclusively EGFR homodimers upon detergent extraction, with the limited formation of EGFR/HER2 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). The same study also reported only a small fraction of heterodimerization (&lt;10%) by live-cell single molecule imaging of EGFR and HER2 on the plasma membrane of EGFR/HER2 positive SUM159 cells after EGF stimulation. Altogether, these findings raise questions about the conditions under which HER receptor heterodimers form in vivo, especially for HER receptors, which are not obligate heterodimers, namely EGFR and HER4. Is their reluctance to form such heterodimers an important part of the regulation of their signaling specificity, a current lack of knowledge about the conditions under which they form, or both? For example, one of the consequences of HER2 overexpression in cancer could be the elevation of the otherwise non-optimal heterodimers with EGFR, resulting in potentiation of oncogenic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Biased agonism</title><p>The degree of symmetry between ectodomains of EGFR in the active liganded dimer has been correlated with the strength of its signaling output. Ligand binding is allosterically coupled to the positioning of the dimerization arm and depends on how the ligand engages domains I and III. In EGFR, this allosteric path is differentially engaged by low-affinity EGFR ligands (EREG, Epigen) vs high-affinity ligands (EGF, TGFα), resulting in asymmetric and dynamic dimers vs symmetric and stable dimers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freed et al., 2017</xref>).

Recent cryo-EM studies of EGFR-bound EGF and TGFα revealed that even the high-affinity dimers induce a range of EGFR homodimer conformations differing at receptor intermonomer angles, which might explain distinct functional outcomes downstream from these receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). These analyses directly link structural differences to functional EGFR outputs, posing a question how of this regulation looks for other ligands and other HER receptor combinations.</p><p>Different HER4 ligands were reported to induce unique signaling outputs via activation of HER4 homodimers. Specifically, the two high-affinity HER4 ligands BTC and NRG1β were shown to be different, with BTC more efficiently activating the ERK pathway while NRG1β activated the AKT pathway more potently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>). Our structures of HER4 ectodomain dimers bound to NRG1β and BTC presented here show that in both homodimers there are notable scissor-like movements around the dimerization arms with different intermonomer angles between the two ligands. It is possible that these different dimer conformations influence the stability and consequently signaling outputs emanating from these HER4 homodimers. While these structural differences are seemingly small, they are reminiscent of the ones observed in EGFR homodimers, bound to its two high-affinity ligands, EGF and TGFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the effects that BTC or NRG1β have on stabilizing more diverse conformational ensembles of the HER4 homodimers, their complexes with the HER2/HER4 heterodimers showed no discernable structural differences.

Altogether, these structural analyses show that EGFR and HER4 receptors sample a wider selection of active homodimers states that can be exploited by different ligands and might be better conduits for ligand-specific signaling responses that their respective HER2 heterodimers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Receptor glycosylation</title><p>N-linked glycosylation of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a crucial role in their maturation, stability, and regulation of their interaction with ligands, the extracellular matrix and other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duarte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Contessa et al., 2008</xref>).

Likewise, mutation of N579 on EGFR drives its ligand-independent activation as well as increases its affinity for ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whitson et al., 2005</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms behind most of these effects are poorly understood, mostly because the majority of HER ectodomain structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography using heavily deglycosylated receptor fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>).

We identified glycans in both HER2 and HER4 that directly connect their domains I and II and the HER4-specific interdomain glycan connections between domains II and IV. Such glycosylation modifications would be expected to stabilize the extended conformations of HER2 and HER4 receptors, although their effect on tethered states cannot be excluded. Most remarkably, our structures of HER4 homodimer ectodomains reveal reasonably well-resolved glycans between N548 of one receptor monomer and N358 of the other, pointing to the potential importance of these interactions in stabilizing the homodimer. In contrast, we have not observed a direct inter-receptor connection for HER2/HER4 heterodimers due to the absence of respective glycosylation sites in HER2. It is tempting to speculate that the particularly strong propensity for HER4 homodimerization over heterodimerization with HER2 that we see in our reconstitution experiments is, at least partially, rooted in the missing glycan-mediated stabilization of the heterodimer.</p><p>In recent years several studies of the effects of HER receptor glycosylation on their structure and signaling have been conducted using molecular dynamics (MD) generating models on how glycans contribute to receptor stability and its interactions with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaszuba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azimzadeh Irani et al., 2017</xref>). Most recently, MD simulations conducted on the HER4/EGFR heterodimer models have suggested that the glycans present on HER4 N358 and N548, as well as EGFR N361 (which is equivalent to HER4 N358), form a connection in the dimerization interface that effectively stabilizes the heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Motamedi et al., 2022</xref>). Our current study provides the first direct experimental evidence that these glycan interactions are operative at the level of HER4 homodimers.

The HER2 and HER4 constructs were each transfected into 30 ml or 60 ml of Expi293F mammalian suspension cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A14527,RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_D615">CVCL_D615</ext-link>) cultured to 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml at 37 °C, 8% CO<sub>2</sub> following the standard expression protocol with 1 µg DNA/ml cultures. 10 mM canertinib (MedChemExpress) in DMSO was added to HER2 cultures 16–18 hr post-transfection to a final concentration of 10 µM along with ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit enhancers 1 and 2. Cells were harvested, flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C 24 hr after the addition of enhancers. For homodimer formation, full-length, untagged wild-type HER4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform was cloned into a pCDNA4TO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transfected into Expi293F cultures as described above. If utilized, a final concentration of 10 µM afatinib (MedChemExpress) was added as described above for canertinib.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>HER2/HER4 heterodimer and HER4 homodimer purification</title><p>For heterodimer purification, cell pellets from 120 ml suspension cultures for each receptor were resuspended with the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaVO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors (cOomplete, Roche), DNAse I (Roche), and 1% DDM (Inalco)) and lysed for 2 hr by gentle rocking at 4 °C. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Purified EGF-like domain of NRG1β or BTC was incubated with anti-DYKDDDDK G1 affinity resin (Genscript, short anti-Flag) for 1 hr at 4 °C and serially washed 3 x with Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl).

Micrograph CTF parameters were estimated with the patch CTF estimation job in CryoSPARC v2 (HER2/HER4/BTC, HER4/NRG1β, HER4/BTC), or CryoSPARC v4 (HER2/HER4/NRG1β). Particles were picked using a template picker with low-pass filtered (20–25 Å) 2D templates created from imported HER receptor dimer volumes, initially from published HER2/HER3/NRG1β heterodimers. HER4 homodimer particles were template-picked a second time using 2D class averages as a template obtained from a first round of picking and processing (see processing flow charts for sample-specific details). The resulting picks were extracted with a box size of 384 pix (320.64 Å) with 2 x Fourier cropping and subjected to initial 2D classification to remove obviously poor classes and picks containing lines from visible graphene-oxide flakes. More than 90% of picks were selected and subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction into three classes. In all datasets, this resulted in ‘junk’ classes without recognizable HER receptor features. To purify this particle set, all 2D-selected particles were subjected to two rounds of heterogeneous refinement containing a HER receptor dimer volume (imported from previous datasets or obtained from this dataset in a previous round of processing using the same overall workflow) and 3 ‘junk’ classes. Particles sorted into the HER receptor dimer volume were subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction into one or two classes, depending on which resulted in better resolution downstream, followed by heterogeneous refinement (in two classes) and non-uniform refinement (see processing flow charts for sample-specific details). Once reasonable reconstructions were obtained (as judged by the FSC (Fourier Shell Correlation) curve shape), unbinned particles were re-extracted and subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction, heterogeneous refinement or 2D classification/selection, and finally non-uniform refinement to achieve reconstructions with the highest resolution. The map of HER2/HER4/NRG1β was manually sharpened with an applied B-factor of –85. The final reconstructions of HER2/HER4/NRG1β and HER2/HER4/BTC used for model building included 289,192 and 148,541 particles and resulted in an overall resolution of 3.31 Å and 4.27 Å by Gold Standard-Fourier Shell Correlation (GS-FSC) cutoff of 0.143, respectively. The final reconstructions of HER4/NRG1β and HER4/BTC used for model building included 205,726 and 274,540 particles and attained a GS-FSC resolution of 3.38 and 3.70 Å with C1 symmetry, respectively. Applying C2 symmetry in the final non-uniform refinement run improved the resolution to 3.26 and 3.49 Å. However, due to imperfect C2 symmetry observed in our C1 reconstructions, most of the reported analysis was performed using C1 reconstructions. Each map was assessed for local and directional resolutions in cryoSPARC v4 and 3DFSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) serves, respectively. Except for the HER2/HER4/BTC, extracellular domains I-III achieved the highest local resolutions (~3 Å) while that of domain IV varied from 4 to above 7 Å suggesting that a high degree of flexibility exists closer to the transmembrane domains.

The HER2-HER4 heterodimer with BTC appears to be the lowest resolution of the reported structures. Although the authors claim the overall structure is similar to the HER2-HER4 heterodimer with NRG1b, it is therefore unclear whether the lower resolution of the BTC is due to challenging data collection conditions, sample preparation, or conformational dynamics not discernible due to the lower resolution. The authors should minimally clarify where they see the possible issues arising for the lower resolution as this is a key aspect of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>The most likely reason for the lower resolution of the HER2/HER4/BTC reconstruction is not the underlying fundamental biology but a certain degree of preferred orientations in the sample, as can be seen from the directional FSC curves in the supplemental materials (Figure S3). We would like to note that while the overall resolution of the HER2/HER4/BTC reconstruction may be comparatively lower than other reconstructions presented in the manuscript, it remains of sufficiently high quality to substantiate our key claims. Specifically, our analysis indicates a close resemblance between the HER2/HER4/BTC reconstruction and the HER2/HER4/NRG reconstruction. For example, individual beta strands can still be well resolved allowing their accurate placement. There may be differences in features at higher resolution than 4.5Å between these two reconstructions which we cannot observe due to the lower resolution of HER2/HER4/BTC map, but these would amount to side chain motions rather than larger secondary structure movement. In the manuscript, we only draw comparisons between domain movements in different heterodimer structures and do not see any conformational variability in the final reconstructions, nor in their 3D classification analyses. Thus, we do not attribute the lower resolution of HER2/HER4/BTC reconstruction to increased dynamics at resolution scales that are discussed in the manuscript. What is more likely, is that variability in data quality, which we commonly observe between different GO grids, contributes to differences in resolution between different samples and potentially to the different orientation distributions. To comment on these possibilities, we added the following text to the manuscript (italic, underlined):</p><p>Page 8 top paragraph:</p><p>“Despite the diverse sequences of the NRG1β and BTC ligands, the larger-scale domain conformation of the HER2/HER4 heterodimers stabilized by each ligand is identical with only small differences in the ligand binding pockets (Figure 1d). Due to the lower resolution of the HER2/HER4/BTC complex, we cannot exclude the possibility of differences in side-chain arrangements between the two structures. However, we attribute the lower resolution to variability in data collection on GO grids, which we frequently observe, rather than differences in conformational heterogeneity of HER2/HER4/BTC.”</p><p>Page 10, second paragraph:</p><p>“Our cryo-EM structures of the full-length HER2/HER4 complexes bound to either NRG1β or BTC, did not reveal discernible differences at the receptor dimerization interface and larger-scale domain arrangements (Figure 1d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For all maps, authors should display Euler angle plots from their final refinements to assess the degree of preferred orientation. Judging by the sphericity, it appears all the structures, except HER2-HER4-BTC, have well-sampled projection distributions. However, a formal clarification would be useful to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We regarded the 3DFSC curves included in our original submission as sufficient measure for projection distributions. In the revised manuscript, we now also include Euler angle plots from respective CryoSPARC refinements in the supplemental Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should also include map-model FSCs to ascertain the quality of the map with respect to model building, as this is currently missing in the submission.</p></disp-quote><p>We included map-model FSCs from Phenix validation runs in our supplemental material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. With respect to complex formation, is there a reason why HER2 expression is dramatically lower than HER4?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of HER2 and HER4 in Expi293F cells, and consequently the amount of HER2 and HER4 receptors at the beginning of our first purification step, which is the NRG1b-mediated pulldown of HER4, is not noticeably different. After this initial purification step, a significant portion of HER2 is lost due to the fact that HER2/HER4 complexes constitute only a small fraction of the total HER complexes because HER4 homodimers preferentially tend to form. This is the reason why HER4 levels after the first purification step shown on the gel in Figure S1b are significantly higher than those of HER2. In the revised manuscript, in Figure S1d, we now show that both receptors are expressed at a comparable levels at the beginning of purification. In this experiment, levels of HER2-MBP-TS and HER4-TS purified separately from the equivalent volumes of transfected Exp293F cell culture via their shared TS-tags (MBP=Maltose Binding Protein, TS=Twin-Strep) are evaluated on a Coomassie-stained gel. When equal volumes of these elutions are then mixed and either subjected to HER4-directed pulldown using NRG1b-coated Flag-resin (lane 3, Figure S1d of the revised manuscript) or HER2-MBP-directed pulldown using amylose resin in the presence of NRG1b (lane 4, Figure S1d of revised manuscript), none of these pulldowns reveals substantial HER2/HER4 heterodimerization indicating that HER4 homodimerization is favored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figures S1e authors should clarify if HER2 substitutions are VR alone or do these include GD substitutions as well. These should be suitably clarified in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>The HER2 constructs used in all cellular assays do not include the G778D mutation. We clarified this in Figure S1e, in the Materials and Methods section and in the main text on page 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The validation reports for all 4 reported structures suggest the user-provided FSC-derived resolutions are different from those calculated by the deposition server. Are the masks deposited significantly different compared to the ones generated within cryoSPARC?</p></disp-quote><p>The user-provided FSC-derived resolutions are different from those calculated by the server because the server only calculates resolution of unmasked curves from half maps while we provide the resolution derived from masked FSCs. These were all calculated using masks generated within the respective refinement job in cryoSPARC. However, we did notice that our author-provided FSC curves were from unmasked maps and we replaced the provided unmasked FSCs with masked FSCs as generated in cryoSPARC. These FSC plots in the validation reports now reflect the author-provided resolution in our validation reports and the plots generated by cryoSPARC shown in Figures S2, S3, S9 and S10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For interpretation regarding activation through phosphorylation in Figure 2e, have the authors considered HER4 could homodimerize as well? It appears from the data presented in Figure 4 and S12 that the propensity to form homodimers is greater for HER4 than to heterodimerize with HER2, despite the VR/IQ substitutions. This also appears to be supported by the reasonable amount of signal for pERK in lanes with HER4-IQ alone in the presence of NRG1b. It is recommended that the authors comment on this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The IQ mutation, originally engineered to disrupt the receiver interface in EGFR, has been shown to have residual activity, which is greater than the mutation on the opposite site of the asymmetric dimer interface (VR) (PMID:16777603). This might be because this mutation partially destabilizes an inactive state of HER kinases by disrupting the hydrophobic interactions, which are both important for kinase inhibition and for stabilization of the active dimer. While IQ mutation is significantly inhibitory, as evidenced by the fact that we do not detect NRG1b-dependent HER4 phosphorylation in cells expressing HER4-IQ alone, it is possible that undetectable levels of phosphorylated HER4 cause the small increase in pERK signal. To acknowledge this possibility, we added the following sentence to the appropriate paragraph on page 10 in the main text:</p><p>“Small increases in pERK levels in cells expressing the HER4-IQ construct are consistent with previous observations that the IQ mutation in HER kinase domains has small residual activity through homodimerization (PMID:16777603).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the following line, &quot;NRG1b-induced phosphorylation of HER2, HER4, ERK and AKT was not notably affected by substitution of the HER4 dimerization arm to a GS-arm relative to wild type receptors&quot;, it is unclear what the authors mean by wild-type receptors? There is presently no wildtype HER2 and/or HER4 tested in this blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Wild type receptors here refer to WT dimerization arm sequences in contrast to GS-arm mutants. We corrected the language in the appropriate place in the main text:</p><p>“NRG1b-induced phosphorylation of HER2, HER4, ERK and AKT was not notably affected by substitution of the HER4 dimerization arm to a GS-arm relative to receptors featuring wild type dimerization arm sequences, indicating that the HER4 dimerization arm is not required for assembly and activation of HER2/HER4 heterodimers (Figure 2e).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Considering the asparagine residues can potentially mediate stabilization of HER2-HER4 dimers through glycosylation, the authors should include western blot data for receptor-activation for mutants where glycosylation can be disrupted. This could minimally instruct the reader on how functionally relevant the identified interactions like N576-N358 are.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that this is a very interesting and important point, and it is subject of our future investigations. The different spectra of glycosylation that we observe between HER4 homodimers and HER2/HER4 heterodimers suggest that glycans will modulate these interactions differently. We speculate that glycans will likely be more important for HER4 homodimerization where glycosylation is more pronounced in our reconstructions. To investigate how these interactions change in the absence of single glycan modifications or their combinations, will also require taking into consideration how glycan mutations will alter an equilibrium between HER4 homodimers and HER2/HER4 heterodimerization. Such studies will require months of mutagenesis and optimization of controlled expression of such mutants, ideally generation of stable cell lines, and likely and ideally structural follow up studies. We respectfully argue that this undertaking is beyond the main scope of the current manuscript, and conceptually constitutes a separate, very important question that we are working on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The structural coordinates should be deposited in the RCSB.</p></disp-quote><p>The coordinates are deposited in the RCSB:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4L">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4L</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4K">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4K</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4I">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4I</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4J">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8U4J</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Figure S1b authors should ideally include a silver stain gel to assess the purity of the heterodimer-ligand complex. Although HER subunits are discernible, there is no clear band for NRG1b.</p></disp-quote><p>Given its small size (9.7 kDa) our NRG1b construct is typically difficult to detect in our samples, but we would like to respectfully argue that the fact that we can resolve it at high resolution in our cryo-EM reconstructions provides sufficient evidence that it is present. Likewise, we argue that the Coomassie-stained gel we present in the manuscript is sufficient. It demonstrates that our purifications yield a stoichiometric complex of enough purity to obtain a high resolution cryo-EM reconstruction. Since we are not making any other claims about these preparations, we respectfully argue that providing a silver stain gel is not necessary to support conclusions of our study.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for point this out.

Notably, our two cryo-EM HER4 homodimer structures are more symmetric than the crystal structures of the HER4/NRG1β ectodomain homodimer.
