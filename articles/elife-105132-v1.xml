The composition of TA varies greatly but the presence of both WTA and LTA is highly conserved, hinting at an underlying fundamental function that is distinct from their specific roles in diverse organisms. We report the observation of a periplasmic space in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. The thickness and appearance of this region change upon deletion of genes involved in the attachment of TA, supporting their role in the maintenance of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive bacteria as a possible universal function. Consequences of these mutations were further examined by super-resolved microscopy, following metabolic labeling and fluorophore coupling by click chemistry. This novel labeling method also enabled in-gel analysis of cell fractions. With this approach, we were able to titrate the actual amount of TA per cell and to determine the ratio of WTA to LTA. In addition, we followed the change of TA length during growth phases, and discovered that a mutant devoid of LTA accumulates the membrane-bound polymerized TA precursor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>bacterial cell wall</kwd><kwd>periplasm</kwd><kwd>teichoic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-23-CE11-0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morlot</surname><given-names>Cecile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE15-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grangeasse</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE07-0035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Yung-Sing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LabEx Gral</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bauda</surname><given-names>Elda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FRISBI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-0005-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morlot</surname><given-names>Cecile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LABoratoires d'EXcellence ARCANE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morlot</surname><given-names>Cecile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The thickness of the periplasmic region is reduced in strains of pneumococcus that are deleted in genes responsible for the incorporation of teichoic acid in the cell envelope.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Teichoic acids (TA) are major components of the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria.

TA participate in numerous cellular processes such as cell wall elongation and hydrolysis, cell division, transport processes, cation homeostasis, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, and interactions with the environment or the host.</p><p>In studies of Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus gallinarum</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic>) by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>), a region between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall was proposed to be a periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matias and Beveridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matias and Beveridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). A most interesting speculation is the possible role of TA in maintaining this periplasmic space, so that it would be isotonic with the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Models of the functions and structures of teichoic acids (TA) in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TA (multicolored rods) attached to the membrane (M) or to the peptidoglycan (PG) exclude each other to maintain a periplasmic space (PS) as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>.

TA of streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group, such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, are particular in two ways: LTA and WTA are products of the same biosynthetic pathway and are therefore of very similar composition, and they are uniquely decorated by phosphocholine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The role of TA in the pneumococcus is also critical because 13–16 different proteins (choline-binding proteins) are anchored to the cell envelope by the interaction of their choline-binding domain to phosphocholine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maestro and Sanz, 2016</xref>). The functions of the choline-binding proteins are diverse, several of them are acting on the cell wall itself as hydrolases such as LytA and LytB, others are virulence factors mediating interactions with the host and its immune system.</p><p>The pneumococcus has a strict nutritional requirement for choline, which is solely incorporated in its TA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomasz, 1967</xref>). However, numerous derivatives can substitute for choline, as long as the hydroxyl group is present and the amine substituents are not too bulky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badger, 1944</xref>). Nutritional shift between choline and ethanolamine had been used in early studies of the localization and composition of nascent cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laitinen and Tomasz, 1990</xref>). More recently, we have used the incorporation of alkyne- and azido-choline (aCho) derivatives to label TA with clickable-fluorophores and investigate the spatial and temporal relationship between TA and PG assembly by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Guilmi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnet et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>The pneumococcal repeating unit of TA consists of a pseudo-pentasaccharide ((→4)-6-O-P-Cho-α-D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc-(1→3)-6-O-P-Cho-β-D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc-(1→1)-Rib-ol-5-P-(O→6)-β-D-Glc<italic>p</italic>-(1→3)-AATGal<italic>p</italic>-(1→)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer, 1997</xref>). The glucose (D-Glc<italic>p</italic>) and the ribitol (Rib-ol) are joined by a phosphodiester bond. The two <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (D-Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc) are substituted on position 6 with a phosphocholine, as mentioned above. The phosphocholine is sometimes lacking on the proximal Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc of some subunits, as well as from both Gal<italic>p</italic>NAc from the terminal unit. Subunits are linked together by α-(1→6) bonds. In LTA, the acetamido-4-amino-6-deoxygalactopyranose (AATGal<italic>p</italic>) of the first subunit is β-(1→6)-linked to the glucose of a mono-glucosyl-diacyl-glycerol (DGlc<italic>p</italic>-DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gisch et al., 2013</xref>). In WTA, the first AATGal<italic>p</italic> is thought to be α-linked via a phosphodiester to position 6 of the PG <italic>N</italic>-acetyl muramic acid, as in WTA of other species, although this labile linkage has never been experimentally observed in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bui et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Like other surface polysaccharides such as the PG or the capsule, the basic unit is intracellularly synthesized at the plasma membrane onto the carrier lipid undecaprenyl pyrophosphate by a succession of glycosyl- and phosphotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>). The basic unit precursor is then thought to be flipped across the membrane by the flippase TacF (<italic>spr1150</italic>) to allow elongation of the TA polymers at the cell surface by the polymerase TarP (<italic>spr1222</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damjanovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson and Veening, 2023</xref>). Once on the external surface of the membrane, the polymerized precursors can undergo two fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A phosphotransferase can anchor the polymer onto the PG to yield WTA. Alternatively, a glycosyltransferase can transfer the polymer to DGlc<italic>p</italic>-DAG to form LTA. The phosphotransferase attaching WTA is thought to be LytR (<italic>spr1759</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minhas et al., 2023</xref>), although LytR and the two homologous enzymes Cps2A (<italic>spr 0314</italic>) and Psr (<italic>spr1226</italic>) that form the LCP (LytR-Cps2A-Psr) family may exhibit some redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eberhardt et al., 2012</xref>). The glycosyltransferase producing LTA was found to be TacL (<italic>spr1702</italic>), since the purification procedure normally yielding LTA produced no detectable TA compounds from a Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heß et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Some fundamental aspects of the pneumococcal biology have recently been proposed to rely on shifting the ratio of WTA to LTA. Notably, competence, the process allowing incorporation of DNA from the extracellular environment, was found to be accompanied by an increase of the amount of WTA dependent on the presence of the phosphotransferase LytR, whose expression is upregulated during competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minhas et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, autolysis, which occurs during the stationary phase of planktonic cultures and is mostly driven by the PG amidase and choline-binding protein LytA, was shown to depend on the relative abundance of LTA and WTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>), modulated by the phosphodiesterase WhyD that releases TA from the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flores-Kim et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>WTA are attached to the C-6 hydroxyl of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl muramic acids in the PG of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.

To localize newly synthesized TA, an excess of aCho was added for 5 min to exponentially growing cell cultures.

The weak labeling of Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells may reflect one or a combination of the following: (1) TA are less abundant, (2) cells incorporate less aCho into TA, or (3) cells grow more slowly, so that the 5-min pulse represents a shorter fraction of their cell cycle.</p><p>The photophysical properties of AF647 are amenable to direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), which allowed the reconstruction of super-resolved images as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, showing the localization of fluorescent TA after a 5-min labeling pulse experiment.

For this, we incubated varying quantities of the aCho-labeled cell lysate with fixed amounts of DBCO-AF488. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and the relative amount of the various fluorescent species was determined by densitometry and plotted against the concentration of cells. The gels and quantifications are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A, B</xref> for two concentrations of DBCO-AF488. For intermediate amounts of lysate, the concentrations of clickable groups were too low to reach reaction completion during the incubation time. Only with the highest amount of lysate could the fluorophore be nearly consumed. However, for low amounts of lysate, when the fluorophore is in large excess, the reaction is also expected to have neared completion. Therefore, the fraction of unreacted DBCO-AF488 was linearly extrapolated to zero from the measurements at low lysate concentrations, to obtain the amount of lysate that would titrate the fluorophore in an infinite reaction time. Thus, 1.9 µM DBCO-AF488 would titrate the metabolized aCho from (0.24 ± 0.01) × 2.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells⋅ml<sup>–1</sup> and 3.7 µM would titrate aCho from (0.45 ± 0.01) × 2.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells⋅ml<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A, B</xref>), which is equivalent to (17 ± 2) × 10<sup>6</sup> incorporated aCho molecules per cell.

Later during the culture, although the 6-unit species remains the most abundant and the 5-unit is detected at level comparable as earlier in the culture, longer species become more abundant with up to 17 identifiable units. Surprisingly, the size distribution appears to be bimodal with a first group of species consisting of 5–11 units, and a second group of longer forms where the most abundant one contains 15 units. When considering the electrophoretic pattern, it should be considered that the signal of the different species is proportional not only to their amount but also to their length, since longer species harbor more labeled choline residues.

The hypothesis proposed by Erickson posits that TA are necessary to maintain a periplasmic space at an osmotic pressure that counterbalances that of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>). TA being maintained for this reason may then have been coopted by evolutionary process to carry out additional functions, like evolutionary spandrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>). This attractive hypothesis is however difficult to test, not least because data supporting the existence of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive bacteria are scarce.</p><p>Here, our CEMOVIS images of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>) reveal the presence of a region of lower electron density between the membrane and the PG, as reported previously in other Gram-positive organisms and defined as periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matias and Beveridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matias and Beveridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). About halfway between the PG and the membrane, this periplasmic space appears to be partitioned by a thin layer of more electron-dense material, termed the granular layer in a previous study of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, freeze-substitution and osmium staining produced thin section of cells with no visible periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, an alternative staining procedure after freeze-substitution and thin sectioning, reported elsewhere for encapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39, yielded images of cells with a three-layered cell envelope (not counting the capsule). It is likely that the middle envelope layer observed in these images is the periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallay et al., 2021</xref>). Since high-pressure frozen cells are directly sectioned for CEMOVIS but undergo numerous subsequent treatments for freeze-substitution and contrasting, it is tempting to consider that the CEMOVIS images yield more truthful representations of the cellular architecture. The thinning of the periplasmic space and disappearance of the granular layer in strains with diminished amounts of either WTA (Δ<italic>lytR</italic>) or LTA (Δ<italic>tacL</italic>) support Erickson’s hypothesis that a periplasmic space is maintained by the physical properties of WTA emanating from the PG layer and LTA springing from the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>. In this framework, it is also striking that the appearance of the cell envelope of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuber et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> are so similar, despite the fact that the composition of their TA are very different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lima et al., 2019</xref>), lending credence to a fundamental function of TA stemming from their general physico-chemical properties, rather than from specific molecular interactions.</p><p>Erickson listed four physical mechanisms of the polyelectrolyte brush model of TA that could explain the formation of a periplasmic space where TA chains closely packed on a surface of the plasma membrane generate a pressure when pushed against another TA covered surface (the PG layer). These four contributing factors are: ‘(i) excluded volume, where the chains cannot occupy the same space; (ii) electrostatic repulsion within and between chains; (iii) reduced entropy of the chains as they are confined to a narrow cylinder; (iv) reduced entropy of the counterions as they are concentrated near the anionic charges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>). Although generally applicable, the electrostatic repulsion experienced by most anionic TA cannot apply to TA from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, since these are zwitterionic and polyampholytes. Indeed, the phosphocholine side chains carry both a positive and a negative charge at physiologically relevant pH (zwitterionic), while the main chain repeated unit also carry one negative chain from its phosphodiester linkage and one positive charge from the amino-group of its AATGal<italic>p</italic> ring (polyampholyte character). Although globally neutral, the local charges of pneumococcal TA may attract counterions, which could also contribute to the osmolality and pressure of the periplasmic compartment. Together with the excluded volume and reduced entropy of TA due to confinement of the neutral brush polymer theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Gennes, 1987</xref>), these would be the main drivers of the maintenance of a periplasmic space in streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group. Since <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic> display similar periplasmic spaces when observed by CEMOVIS, despite having TA with different electrostatic properties, future comparisons of these species in different pH, osmolality, and ionic strength regimen may provide clues about the physico-chemical interactions of these polymers.</p><p>The brush polymer model of TA function in forming a periplasmic space applies only if they are present at a density at which volume exclusion occurs. Our metabolic labeling method using aCho that can be titrated with a clickable fluorescent probe has allowed to evaluate the amount of TA chains per cell to about 10<sup>6</sup>. Since WTA may be distributed throughout and on both sides of the PG layer, let us concentrate on the LTA which are less abundant but are all expected to be in the periplasmic space, with about 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> chains per cell. A single pneumococcal cell could be approximated by a sphere with a diameter of 1 µm and surface area of 3 × 10<sup>–12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. Pneumococcus exists mostly as diplococci, so let us assume an average surface area per cell of 5 × 10<sup>–12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. The surface density of LTA would therefore be 3.3 × 10<sup>16</sup> molecule⋅m<sup>–2</sup> or one LTA chain per 30 nm<sup>2</sup>. This density value is lower than that of one chain per 5 nm<sup>2</sup> calculated for LTA from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> based on the ratio of LTA to membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson, 2021</xref>). Although both density values are rough estimates, they likely require volume exclusion to accommodate TA chains at the membrane surface and are probably compatible with the polymer brush model.</p><p>The morphogenesis and cell division of Gram-positive bacteria rely on the carefully orchestrated assembly of the cell envelope, which includes the membrane, the PG layer and the TA. To gain a better understanding of the incorporation of TA into the cell wall, TA were metabolically labeled with aCho that allowed the subsequent grafting of fluorescent probes. Cells labeled during short incubation pulses could be observed by dSTORM, revealing the regions of TA insertion in unprecedented details. In parallel, labeled TA, after short pulses or continuous growth in labeling media, could be analyzed by gel electrophoresis after cell wall digestion by PG hydrolases. As expected from an earlier study with conventional microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnet et al., 2018a</xref>), TA are incorporated in the cell wall at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Patterns after a 5-min labeling pulse are very similar to those obtained when the PG is pulse-labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trouve et al., 2021b</xref>) and do not differ in the absence of the glycosyltransferase TacL. In contrast, the absence of the phosphotransferase LytR markedly reduces the fluorescence signal. These observations are consistent with the role attributed to TacL of anchoring the less abundant LTA, and to LytR of attaching the more abundant WTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heß et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minhas et al., 2023</xref>). The electrophoretic analysis of labeled TA confirmed that WTA are less abundant in the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The amount of LTA appeared comparable in WT and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells, but LTA seem to contribute little to the dSTORM localization patterns, since cell wall sacculi that lacks LTA show patterns identical to that of whole cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The notable difference with TA compared to PG is the presence of some heterogenous surface localization after a labeling pulse. This surface signal is not due to non-specific binding of the fluorophore to the surface, since it is not observed in labeling studies of the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trouve et al., 2021b</xref>). Since the same level of heterogenous surface labeling was observed with the three strains investigated, the most likely reason is some non-specific adsorption of aCho at the cell surface. It is also possible that some LTA or membrane-bound precursors, which are not covalently bound to the cell wall, can diffuse from the division site across the plasma membrane during the pulse and prior the fixation. Finally, it is possible that hitherto unidentified choline-containing compounds at the cell surface are also labeled.</p><p>When imaging was performed after a chase time during which cells are allowed to grow in the absence of probes following the labeling pulse, patterns of labeled TA in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> and Δ<italic>lytR</italic> cells appeared different from those produced when the PG was labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In WT cells, in contrast, TA and PG labeling patterns were similar throughout the chase time. Although the appearance of pulse labeled Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells resemble that of WT cells, the labeling patterns are strikingly different after a chase period. In ∆<italic>tacL</italic> cells, all the cell wall generated during the chase is labeled, resulting in a wide contiguous fluorescent region, whereas it is not labeled in WT cells, producing separated bands. It is most likely that in WT cells, production of WTA and LTA are competing pathways as the two polymers share the same composition, that rapidly consumes the undecaprenyl-linked polymerized TA precursors, whereas these precursors accumulate in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>). The slower turnover of the undecaprenyl-linked TA in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain allows the cell wall incorporation of labeled WTA during the chase, several minutes after the aCho has been removed from the medium. This phenomenon could be observed in an electrophoretic analysis of a pulse–chase labeling experiment of the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain, where membrane bound TA precursors disappear over a 15-min course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Patterns are difficult to discern in the Δ<italic>lytR</italic> strain due to the weak labeling signal, however, they appear to resemble those of Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells.</p><p>In streptococci of the <italic>mitis</italic> group, TA serve as moorings for the attachment of a variety of surface proteins termed choline-binding proteins, because the interaction occurs between the choline residues of TA and protein domains made of repeated choline-binding motifs. The functions of these proteins are varied, playing roles in virulence, competence, or cell wall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maestro and Sanz, 2016</xref>). The localization of some choline-binding proteins can be restricted, such as that of the autolysin LytA, which is found at mid-cell to hydrolyze the PG to promote lysis, or the other cell wall hydrolase LytB that is enriched at the new poles to complete cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnet et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Las Rivas et al., 2002</xref>). Since the choline-binding domains of these proteins participate in their localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnet et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Caballero et al., 2023</xref>), it probably requires that TA at different places of the cell surface display some compositional or size differences, that could arise from some maturation process. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed metabolically labeled TA at different stages of cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, longer LTA are present when the culture enters its stationary phase. One can speculate that the same may be true with WTA, although this could not be determined in our experiment. Surprisingly, when pulse labeling is performed at the onset of stationary phase, the LTA that are synthesized during that phase of the culture do not differ from those produced earlier during the exponential phase, despite the observation of longer LTA in late phase culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). How could these long LTA arise? Since their length distribution is bi-modal and the longer (12–16 units) are about twice the size of the short ones (5–7 units), it is tempting to imagine that they may arise from the coupling of pre-existing TA.</p><p>The finding that undecaprenyl-attached TA accumulate in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strain to a level that is lower, but comparable to that of LTA in a WT strain raises the question of whether these precursors can fulfill the function of mature LTA, at least partially. The observation by CEMOVIS that the cell envelope architecture is altered in Δ<italic>tacL</italic> cells, with a thinner periplasmic space devoid of granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicates that if some functional replacement occurs, it is not complete. It has been proposed previously that the physical properties of the undecaprenyl chain underlie the localization of the PG precursor lipid II at the sites of cell wall assembly, which occurs at sites of maximal membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calvez et al., 2019</xref>). The same reasoning would restrict the presence, and thus the function, of the undecaprenyl-linked TA precursors to sites of cell wall assembly were they can be incorporated into WTA or true LTA. In the absence of TacL, undecaprenyl-linked TA accumulate to a greater extent, so that their turnover is slower than in a WT strain, resulting in the incorporation of labeled WTA during a chase after the labeling pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The propensity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> membrane to sediment at low centrifugal speed, discussed in the SI, is not without experimental consequences in the study of TA. A number of recent studies have investigated the possible role of changes in the relative proportion of WTA and LTA in physiological processes such as autolysis or competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minhas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flores-Kim et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is likely that most of the LTA-containing membranes were unknowingly discarded in these experiments during a clarification step of cell lysates, suggesting that the reported ratio of LTA to WTA were underestimated. The identification of undecaprenyl-linked TA accumulated in the absence of TacL explains the troubling observation of LTA-like signal in the Δ<italic>tacL</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flores-Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The metabolic labeling and electrophoretic analysis methods reported here will certainly help to further study multiple aspects of the biology of TA in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, such as the relationship with the capsule and the <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of the PG, or the specific localization and activity of CBPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from J.-P.

Touzé) prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barreteau et al., 2012</xref>), was added at various concentrations to resuspended pellets and the mixtures were incubated overnight at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Notes on the fractionation of LTA and WTA</title><p>Although sedimentation of LTA was observed at relative centrifugal force as low as 2000 × <italic>g</italic>, the pelleting was not always complete, even after prolonged centrifugation at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic>. Incomplete cell lysis cannot account for the incomplete pelleting of LTA, since intact cells or large fragments would be expected to add to the pellet material. We found out that the quality of the separation of LTA from solubilized WTA by sedimentation depended on the amount of recombinant LytA used during the lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This parameter was difficult to adjust since the exactly adequate amount appeared to depend on the particulars of the experiment (strain, cell density). We think that the multivalent choline-binding domain of LytA crosslinks LTA bound to membrane vesicles, leading to the formation of large aggregates that sediment more easily. In support of this explanation, the presence of recombinant LytA also impacts the migration of the solubilized TA, causing species with lower electrophoretic mobilities to be more abundant at the top of the gels.</p><p>The fractionation of LTA and WTA with the procedure used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flores-Kim et al., 2022</xref>), which involves the preparation of spheroplasts in high concentration of sucrose, was compared to the low-speed centrifugation following direct enzymatic lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taking advantage of the fluorescent labeling of TA, we found that most WTA and LTA were sedimented at 5000 × <italic>g</italic>, but some LTA were further pelleted at 20,000 and 100,000×<italic>g</italic>, whereas some WTA remained in the ultracentrifugation supernatant. The formation of spheroplasts appeared be complete after 1 h of cell wall digestion as checked by phase-contrast microscopy. However, intact cells and/or large cell wall fragments were still present after hypotonic lysis for 30 min since most of the WTA were pelleted at low speed. It is likely that the extent of lysis depends on the quality of the enzyme stocks that are used and may be difficult to replicate in different laboratories. Also, large membrane fragments or intact spheroplasts may sediment more easily than smaller membrane fragments. Thus, the amount of LTA-containing membranes sedimented at the different centrifugal speeds may depend on the specific handling of the samples (e.g. more or less vigorous resuspensions).</p><p>Indeed, when cells, mechanically broken using a microfluidizer, were fractionated at different centrifugal speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), most of the membranes were found in the pellet sedimented at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic>. This different behavior indicates that the mechanical processing impacts the sedimentation properties of membranes, probably by changing the size of the fragments. Since the large minimal volume of culture compatible with the microfluidic equipment precluded labeling of the TA, the membranes were monitored by Western blot using an antibody against the membrane protein PBP2x. A fraction of the same culture was treated by direct enzymatic lysis and low-speed centrifugation. In this case, no PBP2x was detected, presumably due to degradation by proteases present in the commercial mutanolysin, even in the presence of protease inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Notes on the electrophoresis</title><p>Several points should be made regarding the electrophoretic system. We used gels with acrylamide concentrations of either 12% or 17%. Although the acrylamide concentration had little consequence on the separation of WTA and LTA, we observed that the migration of small soluble compounds was greatly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Thus, the phospho-choline-triazole-AF488 migrates a lesser distance than the choline-triazole-AF488 or the DBCO-AF488 in 12% acrylamide gels, whereas the opposite occurs in 17% gels. The separation of the choline-triazole-AF488 and the DBCO-AF488 is not sufficient in 17% gels.</p><p>Also, we found that thiol reducing agents such as DTT routinely included when loading the gels do react with DBCO-AF488 to yield a mixture of species, denoted with * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>. The extent of this reaction appeared to depend on the length and conditions of the storage of the samples prior to analysis and therefore was not controlled.</p><p>In some cases, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B or E</xref>, one or multiple additional weak but sharp bands of fluorescently labeled material appear on the gels above the LTA bands. These bands can be correlated to Coomassie-stained protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>) and they are likely products of the reaction of DBCO-AF488 with protein thiols or primary amines. As stated above for the modification of DBCO-AF488, this side reaction was not controlled and not always present. A weak non-specific fluorescent labeling of cellular proteins by DBCO-AF488, which was not a problem when TA were labeled during the whole culture, contributed to a significant smear blurring the TA bands when labeling was performed only during a short pulse time such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-105132-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Unprocessed EM and optical microscopy images are available on Zenodo at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15111725">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15111725</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15111761">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15111761</ext-link>, respectively.

Previous work has proposed the periplasm to be present in Gram positive bacteria and here advanced electron microscopy approach was used. This also showed a likely role for both wall and lipo-teichoic acids in maintaining the periplasm. Next, the authors use a metabolic labelling approach to analyse the teichoic acids. This is a clear strength as this method cannot be used for most other well studied organisms. The labelling was coupled with super-resolution microscopy to be able to map the teichoic acids at the subcellular level and a series of gel separation experiments to unravel the nature of the teichoic acids and the contribution of genes previously proposed to be required for their display. The manuscript could be an important addition to the field but there are a number of technical issues which somewhat undermine the conclusions drawn at the moment. These are shown below and should be addressed. More minor points are covered in the private</p><p>Recommendations for Authors.</p><p>Weaknesses to be addressed:</p><p>(1) l. 144 Was there really only one sample that gave this resolution? Biological repeats of all experiments are required.</p><p>(2) Fig. 4A. Is the pellet recovered at &quot;low&quot; speeds not just some of the membrane that would sediment at this speed with or without LTA? Can a control be done using an integral membrane protein and Western Blot? Using the tacL mutant would show the behaviour of membranes alone.</p><p>(3) Fig. 4A. Using enzymatic digestion of the cell wall and then sedimentation will allow cell wall associated proteins (and other material) to become bound to the membranes and potentially effect sedimentation properties. This is what is in fact suggested by the authors (l. 1000, Fig. S6). In order to determine if the sedimentation properties observed are due to an artefact of the lysis conditions a physical breakage of the cells, using a French Press, should be carried out and then membranes purified by differential centrifugation. This is a standard, and well-established method (low-speed to remove debris and high-speed to sediment membranes) that has been used for S. pneumoniae over many years but would seem counter to the results in the current manuscript (for instance Hakenbeck, R. and Kohiyama, M. (1982), Purification of Penicillin-Binding Protein 3 from Streptococcus pneumoniae. European Journal of Biochemistry, 127: 231-236).</p><p>(4) l. 303-305. The authors suggest that the observed LTA-like bands disappear in a pulse chase experiment (Fig. 6B). What is the difference between this and Fig. 5B, where the bands do not disappear? Fig. 5C is the WT and was only pulse labelled for 5 min and so would one not expect the LTA-like bands to disappear as in 6B?</p><p>(5) Fig. 6B, l. 243-269 and l. 398-410. If, as stated, most of the LTA-like bands are actually precursor then how can the quantification of LTA stand as stated in the text? The &quot;Titration of Cellular TA&quot; section should be re-evaluated or removed? If you compare Fig. 6C WT extract incubated at RT and 110oC it seems like a large decrease in amount of material at the higher temperature. Thus, the WT has a lot of precursors in the membrane? This needs to be quantified.</p><p>(6) L. 339-351, Fig. 6A. A single lane on a gel is not very convincing as to the role of LytR. Here, and throughout the manuscript, wherever statements concerning levels of material are made, quantification needs to be done over appropriate numbers of repeats and with densitometry data shown in SI.</p><p>(7) 14. l. 385-391. Contrary to the statement in the text, the zwitterionic TA will have associated counterions that results in net neutrality. It will just have both -ve and +ve counterions in equal amounts (dependent on their valency), which doesn't matter if it is doing the job of balancing osmolarity (rather than charge).</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The resubmitted manuscript now contains new data and changes to the text.</p><p>The authors have largely covered my previous points in both sets of reviews (Public/Recommendations).</p><p>Public Review Points:</p><p>1 &amp; 6: I still do not see a reproducibility statement as such, with details of the number of biological repeats etc.</p><p>2 &amp; 3. Fig S7 seems to be quite telling. As predicted after physical breakage the membrane proteins sediment at high speed (rather than low speed). This presumably also means that the LTA comes down at high and not low speed. LTA was not measured due to cost of reagents. The Microfluidizer breaks the cells using a shear force and thus is unlikely to create very small membrane fragments. Thus, the sedimentation properties of membranes containing LTA are likely dependent on the way in which the cells are lysed. It is therefore worthwhile qualifying the statements on l. 35-36, 46-47 and 212 (as Ref 8 used mechanical breakage). This will give better direction to those in the field following up the findings.</p><p>It is also a little alarming that the mutanolysin is contaminated by protease and one hopes this does not affect any of the properties of the materials being analysed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105132.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The Gram-positive cell wall contains for a large part of TAs, and is essential for most bacteria.

Previous work has proposed the periplasm to be present in Gram positive bacteria and here advanced electron microscopy approach was used. This also showed a likely role for both wall and lipo-teichoic acids in maintaining the periplasm. Next, the authors use a metabolic labelling approach to analyse the teichoic acids. This is a clear strength as this method cannot be used for most other well studied organisms. The labelling was coupled with super-resolution microscopy to be able to map the teichoic acids at the subcellular level and a series of gel separation experiments to unravel the nature of the teichoic acids and the contribution of genes previously proposed to be required for their display. The manuscript could be an important addition to the field but there are a number of technical issues which somewhat undermine the conclusions drawn at the moment. These are shown below and should be addressed. More minor points are covered in the private Recommendations for Authors.</p><p>Weaknesses to be addressed:</p><p>(1) l. 144 Was there really only one sample that gave this resolution? Biological repeats of all experiments are required.</p></disp-quote><p>CEMOVIS is a very challenging method that is not amenable to numerous repeats. However, multiple images were recorded from at least two independent samples for each strain. Additional sample images are shown in a new Fig. S3.</p><p>CETOVIS is even more challenging (only two publications in Pubmed since 2015) and was performed on a single ultrathin section that, exceptionally, laid perfectly flat on the EM grid, allowing tomography data acquisition on ∆<italic>tacL</italic> cells. The reconstructed tomogram confirmed the absence of a granular layer in the depth of the section. Additionally, the numbering of Fig. S4A-B (previously misidentified as Fig. S2A-B) has been corrected in the text of V2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig. 4A. Is the pellet recovered at &quot;low&quot; speeds not just some of the membrane that would sediment at this speed with or without LTA? Can a control be done using an integral membrane protein and Western Blot? Using the tacL mutant would show the behaviour of membranes alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the pellet is not just some of the membrane but most of it. In support of this view, the “low” speed pellets after enzymatic cell lysis contain not just some membrane lipids, but most of them (Fig. S10A). We therefore expect membrane proteins to be also present in this fraction. We performed a Western blot using antibodies against the membrane protein PBP2x (new Fig. S7C). Unfortunately, no signal was detected most likely due to protein degradation from contaminant proteases that we could trace to the purchased mutanolysin. The same sedimentation properties were observed with the ∆<italic>tacL</italic> strain as shown in Fig. 6A. However, in the ∆<italic>tacL</italic> strain the membrane pellet still contains membrane-bound TA precursors. It is therefore impossible to test definitely if pneumococcal membranes totally devoid of TA would sediment in the same way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig. 4A. Using enzymatic digestion of the cell wall and then sedimentation will allow cell wall associated proteins (and other material) to become bound to the membranes and potentially effect sedimentation properties.

We have tested this hypothesis by breaking cells with a Microfluidizer followed by differential centrifugation. This experiment, which requires an important minimal volume, was performed with unlabeled cells (due to the cost of reagents) and assessed by Western blot using antibodies against the membrane protein PBP2x (new Fig. S7C). In this case, the majority of the membrane material was found in the high-speed pellet, as expected.</p><p>We also applied the spheroplast lysis procedure of Flores-Kim et al. to the labeled cells, and found that most of the labeled material sedimented at low speed (new Fig. S7B), as observed with our own procedure.</p><p>With these new results, the section on membrane density has been removed from the Supplementary Information. Instead, the fractionation is further discussed in terms of size of membrane fragments and presence of intact spheroplasts in the notes in Supplementary Information preceding Fig. S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) l. 303-305.

The disappearance of the LTA-like band pattern with the ∆<italic>tacL</italic> strain (Fig. 6B), and their persistence in the WT strain (Fig. 5C), indicate that these bands are the undecaprenyl-linked TA in ∆<italic>tacL</italic> and proper LTA in the WT. A sentence has been added to better explain this point in V2.</p><p>Note that we have exchanged the previous Fig. 5C and Fig. S13B, so that the experiments of Fig. 5A and 5C are in the same medium, as suggested by Reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Fig. 6B, l. 243-269 and l. 398-410. If, as stated, most of the LTA-like bands are actually precursor then how can the quantification of LTA stand as stated in the text? The &quot;Titration of Cellular TA&quot; section should be re-evaluated or removed? If you compare Fig. 6C WT extract incubated at RT and 110oC it seems like a large decrease in amount of material at the higher temperature. Thus, the WT has a lot of precursors in the membrane? This needs to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the quantification of the ratio of LTA and WTA in the WT strain rests on the assumption that the amount of membrane-linked polymerized TA precursors is negligible in this strain. This assumption is now stated in the Titration section. We think it is the case. The true LTA and TA precursors do not have exactly the same electrophoretic mobility, being shifted relative to each other by about half a ladder “step”. This difference is visible when samples are run in adjacent lanes on the same gel, as in the new Fig. 6C. The difference of migration was well documented in the original paper about the deletion of <italic>tacL</italic>, although <italic>tacL</italic> was known as <italic>rafX</italic> at that time, and the ladders were misidentified as WTA (Wu et al. 2014. A novel protein, RafX, is important for common cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>: implications for bacterial virulence. J Bacteriol. 196, 3324-34. doi: 10.1128/JB.01696-14). This reference was added in V2. The experiment in the new Fig. 6C was repeated to have all samples on the same gel and treated at a lower temperature. The minor effect on the amount of LTA when WT cells are heated at pH 4.2 may be due to the removal of some labeled phosphocholine. We have NMR evidence that the phosphocholine in position D is labile to acidic treatment of LTA, which may lack in some cases, as reported by Hess et al. (Nat Commun. 2017 Dec 12;8(1):2093. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-01720-z).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) L. 339-351, Fig. 6A.

Apart from the titration of TA in the WT strain, we haven’t yet carried out a thorough quantification of TA or LTA/WTA ratio in different strains and conditions, although we intend to do so in a follow-up study, using the novel opportunities offered by the method presented here.</p><p>However, to better substantiate our statement regarding the ∆<italic>lytR</italic> strain, we have quantified two experiments performed in C-medium with azido-choline, and two experiments of pulse labeling in BHI medium.

Is the model based on the images from this paper? Is the periplasm as thick as the peptidoglycan layer? Would you not expect the density of WTA to be the same throughout the wall, rather than less inside? Do the authors think that the TA are present as rods in the cell envelope and because of this the periplasm looks a little like a bilayer, is this so? Is the relative thickness of the layers based on the data in the paper (Table 1)?</p></disp-quote><p>The model proposed in Fig. 1A is not based on our data. It is a representation of the model proposed by Harold Erickson, and the appropriate reference has been added to the figure legend in V2. We do not speculate on the relative density of WTA inside the peptidoglycan layer, at the surface or in the periplasm. The only constraint from the model is that the density of WTA in the periplasm should be sufficient for self-exclusion and allow the brush polymer theory to apply. The legend has been amended in V2.</p><p>We indeed think that the bilayer appearance of the periplasmic space in the wild type strain, and the single layer periplasmic space in the ∆<italic>tacL</italic> and ∆<italic>lytR</italic> support the Erickson’s model. Although the model was drawn arbitrarily, it turns out that the relative thickness of the peptidoglycan and periplasmic scale is in rough agreement with the measurements reported in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig. 2. It is hard to orient oneself to see the layers. The use of the term periplasmic space (l. 132) and throughout is probably not wise as it is not a space.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer to retain this nomenclature since the term periplasmic space has been used in all the cell envelope CEMOVIS publications and is at the core of Erickson’s hypothesis about these observations and teichoic acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) L. 147.

If PG digestion has been successful then there will be marginal debris. Is this pellet translucent (like membranes)? If you use fluorescently labelled PG in the preparation has it all disappeared, as would be expected by fully digested and solubilised material?</p></disp-quote><p>In traditional protocols of bacterial membrane preparation, a low-speed centrifugation is first performed to discard “debris” that to our knowledge have not been well characterized but are thought to consist of unbroken cells and large fragments of cell wall. After enzymatic degradation of the pneumococcal cell wall, the low-speed pellet is not translucent as in typical membrane pellets after ultracentrifugation, but is rather loose, unlike a dense pellet of unbroken cells. A description of the pellet appearance was added in V2.</p><p>It is a good idea to check if some labeled PG is also pelleted at low-speed after digestion. In a double labeling experiment using azido-choline and a novel unpublished metabolic probe of the PG, we found that the PG was fully digested and labeled fragments migrated as a couple of fuzzy bands likely corresponding to different labeled peptides. These species were not pelleted at low speed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) l. 219. Can you give a reference to certify that the low mobility material is WTA? Why does it migrate differently than LTA? Or is the PG digestion not efficient?</p></disp-quote><p>WTA released from sacculi by alkaline lysis were found to migrate as a smear at the top of native gels revealed by alcian-blue silver staining, which is incompatible with SDS (Flores-Kim, 2019, 2022). The references have be added in V2. It could be argued in this case that the smearing was due to partial degradation of the WTA by the alkaline treatment.</p><p>Bui et al. (2012) reported the preparation of WTA by enzymatic digestion of sacculi, but the resulting WTA were without muropeptide, presumably due to a step of boiling at pH 5 used to deactivate the enzymes.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of pneumococcal WTA prepared by digestion of sacculi and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Since the migration of WTA in native and SDS-PAGE is similar, we hypothesize that they do not interact significantly with the dodecyl sulphate, in contrast to the LTA, which bear a lipidic moiety. The fuzziness of the WTA migration pattern may also result from the greater heterogeneity due to the attached muropeptide, such as different lengths (di-, tetra-saccharide…), different peptides despite the action of LytA (tri-, tetra-peptide…), different O-acetylation status, etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) L. 226-227, Fig S8. Presumably several of the major bands on the Coomassie stained gel are the lysozyme, mutanolysin, recombinant LytA, DNase and RNase used to digest the cell wall etc.? Can the sizes of these proteins be marked on the gel. Do any of them come down with the material at low-speed centrifugation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a gel showing the different enzymes individually and mixed (new Fig. S9G).

The statement was toned down in V2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L55: Although generally non-essential. I would remove or rephrase this statement. I don't think any TA mutant will survive out in the wild and will be essential under a certain condition. So perhaps not essential for growth under ideal conditions, but for the rest pretty essential.</p></disp-quote><p>The paragraph was amended by qualifying the essentiality to laboratory conditions and including selected references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L95: Note that the prevailing model until reference 20 (Gibson and Veening) was that the TA is polymerized intracellularly (see e.g. Figure 2 of PMID: 22432701, DOI: 10.1089/mdr.2012.0026). This intracellular polymerisation model seemed unlikely according to Gibson and Veening ('As TarP is classified by PFAM as a Wzy-type polymerase with predicted active site outside the cell, we speculate that TarP and TarQ polymerize the TA extracellularly in contrast to previous reports.'), but there is no experimental evidence as far as this referee knows of either model being correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the lack of experimental evidence, we think that Gibson and Veening are very likely correct, based on their argument, and also by analogy with the synthesis of other surface polysaccharides from undecaprenyl- or dolichol-linked precursors. It is unfortunate that Figure 2 of PMID: 22432701, DOI: 10.1089/mdr.2012.0026 was published in this way, since there was no evidence for a cytoplasmic polymerization, to our knowledge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L97: It is commonly believed, although I'm not sure it has ever been shown, that the capsule is covalently attached at the same position on the PG as WTA. Therefore, there must be some sort of regulation/competition between capsule biosynthesis and WTA biosynthesis (see also ref. 21). The presence of the capsule might thus also influence the characteristics of the periplasmic space. Considering that by far most pneumococcal strains are encapsulated, the authors should discuss this and why a capsule mutant was used in this study and how translatable their study using a capsule mutant is to S. pneumoniae in general.</p></disp-quote><p>A paragraph was added in the Introduction of V2 to present the complication and a sentence was added at the end of the discussion to mention that this should be studied in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L102: Ref 29 should probably be cited here as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Since in Ref 29 (Flores-Kim et al. 2019) there is a detectable amount of LTA (presumably precursors TA) in the ∆<italic>tacL</italic> stain, we prefer to cite only Hess et al. 2017 regarding the absence of LTA in the absence of TacL.

Supposedly, the LTA levels were underestimated in all samples equally so the relative WTA/LTA ratio changes will qualitatively give the same outcome? I agree that these findings will allow for a reassessment of previous studies in which presumably too low LTA levels were reported, but I would not expect a difference in outcome when people compared WTA:LTA ratios between strains?</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence was rephrased in V2 to be neutral regarding previous work and rather emphasize future possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L131: Perhaps it would be good to highlight that such a conspicuous space has been noticed before by other EM methods (see e.g. Figs.4 and 5 or ref 19, or one of the most clear TEM S. pneumoniae images I have seen in Fig. 1F of Gallay et al, Nat. Micro 2021). However, always some sort of staining had previously been performed so it was never clear this was a real periplasmic space.

I do not see one valid point in the current paper why underestimating LTA levels would change any of the conclusions drawn in Ref. 21. I do not know the other papers cited well enough, but it seems highly unlikely that their conclusions would be wrong by systematically underestimating LTA levels. As far as I understand it, this current work basically confirms the major conclusions drawn by these 'doubtful' papers (that TacL makes LTA and LytR is the main WTA producer). As such, I find this sentence highly unfair without precisely specifying what the exact doubts are. Sure, this current paper now shows that probably people have discarded unknowingly LTA and therefore underestimated LTA levels, so any quantitative assessment of LTA levels are probably wrong. That is one thing. But to say this casts doubts on these studies is very serious and unfair (unless the authors provide good arguments to support these serious claims).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes indeed.
