virus (HBV)-mediated transformation and tumorigenesis have remained largely unclear, due to the absence of a relevant primary model system. Here we propose the use of human liver organoids as a platform for modeling HBV infection and related tumorigenesis. We first describe a primary ex vivo HBV-infection model derived from healthy donor liver organoids after challenge with recombinant virus or HBV-infected patient serum. HBV-infected organoids produced covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and HBV early antigen (HBeAg), expressed intracellular HBV RNA and proteins, and produced infectious HBV. This ex vivo HBV-infected primary differentiated hepatocyte organoid platform was amenable to drug screening for both anti-HBV activity and drug-induced toxicity. We also studied HBV replication in transgenically modified organoids; liver organoids exogenously overexpressing the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) after lentiviral transduction were not more susceptible to HBV, suggesting the necessity for additional host factors for efficient infection. We also generated transgenic organoids harboring integrated HBV, representing a long-term culture system also suitable for viral production and the study of HBV transcription. Finally, we generated HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids from non-tumor cirrhotic tissue of explants from liver transplant patients. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived liver organoids indicated the presence of an aberrant early cancer gene signature, which clustered with the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort on The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma dataset and away from healthy liver tissue, and may provide invaluable novel biomarkers for the development of HCC and surveillance in HBV-infected patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>liver organoids</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis B virus</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STG 337116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahmoudi</surname><given-names>Tokameh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007553</institution-id><institution>Aids Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahmoudi</surname><given-names>Tokameh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002491</institution-id><institution>Bristol-Myers Squibb</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI424-543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Crignis</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human liver organoids provide a patient-derived platform to interrogate host and viral mechanisms of HBV replication, perform anti-HBV and toxicity drug screens, and investigate the molecular determinants of related tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of chronic liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) world wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacLachlan and Cowie, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Bisceglie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2018</xref>). A combination of viral and host factors determines whether an individual infected with HBV will be able to clear the infection or will become a chronic carrier. Characterized by its high host species and organ specificity, HBV infection and replication is thought to orchestrate an interplay between the immune system and viral-specific factors that eventually lead to the onset of HCC. Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-induced HCC have largely been provided by epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Serag, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fattovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sagnelli et al., 2020</xref>), genome-wide analysis of viral and host characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ally et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sartorius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shibata and Aburatani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ally et al., 2017</xref>), as well as by studies performed in in vitro settings using hepatoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas and Liang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, the limited availability of relevant animals or in vitro model systems to study HBV infection constitutes a major deficiency attributed to the strict viral host and cell-type tropism. Chimpanzees remain the only animal model that supports the full HBV replication cycle, while available hepatoma cell line models are unsuitable for delineating the molecular steps leading to tumorigenesis as they differ substantially from primary cells in their already tumor-derived gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Protzer, 2017</xref>). These systems have inherent limitations resulting in poor predictive value for clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allweiss and Dandri, 2016</xref>). Primary hepatocytes present the gold standard model system for HBV research in vitro, with recent studies reporting on significant increases in the half-life of these cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiang et al., 2019</xref>). However, primary cells are difficult to obtain and, since they cannot be expanded, are not usually available in quantities sufficient to perform large-scale analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes, which are susceptible to HBV infection and support replication, are also a useful model for studying host-virus determinants of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaneko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakurai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). However, iPSC-derived hepatocyte models cannot be patient derived, confining studies to only ex vivo infection systems and limiting the possibility of patient-specific personalized treatment approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Torresi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nantasanti et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence of deficiencies in available model systems and, despite its fascinating biology, many questions regarding the life cycle of HBV and its mechanisms of persistence, including HBV-induced molecular events underlying tumorigenesis, remain largely unexplored in primary settings, and key viral and host players involved remain unknown.</p><p>The dependence of hepatocytes on spatial and matrix-derived signals had until recently prevented their long-term in vitro culturing. Organoid culture technology involves the generation of cell-derived genetically stable in vitro 3D organ models of human origin. We have previously established a primary liver culture system based on isolation and expansion of primary cells that allows for the long-term expansion of liver cells as organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huch et al., 2015</xref>). In this culture system, isolated adult hepatic cells are expanded through multiple passages in an optimized expansion medium (EM) without induction of genomic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huch et al., 2015</xref>). When switched to a differentiation medium (DM) where proliferation signals are removed and ductal (progenitor) fate is inhibited, liver organoid cultures differentiate into functional hepatocytes in vitro as exemplified by their polygonal cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and hepatocyte functions, including <italic>albumin</italic> production and cytochrome <italic>CYP3A4</italic> expression and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huch et al., 2015</xref>). Here we use the human liver organoid platform to model and study HBV infection and replication, as well as related tumorigenesis in patient-derived organoids generated from HBV-infected donors. This expandable model yields patient-specific organoids in quantities amenable to molecular and functional characterization and allows us to generate a living biobank of HBV-infected patient-derived cells amenable to downstream genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis as well as screening for HBV-directed therapeutics. We first described the ex vivo HBV infection of healthy donor (hD)-derived liver organoids, as a model to investigate viral infection and replication in hepatocytes. We used the HBV-infected organoid model as a platform for drug screening that can measure both drug-induced anti-HBV transcription and replication activity as well as drug-induced toxicity. We also demonstrated that transgenic modification of liver organoids provides an in vitro mechanistic platform to study the molecular determinants of HBV infection and replication. Finally, we performed transcriptomic analysis of HBV-infected patient-derived organoids and described the discovery of an early cancer gene signature, a potentially invaluable prognostic biomarker for HCC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modeling HBV infection in vitro using human liver organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of liver organoids in expansion medium (EM) and differentiation medium (DM).

Liver organoids from healthy donors were grown in either EM or DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for 7 days prior to infection with recombinant HBV generated from HepG2.2.15, an HepG2 cell line subclone stably expressing HBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As control for the inoculum, we also infected organoids with heat-inactivated (HI) HBV. HBV infection and replication were validated by quantifying the levels of HBV DNA in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), detection of intracellular HBV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), visualizing HBV-specific proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and quantifying intracellular covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) from infected organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). HBV DNA was detected in organoid culture supernatants from 4 days post infection, but not from the HI virus-infected cells, pointing to successful HBV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Differentiated organoids maintained in DM were more efficiently infected and produced higher viral titers than organoids maintained in EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The RNA intermediates necessary for protein production and viral replication (3.5 kb RNA transcript and total HBV RNA) were present in infected DM organoids and detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, but not in the HI virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a further measure of active HBV replication, HBV early antigen (HBeAg) was also measured in supernatants of infected organoids and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Immunostaining, using antibodies recognizing HBV core antigen (HBcAg), showed specific nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in multiple infected healthy donor liver organoid lines, confirming the presence of foci of HBV replication in HBV-infected cells predominantly in infected DM organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, infection of DM organoids resulted in the production of cccDNA, a definitive marker of HBV replication, as detected by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based cccDNA detection method of intracellular HBV DNA after digestion with a nuclease to specifically remove non-cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Inoculum that lacks cccDNA was used as a negative control for the cccDNA-specific qPCR and HBV plasmid DNA was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). HBV replication, infection, and spread appeared to be persistent until 8 days after infection when viral production dropped significantly, likely because of the limited half-life of differentiated organoids in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Periodic culturing of the organoids in EM in order to stimulate the recovery and proliferation of the organoids modestly extended the half-life of the infected cultures, where viral production was maintained for approximately 1 month post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Donor-specific differences in efficiency of HBV infection were observed consistent with variable HBV permissiveness of primary human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shlomai et al., 2014</xref>), while HBV infection was observed with similar efficiency in different passages of the same donor line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). To determine whether the organoids are capable of producing infectious HBV, supernatants containing virus produced by organoids were collected, concentrated, and used for subsequent spinoculation of hD organoids. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, infection of hD organoids with organoid-produced HBV resulted in expression of intracellular HBV RNA, indicating that organoids produce infectious viral particles. Growth of viral isolates from patient material has been limited by the lack of an adequate primary model system. However, differentiated organoids were able to support infection and replication when challenged with HBV-infected patient sera, as shown by production of viral DNA, expression of viral transcripts, and positive immunostaining for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Differentiated liver organoids therefore provide a useful ex vivo HBV-infection platform in which the role of specific host and viral factors can be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ex vivo HBV-infected liver organoids are a viable platform for anti-viral drug screening and drug-induced toxicity</title><p>We next examined whether the ex vivo infected liver organoid platform would be amenable to anti-HBV drug screening to monitor antiviral activity and drug-induced toxicity of two different drugs, tenofovir and fialuridine, according to the schematic outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Tenofovir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits the reverse transcription of HBV pre-genomic RNA to DNA. Fialuridine, also a nucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcription, was shown to cause severe hepatotoxicity in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKenzie, 1995</xref>). In the organoids, HBV viral DNA production in the culture supernatant was inhibited by both tenofovir and fialuridine in three independent hD-derived organoids, whereas, as expected, RNA levels remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the organoid ex vivo infection platform not only allows measurement of drug-induced antiviral activity, but also offers insight into the mechanism of drug action by allowing delineation of distinct steps of the HBV life cycle targeted and inhibited. As expected, treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with tenofovir and fialuridine resulted in similar decreases in released HBV DNA, but no change in intracellular HBV RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), reaffirming the mechanism of action of these drugs in a cell-line model of HBV replication. Due to the well-established detrimental effects of fialuridine on the viability of primary human hepatocytes, we sought to evaluate fialuridine-induced toxicity on primary human liver organoids as well as in HepG2 cells. We measured the viability of organoids and HepG2 cells using the alamarBlue viability assay and by monitoring their phenotype upon fialuridine and tenofovir treatment using microscopy. HepG2 cells demonstrated no change in cell viability upon treatment with tenofovir and increasing concentrations of fialuridine as compared to the mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The phenotype of HepG2 cells was also comparable across all treatments as observed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, the liver organoids treated with fialuridine at as low a concentration as 1 µM demonstrated a significant reduction in viability as measured by alamarBlue assay when compared to mock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The organoids treated with higher fialuridine concentrations (5–20 µM) as well as with 20 µM tenofovir also demonstrated impaired viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The decreased cell viability was also apparent in the phenotype of the 1–20 µM fialuridine-treated and 20-µM tenofovir-treated organoids compared to vehicle controls as observed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This highlights that fialuridine-induced toxicity is evident and quantifiable in the primary human liver organoid model but not in the HepG2.2.15 model of HBV replication. Thus, we demonstrate that ex vivo-infected differentiated liver organoids support the full replication cycle of HBV and, following further characterization, may serve as an ideal novel primary platform for drug screening as well as elucidation of the molecular events underlying HBV replication. Moreover, human liver organoids serve as an ideal platform for monitoring drug-induced toxicity in pre-clinical studies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HBV-infected liver organoids as a model for HBV antiviral drug screening and toxicity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design of drug treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected liver organoids followed by assessment of antiviral activity and toxicity.

Exogenous expression of NTCP in hepatoma cell lines was shown to confer susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2012</xref>) in line with our observations of increased HBV infection in differentiated organoids, likely because of the higher level of NTCP expression. Since differentiated organoid cultures have a limited half-life, we sought to generate transgenically modified hD organoids exogenously expressing NTCP under expansion conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in order to improve infection efficiency and facilitate downstream analyses and investigation of the molecular events involved in HBV replication.

HBV-infected patient-derived (infected patient [iP]) organoids were expanded in culture (EM) and displayed proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and data not shown) and expression of progenitor markers <italic>LGR5, KRT7, HNF4α,</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) comparable to those of hD organoids. When grown in DM, in which proliferation signals are removed and the progenitor fate is inhibited, liver organoid cultures from both healthy and HBV-infected sources acquired the hepatocyte fate and differentiated into functional hepatocytes, similar to previously obtained data for healthy liver organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huch et al., 2015</xref>). In DM, both hD and iP liver organoid cultures showed increased expression of hepatocyte-specific genes encoding <italic>albumin</italic>, cytochrome <italic>CYP3A4</italic>, and NTCP, the cellular receptor implicated in HBV hepatocyte entry, concomitant with decreased expression of the stem cell-specific gene <italic>LGR5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). None of the iP organoids showed signs of HBV production at the RNA, DNA, or protein level (data not shown), suggesting that adult stem cells, from which the liver organoids are derived, do not contain actively replicating HBV. Interestingly, five out of six iP organoids contained portions of integrated HBV, corresponding to the HBx coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In accordance with our findings, in previous genome-wide analyses in tissues derived from donors with HCC, this region of the HBV genome was also found to be highly integrated in both HCC and non-tumor hepatocytes from infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in one donor, who was previously infected with HBV but cleared the infection (iDonor1), integration corresponding to a part of the HBV genome, including the HBx region, was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This finding indicates that despite clearance of active HBV replication, portions of the genome may remain integrated in the hepatocyte genome, for which the functional consequences remain to be elucidated. At the phenotypic level, while EM organoids grew larger in size and were translucent, differentiated iP organoids showed hepatocyte morphology and physiology comparable to hD organoids, with thickening of the outer cell layer, comparable to hD organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and production of albumin as detected by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, non-tumor HBV iP organoids display phenotypes comparable to hD-derived organoids, retain the capacity for differentiation, and are conducive to downstream genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids display a distinct early gene expression signature</title><p>The early detection of HBV-related HCC is a challenge that remains critical to direct optimal clinical management of the disease. Despite widely practiced periodic surveillance of patients with cirrhosis, patients with HCC are mostly diagnosed in a late stage. The presence of diagnostic biomarkers for early events in liver cell tumorigenesis would therefore be invaluable for early detection. In order to identify potential early biomarker genes for HBV-induced HCC, we performed mRNA sequencing of the organoid lines derived from HBV-iP and compared their gene expression profiles to those of organoids derived from hDs. We performed hierarchical clustering of protein-coding differentially expressed genes obtained from the comparison between organoids from five hD organoid lines and those from five iP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The iP organoid lines were seeded from five HBV mono-infected patients with cirrhotic liver, four of whom presented with small tumors at the time of the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, although the hD and iP organoids were phenotypically indistinguishable, the iP organoids clustered separately from the healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This comparison resulted in identification of a gene signature characteristic of iP-derived organoids (henceforth ‘iP-signature’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then ranked the differentially expressed genes according to the relative distance of their expression in hD- vs iP-derived organoids and identified a group of 33 putative early biomarker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO)-term and KEGG-pathway analysis revealed that the ‘early signature’ genes were enriched in metabolic pathway-associated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Among these, <italic>CCNA1</italic> and <italic>STMN2</italic>, which we found to be upregulated in the non-tumor infected patient-derived organoids, were previously identified to be upregulated in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paradis et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, <italic>WNK2, RUSC2, CYP3A4,</italic> and <italic>RGN</italic>, among the significantly downregulated genes in the non-tumor iP organoids, have been described as tumor suppressors downregulated in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamaguchi, 2015</xref>). We further checked if these targets were also upregulated in primary hepatocytes obtained from the tissues from which iP vs hD organoids had been seeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or in ex vivo HBV-infected organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similarly, signature genes were upregulated upon ex vivo HBV infection of hD organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our subsequent analysis included six healthy donors (orange circles, hD), six HBV-infected samples (green triangles, iP), and four healthy donors that had previously been infected with HBV, but had subsequently cleared infection and displayed no aberrant phenotype (blue squares, infected donor [iDonor]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The application of the iP-signature to these samples groups hDs (gray bars) apart from iPs (black bars), as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, the organoids generated from the iDonors (light orange bars), which had cleared HBV infection, clustered together and more closely to the larger group of iP organoids derived from patients with HBV-driven cirrhosis and HCC (maroon bars) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This observation of iDonors’ clustering closely with iP-HBV-HCC indicated the presence of the early HCC-like gene signature in these infected donor livers, despite clearance of HBV infection and absence of phenotypic and functional abnormalities at the time of donation, an observation that may be important to be considered for transplantation purposes and surveillance. This is also in accordance with our observation that some iDonors also contain integrated parts of the HBV genome corresponding to HBx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then applied the iP-signature to organoids from 11 iPs (green triangles, iP), 6 healthy donors (orange circles, hD), 4 infected donors (blue squares, iDonors), and 4 donors diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) not caused by HBV infection (purple pentagons, CN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> describes all patients, groups, and clinical characteristics. Included amongst the iP group were also organoids seeded from HBV-infected patients who at the time of collection had HCC (iP-BCC), acute liver failure (iP-BFA), HBV-infection-induced cirrhosis without HCC (iP-BC), as well as HBV-HDV coinfection either with HCC (iP-BDCC) or with acute liver failure (iP-BDFA). The iP-signature separates and groups together the non-infected samples (gray bars) and iP organoids (black bars) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, although the CN samples were obtained from cirrhotic livers (green bars), they grouped apart from the HBV-infected iPs and hDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>), indicating that our gene signature is defined by HBV-infection status, rather than the cirrhotic status. In agreement, multidimensional scaling analysis of all iP and hD samples indicated that all hD organoids are clearly separated from the rest and tightly grouped together, while the iP organoids form separate groups corresponding to HDV (hepatitis D virus) coinfection, HCC, acute liver failure, or previous/cirrhotic HBV infection and cluster together, but away from CN samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). We have, therefore, identified a specific gene signature/group that discriminates between the hD and iP organoids among more complex classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). We applied this gene signature to all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) database, a depository of sequences from HCC patients. The application of this gene signature when mapped onto the relevant TCGA gene expression data distinctly separated the TCGA HCC samples from non-HCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This important observation indicates that transcriptomic analysis of our patient-derived liver organoid model identified a novel early liver cancer gene signature in non-tumor HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids, despite the absence of phenotypic signs of aberrant growth. Thus, HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids are a novel primary 3D cell culture model that resembles the diseased tissue of origin and can be used for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical applications to identify biomarkers for disease states during HBV infection.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Characterization of early HCC gene signature.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hierarchical clustering heatmap of six infected patient (iP), six healthy donor (hD), and four infected donor (iDonor) samples depicting the grouping and expression levels of protein-coding differentially expressed genes derived from the comparison between the group of five hDs and five iPs presenting hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (four out of five) (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Healthy donor liver organoids were efficiently infected with both recombinant virus as well as HBV-infected patient serum, expressed HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV core proteins, produced cccDNA and infectious HBV in the culture supernatant, indicating that liver organoids support the full HBV replication cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Human liver organoids, therefore, serve as an invaluable tool in the field of HBV research to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV replication in a primary cell system that is expandable and ideal for biobanking.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of applications of human liver organoids in HBV studies.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60747-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We demonstrated that the ex vivo infected organoid replication platform is amenable to screening for potential inhibitors of HBV replication and can provide insights into both HBV-directed anti-viral activity and drug-induced toxicity. The ability to measure different readouts of HBV replication at the level of HBV mRNA gene expression, or viral production by quantitation of HBV DNA or S antigen, present in the culture supernatant of HBV-infected liver organoids, can provide insights into the distinct steps in the HBV life cycle that may be targeted upon drug treatment. This is highlighted by our studies using the HBV-directed drugs tenofovir and fialuridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which, as expected, did not affect the levels of intracellular HBV RNA, but blocked HBV replication by inhibiting the reverse transcription step that converts HBV pre-genomic RNA to DNA, as was measurable by decreased HBV DNA levels. A critical aspect of potentially therapeutic novel drugs, which leads to failure within the drug development pipeline, is toxicity. While fialuridine treatment of HBV-infected human liver organoids efficiently inhibited HBV replication, it also caused significant toxicity in the liver organoids. The potential of this pre-clinical human liver organoid model for measuring drug-induced toxicity is highlighted by the results of a phase II clinical trial conducted in 1993 to evaluate fialuridine as a novel HBV-anti-viral drug (Eli Lilly Trial H3X-MC-PPPC, NIH protocol #93-DK-0031). Although the preliminary results of the trial were promising, with reduced levels of HBV DNA in patients, the study was terminated on an emergency basis by week 13 because of serious hepatotoxicity in seven patients, of which five died and two required emergency liver transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKenzie, 1995</xref>). This compound successfully passed pre-clinical toxicity studies, but the expression of a nucleoside transporter in human mitochondria may be responsible for the human-specific mitochondrial toxicity caused by fialuridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). In the primary human liver organoid system, the toxicity of fialuridine is significant and quantifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>) but was not observed in the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line, indicating that human liver organoids can more accurately predict the clinical outcomes of drug treatment. Thus, the HBV-infected organoid platform can potentially be used as an important pre-clinical, primary hepatocyte-screening platform for both the discovery of new candidate drugs targeting HBV transcription and replication and for assessing their potential toxicity.</p><p>When cultured under differentiating growth conditions, the expression of the HBV receptor NTCP increased significantly in liver organoids. Consistent with the observed higher NTCP levels, in vitro infection of differentiated organoids with HBV led to higher levels of infection and replication. HBV infection was dependent on NTCP, as treatment of liver organoids with the NTCP-targeting competitive HBV entry inhibitor myrcludex-B reduced infection. To obtain expanding long-term HBV-infected replicating cultures of human liver organoids using transgenic modification by lentiviral transduction, we generated liver organoids that exogenously expressed membrane-localized NTCP under expansion conditions. Surprisingly, the higher expression of NTCP did not result in more efficient infection of organoids, suggesting that although necessary, NTCP alone may not be sufficient for optimal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with our observations, HepG2 cell lines exogenously expressing NTCP, while susceptible to infection, are inefficiently infected with HBV and require high viral titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwamoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). These observations are suggestive of the potential necessity for additional (co)receptors or downstream factors necessary for optimal infection in hepatocytes. Using lentiviral transduction, we also generated polyclonal liver organoids that contain integrated full-length HBV genome, which efficiently produced HBV under expansion conditions. This model, similar to HepG2.2.15 cells, although not a cccDNA-generating model of productive HBV infection, is a useful primary human liver model to investigate HBV transcription and HBV-directed drugs.</p><p>Recently, alternative liver organoid model systems derived from human (induced) pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaneko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakurai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 2017</xref>) as well as primary human hepatocyte co-culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">March et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiang et al., 2019</xref>) have been developed, which can be used to study HBV infection. However, the human liver organoid platform offers two main advantages over these model systems. The first and most important is that HBV-infected patient-derived organoids resemble the diseased tissue of origin, as demonstrated by our gene expression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, the organoid platform allows the possibility of expansion and biobanking, ensuring the availability of sufficient samples for downstream analyses. Therefore, while primary human hepatocytes and iPSC models, similar to the ex vivo infection of hD human liver organoids we describe here, provide reliable ex vivo infection models for studies on HBV, the human liver organoid platform is uniquely suitable for long-term, patient-derived studies.</p><p>Early surveillance of the changes in gene expression or biomarkers that predict the occurrence of HCC is critical for enabling patients to receive timely and successful treatment. Paving the way for personalized therapy of HBV-infected patients, liver organoids can be seeded from infected patient liver resections, at different stages of the disease. Comparison of the gene expression profiles of healthy donor to HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids and further HDV-co-infected and acute liver failure patient sub-groups points to the extent to which organoids reflect the biology and represent the transcriptomic profiles of the primary non-tumor tissue of origin. Interestingly, although we found no sign of viral production in the non-tumor HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoid lines, we did observe portions of the HBV genome corresponding to parts of HBx integrated into these patient-derived organoids. Aside from the potential for insertional mutagenisis and disruption of host gene integration of HBx, a characterized oncogene may lead to aberrant host gene expression, providing a potential mechanism for iDonor organoids to display an early gene signature despite the absence of active HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Thus, the observed HBV-infected patient-specific gene expression profile is likely a marker of HBV infection and possibly HBx expression. Our observations are consistent with the notion that the gene expression profile of the tumor microenvironment may serve as an important biomarker of HCC as bystander cells contain portions of the integrated HBV genome and are chronically exposed to released HBV proteins despite not having active viral replication. Indeed, our data indicate that HBV-infected non-tumor patient-derived liver organoids exhibit an early cancer gene profile, as shown by comparison to the TCGA-LIHC database. The identification of early aberrant gene regulatory networks and biomarkers that drive HBV-mediated HCC, detectable at an early non-tumor stage without phenotypic signs of tumorigenesis, allows for patient-specific surveillance of disease progression and provides a screening platform for candidate drugs that may guide personalized treatments by targeting early stages in HBV-mediated HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Organoids from two wells of a 24-well plate were collected in 500 µl of cell lysis buffer and processed using RealiaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>To determine HBV production following transduction with the full-length HBV lentiviral vector, the supernatant and cells from transduced cultures were collected at different time points after completion of blasticidin selection. Presence of viral DNA in the supernatant and cellular-associated viral RNA was assessed using the real-time protocol detailed as mentioned before in detection of HBV DNA and RNA section. Presence of HBsAg in organoid supernatant was assessed using the MonaLisa Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were first analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), and then each pair was compared through Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are shown as mean ± SD of at least three replicate treatments; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01. The data were analyzed and graphs were depicted by GraphPad Prism software 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Obtained data from drug screening of infected organoids have two to eight technical replicates for each donor. Thus, the obtained data from each donor were analyzed by ANOVA separately or as stated in the figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Melanie Ott as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Aleem Siddiqui (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors previously reported the human liver organoid system using human liver biopsy samples. In this manuscript, they develop human liver organoids as a model system for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and as a tool to screen for antiviral therapeutics. The authors demonstrate the ability to generate liver organoids from healthy as well as chronic HBV patients, and these organoids in the EM state retain stem cell markers and in DM upregulate hepatocyte markers as expected. In the expansion media, organoid hepatocytes expressed low levels of NTCP. Levels of NTCP expression was higher in the differentiation medium, but ultimately the authors established NTCP-overexpressed human liver organoids using lentiviral transduction. These were used for de novo infections with HBV and overall for drug-induced toxicity studies. The authors also performed bulk RNAseq analysis of organoids derived from HBV+ from patients (without de novo infection) to identify an &quot;early signature&quot; gene set that can serve as a biomarker for HBV infection and related HCC.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers recognize the novelty and potential impact of the described liver organoid system on HBV research. Revisions are outlined to strengthen (1) the HBV virology; (2) the conclusions from the RNA-Seq data; (3) information regarding the organoid system.</p><p>1) The absolute numbers of cccDNA and intracellular HBV DNA, as well as their ratios, varied significantly among the liver organoids from different donors, which could be due to the batch-to-batch variation of liver organoids or the variations of the detection method. In these regards, the authors need to further characterize the viral nucleic acids (cccDNA, RNA, core DNA) in HBV-infected liver organoids more qualitatively and quantitatively.To unambiguously show successful infection of the organoids, detection of cccDNA by Southern blotting is the gold standard and should be shown. Alternatively, a northern blot of HBV RNA or Southern blot of HBV core DNA with and without Nuc treatment can be acceptable.</p><p>2) It would be critical to include organoids from cirrhotic donors who have not been previously infected in the analysis. Comparing infected versus uninfected &quot;healthy&quot; individuals makes interpreting the RNAseq data (Figure 4F) ambiguous as it remains unclear what weight the &quot;cirrhotic&quot; gene expression signature carries in the interpretation of results versus HBV infection. Also, were input samples analyzed, and are these transcriptome differences consistent with the liver samples before organoid formation? Several genes related to early HCC were up-regulated in HBV patient-derived liver organoids systems. However, the authors did not verify these genes and their expression levels in the HBV-associated HCC patients and HBV infected human liver organoids systems.</p><p>3) The authors have not stated how long NTCP-overexpressed human liver organoids and HBV patient-derived liver organoids systems can be kept in culture while maintaining liver cell properties. The authors should confirm these. Could the authors explain more on why HBV-positive liver organoids were not obtained from HBV patient livers? Have the authors detected HBV integration in the established organoids derived from HBV patients?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Application of human liver organoids as a patient-derived primary model for HBV Infection and Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors add new data to address some of the areas highlighted in the previous peer review including critically important RNA-seq analysis of non-cirrhotic donors and analysis of integration events in iP organoids. The authors also address several points regarding HBV virology, including elimination of the CMV-driven 1.3xHBV construct data.</p><p>A critical issue that the authors need to address is the hierarchical clustering analysis in Figure 6. The authors provide two analyses (Figure 6A and 6C) which share the iP organoid lines but not the organoids from donors that cleared infection (iD-B) and donors that had NASH (CN). To ascertain whether both of these donor populations organoids cluster in relation to each other as well as iP organoids, the clustering analysis should be done in one combined iteration.</p><p>As the Southern blot is not available, the authors should provide additional supporting data, such as MyrB and/or CsA treatment (confirming NTCP-dependency) as well as HBeAg measurement (a better de novo infection marker than the virion-associated HBcAg and HBsAg) of infected organoids.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60747.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers recognize the novelty and potential impact of the described liver organoid system on HBV research.

As the reviewers suggest, to better characterize whether the source of variability of HBV DNA, both intracellular and cccDNA, is due to donor variability, batch to batch variation or variations in the detection method, we quantitatively examined the viral nucleic acids following ex vivo HBV infection of organoids derived from four independent donors. Organoids from the four donors were infected simultaneously with the same batch of virus and intracellular HBV DNA was quantified and detected in parallel to eliminate the contribution of variations in detection method to the observed variability (Lines 135-137 and Figure 1, Figure supplement 3c of the revised manuscript). In order to assess the effect of batch-to-batch variation on the observed variability of infection levels, we also infected independent donors at two different culture passages with the same batch of HBV and we observed comparable levels of intracellular HBV DNA in organoids derived from the same donor at different passages (Lines 135-137 and Figure 1, Figure supplement 3d of the revised manuscript). Our data thus demonstrate that batch to batch variation does not significantly contribute to the observed variability. We did however observe significant differences in intracellular HBV DNA levels between different organoid donors which were infected at the same time with the same batch of virus and processed simultaneously (lines 136 and Figure 1, Figure supplement 3c of the revised manuscript), demonstrating that the variability we observe in the efficiency of infection is indeed donor-to-donor variability. Our data is also consistent with donor to donor variability in infection efficiency observed for primary human hepatocytes (Shlomai et. al, PNAS 2014). We now discuss these results in lines 135-137 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To unambiguously show successful infection of the organoids, detection of cccDNA by Southern blotting is the gold standard and should be shown.

Indeed a recent paper which described a 3D hiPSC liver organoid system as a model to study HBV infection demonstrated the presence of intracellular HBV core DNA using PCR and not Southern blotting (Nie et al., EBioMedicine 2018; 35: 114–123).</p><p>We put substantial effort into setting-up a Southern blot experiment for the ex vivo HBV infected organoid model, which we detail below. However, we came to the conclusion that the scale (100-10000 wells of organoids per condition) and cost of such an experiment (&gt;&gt;€7000,- per condition) precluded its feasibility. Below we will explain in detail how we came to this conclusion.</p><p>First we determined the limit of detection for a Southern blot assay and set-up a dot blot assay using biotinylated PCR generated probes spanning either a ~400bp region of the HBV core region or the full-length HBV genome and detected signal using IRDye 800CW Streptavidin using a Li-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager and obtained a specific signal with a linear limit of detection of around 1^10<sup>6</sup> copies of cloned HBV DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This is in line with limits of detection previously reported for Southern blot (dot blot) detection using either biotin- or 32P- labelled probes [e.g. Saldanha et al., J Virol Methods 1987; 16(4): 339-342; Roe et al., Korean J intern Med 1988; 3(1): 9-14; Santantonio et al., Rec Clin Lab 1990; 20(1): 29-35; Valentine-Thon et al., Mol Cell Probes 1991; 5(4): 299-305]. From this experiment we concluded that we need at minimum a total of 1^10<sup>6</sup> copies of purified HBV DNA for reliable detection of intracellular HBV core DNA and preferably 1^10<sup>7</sup> – 1^10<sup>8</sup> copies to reliably quantify the effect of Nuc treatment.</p><p>In order to estimate the amount of organoids needed to perform the Southern blot experiment we performed real-time qPCR on the same amounts of cloned HBV DNA as used in the titration curve we used to assess the detection limit of the dot-blot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>) and compared these Cq values to Cq values routinely obtained from infected organoid cultures.</p><p>When isolating total DNA from HBV infected organoids cultured in one well of a 24 well plate we obtained, depending on the efficiency of infection, Cq values of 23-25 which corresponds to approximately 1^10<sup>3</sup> – 1^10<sup>4</sup> copies of intracellular HBV core DNA. This means that in order to obtain a reliable signal in our blot experiment we would need in the range of 100 (bare minimum) to 10000 (optimum) wells of infected organoids for one single condition (with or without Nuc treatment).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Detection limit of Southern Blot analysis of HBV genome.</title><p>A. Serial dilution of cloned HBV genome (top row) and non HBV plasmid (bottom row) was spotted on Hybond-XL membrane and detected using a PCR generated biotinylated near full length HBV probe.

Therefore, in order to infect the amount of organoids needed for a Southern blot experiment we would have to collect and concentrate up to 50 liters of supernatant.</p><p>Importantly, during the total DNA extraction procedure cellular gDNA (~1ug) is isolated as well as intracellular HBV core DNA. Therefore we applied an existing protocol for HBV nucleocapsid isolation commonly used for cell lines and sera [e.g. Guo et al., J Virol 2005;79(5):2729-42] to our liver organoids and found that this resulted in a ~50% loss of intracellular HBV core DNA as compared to a total DNA extraction protocol while it still contains a high genomic DNA background (100ng genomic DNA/0.005pg (1250 copies) HBV DNA). This is probably due to the intricate three dimensional organoid structure that hampers complete cell lysis in mild lysis buffers. A consequence of this high genomic DNA background is that if we load 1^10<sup>6</sup> copies of purified HBV DNA we also load ~100ug of genomic DNA which exceeds the binding capacity of the HybondXL membrane (42ug for a 3mm diameter well).</p><p>However, to strengthen the HBV virology presented in the manuscript and to further characterize the ex vivo HBV infection of liver organoids, we have performed additional experiments using T5 exonuclease-mediated digestion, a more robust PCR-based technique to detect intracellular cccDNA in four additional donor organoid lines. Using this technique we confirm that the liver organoids are indeed infected with HBV and produce cccDNA (Figure 1f of the revised manuscript). This data, together with extensive immune-fluorescent characterization of expression of HBV proteins HBx and HBV core, as well as characterization of HBV intracellular RNA, DNA, as well as organoid culture supernatants containing infectious HBV particles provides unambiguous data that demonstrates successful infection of the liver organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be critical to include organoids from cirrhotic donors who have not been previously infected in the analysis. Comparing infected versus uninfected &quot;healthy&quot; individuals makes interpreting the RNAseq data (Figure 4F) ambiguous as it remains unclear what weight the &quot;cirrhotic&quot; gene expression signature carries in the interpretation of results versus HBV infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether the iP-signature observed corresponds to HBV infection or is a consequence of cirrhosis is indeed a very important point that following the reviewers’ comments, we have made substantial effort to address by including additional donors and patient-derived organoid lines in our RNA seq analysis (figure 6). Specifically, in addition to the healthy infected donor presented in the first version of the manuscript, we now include two additional donors that had previously been infected with but cleared HBV-infection (iDonors). Importantly, these donors had non-cirrhotic livers which were used for transplantation in HBV infected recipients (whose cirrhotic livers were explanted). We also include two donors who had a cirrhotic liver phenotype and underwent explant because of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but were uninfected with HBV (CN). We also included a sixth healthy donor line (hD22) (Lines 309-311 and Figure 6a-d of the revised manuscript). Organoid lines were seeded from liver biopsies or explants from these donors/patients and used in RNA seq analysis. When applying the iP- signature we generated from comparing the five healthy donor organoid lines (hD) to five HBV-infected cirrhotic patient-derived organoid lines (iPs), the iDonors as well as the iP-CN clustered away from the healthy donors (Figure 6a-d). Interestingly, while the iDonors grouped together closely with the iPs (Figure 6a), the CN samples clustered away from the iPs (Figure 6c). These results demonstrate that the iP- signature we obtained is an indicator of HBV infection, and not of the cirrhotic state per se: the HBV infected iDonors organoids, while clustering together with HBV infected iPs, were not generated from cirrhotic livers, and therefore the signature cannot be a cirrhotic signature. These findings are now discussed in lines 295-318 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, were input samples analyzed, and are these transcriptome differences consistent with the liver samples before organoid formation? Several genes related to early HCC were up-regulated in HBV patient-derived liver organoids systems. However, the authors did not verify these genes and their expression levels in the HBV-associated HCC patients and HBV infected human liver organoids systems.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, in order to validate that the transcriptome differences we observed are consistent with liver samples before organoid formation, we examined the expression of candidate genes identified in our gene signature in primary hepatocytes obtained from tissues from healthy or HBV-infected donors. We indeed observed upregulation of signature genes <italic>ADAMTS1, CORO1A, PTHLH, STMN2</italic> and <italic>STY5</italic> mRNA expression in iP primary hepatocytes as compared to hD hepatocytes (Figure 5c). Additionally, we examined expression of the select candidate upregulated signature genes in independent hD organoid lines infected ex vivo with HBV or heat-inactivated virus. In response to HBV infection of organoids, signature genes were modestly upregulated, although not significantly, given the low percentages of infection as well as donor to donor variability inherent to the system (Figure 5 Supplement 1a). We discuss these results in lines 282-289 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have not stated how long NTCP-overexpressed human liver organoids and HBV patient-derived liver organoids systems can be kept in culture while maintaining liver cell properties. The authors should confirm these.</p></disp-quote><p>Healthy donor, patient-derived and lentivirally transduced NTCP overexpressed liver organoids exhibited liver properties after seven days of culturing in differentiation media (DM). The differentiated hepatocyte markers, which indicate liver cell properties remain stably expressed in DM organoids for the duration of the cultures, which as we have shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, can be maintained for more than one month (27 days after infection) (line 132-134). In the absence of ex vivo spin infection, differentiated organoid cultures can be maintained for up to two months with intermittent culturing in expansion media (data not shown). We now provide this information in the methods section (lines 588-590).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors explain more on why HBV-positive liver organoids were not obtained from HBV patient livers? Have the authors detected HBV integration in the established organoids derived from HBV patients?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers point out, we were unable to find any quantifiable signs of HBV replication in the patient-derived organoids. iP- organoid culture supernatants were devoid of HBV DNA, in either expansion or differentiation media. We were also unable to detect intracellular HBV RNA or DNA from iP organoids. Liver organoids are generated from adult stem cells present in the liver. Although these ASCs may not support active viral replication, they may still contain portions of integrated HBV DNA with as of yet uncharacterized function. Previous genome wide analyses in tissues from patients with HCC, had identified regions of the HBV genome to be integrated in both non-tumor HBV infected tissue as well as HCC obtained from these patients (Sung et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2016). Therefore, in order to better address the reviewers’ comments, we conducted a PCR analysis on genomic DNA obtained from infected patient-derived organoids to examine if HBV is integrated in the genome of these iP lines. Interestingly, in five out of six iP organoid lines analyzed, we found parts of the HBV genome integrated, corresponding to a portion of the HBx coding region (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, in a healthy donor who was previously infected with HBV but since cleared the infection (iDonor1), HBV integration corresponding to the HBx region was also observed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This finding indicates that although an individual may have cleared active HBV replication, parts of the genome remain integrated in the host DNA, for which the functional consequences remain to be characterized. This new data is now presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and is discussed in lines 243-250 and lines 406-417 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors add new data to address some of the areas highlighted in the previous peer review including critically important RNA-seq analysis of non-cirrhotic donors and analysis of integration events in iP organoids. The authors also address several points regarding HBV virology, including elimination of the CMV-driven 1.3xHBV construct data.</p><p>A critical issue that the authors need to address is the hierarchical clustering analysis in Figure 6. The authors provide two analyses (Figure 6A and 6C) which share the iP organoid lines but not the organoids from donors that cleared infection (iD-B) and donors that had NASH (CN). To ascertain whether both of these donor populations organoids cluster in relation to each other as well as iP organoids, the clustering analysis should be done in one combined iteration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In Figure 6C and 6D of the revised manuscript we now include donors that cleared infection (iDonors 1-4) along with donors that had liver cirrhosis due to NASH (CN1-4) in the same hierarchical clustering analysis and MDS plot. We have made substantial effort to strengthen our analysis and conclusions by including, as stated above, an additional infected donor that cleared HBV (iDonor 4) and two additional donors who had cirrhotic phenotypes due to NASH (CN3-4). By applying the HBV driven iP signature that we generated from comparing the five healthy donor organoid lines (hD) to five HBV-infected cirrhotic patient-derived organoid lines (iPs), we observed that iDonors cluster closely with iPs and away from hDs even though they phenotypically resemble hDs (Figure 6A-B). importantly, inclusion of the iDonors into the analysis, did not change the clustering of the CN samples separately away from the iPs (Figure 6 C-D). These data, generated from additional donors are in agreement with our previous data and support the notion that the iP signature we generated is HBV-driven and not a general cirrhotic signature (lines 313, 320, Table -1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the Southern blot is not available, the authors should provide additional supporting data, such as MyrB and/or CsA treatment (confirming NTCP-dependency) as well as HBeAg measurement (a better de novo infection marker than the virion-associated HBcAg and HBsAg) of infected organoids.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the recommendations of the reviewers, to confirm NTCP dependency of HBV infection of the liver organoids, we performed the in vitro HBV infection experiments with or without (pre)treatment of liver organoids with myrcludex-B, the HBV entry inhibitor, which functions by blocking NTCP. Indeed, blocking NTCP results in a reduction of HBV infection as measured via quantitation of intracellular HBV RNA, as well as HBV DNA and HBeAg in the supernatant of infected organoids (presented in Figure 3 C, D and E of the revised manuscript (lines 190-197)). We also measured, as suggested by the reviewers the presence of HBeAg in the culture supernatants of infected liver organoids as an additional marker of active HBV replication (confirming our data demonstrating intracellular HBV RNA and DNA, HBV DNA and Surface Ag produced and detected in the culture supernatant, and HBV viral proteins detected by Immunofluorescence microscopy). Data demonstrating HBV infection mediated production of HBeAg in infected liver organoids are presented in Figure 1G of the revised manuscript (lines 122-123).</p></body></sub-article></article>
