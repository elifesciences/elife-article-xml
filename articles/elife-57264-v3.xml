Their thermodynamics provides information critical for deriving a fundamental understanding of molecular functions. In a broader biological context, these associations are linked and interconnected in complex networks that allow sensitive and precise developmental programs and responses to environmental cues, and that are altered in disease states. The outputs of pathways and networks are determined by the quantitative interplay of their many constituent molecules and interactions. Thus, equilibrium constants for association between network components are needed to define, model, predict, and ultimately precisely manipulate biology.</p><p>A limitation of traditional biochemical measurements is their low throughput, especially in relation to the large number of cellular interactions. Excitingly, several strategies have recently emerged to obtain high-throughput, quantitative information for intermolecular associations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tome et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nutiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maerkl and Quake, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jain et al., 2017</xref>). Given these potentially transformative advances, it is especially timely to assess the accuracy of equilibrium binding measurements. We wanted to know whether current practices are sufficient to ensure reliable and accurate measurements, and whether the reliability of these measurements can be readily ascertained from the information provided in published work.</p><p>Our survey of 100 literature binding measurements, presented below, uncovered recurring problems with a large majority of studies. Fortunately, there are straightforward procedures, laid out here, that can be followed to ensure that published binding measurements are reliable. The principles underlying these procedures have been discussed and we build on these previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pollard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulme and Trevethick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanders, 2010</xref>). We focus on a minimal set of critical actionable steps and controls that biologists of any background should be able to implement in their binding measurements. We apply these procedures with experimental examples and also demonstrate the pitfalls of omitting essential controls. To further streamline application of these standard procedures, we provide a convenient checklist that can organize and guide experiments and can be used as an aid in summarizing and presenting results for publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessing the current state of binding measurements</title><p>We evaluated published binding measurements using RNA-protein interactions as an illustrative example. We surveyed 100 studies that reported equilibrium dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values) and scored them based on two key criteria for reliable binding measurements: sufficient time to equilibration and proper concentration regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Assessment of published <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for RNA-binding proteins.</title><p>We analyzed 100 papers reporting <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> or ‘apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>’ values of RNA/protein interactions. Measurements were evaluated based on two criteria: demonstrating equilibration (horizontal axis) and controlling for titration (vertical axis). Detailed criteria are described in Materials and methods, and the source data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The right column includes predominantly studies that used ITC and SPR, techniques that inherently record binding progress over time (24/30 in this column).

The first category includes studies that systematically varied the limiting component concentration to rule out titration. Studies that reported using an appropriate concentration regime or analysis methods to minimize the effects of titration (second and third column, respectively) were considered titration controlled; nevertheless, we emphasize the importance of performing and reporting the control experiments described herein, instead of relying on concentrations alone (see section 'Avoid the titration regime'). The ‘Other’ category (n = 7) includes a study that reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values as upper limits, recognizing possible titration (n = 1), and studies that only used SPR (n = 6), where the concentration of the immobilized species is difficult to estimate, but mass transport is typically controlled for or accounted for during analysis, as indicated in most surveyed studies.

The ‘Not reported/Other’ category includes studies that did not report the limiting component concentration (n = 4), or used the quadratic equation in a titration regime (limiting component concentration in &gt;1000-fold excess over the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>), incompatible with reliable <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> determination (n = 1; see below).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-57264-fig1-figsupp2-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig></fig-group><p>First, we asked if equilibration was demonstrated. By definition, an equilibrium state is invariant with time. So, determining a binding equilibrium constant requires showing that there is no change in the amount of bound complex over time. Of the 100 studies surveyed, 70 did not report varying time for reported equilibrium measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of the 30 studies that did vary time, 24 exclusively used techniques with built-in monitoring of progress over time (isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance [SPR]). Of the remaining 76 studies—those using approaches such as native gel shifts, nitrocellulose filter binding, and fluorescence anisotropy—less than 10% reported varying time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We know from individual discussions that some researchers carry out these controls, as we advocate below, but do not report them. Unfortunately, the published record then cannot distinguish between these studies and others that have not demonstrated equilibration.</p><p>A second critical control entails demonstrating that the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is not affected by titration, as artifacts can arise when the concentration of the constant limiting component is too high relative to the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>). Similar to varying time to establish equilibration, systematically varying the concentration of the limiting component provides a definitive control for effects of titration. In our survey, only 5% of studies reported performing this or equivalent control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, most authors appeared to be aware of the need to avoid titration, as the majority of studies (~70%) reported using appropriately low concentrations of the limiting component or employed advanced analysis methods. We consider these examples as reasonably titration-controlled for the purpose of the survey, but emphasize the importance of empirical controls in the sections below. Importantly, this leaves, at a minimum, one-fourth of studies at risk for titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To what extent do these limitations affect the reported equilibrium binding constants in practice? As an example, for Puf4 binding (see below), <italic>not</italic> controlling for the factors above gave apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values that were up to seven-fold higher than the actual <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values. A more extreme literature example is discussed in the next section, with discrepancies reaching 1000-fold, and other examples have been previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulme and Trevethick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strohkendl et al., 2018</xref>). There is a tendency to be less careful about controls in pursuit of relative affinities (specificity) rather than absolute affinity. However, failing to account for the factors noted above can also underestimate specificity by orders of magnitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> below).</p><p>These observations highlight an urgent need to revisit the criteria for reliable binding measurements. There is a parallel need to render these criteria accessible to a broad range of biologists, regardless of background or training, in the form of clear and readily actionable guidelines. To meet these needs, we provide simple, concrete strategies so that any practitioner can carry out reliable binding measurements, clearly communicate their results, and evaluate results from others.</p><p>Fortunately, the key requirements for binding measurements can be broken down into a small number of steps. We present two required steps for equilibrium binding measurements—varying the incubation time (see section 'Vary incubation time to test for equilibration') and controlling for titration (see section 'Avoid the titration regime'), and we illustrate these steps for the example of RNA binding to the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Puf4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2008</xref>). We also present additional steps that can be taken to further increase confidence in <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values and to obtain kinetic information about the binding event under investigation (see sections 'Test <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> by an independent approach' and 'Determine the fraction of active protein'). Finally, we describe strategies to address cases where no binding is initially detected and explain why it is often premature to conclude an absence of binding (see section 'The case of no observed binding').</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Practical considerations</title><p>In principle, one would like to have well-behaved and perfectly controlled measurements in all cases, but biology and biochemistry can be messy. There are many times, working with extracts and partially purified systems where protein concentrations cannot be accurately determined, where proteases and nucleases may limit achievable equilibration times, and where there may be additional interacting components. Regardless of these potential complications, the simple steps indicated below can establish the robustness of measured affinities and can diagnose and help overcome issues like loss of activity over time. Moreover, these controls (and quantitative measurements more generally) can help uncover new features and regulatory mechanisms, based on deviations from ‘ideal’ behavior of simple binding equilibria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Vary incubation time to test for equilibration</title><p>The most basic test for whether a binding reaction has reached equilibrium is that the fraction of complex formed between two molecules does not change over time. Nevertheless, the majority of papers we surveyed that present binding measurements and report apparent affinities or equilibrium dissociation constants do not report that time has been varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We first describe two related concepts that will help readers develop an intuition for the time scales of binding processes and we then apply these concepts to Puf4 binding.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Half-life</title><p>Binding and other simple kinetic processes, in general, follow exponential curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The key property of an exponential curve is that it has a constant half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>)—that is, the time it takes for the reaction to proceed from 0% to 50% complete, 50% to 75% complete, 75% to 87.5% complete, etc. is the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). After three half-lives, an exponential process is almost 90% complete (3t<sub>1/2</sub> = 87.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is close enough to equilibration for most applications. Below we adopt the more common standard of taking reactions to five half-lives, or 96.6% completion; this more conservative standard is safer given that there are multiple sources of potential error in practice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Exponential kinetics used to estimate the time needed for binding equilibration.</title><p>Arrows indicate reaction half-life t<sub>1/2</sub>.

Insufficient incubation times for tight binders may have also led to underestimation of specificity, a topic of central concern for CRISPR targeting (and for much of biology). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> illustrates how target affinities that differ by two orders of magnitude may appear identical if the incubation time is too short.</p><p>An example in which extending the incubation time changed the mechanistic interpretation comes from studies of the signal recognition particle (SRP).

While a poor fit is not sufficient to diagnose insufficient equilibration (and, conversely, a good fit does not prove complete equilibration), an inability to fit the data well to a simple binding model provides an important indicator that additional controls are required. Only after simple controls for equilibration and titration (see below) have been performed, should more complex binding models, such as cooperativity, be considered, unless such models are independently supported. Indeed, among the studies in our literature survey omitting one or both key controls, several included poorly fit binding curves. Importantly, graphs of fits of the data to a clearly defined equilibrium binding model should be published along with the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values when possible, and the quality of the fit over the entire concentration range should always be carefully assessed. In summary, the incubation time must be varied to ensure equilibration, ideally across a range of at least 10-fold.

techniques (most notably ITC) commonly operate outside the binding regime and rely on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> (or equivalent formulations) for data fitting. Importantly, the quadratic equation is only applicable to the intermediate and binding regimes, but not the titration regime. The reason for this is that at very high concentrations relative to the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, the contribution of <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in determining the fraction bound (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>) becomes negligible, and as a result a meaningful <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value cannot be extracted from the fit to the binding data. Simulated data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref> illustrate this limitation. Consequently, even when using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>, the concentration of the limiting component should be kept to a minimum to avoid the titration regime.</p><p>Where does the intermediate regime end and titration begin? The answer depends on the technique and the quality of the data. For ITC measurements, which provide highly precise information for each added binding aliquot, up to 1000-fold excess of the limiting species over the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> can be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Velázquez-Campoy et al., 2004</xref>). However, in most other cases, this limit is much lower. Simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> suggest that up to ~10-fold excess consistently allows for reasonably well-defined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values in the presence of typical binding data, and up to 100-fold excess can be useful for data with minimal noise. In contrast, performing the experiments in the binding regime (fit with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>) yields well-defined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values even with substantial noise in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Implications of the titration regime</title><p>Of the 100 literature studies we surveyed, most (65%) determined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values under the assumption of the binding regime, by using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> or equivalent analysis. Nevertheless, the required condition that the limiting species concentration be &lt;&lt;<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was not always supported. One-third of the studies using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> (n = 21) reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values that were comparable to (&lt;10-fold excess) the concentration of the trace component, including nine studies in which the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was indistinguishable from (within ~2-fold) or even below the stated trace component concentration, consistent with an intermediate or even titration regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The implication in all these cases is that the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values may underestimate the real affinities. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the extent of this underestimation post-factum without further experimental controls. To understand why, recall from the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> that in the titration regime the midpoint of the binding curve only reflects ~half the concentration of the limiting species, which sets a lower limit to the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> derived from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>, even if the real <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is much lower. Conversely, if the midpoint of the binding curve (and the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in the above cases) is approximately the same as the limiting component concentration (allowing for some uncertainty in the concentration), the real <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> could be anything below this value, from several-fold to many orders of magnitude less. As with insufficient incubation, systematic deviations of the data from the fit to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> can be a clear indicator that the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is limited by titration, but a good fit should not be considered sufficient to prove the binding regime, as experimental uncertainties and other causes can mask deviations.</p><p>High-affinity interactions are most susceptible to titration, a corollary of the simple fact that for very low <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain concentrations much lower than <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> while still allowing for detection. Since CRISPR nucleases represent some of the most widely studied high-affinity binders, we surveyed a sample of studies to determine the concentration regime under which the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values were measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Of the 15 studies, the majority (13, or 90%) assumed the binding regime in their analysis, indicated by the use of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> or equivalent. However, only two of these studies (15%) reported using labeled DNA or RNA concentrations considerably below the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, and in five cases the lowest reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was essentially identical to the labeled RNA or DNA concentration (within ~2-fold), consistent with possible titration.</p><p>Importantly, because relative affinities are typically based on the tightest binders, titration effects on the ‘wild-type’ substrate measurements can distort all specificity (relative affinity) values that are based on it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> illustrates an example, in which two substrates with a 100-fold difference in affinity appear to have identical or near-identical affinities when titration is not controlled for.</p><p>Given the impossibility of designing experiments for the binding regime a priori, without knowing the affinity, it is important to rule out titration empirically. Thus, analogously to varying time to establish equilibration, we strongly recommend systematically varying the concentration of the limiting species to establish the binding regime (or, with use of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>, the intermediate regime). The hallmark of a valid <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is that it is not affected by varying the concentration of the limiting component, whereas a titration regime would result in concentration-dependent apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values. At a minimum, this control should always be performed when the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value is comparable to the concentration of the limiting component (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>), or when <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> yields poorly defined apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values or values much lower than the limiting concentration.

Here, varying the labeled RNA concentration revealed divergent binding curves and a pronounced dependence of apparent affinity (determined by fitting the data to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>) on the concentration of RNA, the constant component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Moreover, the fits of the data to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> (solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which assumes [P]<sub>free</sub> ≈ [P]<sub>total</sub>, were poor, increasingly so for higher RNA concentrations. These data are indicative of protein depletion due to binding to labeled RNA. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values vary by five-fold across the 30-fold range of RNA concentrations used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, red circles), and even greater discrepancies would arise at higher RNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, only an upper limit of the real affinity can be extracted from these data (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> ≤ 2.3 pM, based on the fit value at the lowest RNA concentration used).</p><p>To address the limitation in our 0°C data we could, in principle, lower the concentration of labeled RNA even further, until the labeled RNA concentration is &lt;&lt;<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> and until an RNA concentration-independent regime is established. But this is difficult when binding is very tight, as a limit is set by the sensitivity of the technique used. In our case, at ~1 pM <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA we are already near the limit of reliable detection. If the concentration of the trace component cannot be lowered further, a more sensitive approach can sometimes be found. Kinetic approaches are particularly suitable for tight binders (see Appendix 1), or one can report an upper limit of the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. In some cases, increasing the salt concentration or other changes to the solution or binding partners can be used to weaken binding to make it easier to obtain affinities at higher concentrations of the labeled species; this approach can be especially valuable if one is primarily interested in the relative affinities of multiple ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschuler et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As noted earlier, the quadratic binding equation enables <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> determination for binding reactions in the intermediate regime. The quadratic equation provides a good fit to the 0°C data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, dashed lines) and yields uniform and well-defined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of ~1.9 pM across the different RNA concentrations, consistent with an intermediate (rather than titration) regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, grey circles). The same <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value was obtained from kinetic experiments, providing independent support for and confidence in this determination (Appendix 1).</p><p>In summary, we want to use the binding regime whenever possible, as it allows for the most straightforward and reliable <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> measurements. It is necessary to avoid the titration regime and caution is required in the intermediate regime. In practice, varying the concentration of both components is an essential control for ruling out titration, ruling out other potential artifacts, and ensuring the measurement of valid dissociation constants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Re-evaluating the equilibration time at 0°C</title><p>In the previous section, we mentioned the need for re-evaluating the equilibration time for Puf4 binding at 0°C after a binding regime was established.

This is especially important when using a secondary readout (vs. a direct approach) such as native gel shift or nitrocellulose filter binding, where major loss (or gain) of bound complex can potentially occur between the equilibration and detection steps (see below and Appendix 2—note 2).</p><p>Of course, there are many approaches to carrying out equilibrium binding measurements one can choose from (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Velázquez-Campoy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong and Lohman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eftink, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McDonnell, 2001</xref>). Here, we used a kinetic approach for independent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> determination for Puf4 at 25°C and 0°C, as described in Appendix 1. Kinetic measurements provide an information-rich alternative and complement to the equilibrium measurements and are often simple to carry out provided they fall within a measurable time range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pollard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulme and Trevethick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanders, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollard and De La Cruz, 2013</xref>). In case of Puf4, the affinities determined by kinetic measurements were within two-fold of those from equilibrium determinations, strongly supporting their accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Determine the fraction of active protein</title><p>The amount of bound ligand is determined not by the total protein concentration but by the concentration of total <italic>active</italic> protein. If 90% of the protein is damaged due to misfolding, aggregation, degradation or, for example, inactivated by phosphorylation at the binding interface, then the observed affinity will be that for only 10% of the total protein present—and will be ten-fold higher than the actual <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value. Moreover, if the binding-competent protein concentration is much lower than the total and therefore much closer to the limiting component concentration than expected, the binding regime may not be maintained, leading to even greater discrepancies between the real and observed <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. As a common cause of non-active or less active protein is aggregation, determining the monodispersity of the protein following purification is advisable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschuler et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we recommend, when possible, a titration experiment to determine the fraction of binding-competent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschuler et al., 2013</xref>). Here, a concentration of ligand that is much greater than the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is intentionally used and the protein concentration is varied by approximately an order of magnitude above and below the ligand concentration. To ensure accurate ligand concentration and to prevent excessive signal (if labeled ligand is used), the trace labeled ligand should be mixed with a large excess of identical unlabeled molecule at a known concentration. Assuming that the stoichiometry of the bound complex is known and that the ligand is 100% active, the breakpoint in fraction bound versus the ratio of protein to ligand indicates the amount of active protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, for a 1:1 complex, a breakpoint at a protein:RNA ratio of 2.0 suggests that half of the protein is active. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the ratio of 1.3 suggests that the Puf4 preparation is 75% active (0.75 = 1/1.3). Consequently, the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values determined in the previous sections should be multiplied by the active protein fraction (which ranged from 0.75 to 0.90 for Puf4) to determine the final <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value. In an alternative approach, the titration data could be fit to a quadratic equation, with a coefficient used to represent the active protein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Measuring the fraction of active protein by titration.</title><p>The fraction of active protein is derived from the breakpoint, that is, the intersection of linear fits to the low and high-Puf4 concentration data.

Importantly, one should always make clear whether experiments were carried out to determine ‘fraction active’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The case of no observed binding</title><p>Researchers often conclude that there is ‘no binding’—that ‘X does not bind to Y’. Typically, the underlying experimental observation is an absence of observed binding up to a certain protein (or ligand) concentration. Therefore, one should report a lower limit for the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>), rather than draw an absolute conclusion of ‘no binding’. But even an accurate lower limit often requires additional experiments, because the absence of observed binding—say in a gel shift, filter binding, or pull-down experiment—can arise either because there is no significant binding or because the complex does not withstand the assay conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pollard, 2010</xref>). While this objection may seem like a technicality, there are many instances where known binders do not give a gel shift or filter binding.</p><p>Immuno-precipitation and pull-down assays are pervasive in current biological investigations and are often interpreted in terms of ‘binding’ or ‘no binding’. But the reality of the interpretation of these experiments—and the reality of molecular interactions—is more nuanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pollard, 2010</xref>). A ligand with the same affinity, slightly lower affinity, or even higher affinity than another ligand with demonstrated binding can incorrectly be concluded to ‘not bind’.</p><p>Consider, for example, an RNA pull-down with an RNA binding protein with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 10<sup>−9</sup> M and <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> = 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; this gives <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> = 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup> or a half-life for dissociation of ~10 s. If the washing steps following a pull-down take 30 s, only ~10% of the complex is expected to remain. If the affinity is 10-fold weaker (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> = 1 s<sup>−1</sup>), then no detectable complex is likely to remain after 30 s of washing (10<sup>−13</sup> of the starting amount). Further, if another RNA ligand binds with the same affinity, but 10-fold slower (and thus also dissociating 10-fold slower; <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> = 0.01 s<sup>−1</sup>, half-life of ~100 s), most (~75%) of the complex will remain after the 30 s washing steps despite an identical <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> to the first ligand. In addition, the limited dynamic range of visual readouts of gels that are often used to evaluate pull-down experiments increases the danger of misinterpretation or overinterpretation of these experiments.</p><p>Overall, observing binding in pull-downs and related experiments is a complex function of the experimental components and conditions. This doesn’t at all mean these experiments should not be done—they often provide critical clues and insights into biology. But, for these and all experiments, we need to keep in mind the nature of the assay, and thus what can and cannot be concluded from the experiment.</p><p>Whether binding is absent or not detected can be tested by using approaches that directly report on the equilibrium between bound and unbound components in solution (e.g. ITC, fluorescence anisotropy, and other fluorescence-based techniques), as opposed to indirect approaches like native gel shift and pull-downs that are based on physically separating bound and unbound components, so that unstable complexes may fall apart prior to the detection step. Nevertheless, direct approaches also have limitations. For example, fluorescence intensity or FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) is limited at high concentrations by inner filter effects, and ITC will miss binding events when the release (or uptake) of heat upon binding is too small (i.e. the binding enthalpy is too small).</p><p>A simple way to test whether binding occurs when there is no binding signal is to carry out a competition experiment. If the ligand is bound but not detected in an approach such as native gel shift or filter binding, it will still lessen binding of another ligand for which there is an established signal. The amount lessened depends quantitatively on the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values and concentrations of each ligand, given sufficient time for equilibration. A competition experiment to obtain the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value for a weak RNA substrate of Puf4 is shown in Appendix 3, along with the binding scheme and equation to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value.</p><p>Competition binding measurements can also have a practical benefit; after an initial <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is determined for a labeled substrate, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for additional substrates can be determined by competition without labeling each substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulme and Trevethick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanders, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryder et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the increasingly multi-disciplinary nature of research, scientists are increasingly venturing into disciplines outside their expertise.

To confirm that our survey was not biased, we also scored 20 publications from a single PubMed search for ‘RNA protein binding dissociation constant’, after confirming that they reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for RNA/protein binding. Four of the 20 papers also appeared in the above list. The fractions of papers controlling for equilibration and/or titration were similar to those in the main survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): 30% of the 20 papers controlled both for equilibration and titration, 15% controlled for neither, 50% only controlled for titration and 5% only controlled for equilibration.</p><p>Equilibration was evaluated as follows. If a study reported systematically varying the incubation time, it was counted as controlled for equilibration. If dissociation kinetics were measured in addition to performing equilibrium measurements (n = 3), the study was scored as equilibration-controlled, but only if the reported incubation time was at least three half-lives based on the reported <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, and only if the kinetic and equilibrium experiments were performed at the same conditions (n = 1). Studies exclusively using approaches that intrinsically monitor the binding progress (ITC, SPR, biolayer interferometry [BLI]) also were counted as equilibration controlled. However, if several approaches were used in a given study to determine affinities for distinct binding interactions and/or conditions, and if for at least one approach time was not varied, the study was scored as not equilibration controlled. Some exceptions where equilibration can be reasonably assumed are noted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>To generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we used the incubation times reported for non-equilibration controlled binding experiments.

If two sequential incubations were performed at different temperatures (e.g. ‘10 min at room temperature and 10 min at 4°C’, n = 4), the total incubation time was used for the purposes of the survey. However, since affinity is condition-specific, only equilibration at a constant temperature can yield meaningful <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values, and two-temperature incubations should be avoided.</p><p>To evaluate if titration was controlled for, first, we confirmed if the concentration of the limiting species was systematically varied to determine effects on <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (n = 5); these studies were counted as titration controlled. If a study reported a range of concentrations of the limiting species, without stating that the effects on <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> were assessed, we did not count this as a titration control, as in practice such a range typically only indicates optimization of radioactive/fluorescent signal to account for radioactive decay and/or varying labeling efficiencies. For the remaining studies, we asked if <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref> (which assumes the binding regime) or <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> (which also allows for the intermediate regime) was used to fit the data. If no equation was indicated, or if the midpoint of the binding curve/gel signal was used to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, or if linear transformation was used in lieu of the hyperbolic fit, we counted the study as using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>. For studies using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>, we asked if the lowest apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value was in at least 10-fold excess over the limiting component concentration, in which case we counted the study as titration controlled. If a range of limiting component concentrations was reported, we used the lowest value. If only the amount (not concentration) of the limiting species was reported, the concentration was calculated based on the provided volume or, if not indicated, based on a 10 µL reaction volume; nevertheless, binding equilibria depend on concentrations, not amounts, and concentrations, in units of ‘M’, should always be indicated. If <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> was used (incl. all ITC measurements), we counted the study as titration controlled, unless the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was more than 1000-fold below the limiting species concentration (corresponding to a cutoff typically used in ITC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Velázquez-Campoy et al., 2004</xref>]). For simplicity, we assumed that all SPR/BLI measurements (where the concentration of the immobilized species is difficult to estimate and not reported) were titration controlled; nevertheless, we emphasize the importance of explicitly reporting controls for mass transport in SPR measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myszka, 1999</xref>). If multiple approaches were used, but at least in one approach titration was not controlled for according to the above criteria, the study was scored as not titration controlled, unless the affected values were corroborated by a titration-controlled approach in the same study.</p><p>If no details on the incubation time and/or the concentration of the limiting reagent were provided, but instead a previous study was cited (‘as described’, n = 4), the information for the above evaluation was obtained from the cited study.

The supernatant was loaded on a Nickel-chelating HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Bound protein was washed extensively over a shallow 10–25 mM imidazole gradient and eluted over a linear 25–500 mM gradient of imidazole. Peak Puf4 protein fractions were pooled and desalted into Buffer B (20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 50 mM KOAc, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT) using a desalting column. The His-tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with His-tagged TEV protease at 4°C, and the protein was purified on a HisTrap HP column. The flow-through was desalted into Buffer B and loaded on a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) and washed extensively with Buffer B to remove any bound RNA. Protein was eluted over a linear gradient of potassium acetate from 50 to 1000 mM. Protein fractions were pooled and desalted into Buffer C (20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mM KOAc, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20 and 2 mM DTT), concentrated and diluted two-fold with Buffer C containing 80% glycerol for final storage at −20°C. UV absorbance spectra indicated that the protein was free from significant RNA contamination (&lt;1 RNA base per protein).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA 5´-end labeling</title><p>Puf4_HO RNA (AUGUGUAUAUUAGU; Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA; 5 µM) was labeled with equimolar [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (Perkin Elmer, Inc, Boston, MA) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) and purified by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide). The RNA was eluted into TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C overnight, and the lower limit of eluted RNA concentration, assuming no unlabeled RNA, was determined by scintillation counting and calibration against the specific activity of the [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP stock used for labeling. The upper limit of RNA concentration was calculated from total RNA input and the elution buffer volume, assuming a 100% yield.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Equilibrium binding measurements</title><p>All reactions were performed in a binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-sodium or HEPES-potassium buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM DTT, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, at 25 or 0°C, as indicated. The protein and labeled RNA dilutions were prepared in binding buffer at two-times the indicated concentration and were kept on ice until the binding reactions were initiated by mixing 10 µL of protein with 10 µL of labeled RNA. The pipette tips used for mixing and aliquoting the 0°C reactions were kept on ice. The labeled RNA concentrations and incubation times are indicated in the individual figure legends. Following the incubation, 7.5 µL aliquots were moved to 5 µL of ice-cold loading buffer containing 6.25% Ficoll PM 400 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 0.075% bromophenol blue (BPB), and 2.5 µM unlabeled Puf4_HO RNA. The unlabeled RNA in the loading buffer prevented additional association to the labeled RNA from occurring during sample loading (Appendix 2—note 2). Control experiments indicated negligible re-equilibration in loading buffer (t<sub>1/2</sub> ≥ 3 hr in three independent measurements), consistent with the slow dissociation rate constant measured in binding buffer at 0°C (Appendix 1). All samples were loaded on the gel within 20 min from mixing with the loading buffer. Non-denaturing acrylamide gels (20%) were pre-run for at least 1 hr at 42 V/cm constant voltage, 4–6°C with 0.5x TBE buffer (50 mM Tris, 42 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA•Na<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.5–8.6 final) using a circulating cooling system.

After forming the complex between protein and a trace concentration of labeled RNA, a large excess of unlabeled RNA is added to the reaction. The role of the unlabeled 'chase' RNA is to bind any dissociated protein before it can re-bind the labeled RNA. Thus, the chase RNA must be in large excess of the protein concentration and must be a tight binder. The probability of rebinding can be further reduced by diluting the reaction mixture. At specified time points (t<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>), the amount of remaining complex can be determined by native gel electrophoresis or another approach.

This is because in some contexts of multi-step dissociation processes, the chase can facilitate dissociation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hadizadeh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of Puf4 dissociation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mixing scheme for measuring the dissociation rate constant.

However, we still recommend monitoring the time course of complex formation in the presence of ligand, in case binding is more complex than a single step, for example involving an additional slow conformational step (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeCuyer and Crothers, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevilacqua et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mueller-Planitz and Herschlag, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">James and Tawfik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pisareva et al., 2006</xref>). If there is a slow step preceding binding, the rate of equilibration may become limited by this slow step. For example, the formation of long-lived stable alternative structures is well known for RNA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uhlenbeck, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herschlag, 1995</xref>). Such alternative states can lead to rapid equilibrium binding for a sub-population and then slow binding as the misfolded, alternative state re-equilibrates to give partial binding or non-exponential kinetics. The following are diagnostics for these and related issues:</p><list list-type="roman-upper"><list-item><p>Association and/or dissociation kinetics do not follow a single exponential. Such more complex kinetics indicate the presence of additional species that must be identified.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Association kinetics are not first order in protein; that is, the binding rate constant is independent of protein concentration instead of the linear dependence seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2D, E</xref> and predicted by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>. This behavior indicates additional species in the binding process.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Equilibration rate constant <italic>is</italic> dependent on protein concentration, but binding does not go to completion even at saturating concentrations. E.g. if only half of a ligand is bound at saturation, that may indicate that 50% of the ligand is trapped in a long-lived conformation or covalently heterogeneous (e.g. protein ligands that are partially or heterogeneously covalently modified). Alternatively, incomplete binding can mean that the ligand dissociates during disruptive sample processing steps (see Note 2). Further tests, such as extending the incubation time, pre-incubating an RNA ligand at increased temperatures, or analysis of the labeled ligand by HPLC, gel, sedimentation, or other methods, can determine if incomplete binding is caused by a slow conformational step or by covalent heterogeneity.</p></list-item></list><p>If these situations do not apply, <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> is sufficient to determine the required equilibration time.</p></sec><sec id="s9-2"><title>Note 2: Controls for changes during sample processing in ‘indirect’ binding measurements, and approaches to prevent these changes</title><p>Techniques such as native gel shift, nitrocellulose filter binding, and any pull-down-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong and Lohman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>) involve sample processing steps between the binding incubation and detection of bound complex, and are thus ‘indirect.’ Changes in conditions during sample handling and analysis can perturb the amount of complex from that present at the end of the initial incubation. It is therefore important to control for and ideally prevent such changes, and additional confirmatory experiments, such as the kinetic experiments described in the main text, are necessary to obtain high-confidence <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values.</p><p>In the case of native gel shift experiments, following the incubation (time t<sub>1</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the sample is transferred to a gel loading buffer, containing a high-density additive such as Ficoll or glycerol to facilitate gel loading, and typically a dye, and is loaded onto a non-denaturing gel.

Using only two incubation times has the potential to give a misleading result—if binding continues to increase while, for example, protein is denaturing, these factors can cancel each other out to give apparently constant binding. It is also critical to use times that span a considerable range, preferably approaching or exceeding 10-fold; here the concern is that if the time interval is narrow, the (inevitable) measurement error can make it difficult to distinguish if measurements are or are not time-independent.</p></sec><sec id="s9-4"><title>Note 4: Uncertainty in the concentration of labeled trace binding partner</title><p>Accurately quantifying trace concentrations of labeled ligands can be a challenge, for instance, when working with radioactively labeled oligonucleotides. The concentration of labeled material can be estimated from specific activity of the isotope used for labeling. However, if labeling is incomplete and the purification procedure used after labeling does not fully separate labeled from unlabeled material, more oligonucleotide will be present than accounted for by specific activity. To be conservative, the upper limit of labeled oligonucleotide concentration should always be calculated based on the total oligonucleotide input in the labeling reaction. The concentration determined by specific activity provides a lower limit.</p><p>If not all protein is active or if the protein concentration is inaccurate, one may have false confidence of being in the excess-protein regime described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4b</xref>. Thus, although keeping the trace component at least 10-fold below the dissociation constant is a useful benchmark, we recommend always varying the trace ligand concentration (section 'Avoid the titration regime'). When possible, the concentration of active protein should be determined by titration against a known concentration of the ligand (see section 'Determine the fraction of active protein').</p></sec><sec id="s9-5"><title>Note 5: Additional factors that can affect binding-competent concentrations of protein and ligand</title><p>Depending on the system and technique, other factors can lead to concentration-dependent variation in the observed <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values.

The dissociation rate constant should be consistent across different dilution factors that give full dissociation. Incomplete dissociation (with the dissociation curve plateauing substantially above zero) most simply suggests insufficient chase (and/or dilution), which is usually readily resolved by increasing the chase concentration. Less commonly, incomplete dissociation can indicate heterogeneity of the bound complex, with a slowly dissociating sub-population remaining bound on the time scale of the experiment. In this case, increasing the chase concentration will not lead to complete dissociation, and the origins of complex heterogeneity should be investigated. Indeed, the more slowly dissociating fraction is more likely to represent a functional form, as it is more tightly associated.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Establish independence of protein concentration.</italic> While the starting fraction bound may vary depending on how far above the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> the protein concentration is, the dissociation rate constant should always be the same.

Using example binding measurements to illustrate the most relevant points, the authors provide a straightforward, practical set of guidelines in terms of a step-by-step “checklist” that can be followed to ensure acquisition of high-quality data best suited to quantitatively describe simple binding equilibria. Given the ubiquitous nature of binding measurements in the literature, including newly emerging high-throughput approaches, this manuscript addresses an important and timely topic. While there may be at least partial overlap with previously published literature on this topic, this manuscript is particularly compelling in providing an easy-to-follow set of practical guidelines exemplified with relevant binding data. The manuscript is well written and accompanied with a number of high-quality and clear illustrations. As such, the authors' approach to this important topic is highly pedagogical and should be a must-read for anyone with the ambition to quantitatively characterize binding equilibria.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the following points to further improve clarity of the manuscript:</p><p>1) While the need for the equilibration time control is clear, the requirement for changing the concentration of the second species to probe whether ligand depletion could affect Kd measurements seems to be less universal. If a Kd value, as obtained via binding experiment, is substantially larger than the concentration of the labeled species, it would not be strictly necessary to test for potential ligand depletion. It would be important to take this notion into account in the literature survey so as to indicate those cases where a titration regime could indeed be plausible. It would be useful to provide examples from the literature of Kd values that were underestimated due to ligand depletion. The authors should consider emphasizing the specific conditions where ligand depletion might be overlooked (e.g. high-affinity interactions requiring the use of particularly low concentrations of the labeled binding partner, where concentration uncertainty could play a significant role, and a very low active concentration of the protein). That said, varying the equilibration time is an extremely useful control that should be recommended, but perhaps the authors could be more specific as described above. The authors should also consider emphasizing that the inability to obtain a good fit with a hyperbolic function should be considered a serious warning sign that could indicate insufficient equilibration or ligand depletion. The requirement to rigorously report binding curves and fits could be an important part of a binding data reporting standard. In particular for indirect methods such as EMSAs, binding curves and fits are often omitted.</p><p>2) Cpf1 is discussed as an example where affinity is substantially underestimated. However, this particular example appears more complicated and likely requires factors other than insufficient incubation time to be considered: First, in one of the studies reporting a 1000-fold lower affinity, a k<sub>off</sub> of 1/(several seconds) was directly measured using a smFRET assay; Second, the experimental conditions that are known to affect binding were different in all three studies being compared, including temperature, buffer composition (specifically, divalent ions), as well as RNA and DNA sequences; Moreover, in some cases, the Cpf1 proteins were from different species (Strohkendl et al., 2018, and the study reporting the lowest affinity).</p><p>Indeed, this illustrates another common mistake when reporting or using binding affinities: treating them as constant values rather than functions of many variables, and ignoring experimental conditions and other important details when comparing the values. It would be important (and educational) to emphasize this in the manuscript, see also minor points for more details. This all being said, Cpf1 still makes a good case for the authors' main point regarding the need to prove that binding is at equilibrium, since the lack of this proof in the study reporting the lowest affinity creates a lot of confusion.</p><p>3) In Appendix 3, Weeks and Crothers, 1992 is cited for a precise competitive binding equation for the case of Kd,comp close to total concentration of P, but the solution to the quadratic equation in Weeks and Crothers does not represent a general equation for competitive binding. Instead, the same approximation as in Lin and Riggs (Kd,comp&gt;&gt;total concentration of P) is assumed and the equation is solved for theta to obtain a binding curve rather than a single point for theta=0.5. This approach should still be considered superior when compared to determining Kd,comp from a single data point since it takes all the other data of the curve into account. However, this approach still cannot be used in case of comparable affinities for competitor and labeled ligand. Instead, a general competitive binding curve should be used that represents a correct solution to the cubic equation (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7875313/">PMID:</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7875313/">7875313</ext-link>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57264.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the following points to further improve clarity of the manuscript:</p><p>1) While the need for the equilibration time control is clear, the requirement for changing the concentration of the second species to probe whether ligand depletion could affect Kd measurements seems to be less universal.

While most authors appear to be aware of the need to avoid titration, approx. one fifth of all studies used the hyperbolic equation at concentrations that violate the [P]<sub>total</sub> ≈ [P]<sub>free</sub> condition. This included several studies in which the reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was equal to or even lower than the stated limiting species concentration, putting these studies at high risk for inaccuracies that accompany <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values determined in the titration regime. In these and other cases varying the concentration of the limiting species would provide a definitive control for titration (and for other concentration-related artifacts). Further, while it becomes <italic>less</italic> likely that there are titration artifacts when reported <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values are much greater than the concentration of the second species, one typically does not know for certain if all of the added material is active or if other possible artifacts, such as contamination with another species, are present. Finally, we emphasize that our primary purpose is to make future measurements reliable, so we have tried to make the case that changes are needed in how measurements are typically or often made, without calling out individual studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to provide examples from the literature of Kd values that were underestimated due to ligand depletion.

We also amended the checklist (Appendix 4) to include questions about systematic deviations from the fit and whether binding curves are displayed. Nevertheless, it is important not to rely on the quality of fits alone (given potential noise, often sparse data points, subtle and difficult to recognize systematic deviations, or real differences from simple 1:1 binding model). In addition, it is not uncommon for authors to vary the Hill coefficient to compensate for poor fits or to show gel images and derived <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values without plots or fits of the data. We chose not to elaborate on these practices in order to focus on guidelines for correct measurements rather than on criticisms of unreliable ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cpf1 is discussed as an example where affinity is substantially underestimated.

While we recognize the potential for additional complexities, the data strongly support a dominant role of insufficient equilibration in underestimating the affinity. To respond to the first point, the kinetics data in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29735714/">PMID: 29735714</ext-link> that show rapid dissociation on the scale of seconds refer to targets with 9 mismatches (Figure 3E) or 16 mismatches (Figure S3E). For the fully complementary target, Figure 3A indicates virtually no dissociation after &gt;1 h, consistent with extremely slow equilibration. Figure 3A also suggests slow equilibration (&gt;1 h) for targets with up to 7 mismatches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the experimental conditions that are known to affect binding were different in all three studies being compared, including temperature, buffer composition (specifically, divalent ions), as well as RNA and DNA sequences; Moreover, in some cases, the Cpf1 proteins were from different species (Strohkendl et al., 2018 and the study reporting the lowest affinity).</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that affinity can vary dramatically across conditions and now address this general point in the manuscript.

Moreover, the consistency between the kinetic data in both studies (see the previous point) argues against major acceleration of equilibration in response to the small differences in conditions.</p><p>We now only mention the 1000-fold difference between the affinities reported for the same Cpf1 ortholog (AsCpf1) and do not mention the 100,000-fold difference from a study that investigated a different Cpf1 ortholog.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, this illustrates another common mistake when reporting or using binding affinities: treating them as constant values rather than functions of many variables, and ignoring experimental conditions and other important details when comparing the values.
