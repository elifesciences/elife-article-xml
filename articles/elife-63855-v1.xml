significant tricuspid valve leakage. In most cases this leakage is designated as secondary. Thus, valve dysfunction is assumed to be due to valve-extrinsic factors. We challenge this paradigm and hypothesize that the tricuspid valve maladapts in those patients rendering the valve at least partially culpable for its dysfunction. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we set out to demonstrate that the tricuspid valve maladapts in disease. To this end, we induced biventricular heart failure in sheep that developed tricuspid valve leakage. In the anterior leaflets of those animals, we investigated maladaptation on multiple scales. We demonstrated alterations on the protein and cell-level, leading to tissue growth, thickening, and stiffening. These data provide a new perspective on a poorly understood, yet highly prevalent disease. Our findings may motivate novel therapy options for many currently untreated patients with leaky tricuspid valves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sheep</kwd><kwd>heart valve</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>regurgitation</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd><kwd>disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34120028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rausch</surname><given-names>Manuel Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HL145976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meador</surname><given-names>William D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Demonstrating the tricuspid valve maladapts is critical, and understanding its regurgitation may aid in developing better treatment strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle. Its function as a check-valve depends on the well-orchestrated interplay between the three leaflets and the valveâs annular junction with the surrounding myocardium. During ventricular systole, the three leaflets coapt and seal the valve orifice, while, during diastole, they open to allow for blood to pass. Leaflet coaptation is further ensured through fibrous cords which connect the leaflets to the papillary muscles of the ventricular myocardium, akin to parachute cords that prevent leaflet prolapse into the atrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silver et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>). In tricuspid regurgitation (TR), leaflet coaptation is incomplete allowing for retrograde leakage through the valve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangieri et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Moderate to severe TR affects more than 1.6 million Americans and is an independent predictor of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taramasso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nath et al., 2004</xref>). In 85% of severe cases, TR is considered functional or secondary to right ventricular remodeling and left-sided heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dreyfus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rogers and Bolling, 2009</xref>). Here, resultant tricuspid annular dilation and papillary muscle displacement are believed to circumferentially strain and tether the valveâs leaflets, respectively, preventing proper leaflet coaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun and OâGara, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spinner et al., 2012</xref>). In other words, it is believed that constraints from valve-extrinsic conditions render the valve dysfunctional, while the valve itself is considered structurally and mechanically intact and healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meador et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, TR was historically not treated assuming that it would resolve following treatment of left-sided heartÂ disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braunwald et al., 1967</xref>). However, this conservative approach to TR has since been reconsidered and treatment strategies are more aggressive, including invasive surgical repair or replacement. Despite decades of experience with these devices and techniques, repairÂ failure rates are still as high as 10â30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">PfannmÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>). As such, TR remains a poorly understood disease with significant opportunity for therapeutic improvement.</p><p>Interestingly, on the left side of the heart, functional mitral regurgitation has been found to be not so functional after all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillam, 2008</xref>). Our group and others have shown that the mitral valve leaflets grow and remodel in functional mitral regurgitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rausch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal-Bianco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grande-Allen et al., 2005a</xref>). While leaflet growth, thatÂ is adaptation, in the mitral valve may be beneficial by increasing the coaptation area, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dal-Bianco and Levine, 2015</xref>) concomitant leaflet fibrosis, thatÂ is maladaptation, may stiffen the valve and thus impede proper kinematics and coaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grande-Allen et al., 2005b</xref>). Thus, mitral leaflet (mal)adaptation, thatÂ is both adaptation and maladaptation, plays a diametrical role. Fortunately, Levine and co-workers have demonstrated that the maladaptive, fibrotic response of the leaflets may be pharmacologically reduced without reducing their adaptive ability to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartko et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in the future, pharmacological management of mitral regurgitation targeting leaflet remodeling may support its surgical/interventional treatment and improve long-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rausch, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Similar research on the tricuspid valve is nearly absent, so much so that it has been dubbed the âforgotten valveâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stephens and Borger, 2014</xref>). Although a first study in humans demonstrated that leaflets of patients with pulmonary hypertension may increase in area, it remains unknown whether tricuspid valve leaflets similarly maladapt during functional TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afilalo et al., 2015</xref>). Whether they actively maladapt or not is ultimately important as it may, as is the case with the mitral valve, challenge the notion of TR being strictly functional. In turn, a better understanding of TR may inform improved surgical strategies or provide alternative treatment routes. Therefore, our objective was to fill this gap in knowledge and investigate whether the tricuspid valve, similarly to the mitral valve, (mal)adapts during TR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animal model outcomes</title><p>We successfully isolated 17 tricuspid valves from control (CTL) sheep and 33 tricuspid valves from sheep that underwent 19Â Â±Â 6 days of rapid pacing to induce biventricular heart failure (TIC). We included only anterior tricuspid valve leaflets in our study because the anterior leaflet has the largest major cusp of the three leaflets which allowed us to conduct all (or most) of our analyses on one and the same tissue. Furthermore, because of its tethering to the remodeling right ventricular free wall we suspected that the anterior leaflet also maladapts the most of the three leaflets. Echocardiographic data and hemodynamic data of the animals revealed significant parameter changes in TIC subjects consistent with clinical biventricular dysfunction and functional tricuspid valve regurgitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Most notably, we observed that TIC subjects had significant biventricular ejection fraction reduction, biventricular remodeling, tricuspid valve annular dilation, and increased TR severity.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Echocardiographic and hemodynamic data of animal model.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>CTL</th><th>TIC (baseline)</th><th>TIC (terminal)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Echocardiographic data</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TR grade (i.e., severity)</td><td valign="bottom">1.0 (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">0.0 (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">2.0 (1.0) * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RV EF, %</td><td valign="bottom">67.0Â Â±Â 8.6</td><td valign="bottom">58.8 (20.5)</td><td valign="bottom">48.4Â Â±Â 12.9 * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RV FAC, %</td><td valign="bottom">52.1Â Â±Â 6.0</td><td valign="bottom">53.9Â Â±Â 8.0</td><td valign="bottom">37.4Â Â±Â 8.7 * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RV IDd, cm</td><td valign="bottom">2.5Â Â±Â 0.4</td><td valign="bottom">2.6 (0.6)</td><td valign="bottom">2.9Â Â±Â 0.7 *</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">TV annulus dimension, cm</td><td valign="bottom">2.5 (0.3)</td><td valign="bottom">2.5Â Â±Â 0.4</td><td valign="bottom">3.2Â Â±Â 0.5 * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">MR grade (i.e., severity)</td><td valign="bottom">0.0 (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">0.0 (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">2.0 (1.0) * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">LV EF, %</td><td valign="bottom">55.8Â Â±Â 4.4</td><td valign="bottom">61.3Â Â±Â 6.2</td><td valign="bottom">30.0 (11.2) * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">LV IDd, cm</td><td valign="bottom">4.2Â Â±Â 0.3</td><td valign="bottom">3.7Â Â±Â 0.6</td><td valign="bottom">4.6Â Â±Â 0.4 * â </td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Hemodynamic data</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">HR, bpm</td><td>108 (11)</td><td>-</td><td>126Â Â±Â 23 *</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RV P<sub>Max</sub>, mmHg</td><td>28.8 (11.4)</td><td>-</td><td>44.0Â Â±Â 11.5 *</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RV P<sub>ES</sub>, mmHg</td><td>22.3Â Â±Â 5.6</td><td>-</td><td>35.7Â Â±Â 11.0 *</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RA P<sub>Mean</sub>, mmHg</td><td>10.5 (3.2)</td><td>-</td><td>10.6 (5.6)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">LV P<sub>Max</sub>, mmHg</td><td>96.1Â Â±Â 9.7</td><td>-</td><td>92.9Â Â±Â 13.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">LV P<sub>ES</sub>, mmHg</td><td>63.1Â Â±Â 17.8</td><td>-</td><td>64.4Â Â±Â 13.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Values are meanÂ Â±Â standard deviation or median (interquartile range).</p><p>CTLÂ =Â control, EFÂ =Â ejection fraction, ESÂ =Â end systolic, FACÂ =Â fractional area change, HRÂ =Â heart rate, IDdÂ =Â inner dimension at diastole, LVÂ =Â left ventricular, MaxÂ =Â maximal, MRÂ =Â mitral regurgitation, PÂ =Â pressure, RAÂ =Â right atrial, RVÂ =Â right ventricular, TICÂ =Â tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, TRÂ =Â tricuspid regurgitation, TVÂ =Â tricuspid valve.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>*</sup>p&lt;0.05 vs. CTL, â  p&lt;0.05 vs TIC (baseline).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Anterior leaflet area increases in TIC</title><p>Based on previous studies in the mitral and tricuspid valves, we hypothesized that anterior leaflets would increase in area in TIC animals.

Compared to CTL, TIC anterior leaflets overexpressed metabolic proteins (ENO1, ESD, ALDOA, ALDOC, ASPH, UGP2, AK1, PGK1, PGK2, PKM, LDHA, PGD, among others), serpins (A1, A5, C1, D1, and others), apolipoproteins (A1 and B), proteins related to matrix remodeling, such as COL6A3, which is tied to the alpha-chain of a type VI collagen, and FN1, GPC4, and PGLYRP1, all proteins involved in synthesis and regulation of glycans. Additionally, we found upregulation in specific proteins related to the mesenchymal phenotype, forÂ example CD14, CD163, FERMT2, PLS3, and S100A1. Finally, we found that coagulation factor F9 was highly upregulated, along with a number of complement proteins (C2, C5, C6, and others), indicating the increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators downstream. We further classified the 247 differentially expressed proteins according to their primary families and gene ontologies (i.e., protein classes, molecular functions, cellular component, and biological process). We found that these 247 differentially expressed proteins most often belonged to protein classes of metabolite interconversion enzymes, protein binding modulators, and protein modifying enzymes. Furthermore, these 247 proteins were most associated with the molecular functions of catalytic, binding, and regulatory activity. The 247 proteinsâ most common cell component were organelles, protein complexes, or membranes. Finally, the most common biological processes for these 247 proteins were metabolic, biological regulation or biogenesis (e.g., histones, ribosomal, and membrane proteins). In summary, we found 247 differentially expressed proteins in TIC anterior leaflets when compared to CTL anterior leaflets, including many proteins suggestive of increased metabolic and regulatory processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Expression of remodeling-associated cellular markers in TIC</title><p>We used marker expression in immunohistochemistry as a tool to determine regional snapshots of cell scale activity, cell phenotype, cell activation, or cell differentiation. Based on our hypothesis that anterior leaflet tissue remodels in disease, we investigated the presence of four cellular markers frequently associated with remodeling via immunohistochemistry: (i) Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±SMA), (ii) Ki67, (iii) matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), and (iv) transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal-Bianco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal-Bianco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stephens et al., 2008</xref>).

It should be noted that CTL tissues also expressed these markers, albeit to a lesser degree, likely suggesting their involvement in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Also note that, similarly to other data presented herein, immunohistochemistry stains showed heterogeneity among TIC subjects. That is, some TIC leaflets showed more positive staining than others.

In the latter setting, we and others have shown that functional mitral regurgitation is not so functional after all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rausch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal-Bianco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grande-Allen et al., 2005a</xref>). To date, we have a preliminary, theoretical framework to link mitral leaflet (mal)adaptation to functional mitral regurgitation on multiple scales. We think that pathological mitral leaflet strain following ventricular remodeling and/or cellular signaling following ischemia initiate a (mal)adaptive cascade that activates quiescent, valvular interstitial cells and leads to the transdifferentiation of native endothelial cells into myofibroblast-like synthetic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayoub et al., 2017</xref>). Activation and transdifferentiation of native cell populations subsequently increase collagen turnover, and lead to collagen reorganization, tissue thickening and stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal-Bianco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grande-Allen et al., 2005b</xref>). In turn, these tissue changes may lead to loss in coaptation competence and thus render the leaflets not passive bystanders but active contributors to functional mitral regurgitation. Our current study was inspired by those findings and sought to determine whether the tricuspid valve, too, (mal)adapts on all functional scales. To this end, we present our findings on tricuspid valve (mal)adaptation from the perspective of four different scales: protein scale, cell scale, matrix scale, and tissue scale.</p><p>On the protein scale, we have identified 247 differentially expressed proteins in TIC anterior leaflets, which we matched to several protein clusters. The increased metabolic protein expressions we observed may suggest increased energetic demands and a highly active response from valvular cells to TIC. This energy may be necessary for the synthesis of apolipoproteins, serpins and complement proteins, and matrix proteins, which all increased in expression. Increases in expression levels of such proteins have been observed in calcific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novaro et al., 2003</xref>) and stenotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Brien et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlotter et al., 2018</xref>) aortic valves. Such increases may lead to imbalances in lipid metabolism, increased inhibition of proteases such as antithrombins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janciauskiene, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanrattana et al., 2019</xref>) with consequent regulation of complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beinrohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborti et al., 2000</xref>). Overall, the proteomic data indicate that anterior leaflet cells actively respond to TIC.</p><p>On the cell scale, using immunohistochemistry we have shown that expression of markers Î±SMA, Ki67, MMP13 and TGF-Î²1 were increased in TIC. As a marker for valvular interstitial cell (VIC) activation, increased Î±SMA suggests a fibrotic response and matrix remodeling, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) consistent with our findings of increased collagen content. Conjunctively, increased MMP13 highlights extracellular turn-over activity through collagenases. While an increased Ki67 expression indicates cellular proliferation, further cellular recruitment from endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) processes is likely with increased TGF-Î²1, as TGF-Î² is a mediator of EndoMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wylie-Sears et al., 2014</xref>) and VIC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 2004</xref>) in heart valves. Despite evidence of cellular proliferation and recruitment, cellular density of our tissues remained mostly similar, perhaps due to a balance by the increase in leaflet volume (i.e., area and thickness increase) we observed. Furthermore, these cell marker changes were regionally specific suggesting a heterogeneous cellular response, perhaps due to varying regional stimuli.</p><p>On the matrix scale, we found strong evidence of increased collagen content as well as an increase in collagen dispersion, thatÂ is disorganization, near the atrialis surface. The collagen increase may be attributed to the increased fibrotic activity on the cellular scale. Regionally, we observed that collagen increases were most prominent in the near-annulus and free edge regions. Considering the proximity of the near-annulus leaflet tissue to the annulus and the abundance of chordal attachments near the leaflet free edge, we propose that annular dilation and chordal tethering resulting from ventricular remodeling mechanically deformed these regions of leaflet beyond normal physiological levels, inciting an increased profibrotic response by cells in these areas in an attempt to maintain mechanobiological homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta and Grande-Allen, 2006</xref>). Secondarily, we observed a more radially dispersed collagen orientation in the atrialis region of the leaflets. Although this may be evidence of radial collagen deposition due to increased radial leaflet stresses from chordal tethering, it is also possible that altered shear stresses from regurgitant blood flow across the atrialis surface induced this microstructural adaptation.</p><p>At the tissue scale, we observed leaflet area increase, thickening, and calf region stiffening in the radial direction. Importantly, as opposed to in vivo measurements of area increase that are taken under mechanical stress (due to chordal attachments, etc.), our measurements were taken in a mechanically stress-free state. Thus, area increase is entirely due to growth as opposed to elastic stretch. Growth was driven by increases in both width and height (although the latter was not significant). Additionally, we found that tissue calf-region stiffness increased in the radial direction and seemingly reduced in the circumferential direction. These changes may be direct responses to annular dilation and papillary muscle displacement in TIC animals that respectively alter circumferential and radial strain. In turn, altered strain may disrupt the mechanobiological equilibrium in those directions, eliciting increased collagen deposition (radial) or degradation (circumferential) in an attempt to reestablish homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta and Grande-Allen, 2006</xref>). Our stiffness results agree with our microstructural observations of increased collagen fiber dispersion in the radial direction and may suggest radial stiffening is an adaptive mechanism of the anterior leaflet. Interestingly, we did observe a significantly stiffer circumferential toe region, which may suggest a role in remodeling for elastin, which is often attributed with controlling the toe-region mechanical behavior of heart valve tissue. Additionally, tissue thickness increase may be a direct consequence of upregulated collagen deposition. However, it cannot be ruled out that thickness increase may also be due to inflammation-induced tissue swelling.</p><p>We set out to identify whether the tricuspid valve, like the mitral valve, (mal)adapts. We provide significant evidence in support of the tricuspid valveâs propensity to (mal)adapt on several scales. It does so in a qualitatively very similar way to the mitral valve. Although, direct comparison should be done with caution as our current model differs from those of mitral valve (mal)adaptation. Specifically, we found similar tissue-level, matrix-level, and cell-level changes. The most significant difference being that we did not find strong evidence for EndoMT. Specifically, we did not find CD31+ staining cells co-localized with Î±SMA, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartko et al., 2017</xref>. Similarly, we found no significant upregulation of proteins related to EndoMT in our proteomic analysis. While the reasons could be multi-fold, one possible explanation could be that EndoMT may have occurred before or after our observational period.</p><p>These findings are clinically significant. Similar findings to ours in the mitral valve have inspired the study of pharmacological treatment strategies to reduce leaflet maladaptation, thatÂ is detrimental tissue effects, while maintaining its adaptive, thatÂ is beneficial, growth. Specifically, the use of Losartan - an angiotensin II type one receptor antagonist that indirectly blocks the TGF-Î²1 phosphorylation of ERK in EndoMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wylie-Sears et al., 2014</xref>) - resulted in reduced mitral valve leaflet thickness, EndoMT, cellular activation, cell recruitment, and collagen deposition, while preserving leaflet area growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartko et al., 2017</xref>). While much remains to be understood, we hope that we have taken a first step toward similar studies that may support pharmacological treatment of TR surgery and/or intervention. Interestingly, recent work has demonstrated that not only disease, but also surgical repair may initiate mitral valve tissue (mal)adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sielicka et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the tricuspid valve, may also (mal)adapt to repair. If true, our current and future work, should focus on delineating the potentially differing mechanistic origins of tricuspid valve adaptation and maladaptation. Through such studies, we may learn how to promote the former, while preventing the latter. For example, promoting adaptive area increase of the valve could improve interventional efficacy by facilitating better leaflet coaptation. Similarly, avoiding maladaptive stiffening and thickening could prevent post-surgical repair failure. Such strategies could have broad impact by enabling optimization of both surgical repair techniques and interventional approaches, such as transcatheter annuloplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuwata et al., 2017</xref>) or leaflet clipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Naturally, our study is subject to several limitations. Regarding our animal model, we chose a tachycardia-induced biventricular heart failure model over a pulmonary hypertension model as it better represents the clinical setting of TR. That is, few patients present with isolated TR. In fact, 85â90% of severe TR cases are functional, resulting predominantly from left-sided heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangieri et al., 2017</xref>). Our model, with which we have years of experience, demonstrates all salient features of biventricular disease such as reduced left and right ventricular ejection fraction, dilated ventricles, mitral and tricuspid annular dilation, and regurgitation in both valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinowski et al., 2017</xref>). However, our ovine model develops biventricular heart failure within weeks as opposed to years as in patients. Thus, we are likely only reporting on the early response of the tricuspid leaflets to disease. As we fail to capture the late response, we ask the reader to extrapolate our findings with caution. Future studies should extend this time window. The complexity of our model is likely also reflected in our inability to find clear correlative relationships between measures of (mal)adaptation and potential (mal)adaptive stimuli, such as severity of TR or measures of right ventricular dilation. However, as our intent was to evaluate the valveâs propensity to growth and remodeling, thatÂ is (mal)adapt, in the presence of functional TR, we do not see this as a significant limitation. Nonetheless, future studies should aim to isolate the underlying mechanisms through use of other models. Finally, we focused our study only on the anterior leaflet, while the posterior and septal leaflets remain unreported on. With recent publications highlighting unique mechanical and microstructural properties between tricuspid valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>) as well as heterogeneous properties within leaflets, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laurence et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kramer et al., 2019</xref>) we suggest that future studies investigate the heterogeneity of the (mal)adaptive response in the entire tricuspid valve. Although limitations remain, they provide clear future directions for this line of research.</p><p>In conclusion, we used an ovine tachycardia-induced biventricular heart failure model to reveal that the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet (mal)adapted on multiple scales. Namely, we observed in the leaflets of these animals: (i) an active metabolic protein response suggestive of increased energy expenditure, (ii) cells native to the anterior leaflet expressed markers indicative of (mal)adaptation, (iii) upregulated collagen synthesis, (iv) reorganized collagen microstructure, (v) increased tissue thickness, (vi) increased leaflet area, and (vii) increased stiffness. As in the mitral valve, we submit that these multi-scale changes are linked. Specifically, we borrow from our understanding of the mitral valve and propose that, as pathological stimuli activate valvular interstitial cells, changes in cellular phenotype and cell proliferation likely emphasize inflammatory and profibrotic signaling pathways, which upregulate protein expression that initiates increased matrix turnover. As tissue-scale properties are dependent upon their micro-scale composition, the tissue consequently exhibits altered morphological and mechanical properties as a direct result of cellularscale activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (Ovis aries, male)</td><td>Dorset Sheep</td><td>Hunter Dorsets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hunterdorsets.com">http://www.hunterdorsets.com</ext-link>)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>(Rabbit polyclonal) anti- Î±SMA</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#:Ab5694; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2223021">AB_2223021</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:600)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>(Rabbit polyclonal) anti- Ki67</td><td>Thermo Scientific</td><td>Cat#:Rb1510-P0; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_60158">AB_60158</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>(Rabbit polyclonal) anti-MMP13</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#:Ab39012; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_776416">AB_776416</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>(Rabbit polyclonal) anti-TGFÎ²â1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#:Ab9758; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_296604">AB_296604</ext-link></td><td>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Hoechst 33342</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat#:H3570</td><td>(5 Î¼g/mL)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Total Collagen Assay Kit (Perchlorate-Free)</td><td>BioVision Incorporated</td><td>Cat#:K406</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Pierce Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit</td><td>Thermo Scientific</td><td>Cat#:23252</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ (OrientationJ)</td><td>ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>); <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744269">21744269</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014796">SCR_014796</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal model, medications, and procedures</title><p>All aspects of this research study were performed in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care, formulated by the National Society for Medical Research, and the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Science and published by the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, this protocol was developed, reviewed and performed in accordance with the approval of a local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><p>The tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy ovine model used in this study has been previously described in detail and validated as a reliable and repeatable model of biventricular heart failure in sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinowski et al., 2017</xref>). In short, we randomly assigned adult male Dorset sheep to either control (CTL, nÂ =Â 17, 59.9Â Â±Â 4.6 kg) or disease (TIC, nÂ =Â 33, 60.1Â Â±Â 5.3 kg) groups. Initially, all animals were acclimated for a 7Â day period. In all animals, we monitored baseline (i.e. prior to pacing) ventricular function and valvular competence via epicardial echocardiography. We acquired all echocardiographic images with a 1.5â3.6 MHz transducer and Vivid S6 ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). We used the American Society of Echocardiography criteria to assess valvular insufficiency. Using color flow and continuous wave Doppler, an experienced cardiologist graded TR as none (0), trace (0.5), mild (1), moderate (2), moderate-severe (3), or severe (4). We applied local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine for external right jugular intravenous (IV) catheter placement. We then initiated anesthesia (propofol 2â5 mg/kg IV), intubated, and mechanically ventilated each animal. We maintained general anesthesia via isoflurane inhalation (1%â2.5%) and fentanyl (5â20 Âµg/kg/minute). We monitored arterial blood pressure through an 18-gauge left carotid artery catheter (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC).</p><p>In TIC subjects, we sutured a monopolar pacing lead onto the lateral left ventricular wall, gaining access through a left lateral mini-thoracotomy approach (10â15 cm, fifth/sixth intercostal space) with a surgical incision approximated in standard fashion. Additionally, we infiltrated intercostal nerves with bupivacaine (0.25%). We exteriorized the lead through the thorax to a pacemaker (Consulta CRT-P, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). We stabilized the pacemaker in the subcutaneous pocket near the spine. Once the animal was breathing spontaneously, standing, and eating in the recovery area, we moved the animal to the pen. We provided prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively and postoperatively for 10 days (cefazolin 2 g IV q12H, and gentamicin 240 mg IV q24H). After 4â5 days of recovery, we initiated a progressive 180â260 beats per minute pacing protocol. During the pacing of TIC animals, we performed surveillance transthoracic echocardiography every three days to assess heart failure progression. One hour prior to each echocardiography study, we paused pacing, which was resumed at the conclusion of each study. Once both moderate TR and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fractionÂ &lt;30%) were present (19Â Â±Â 6 days), we performed a terminal epicardial echocardiograph.</p><p>During the terminal procedure of all animals, we acquired hemodynamic data over three full cardiac cycles via pressure transducers (PA4.5-X6; Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA) in the left and right ventricles via the apex, and the right atrium. We acquired cardiac pressure data and electrocardiographic recordings at 128 Hz over three cardiac cycles. We defined end-diastole as the time of the peak of the R-wave, and end-systole as the time of the maximum negative time derivative of left ventricular pressure. We euthanized all animals via sodium pentothal (100 mg/kg IV) and potassium chloride bolus (80 mEq IV). In CTL animals, the terminal procedure was performed after baseline epicardial echocardiograph. Lastly, we isolated the tricuspid valve from each animal.</p><p>For disclosure, we previously published the morphological, thickness, biaxial mechanics, and two-photon data for nÂ =Â 6 CTL sheep included in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>). However, these data were all supplemented with additional subjects for this study, as the focus of that study was to report our findings in only CTL matched subjects. Additionally, to maximize utilization of each animal model, some TIC subjects were also used in a previously published study, unrelated to the leaflet (mal)adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jazwiec et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Morphology and storage</title><p>Immediately after tricuspid valve isolation, we cut open the valve leaflet complex by separating the leaflets at the posterior-septal commissure to enable valve unfolding. We floated the tricuspid valve, atrialis side up in 1xPBS and orthogonally photographed the tricuspid valve leaflets on a calibrated grid. Using these photographs, an experienced cardiac surgeon identified the commissural points at which leaflets were separated and, using custom MATLAB code, we calculated the anterior leaflet area, major cusp width, and major cusp height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). All pixel measurements were translated to length metrics by means of the calibrated grid. We then cryogenically stored the tissue at â80Â°C in a 9:1 ratio of DMEM (VWR L0101-0500, Radnor, PA, USA):DMSO (VWR BDH1115-1LP) with protease inhibitor (ThermoFisher, A32953, Weltham, MA, USA) until further testing. Once ready to be tested, we rapidly thawed the vials in room temperature water and removed all chordae tendineae from the ventricularis surface of the anterior leaflets prior to tissue sample collection for testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>High-throughput analysis of protein expression</title><p>We used tricuspid valve anterior leaflet fragments without consideration of localization/region for high-throughput mass spectrometry analyses. We finely minced the tissues and lysed cells at 4Â°C in a buffering solution containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pHÂ =Â 7.4) supplemented with 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1%Â IGEPAL and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Active Motif, 100546). We incubated a total of six samples (nÂ =Â 3 CTL and nÂ =Â 3 TIC) with mild agitation at 4Â°C for 2 hr. We determined the total protein concentration of each sample by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo, PI-23252). After quantification, we ethanol precipitated 50 Î¼g of protein from each sample. After precipitation, we re-dissolved the proteins in Laemmli buffer for one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Coomassie blue staining and in-gel digestion, following a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>). We dehydrated the gel pieces successively in 50% and 100% acetonitrile, and digested the proteins overnight in 0.1 Î¼g sequencing-grade trypsin contained in 50 ÂµL total volume. Finally, we extracted the peptides twice in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, which we dried to completion in a vacuum centrifuge.</p><p>We submitted the dried peptides to the University of Texas at Austin CBRS Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility for protein identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using the Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano LC coupled to the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Prior to HPLC separation, we desalted the peptides using Millipore U-C18 ZipTip pipette tips following the manufacturerâs protocol. We performed a C18 trap column, followed by a 75 Âµm I.D. x 25 cm long analytical column packed with C18 3 Âµm material (Thermo Acclaim PepMap 100) running a gradient from 5â35% acetonitrile. With a Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry resolution of 120,000, and a 3 s cycle time, we acquired MS/MS in HCD ion trap mode. We uploaded the LCâMS/MS mzXML files toÂ MaxQuant (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Germany) and searched against a protein database of Ovis aries downloaded from UniProt. We used default search parameters in MaxQuant for label-free quantification with a 1% false discovery rate. We selected only the proteins which had at least two replicates of intensity values across all treatment groups for the remaining analyses. With this, we confidently identified a total of 2457 proteins. We normalized intensity values per total protein content, and we set a fold-change of two prior to analysis in the Multi-Experiment Viewer (MeV, TM4 Microarray Software Suite). Using the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistical test to compare proteins in the two groups, we identified 247 significant differentially expressed proteins. We uploaded this list of proteins onto STRING v11 (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, STRING Consortium) for the generation of protein interaction maps. We further used the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/">http://www.pantherdb.org/</ext-link>) classification system for the identification of Gene Ontologies (GO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>).

We shipped the samples to a histological service (HistoServ, Inc, Amaranth, MD) for embedding, sectioning (5 Âµm), and H and E staining. Using a light microscope (BX53 Upright Microscope, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 10x objective, we acquired and stitched full section images. Using custom MATLAB code, we fit splines to the atrialis and ventricularis surface of each section. We calculated the normal vectors along the atrialis spline, using these vectors to determine the distance between atrialis and ventricularis splines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Along the length, we summarized the thickness measurements into three regions (i.e. near-annulus, belly, and free edge), defined as three equidistant regions along the arc length of the atrialis spline.</p><p>Additionally, the commercial histological service (HistoServ, Inc, Amaranth, MD) performed four immunohistochemistry stains on the same radial strips. These stains include commonly used markers for growth and remodeling processes in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dal-Bianco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal-Bianco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stephens et al., 2008</xref>): (i) Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) (Abcam, ab5694, Cambridge, MA, US) as a marker for valvular interstitial cell (VIC) activation, (ii) Ki-67 (Thermo Scientific, rb-1510-P0, Waltham, MA, US) to determine cell proliferation, (iii) matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) (Abcam, ab39012, Cambridge, MA, US) to quantify collagenases, and (iv) transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) (Abcam, ab9758, Cambridge, MA, US) as a key profibrotic factor. Using the light microscope with a 40x objective, we acquired and stitched full section images. Using custom MATLAB code, we fit splines to the atrialis and ventricularis surface of each section. Next, we excluded regions of annular muscle, as annular muscle often skewed positive results. Furthermore, we were specifically interested in the location of these markers as regions of tissue may be differentially active, due to regionally varying stimuli and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laurence et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kramer et al., 2019</xref>). Along three equidistant length regions of the atrialis spline, again representing near-annulus, belly, and free edge regions, we interpolated 10 thickness regions between the atrialis and ventricularis splines - altogether splitting each radial strip section into 30 regions. We then passed each region of the image into a custom validated MATLAB program which detects positive and total pixels in that region, from which we determined the normalized percentage of positive stain in that region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative collagen assay</title><p>We acquired the wet mass of tissue samples from annulus, belly, and free edge regions of anterior leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). For every 10 mg of wet tissue mass, we added 100Â ÂµL dH20 for homogenization. We hydrolyzed 100Â ÂµL of homogenate in 100Â ÂµL of 10 N concentrated NaOH at 120Â°C for 1 hr, after which we neutralized by adding 100Â ÂµL of 10 N concentrated HCl. After vortex mixing at 2000x g for 5 min, we transferred 10Â ÂµL of hydrolysate to each well in triplicate, which we allowed to evaporate to dryness on a 65Â°C heating plate. We then followed the protocol provided with a total collagen assay kit (Biovision Inc, K406, Milpitas, CA, USA). From the quantitative assay, we measured the colorimetric absorbance at 560 nm with a spectrophotometer (Tecan, Infinite 200 Pro, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) which we interpolated from a collagen type I standard linear-fit curve (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.99Â Â±Â 0.01). Note: Due to tissue shortage, this experiment was supplemented with 7 CTL sheep (male, Dorset, 46Â Â±Â 6 kg) for a second cohort of control animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biaxial testing and analysis</title><p>We analyzed biaxial mechanics using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>). We isolated 7 x 7 mm square samples from the belly region of anterior leaflets, ensuring the major axes of the square aligned with the radial and circumferential directions of the leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). On the atrialis surface, we applied an approximate 3 x 3 mm grid of four ink fiducial markers in the tissue center to enable strain tracking during testing. To establish a stress-free reference configuration, we photographed these fiducial markers while the tissue floated in 1xPBS on a calibrated grid. We mounted each sample on a biaxial testing device (Biotester, Cellscale, Waterloo, ON, Canada) with rakes, ensuring the radial and circumferential axes of the tissue aligned with the axial directions of the device. After submerging the mounted samples in 37Â°C 1xPBS, we initiated a 10 cycle preconditioning force-controlled protocol to 300 mN equibiaxially. After preconditioning we removed the tissue slack with a 10 mN preload. We tested the tissue at 300 mN equibiaxially for two cycles each, during which we recorded (5 Hz) rake-to-rake distances, circumferential and radial forces, and images of the fiducial markers to compute local tissue stretches of the final downstroke. All biaxial tests were within four hours of tissue thawing.</p><p>Using the coordinates of the fiducial markers on the tissue throughout testing, we calculated the deformation gradient tensor, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, with respect to the floating stress-free reference configuration. We then calculated the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, via <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, to acquire in-plane stretches throughout testing. Using the force data, we calculated the membrane tension as the force divided by the rake-to-rake distance in the orthogonal direction in the deformed configuration at each time point. In our analysis, we characterize these nonlinear J-shaped curves with four metrics: (1) toe stiffness, as the slope of the lower linear region of the curve, (2) calf stiffness, as the slope of the upper linear region (near 20 N/m membrane tension) (3) transition stretch, as the stretch at which the heel of the J-shaped curve is located (determined as the closest data point to the intersection of toe and calf stiffness lines), and (4) anisotropy index, as the ratio between the circumferential and radial stretches at 20 N/m.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon microscopy</title><p>We analyzed the collagen microstructure and cell nuclei morphology using two-photon microscopy methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meador et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meador et al., 2020b</xref>). Briefly, post-mechanical testing, we counterstained the 7 mm x 7 mm belly tissue samples for cell nuclei (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hoechst 33342, Waltham, MA, US) for 20 min. Afterward, we optically cleared the tissue in an optical clearing solution (Glycerol:DMSO:5xPBS, 50:30:20%) under sonication for 30 min to improve imaging depth. We imaged three centrally located 500 x 500 Âµm regions through the entire tissue thickness at 10 Âµm z-steps with a two-photon microscope (Bruker, Ultima IV, Billerica, MA, US) and 20x water immersion objective (Olympus, XLUMPLFLN, Center Valley, PA, US). We imaged with a coverslip on the atrialis surface to avoid imposed stresses, and the tissue on a foil-lined glass slide to visually verify full-thickness image acquisition. We utilized second harmonic generation (SHG) at an excitation wavelength of 900 nm and fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 800 nm to image collagen and cell nuclei, respectively. We epicollected the emission signal of collagen and cell nuclei with a photomultiplier tube filter (460Â Â±Â 25 nm).</p><p>On each collagen image, we acquired coherency-based histograms of collagen fiber orientation by first normalizing the image histogram based on saturation and utilizing the ImageJ plugin OrientationJ on this processed image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rezakhaniha et al., 2012</xref>). Across the three z-stacks of each sample, we averaged and interpolated the OrientationJ output data into a single z-stack of normalized histograms from atrialis to ventricularis surfaces. From there, we fit von Mises distributions to each histogram acquiring the parameters Âµ and Îº representing the mean fiber angle and the fiber orientation concentration, respectively. Collectively, for every sample we imaged, we acquired a set of von Mises parameters representing mean fiber angles and fiber concentration at all depths. On each cell nuclei image, we acquired metrics of nuclear orientation, nuclear aspect ratio (NAR), and circularity by means of a custom MATLAB program which identifies individual nucleus contours in each image. With many nuclei in a single image, we acquire histograms of each of the three metrics at each depth of the z-stack, which we process in the same way as above. For nuclear orientation, we used von Mises distribution fits, while on NAR and circularity we fit normal distributions with parameters Âµ and Ï representing the mean and standard deviation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For all experimental data, we first performed Shapiro-Wilk tests to determine whether our data were normally distributed. Additionally, we tested whether the variances of our data sets were similar through an F-test. Under all disease versus control comparisons, a Studentâs t-test was used if the data were normally distributed and had similar variances. If these assumptions were not met, we used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test or Welchâs t-test, as appropriate. In correlations, if either variable failed the normality assumption or was ordinal in type, we used the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation. Otherwise, we used a Pearson correlation. For statistical comparisons and correlations we used either one-tailed or two-tailed tests, as appropriate, with our stated hypotheses. We defined a p-value less than 0.05 as significant. All statistical comparisons and correlations were implemented in MATLAB.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number F31HL145976 (WDM), the American Heart Association for their support under Award Number 18CDA34120028 (MKR), and internal grants from Meijer Heart and Vascular Institute at Spectrum Health.

The authors demonstrate that the tricuspid valve maladapts on multiple cellular levels, including protein and matrix, and on the overall tissue scale.</p><p>The Editors consider the results presented in this manuscript novel, unique and significant. The work contributes to the further understanding of the pathology of TR and likely will help to develop or optimize therapeutic interventions for TR in the future.</p><p>There are several issues that were raised by the Editors and the reviewers that require to be addressed before this manuscript can be considered further. The most important points are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear why only 'anterior leaflets' were considered, and not other leaflets as well.</p><p>2) Increase in area, height, width of leaflets. These data â like other data (thickness, collagen content) â have a lot of variation, in particular for TIC animals. For example, just by looking at the points on Figure 1B, the reviewer would say that perhaps half of the points have normal (control) ranges of width and height, and perhaps a quarter have normal (control) values of area. Are those valves perhaps the ones exposed to the dysfunctional TR the least amount of time (i.e. 13 days?). Are those valves consistently normal? (for example, are those the same valves showing control values for size, thickness and collagen)? Or are there valves that seem normal in one test (e.g. size) and are abnormal on another (e.g. thickness)? Please add to the Discussion.</p><p>3) There is data for which the individual valve variation is not given â like content of aSMA. Do these data present the same trends as other data (i.e. large variations), with TIC valves that look completely normal and others that do not?</p><p>4) Proteomics analysis found increases in metabolic and regulatory processes, which is expected if there is activation of VICs. It is not clear, though, why protein markers of EndoMT and matrix remodeling such as collagen where not listed (perhaps not found?). The authors suspect increased EndoMT. Could this be substantiated with proteomics results? How about increased collagen deposition â proteomics studies should find this as well, at least fractions of collagens. How about increases of some of the histology markers presented later (e.g. aSMA, MMP13)? These data would help support the authors' hypothesis as well as other data in the paper. Please add this data and comment on its significance.</p><p>5) What is the significance of the 'pockets' of TGFb1 in Figure 3? Are you suggesting that ECs in small vessels are undergoing EndoMT? Please clarify</p><p>6) In Figure 3A aSMA is clustered near the annulus and close to the atrialis surface. This is not really reflected in the heat map plots. Why not? Please clarify</p><p>7) It is mentioned that perhaps inflammation is responsible for some changes. Were inflammation markers found? Perhaps in the proteomics data? Please clarify</p><p>8) The authors are encouraged to provide more justification and/or discussion to the paper's interpretations of adaptation vs. maladaptation. For example, providing more discussion and/or justification for why one change would be an adaptation and another a maladaptation in terms of valve function and competence. Or alternatively in terms of surgical valve repair? And/or alternative in terms of transcatheter repair? This discussion would expand the potential readership of the article and its wider translation. In the reviewer's opinion, there are many areas for which the authors may be able to comment based on the current data and material.</p><p>9) The authors are encouraged to discuss to a greater degree the differences between findings for the TV vs. prior findings of the MV. This discussion may open up new areas of research or hypotheses. As the Authors generally lean towards in the paper, so much of knowledge in the MV has been just adopted for the TV with sometimes good and other times bad consequences. If specific areas differ in magnitude, trend, or otherwise, it would be a truly important finding for consideration. It may also provide a means to differentiate this paper as being in itself novel (which the reviewer believes) vs. just a reproduction of methods and results from the MV.</p><p>10) The animal model is great, and based on the data, reproducible. The model provides an excellent early window into FTR. TV disease on the other hand exists on a wide spectrum, with varying combinations of lesions, dysfunctions, severity that develop over years and decades. It's for the later that the Authors are recommended to consider a more cautious approach to some of the discussion relating to potential data implications and future study. Specific examples are pharmacological targeting, others on evaluating repairs, and future study recommendations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63855.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear why only 'anterior leaflets' were considered, and not other leaflets as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. It was important to us that all analyses, such as the mechanical, histological, immunohistochemical, 2-Photon imaging, and proteomics, were performed on tissue stemming from one and the same leaflet. Of the three leaflets, only the anterior leaflet has a cusp large enough to undergo all (or most) of our extensive analyses. Additionally, because the anterior leaflet is tethered to the right ventricular free wall, the anterior leaflet is likely the most patho-mechanically stimulated leaflet thus undergoing the most maladaptation. Notwithstanding this rationale, we agree with the reviewer and look forward to exploring the relative remodeling between the leaflets in future work. We clarify our rationale now at the beginning of the Results section:</p><p>âWe included only anterior tricuspid valve leaflets in our study because the anterior leaflet has the largest major cusp of the three leaflets which allowed us to conduct all (or most) of our analyses on one and the same tissue. Furthermore, because of its tethering to the remodeling right ventricular free wall we suspected that the anterior leaflet also maladapts the most of the three leaflets.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Increase in area, height, width of leaflets. These data â like other data (thickness, collagen content) â have a lot of variation, in particular for TIC animals.

Are those valves perhaps the ones exposed to the dysfunctional TR the least amount of time (i.e. 13 days?). Are those valves consistently normal? (for example, are those the same valves showing control values for size, thickness and collagen)? Or are there valves that seem normal in one test (e.g. size) and are abnormal on another (e.g. thickness)? Please add to the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a great question. We had the same question and thoughts. Therefore, we conducted two types of analyses. First, we tested correlations according to specific hypotheses about the origins of each remodeling phenomenon (thickness, stiffness, etc.), but found few statistically significant correlations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-E</xref>). Those that were significant are already described in the Results section (e.g., Collagen content correlated positively with TR grade, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Additionally, we took a rather crude approach in which we analyzed correlations between all measured quantities including hemodynamics measurements and geometric measurements of the ventricles. Because of the many repeated analyses, our power was naturally very low. Thus, this analysis also didnât result in significant findings. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref> for a correlative matrix that summarizes those findings. In summary, we believe that our biventricular heart failure model was an effective way to recreate the complex etiology of patients suffering from tricuspid valve regurgitation. As such, it unfortunately is also a non-transparent experimental tool in that many stimuli simultaneously acted on the leaflets creating a complex disease phenotype. In future work, we will identify other models that may be clinically less applicable but allow for isolation of stimuli, which may shed more light on the correlative/causative nature of stimuli and maladaptive phenomena. We now mention these negative findings in our limitations section of the Discussion:</p><p>âThe complexity of our model is likely also reflected in our inability to find clear correlative relationships between measures of (mal)adaptation and potential (mal)adaptive stimuli, such as severity of TR or measures of right ventricular dilation.â</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental findings do not correlate well with clinical echocardiographic metrics of disease severity.</title><p>(a-e) Correlations between echocardiography acquired metrics with experimental findings in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) subjects included (a) tricuspid anterior leaflet area v. annular dilation (Pearson), (b) tricuspid regurgitation (TR) grade v. the ratio of anterior leaflet area to annular dimension (Spearman), (c) circumferential (Circ, left) and radial (Rad, right) calf stiffness v.

That is, some TIC leaflets showed more positive staining than others.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Proteomics analysis found increases in metabolic and regulatory processes, which is expected if there is activation of VICs. It is not clear, though, why protein markers of EndoMT and matrix remodeling such as collagen where not listed (perhaps not found?). The authors suspect increased EndoMT. Could this be substantiated with proteomics results? How about increased collagen deposition â proteomics studies should find this as well, at least fractions of collagens. How about increases of some of the histology markers presented later (e.g. aSMA, MMP13)? These data would help support the authors' hypothesis as well as other data in the paper. Please add this data and comment on its significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion. In total, we found 247 genes/proteins whose expression changed statistically significant. We limited our reporting to those that created clusters, but referred the readers to a table that listed every protein. We recognize that including not only the proteins that formed clusters, but also individual ones that support our other data would have been helpful. Therefore, we are now also specifically mentioning the upregulation of genes related to matrix remodeling, such as COL6A3, which is related to the alpha-chain of a type VI collagen. Similarly, we also specifically refer to FN1, GPC4 and PGLYRP1, all proteins involved in synthesis and regulation of glycans. Similarly, we are now also reporting on the upregulation of specific proteins related to the mesenchymal phenotype, e.g., CD14, CD163, FERMT2, PLS3, and S100A1, see also response to 7. However, no proteins related to endothelial marker expression were identified. The potential reasons for this absence of findings are multi-fold, but most likely related to either lack of statistical power or mismatch in temporal occurrence. In other words, it is possible that Endo-MT had occurred before our observation time point and related soluble proteins where therefore not present anymore. We added a Discussion point to mention this potential limitation:</p><p>âSpecifically, we did not find CD31+ staining cells co-localized with Î±SMA, as reported by Bartko et al., (Bartko et al., 2017). Similarly, we found no significant upregulation of proteins related to EndoMT in our proteomic analysis. While the reasons could be multi-fold, one possible explanation could be that EndoMT may have occurred before or after our observational period.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What is the significance of the 'pockets' of TGFb1 in Figure 3? Are you suggesting that ECs in small vessels are undergoing EndoMT? Please clarify</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question and great observation. We apologize for this confusion in Figure 3. We include this observation for two reasons. First, previous studies on the mitral valve have shown that leaflet remodeling was accompanied by neovascularization. Thus, we wanted to highlight similar observations in the tricuspid valve. We believe the TGFb1 positive staining is likely related to the (possible) angiogenic signaling and therefore only indirectly a result of the tissue maladaptation. We recognize that we failed to include these remarks, and now include them in the figure legend: â(d) interstitial collection of TGF-êµ1 in âpocketâ which may be a neo-microvessel. Note, positive TGF-êµ1 staining in this pocket could be related to angiogenic signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3A aSMA is clustered near the annulus and close to the atrialis surface. This is not really reflected in the heat map plots. Why not? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The heat map indicates an almost three-fold increase in aSMA near the atrialis and near the annulus (top left rectangle). It is possible that our labelling may have caused confusion. We are NOT showing the entire leaflets in the histology images, from annulus to free edge. Instead, we are showing segments of the leaflets, which we believed best represented our findings within the heat maps. In other words, the histology images in Figure 3A show only the leaflet segment near the annulus. With this in mind, the reviewer may see that our histology images and our heat map are well aligned? We recognize that our labelling is not ideal and we added subpanels in Figure 3 to clearly indicate which part of the leaflet we are showing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is mentioned that perhaps inflammation is responsible for some changes. Were inflammation markers found? Perhaps in the proteomics data? Please clarify</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. Classic inflammatory cytokines involved in heart valve disease, such as TGFb, were not found by proteomics as they are typically present in small cellular concentrations. However, our study did find coagulation factor F9 highly up-regulated, along with a number of complement proteins (C2, C5, C6 and others), indicating the increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators downstream. We edited our text to include these findings explicitly:</p><p>âCompared to CTL, TIC anterior leaflets overexpressed metabolic proteins (ENO1, ESD, ALDOA, ALDOC, ASPH, UGP2, AK1, PGK1, PGK2, PKM, LDHA, PGD, among others), serpins (A1, A5, C1, D1, and others), apolipoproteins (A1 and B), proteins related to matrix remodeling, such as COL6A3, which is tied to the alpha-chain of a type VI collagen, and FN1, GPC4 and PGLYRP1, all proteins involved in synthesis and regulation of glycans. Additionally, we found upregulation in specific proteins related to the mesenchymal phenotype, e.g., CD14, CD163, FERMT2, PLS3, and S100A1. Finally, we found that coagulation factor F9 was highly upregulated, along with a number of complement proteins (C2, C5, C6 and others), indicating the increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators downstream.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors are encouraged to provide more justification and/or discussion to the paper's interpretations of adaptation vs. maladaptation. For example, providing more discussion and/or justification for why one change would be an adaptation and another a maladaptation in terms of valve function and competence. Or alternatively in terms of surgical valve repair? And/or alternative in terms of transcatheter repair? This discussion would expand the potential readership of the article and its wider translation. In the reviewer's opinion, there are many areas for which the authors may be able to comment based on the current data and material.</p></disp-quote><p>We much appreciate the suggestion and recognize that we have not been as clear and detailed as we could have been. We now expand our Discussion to include a perspective on what we believe the differences are and how/why there are relevant to a broader readership:</p><p>âIf true, our current and future work, should focus on delineating the potentially differing mechanistic origins of tricuspid valve adaptation and maladaptation. [â¦] Such strategies could have broad impact by enabling optimization of both surgical repair techniques and interventional approaches, such as transcatheter annuloplasty (Kuwata et al., 2017) or leaflet clipping (Fam et al., 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors are encouraged to discuss to a greater degree the differences between findings for the TV vs. prior findings of the MV. This discussion may open up new areas of research or hypotheses. As the Authors generally lean towards in the paper, so much of knowledge in the MV has been just adopted for the TV with sometimes good and other times bad consequences. If specific areas differ in magnitude, trend, or otherwise, it would be a truly important finding for consideration. It may also provide a means to differentiate this paper as being in itself novel (which the reviewer believes) vs. just a reproduction of methods and results from the MV.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. Of course the reviewer is correct in that we have taken inspiration from our own work on the mitral valve as well as that by others (especially Levine and colleagues, whom we also cite). We have now added a separate Discussion point solely designated to contrasting our findings to those in the mitral valve:</p><p>âWe set out to identify whether the tricuspid valve, like the mitral valve, (mal)adapts. [â¦] While the reasons could be multi-fold, one possible explanation could be that EndoMT may have occurred before or after our observational period.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The animal model is great, and based on the data, reproducible. The model provides an excellent early window into FTR. TV disease on the other hand exists on a wide spectrum, with varying combinations of lesions, dysfunctions, severity that develop over years and decades. It's for the later that the Authors are recommended to consider a more cautious approach to some of the discussion relating to potential data implications and future study. Specific examples are pharmacological targeting, others on evaluating repairs, and future study recommendations.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the reviewerâs words of caution. We reviewed our Discussion section and agree. We edited our limitation sections and others to be more cautious. For example:</p><p>âAs we fail to capture the late response of the tricuspid valve to disease mechanisms, we ask the reader to extrapolate our findings with caution.â Or âAlthough, direct comparison should be done with caution as our current model differs from those of mitral valve (mal)adaptation.â Or âWhile much remains to be understood, we hope that we have taken a first step toward similar studies that may support pharmacological treatment of TR surgery and/or intervention.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
