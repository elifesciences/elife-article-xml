Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signaling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity could also come with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell’s baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviorally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies that may allow cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump’s electrogenicity can open an additional axis of vulnerability that may play a role in brain disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium-potassium pump</kwd><kwd>energetics of excitable cells</kwd><kwd>cellular biophysics</kwd><kwd>network synchronization</kwd><kwd>weakly electric fish</kwd><kwd>electric-organ discharge</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03s0fv852</institution-id><institution>Einstein Stiftung Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP-2021-621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase generates a slow activity-dependent feedback signal that influences the computation of excitable cells and requires additional compensatory mechanisms during periods of high sustained activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of P-type ATPases in ancestral methanogenic archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lane and Martin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dibrova et al., 2015</xref>) also laid the foundation for the energetics of energy-intensive signaling tissues like the metazoan nervous systems billions of years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palmgren, 2023</xref>). In particular, one of the ATPases, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump, plays a significant role in charging the batteries required to operate the nervous systems that the motile life of all multicellular animals is so reliant on. The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump exchanges intracellular sodium for extracellular potassium ions in a 3:2 ratio and thereby generates a net outward current. This electrogenic property of the pump appears not only as a useful exaptation for osmoregulation in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stein, 1995</xref>), but also invokes activity-dependent changes in nerve cell excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>), mediating hyperpolarization after repetitive stimulation and firing-rate adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomas, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ritchie and Straub, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connelly, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakajima and Onodera, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sokolove and Cooke, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sawczuk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafsson and Wigström, 1983</xref>).

In the study at hand, we show that for nerve and muscle cells that need to be tonically active for long stretches of time (on the order of minutes to hours), the electrogenicity of the pump can have further, less explored consequences requiring special adaptations of the biophysical components that underlie sustained electrical activity.</p><p>Generally, it is assumed that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase instantaneously restores ionic gradients, ensuring the robustness of electrical signaling. Furthermore, it is assumed that the net current that is produced by pump activity has limited effects on spiking activity. Under these assumptions, generally, pump currents are not explicitly modeled and reversal potentials are kept constant at all times. At first glance, this seems a reasonable pragmatic approach both for the interpretation of experimental data as well as for computational models of neural dynamics. Accordingly, relatively little attention has been given to the interference between electrogenic pumping and neuronal voltage dynamics, a trend reinforced by the success of models capturing neural dynamics without pump currents, solely based on fixed ion reversal potentials, such as the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hodgkin et al., 1952</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that, contrary to this notion, electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases can exert a significant direct impact on computational properties of highly active excitable cells, and that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase electrogenicity could pose a challenge for robust spike-based signaling. For strongly active cells operating at high firing rates, additional mechanisms balancing out the pump’s effect on computation may be required, imposing extra costs on cell signaling. We present these effects in a conductance-based computational model of an excitable cell, which was extended to include dynamic ion concentrations and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. To isolate the investigated effects of the pump current and support the generalizability of this study to other cell types, the model includes only classic conductance-based sodium and potassium channels. The only active transporter is the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is responsible for maintaining ionic homeostasis. Modulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity occurs via its sensitivity to intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium concentration.</p><p>While, due to their generic nature, the described mechanisms may pose challenges for any excitable cell that has to rely on electrogenic pumps, we here showcase them in the electrocyte of the weakly electric fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joos et al., 2018</xref>), chosen because of its persistently high firing rates permanently exceeding hundreds of Hz and its, consequently, significant energetic demand. Electrocytes are the cells that make up the electric organ (EO), creating the electric field in the animal’s environment that is vital for communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunlap et al., 2017</xref>). Electrocyte firing rates, and thus the frequency of the electric organ discharge (EODf), are key for the animal’s survival: the frequency of the resulting oscillating weakly electric field can be sensed by other individuals through electroreceptor afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullock, 1982</xref>) and spans a range of 400 Hz across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hopkins, 1974</xref>). It constitutes the primary signal transmitting information about sex and hierarchy and is also used in intraspecific communication. Due to the high-frequency spiking activity and thus high ATP requirement of electroyctes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salazar et al., 2013</xref>), the EOD cannot only be expected to have been under a severe evolutionary pressure for energetic efficiency, it also exposes the cells to relatively strong electrogenic pump currents that alter cell excitability. The activity-dependent pump currents thus directly influence electrocyte firing rates, as we argue here, complicating the precise regulation of the excitable cells' activity.</p><p>Our model suggests two major effects of electrogenic pumps on computation in highly active excitable cells: (1) a significant shift in a cell’s baseline activity requiring compensation and (2) strong computational side effects of electrogenic pumping in the presence of functionally relevant input changes. While the first effect is intuitive, as electrogenic pumping permanently contributes a hyperpolarizing current that requires a compensation to keep firing-rate set points, the second effect is less so. In particular, it can result in unexpected rate changes up to a complete silencing of spiking activity in cases where a drastic firing increase was required and induce spontaneous activity where silencing was required. Even when effects are milder, causing only graded firing-rate changes but not silencing, the pump’s electrogenicity could interfere with cellular computation when spike timing is to be synchronized across excitable cells. As we show, entrainment of electrocytes by their pacemaker neurons can be disrupted in these cases, weakening the EOD and presumably impairing the fitness of weakly electric fish. Based on the identified mechanisms, we suggest a diverse set of biophysical options that may permanently mitigate the side effects of pump electrogenicity in both cases.</p><p>To do so, we first isolate the effects of pump currents on cell excitability with constant stimulation. We then demonstrate the impact of pump currents in a simple network context, when an electrocyte is driven by a pacemaker neuron. We outline the consequences of electrogenic pumping for two behaviorally relevant signals in weakly electric fish: so-called chirps (i.e. short interruptions in the EOD) and frequency rises (transient frequency sweeps). Finally, we discuss how a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, compared to a pump that adapts its rate exclusively as a function of bulk ionic concentrations and hence only on long timescales, can be useful in alleviating some of the perhaps detrimental effects of electrogenicity on cellular dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The electrogenic property of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase plays a role in the osmoregulation of single eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stein, 1995</xref>) as well as, on the organismal level, in marine osmoregulatory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung and Lin, 2006</xref>). In metazoan nerve cells, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump restores the cross-membrane ion gradients that generate resting and action potentials, whilst its electrogenicity induces a hyperpolarizing membrane current proportional to its pumping activity. The pump rate’s concentration dependence creates a negative feedback loop, leading to an increase in the hyperpolarizing current if nerve cells discharge at higher frequencies where more pumping is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomas, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ritchie and Straub, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connelly, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakajima and Onodera, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sokolove and Cooke, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sawczuk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafsson and Wigström, 1983</xref>). This feedback loop could thus reduce, terminate, or prevent overactivation. On the other hand, for nerve and muscle cells that need to be tonically active for long stretches of time (on the order of minutes to hours), the electrogenicity could pose substantial challenges, and its consequences may need to be balanced by additional mechanisms, the latter of which further restrict energetic efficiency, as we demonstrate in the following.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase affects tonic spiking</title><p>Most computational models of excitable cells follow the principles of conductance-based models for action potential (AP) generation derived by Hodgkin and Huxley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meunier and Segev, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, they assume that the compensation of the transmembrane ion currents is carried out perfectly so that reversal potentials remain constant and that the hyperpolarizing current introduced by the pump is negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hodgkin et al., 1952</xref>). An explicit inclusion of the pump into mathematical models of such cells is hence not required. To challenge this view for highly active cells, we consider the following scenario: Let’s assume that an electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is added to the Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking mechanism to compensate ion flow across the membrane. Specifically, we illustrate the effects of electrogenic pumps in an experimentally well-constrained model of the tonically active electrocyte of weakly electric fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For simplicity, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in this first case is assumed to only depend on intra- and extracellular ion concentrations as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hübel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kueh et al., 2016</xref>, and ATP levels are assumed to be sufficiently high not to impair Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Specifically, a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (described in some previous studies, see for example; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wuddel and Apell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gadsby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>), is omitted here, following the approach taken in most previous concentration-dependent models. The layer of complexity that would be added by a voltage dependence of the pump, however, is discussed in the last Results section (‘The role of Na+/K+-ATPase voltage dependence’).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In the weakly electric fish electrocyte, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase electrogenicity requires compensation, which comes at the cost of a more constrained ion channel composition and sub-optimal energetic efficiency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The weakly electric fish electrocyte is an excitable cell that locks to high-frequency input from an upstream pacemaker (left). Maintenance of ionic homeostasis is carried out by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (gray), which exchanges three intracellular sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions and thereby generates a net outward current (center). The compensation of this relatively strong pump current is crucial for faithful synchronization to pacemaker inputs (right). (<bold>B</bold>) High firing rates require significant pump activity, generating a significant hyperpolarizing pump current. (<bold>C</bold>) Increased pump activity, and thus an increased hyperpolarizing pump current, reduces cell excitability because a larger inward input current is needed to activate voltage-gated channels. (<bold>D</bold>) For a fixed physiologically relevant input current (0.63 <italic>μ</italic>A, see Methods – ‘Stimulation in the mean-driven regime’) that generates tonic firing in an excitable cell, an increase in pump current `silences' the cell.

If Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and sodium leak channels are co-expressed (<bold>E</bold>), the impact of increased pump activity on cell excitability is minimized (<bold>F, G</bold>). This is reflected in the impact of the pump current on the tuning curve (<bold>F</bold>) and the impact of the pump current on the firing rate for a fixed, physiologically relevant input current of 0.63 <italic>μ</italic>A (<bold>G</bold>).

Our model suggests that pump activity sustaining physiological electrocyte firing rates of 200–600 Hz generates a significant hyperpolarizing current, here up to 3<italic>μ</italic>A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the relatively slow dynamics of ion concentrations, on the timescale of the action-potential generation, this pump current is approximately constant. Therefore, under the assumption of a constant ion channel composition, a strong hyperpolarizing pump current will decrease the input-induced firing rate of the cell, potentially up to the extreme point of silencing it. This effect can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, there reflected in a right shift of the frequency-input curve (tuning curve) of a model with electrogenic pump relative to the model without. In other words, for a constant input that elicits high-frequency tonic spiking without this hyperpolarizing pump current, the addition of a pump current decreases a cell’s firing rate; for the strong pump currents that occur in highly active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), firing is eliminated altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To maintain high-frequency firing under physiological pump currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), very high inputs are required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These high inputs could come at a significant metabolic cost of synaptic transmission (specifically the cost related to production and packaging of AChR molecules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Squire et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, the pump-induced raise in current rheobase could be compensated for by adequate adjustments of the cell’s ion channel composition. Specifically, for an excitable cell to operate in a regime of tonic firing, the constant net outward pump current could be balanced by an additional constant inward current, which can be achieved via co-expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and, for example, sodium leak channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 3</xref>, Methods). Although we are not aware of quantitative data on the regulation of ATPase expression in electrocytes, it seems reasonable to assume that the number of pumps expressed in electrocytes scales with the average energetic demand of its spiking activity. An electrocyte that generally fires at higher rates thus requires more pumps to maintain ionic homeostasis. The discharge of the electrical organ (EOD) of <italic>E. virescens</italic> (chosen as a typical representative and whose physiology has been well quantified) approximates to the summed activity of electrocytes. Because individual fish have different baseline EODfs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hopkins, 1974</xref>), their electrocyte firing rates also differ. Energetic requirements and, consequently, pump expression levels could therefore also vary among individuals. In turn, pump current and the resulting shift in rheobase (that requires compensation) are likely to be unique for each organism. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, an appropriately chosen co-expression factor between Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and sodium leak channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 6</xref>, Methods) suffices to stabilize the rheobase for a wide range of pump currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>) which are produced within the regime of physiological firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, such a co-expression mechanism (similar to those that have been described for homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability, see for example; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Leary et al., 2013</xref>) may provide an elegant solution that allows for reliable tonic high-frequency firing with strong pump activity despite cell-to-cell differences in firing rates and pump expression levels.</p><p>The proposed co-expression mechanism not only enables reliable high-frequency firing despite electrogenic pump currents, but also compensates pump currents with minimal effects on AP shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As the overlap of the relatively constant opposing outward pump current with the compensatory inward current, which comprises one-third of the sum of all inward currents (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ20">Equation 19</xref>, Methods), results in a largely electroneutral exchange of positive ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>); however, a surprisingly high fraction of the pump’s energy is spent on pumping out sodium ions that do not directly contribute to the action potential of the cell but only compensate for the additional pump current. Therefore, the energetic efficiency of action potentials is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) because of the electrogenicity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by one third compared to the hypothetical scenario of electroneutral pumping, where no additional inward currents would be needed to enable tonic firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In absolute terms, this effect is particularly severe for systems operating at high average firing rates which require high pump densities to maintain ionic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and even higher pump densities to additionally maintain spike amplitudes (here of around 13 mV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joos et al., 2018</xref>; Appendix 1).</p><p>In a tonically active cell, the negative feedback loop that the electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase provides to enhance ionic homeostasis for action-potential firing could thus come at the cost of a more constrained ion channel composition and sub-optimal energetic efficiency (see Appendix 4 for further discussion on metabolic costs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase affects the tuning curve</title><p>As outlined above, quantitatively, the compensation required because of the pump’s electrogenicity depends on a cell’s spiking activity.

The equation also shows that replacing one-third of the potassium channels with the idealized voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase would leave the action potential shape unchanged compared to the model without pump.

Two main factors help reduce the adaptation: First, the pump current with a potassium-like voltage dependence is almost completely inactive at spiking onset (approximately –80 mV), in contrast to the fully active constant pump current. Alterations in the former pump current hence induce almost no shift in the tuning curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Second, as the pump optimally scales with membrane currents at any firing rate in the voltage-dependent case, it instantaneously leads to near-perfect homeostasis. Therefore, action-potential-induced concentration changes are minimal. In contrast to the case of a constant pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), pacemaker-induced jumps in electrocyte drive hence do not elicit a substantial firing-rate adaptation because concentrations remain largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We note that even if they would, their effect would be small due to the first argument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, suppression of synaptic inputs (like during a chirp) does not result in spontaneous firing for a pump with the described voltage dependence and a cell can be reliably ‘silenced' for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left). Furthermore, there is a fixed input-output mapping from synaptic input to firing rates in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right), which benefits the robustness of entrainment between pacemaker and electrocyte.</p><p>While it remains to be established experimentally whether Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases in electrocytes do exhibit a voltage dependence resembling the one postulated here, our thought experiment demonstrates the generic potential of a voltage dependence of pumps to mitigate negative side effects of electrogenic pumping in highly active cells and to lower the need for a costly investment into alternative compensatory measures such as the co-expression of additional ion channels, increased synaptic weights, or extracellular potassium buffering. A voltage dependence of the hypothesized ideal pump, however, does require a higher pump density. As the idealized pump’s activity is constrained to specific time windows, its peak pump rate during these periods needs to be higher. In our model, the effective pump rate during these (limited) times is elevated by a factor of four in comparison to a voltage-agnostic yet constantly active pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This brings other, potentially significant constraints, such as available membrane space and the cost of pump synthesization and transport to the table (see Appendix 4 for further discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the rarely acknowledged side effects of the electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the computational properties of a highly active spiking cell: the weakly-electric fish electrocyte. Our findings highlight that the electrogenicity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may pose challenges for robust signal processing in highly active cells; for such cells, a pump that would have evolved for the sole purpose of maintaining ionic gradients would be more efficient if it was electroneutral. We dissect the mechanisms involved and show that energy-intensive countermeasures may be required to ensure robust performance in the presence of the pump when a tonically active cell is driven by inputs of alternating mean: a perspective that is underrepresented in the current literature. Specifically, for the weakly electric fish electrocyte, where robust performance is crucial for intraspecific communication, we formulate the following testable hypotheses: (i) Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is co-expressed with ion channels that facilitate a relatively constant inward current (such as sodium leak channels), (ii) in this organism, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase dynamics have evolved to act in a voltage-dependent manner on the time scale of action potential firing, and (iii) extracellular potassium is buffered, or Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase sensitivity to this ion is reduced in comparison to that in other organisms. While analyzed in electrocytes, the model is and identified mechanisms are sufficiently generic to translate to other excitable cells across the animal kingdom operating at high firing rates, such as Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>), vestibular nuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>), and fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roth and Hu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>When Hodgkin and Huxley established their pioneering conductance-based model of action potential generation in 1952 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hodgkin et al., 1952</xref>), it was generally assumed that the sodium-potassium pump, which maintains the ionic gradient across the cell membrane, was electroneutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thomas, 1972</xref>). Their computational model, which was adapted over the following 70 years to model numerous types of excitable cells in diverse tissues and species, therefore did not include a pump current. Even later, after the 3:2 stoichiometry of the sodium-potassium pump and thus its electrogenicity were proven, the pump current was often not included in simple point-neuron models, presumably because of its relatively small amplitude and effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hodgkin and Keynes, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hodgkin and Keynes, 1956</xref>). Although this may be a suitable argument for excitable cells that are only moderately active, it is less likely to hold for cells that need to be tonically active over long periods of time. In fact, tonically active cells are expected to operate closer to the strong-activity-inducing, post-tetanic stimulation protocols used in the 1960s to render the pump current more visible by artificially increasing their effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Straub, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakajima and Takahashi, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gage and Hubbard, 1966</xref>). Additionally, the functional consequences of other, more subtle pump properties, such as its voltage dependence, have not been explored. Here, we identify a range of possible compensation mechanisms for strong pump currents and speculate that, at least theoretically, the pump itself may hold a key to rendering its effects less computationally invasive.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generalization to other cell types</title><p>In this article, two statements were made on the electrogenic pump: in highly active cells, its hyperpolarizing current can be strong enough to interfere with signal coordination, and several biophysical cell properties can be exploited to diminish this effect. Assuming that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase carries out the majority of active sodium- and potassium transport, on average, the pump current is roughly a third of the sum of all sodium currents (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ20">Equation 19</xref>, Methods). This holds for any excitable cell (under the above-mentioned assumption), regardless of their ion channel composition, channel biophysics, and additional pumps and transporters. The magnitude of the sum of sodium currents, and thus of the pump current, however, not only depends on a cell’s firing rate, but also on the dynamics of all currents that contribute to the action potential. The time separation between inward sodium and outward potassium currents, for example, dictates AP energy efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and thus the pump load. Therefore, excitable cells with different sodium channel dynamics than shown here, such as Purkinje cells with resurgent sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>), are likely to exhibit a different degree of crosstalk between the pump current and AP-generating currents, depending on the resulting redundancy in sodium and potassium flows. Moreover, although other ions such as calcium and chloride are assumed not to play a significant role in electrocyte action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari and Zakon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunlap et al., 2017</xref>), other excitable cells such as mammalian neurons have been shown to be influenced by these ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The main players in calcium removal, which is required to maintain calcium gradients, are the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strehler and Zacharias, 2001</xref>). Due to its 3:1 stoichiometry, the combined activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase effectively results in an electroneutral active transport of calcium ions. Calcium that is transported through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, however, comes with the by-product of a strong hyperpolarizing current that will induce the same effects on spiking behavior as the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase currents presented in this article. Therefore, in cells where calcium currents contribute significantly to its AP generation, the ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase to Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger expression might be crucial for cell function. The quantitative influence of other ions such as calcium and chloride is, however, to be determined in future work.</p><p>In general, we can state that as long as sodium ions are the main player in a cell’s AP generation, and if the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase carries out the majority of active sodium transport, even with additional ionic currents, a highly active cell will experience significant pump currents. We hypothesize that the presence of compensatory mechanisms to account for the pump-induced firing-rate adaptation is likely to depend on a cell’s function; if firing-rate adaptation is a desired feature (i.e. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kueh et al., 2016</xref>), compensatory mechanisms may not have evolved. In cells such as electrocytes, however, we argue that compensation of pump currents may be required.</p><p>Many biophysical mechanisms and cell properties could serve as compensatory mechanisms, of which some have been suggested and modeled in this article. Other possible compensatory mechanisms are discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulatory mechanisms</title><p>We discussed four mechanisms that may improve firing-rate control under strong electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase currents: co-expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and sodium leak channels, extracellular potassium buffering, stronger synaptic coupling, and pump voltage dependence. All of these mechanisms can treat the ‘symptoms' of electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and could be replaced by any other mechanism that achieves the same effect, that is providing an opposing current, diminishing the deviations from baseline pump currents, increasing the entrainment range of a cell, and limiting the pump activity to specific periods of the spike-generation cycle. Some alternative (incomplete list of) compensatory mechanisms that achieve the same effects are discussed below.</p><p>Opposing currents do not necessarily have to stem from a sodium leak current, but could also be achieved by other depolarizing currents, such as h-currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roth and Hu, 2020</xref>) or calcium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bean, 2007</xref>), or through the (relatively small) current that results from co-transport of H<sup>+</sup> ions by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vedovato and Gadsby, 2014</xref>). The former has previously been shown to counterbalance pump currents in the leech central pattern generator neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kueh et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, the sodium leak also does not have to result from voltage-agnostic channels, but could, for example, be facilitated by a decreased mean half-activation voltage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, which could be achieved by transcriptional regulation of channels with different splice forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). We lastly note that even though additional supposedly ‘wasteful' sodium currents might serve a secondary purpose of balancing out fluctuating currents produced via sodium-coupled transport of metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berndt and Holzhütter, 2013</xref>).</p><p>As we showed, deviations in pump currents, resulting from the susceptibility of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase to changes in firing rate, can be diminished by prolonging the timescale of the pump’s feedback on cell activity, for example via buffering of extracellular potassium. Similar effects can be obtained from volume increases in intra- and extracellular space or a weaker ion-concentration dependence of the pump. As we showed, for communication with chirps, an uncompensated pump could result in (undesired) spontaneous spiking of electrocytes. In these cases, an increase in the input current required to reach threshold (mediated by additional leak channels) can suppress such activity. Interestingly, compensation could also be provided on the behavioral level: First, an appropriate timing of communication signals, specifically an alternation between frequency rises and chirps, can alleviate undesired changes in baseline pump current due to their opposite impact on pump activity (i.e. increase versus decrease in pump rate). Second, a limitation of individual and cumulative signal duration and amplitude of chirps or frequency rises, respectively, similarly constrains effects on the pump current. This suggests that not only the evolution of ion channels is relevant for shaping communication signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zakon et al., 2006</xref>) but that also the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases may have played a significant role.</p><p>Finally, we argue that effects of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on neuronal dynamics can be partially avoided if the pump is equipped with an appropriately calibrated voltage dependence. A voltage dependence of the pump has been reported experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colina et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, the pumping process depends on many individual steps, each involving a different time scale and voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wuddel and Apell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gadsby et al., 2012</xref>). While it remains unclear whether a pump could exhibit a voltage dependence as ideal as in our thought experiment in the last Results section (in particular with respect to the restriction of its activity to periods of potassium channel activation), at least partial benefits from a modulation of pump activity along some of the qualitative principles described in the thought experiment could be expected. Future experimental investigations on the pump’s voltage dependence, in particular in highly active cells, will therefore be of interest to support or reject the hypothesis predicted from our modeling approach. Interestingly, properties of the pump’s kinetics and voltage dependence have been reported to be highly adaptable in evolution, showing a large heterogeneity in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>), including different splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blanco and Mercer, 1998</xref>) as well as a regulation via RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colina et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for disease</title><p>Several neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heinzen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rosewich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Demos et al., 2014</xref>) have been linked to mutations in the <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math><tex-math id="inft15">\begin{document}$\alpha$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. The origin of many symptoms observed in these diseases, such as epileptic seizures, lies in pathological neuronal network activity including hyperexcitability and altered oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Our modeling work elucidates one mechanism by which altered pump physiology has detrimental effects on cellular computation and can induce pathological network activity. For example, a mutation associated with the rare neurological disease Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) prevents the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase co-transport of H<sup>+</sup> ions, the latter of which normally mitigates some of the pump’s negative effects due to its depolarizing contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vedovato and Gadsby, 2014</xref>). From our work, we can conclude that the negative side effects of the pump on network computation should be exacerbated by this mutation. We also hypothesize that not only direct impairment of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to pathological electrical activity, but also deficits in the postulated compensatory mechanisms, thus opening up additional points of physiological vulnerability to pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Other factors of relevance</title><sec id="s3-4-1"><title>Reversal potentials</title><p>An increase in cellular activity reduces reversal potentials, lowering the ‘driving force' in action potential generation, and hence affects firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>); vice versa for decreases in activity.

The subcellular localization of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases is hence likely to modulate the impact of the pump’s electrogenicity on cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joos et al., 2018</xref>). Pumps located on the posterior side are likely to exhibit a more drastic effect on the firing rate of the electrocyte than those on the anterior side. We also note that potential effects of locally constrained ion concentration changes have, in the absence of data about such distributions, been neglected in our model. Constraining changes in ion concentration to specific subcellular locations could influence our results in both directions, either by local amplification or dampening of ion concentration changes (for example, via efficient local buffering).</p><p>Taken together, our study demonstrates substantial effects of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase’s electrogenicity on voltage dynamics in highly active excitable cells. While this property of the most common pump in the nervous system is assumed to serve as a mechanism preventing overexcitability, we show that it can significantly interfere with cellular voltage dynamics via the immediate effects of its highly variable, hyperpolarizing current, posing a particular challenge for highly active cells like electrocytes but perhaps also any other fast-spiking cell in nervous systems. This ultimately calls for strict regulatory mechanisms and may provide an additional evolutionary explanation for the abundance of differential ion channels and the diversity of pump isoforms expressed in excitable cell membranes to not only serve action potential generation, but also the stabilization of firing in biologically realistic environments.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All simulations were done in brian2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stimberg et al., 2019</xref>) with a time step of 0.001 ms.

If there were no Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump in an excitable cell, sodium ions would accumulate inside the cells and potassium ions would accumulate in extracellular space. This would reduce the concentration differences between ions in intra- and extracellular space, which impedes the firing of action potentials. The goal of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump is therefore to retain fixed sodium and potassium reversal potentials by maintaining ion homeostasis. This is achieved when the energetic supply, which would be the rearranging of ions by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, exactly equals the energetic demand, which is the ion displacement caused by the action potentials.</p><p>To fully understand the influence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump on cell excitability, we modeled the ion displacements of action potentials and the pump explicitly (implemented to create <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

This includes the cost of the restoration of sodium and potassium ions that flow to support action potentials, resting potentials, and postsynaptic potentials.</p><p>The co-expression of pumps and sodium leak channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and even an ideal voltage dependence of the pump (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) have a direct impact on the metabolic cost related to this ATP-fueled Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump. By integrating the net pump current over time and dividing by one elemental charge, we find the rate of ATP that is consumed for either compensatory mechanism. When compensating a relatively `constant' Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump current with sodium leak channels, the amount of ATP spent on pumping sodium is 33% higher than it would be for a voltage-dependent pump (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ23">Equation 22</xref>, Methods).</p><p>The impact that either of these compensatory mechanisms has on the whole cell, however, also depends on other costs, such as those related to cellular maintenance. A voltage-dependent pump would save costs related to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumping, which, based on energy budgets formerly estimated for AP-firing neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howarth et al., 2012</xref>), is likely to be one of the main contributors to the total metabolic cost (in cerebellar cortex, for example, amounting to &gt;50% of the total metabolic cost). Because the peak load of a voltage-dependent pump, however, is four times higher than a relatively constant pump, four times more Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps would need to be expressed on the cell membrane. To be more exact, if a single pump translocates around 450 sodium ions per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gennis, 2013</xref>), 8x10<sup>10</sup> pumps are required to support constant pumping, and 32x10<sup>10</sup> pumps are needed to support voltage-dependent pumping. If one assumes the electrocyte is a perfect cylinder, and its membrane surface were smooth (an approximation not too realistic), the total available membrane space would be 3.4 mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ban et al., 2015</xref>). If the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase expression density would be as high as in the outer medulla of rabbit kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deguchi et al., 1977</xref>), where ATPases are densely packed, a smooth electrocyte membrane would `fit' 4.2x10<sup>10</sup> pumps, which is two times less than necessary for constant pumping, and eight times less than required for voltage-dependent pumps. According to our model, therefore, the invaginations on the posterior side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ban et al., 2015</xref>) are necessary to drastically increase membrane area in order to support the large number of pumps required for ion restoration. This, in turn, would increase the `housekeeping' costs of the cell related to turnover of macromolecules, axoplasmic transport, and mitochondrial proton leak, which in different brain areas are estimated to occupy 25–50% of the total energy budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kety, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>). As there is insufficient data on the ratio between costs related to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumping and `housekeeping costs', and the fraction of housekeeping costs related to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump maintenance, a quantitative comparison of the metabolic cost of the two compensatory mechanisms remains challenging. Future experiments that would aid in answering this question could involve blockage of electrocyte Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps and comparing oxygen consumption to a control where electrocyte Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps are functional.</p><p>Another compensatory mechanism that was discussed in this article is extracellular potassium buffering (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which in electrocytes likely occurs via its extensive capillary beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ban et al., 2015</xref>) that transport excess extracellular potassium to the kidney. Assuming that an equal amount of ATP is needed in total to fuel Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps, either all in the electrocyte, or partly at the electrocyte and partly in the kidney, the additional costs incurred by the extracellular potassium buffer would be dominated by the structural and maintenance costs of the capillaries. We are, however, not aware of an accurate estimate of these costs, especially since the capillaries also have additional functions such as providing other resources and transporting other waste products.</p><p>Lastly, a strong synapse was said in the article to support cell entrainment under fluctuating pump currents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but also to incur additional metabolic costs. In the example shown in the main text, however, baseline Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> costs are smaller for a stronger synapse; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (weak synapse) vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> (strong synapse). This is the case because, similarly as shown in Figure 7B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joos et al., 2018</xref>, a weak synapse elicits smaller postsynaptic potentials, which lowers the AP peak with respect to a stronger synapse. To make a fair comparison on the metabolic costs between a weak and a strong synapse, voltage-gated sodium conductances were scaled to maintain a peak amplitude of 13 mV (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, Methods). For weak synaptic stimulation, a higher voltage-gated sodium conductance was needed to reach this peak amplitude, which, due to the excess inflow of sodium through these voltage-gated channels, resulted in an increase of 10% in ATP consumption by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps with respect to strong synaptic stimulation.</p><p>There are, however, additional costs that scale with synapse strength, such as the restoration of presynaptic calcium, the restoration of (presumably small amounts of) postsynaptic calcium, and neurotransmitter packaging and recycling. In the brain, these costs are estimated to be 0.18–1 times the cost of fueling the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps that restore the sodium ions that traverse neurotransmitter receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howarth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liotta et al., 2012</xref>). In our model, merely 11% of sodium ions enter the electrocyte via neurotransmitter receptor channels in the strong-synapse case. Assuming that the above-mentioned additional costs are equal to those related to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumping of neurotransmitter-related currents (according to the upper bound estimate by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liotta et al., 2012</xref>), a weak synapse (half the size of the strong synapse) would incur a cost increase of 5.5% and a strong synapse would incur an increase of 11%. This would, however, still result in a 4% higher cost efficiency of a strong synapse compared to a weak synapse.</p><p>There is reason to believe that the fraction of the energy budget related to the restoration of presynaptic calcium, the restoration of (presumably small amounts of) postsynaptic calcium, and neurotransmitter packaging and recycling in the electrocyte could differ significantly from those estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howarth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liotta et al., 2012</xref>. First, to the best of our knowledge, such energy budget estimations have only been done for neurons active at significantly lower firing rates than electrocytes (by a factor of approximately 100), and, second, operate mostly under the glutamate neurotransmitter, while electrocyte receptor channels are activated by acetylcholine. An accurate estimate of the impact of synapse strength on the electrocyte energy budget, therefore, requires quantitative data on the rapid dynamics of acetylcholine production in the presynaptic neuron and recycling in the synaptic cleft, which, currently, is also hard to estimate.</p><p>Supported by the above-mentioned considerations, we argue that the impact of mechanisms that compensate for Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-pump currents on an electrocyte’s metabolic cost could be significant. Due to the absence of more detailed experimental quantification, a plausible quantitative cost estimate remains beyond the scope of this article. We note, however, that although the metabolic costs of potassium buffering and synaptic strength are likely to differ between cell types, the energetic estimate of the respective ATP requirements by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps for constant vs. voltage-dependent pumping generalizes and extends to all excitable cell types (as is discussed in the Discussion in the main text, see ‘Generalization to other cell types’).</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103781.4.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Naud</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Compelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides new insights into the lesser-known effects of the sodium-potassium pump on how nerve cells process signals, particularly in highly active cells like those of weakly electric fish.

The authors suggest potential solutions that these cells could employ to circumvent these constraints.</p><p>Electrocytes are highly active or spiking (greater than 300Hz) for sustained periods (for minutes to hours), and such activity is possible due to an influx of sodium and efflux of potassium ions into these cells after each spike. The resulting ion imbalance must be restored, which in electrocytes, as with many other biological cells, is facilitated by the Na-K pumps at the expense of biological energy, i.e., ATP molecules. For each ATP molecule the pump uses, three positively charged sodium ions from the intracellular space are exchanged for two positively charged potassium ions from the extracellular space. This creates a net efflux of positive ions into the extracellular space, resulting in hyperpolarized potentials for the cell over time. For most cells, this does not pose an issue, as their firing rate is much slower, and other compensatory mechanisms and pumps can effectively restore the ion imbalances. However, in the electrocytes of weakly electric fish, which spike at exceptionally high rates, the net efflux of positive ions presents a challenge. Additionally, these cells are involved in critical communication and survival behaviors, underscoring their essential role in reliable functioning.</p><p>In a computational model, the authors test four increasingly complex solutions to the problem of counteracting the hyperpolarized states that occur due to continuous NaK pump action to sustain baseline activity. First, they propose a solution for a well-matched Na leak channel that operates in conjunction with the NaK pump, counteracting the hyperpolarizing states naturally. Their model shows that when such an orchestrated Na leak current is not included, quick changes in the firing rates could have unexpected side effects. Secondly, they study the implications of this cell in the context of chirps-a means of communication between individual fish. Here, an upstream pacemaking neuron entrains the electrocyte to spike, which ceases to produce a so-called chirp - a brief pause in the sustained activity of the electrocytes. In their model, the authors demonstrate that including the extracellular potassium buffer is necessary to obtain a reliable chirp signal. Thirdly, they tested another means of communication in which there was a sudden increase in the firing rate of the electrocyte, followed by a decay to the baseline. For this to occur reliably, the authors emphasize that a strong synaptic connection between the pacemaker neuron and the electrocyte is necessary. Finally, since these cells are energy-intensive, they hypothesize that electrocytes may have energy-efficient action potentials, for which their NaK pumps may be sensitive to the membrane voltages and perform course correction rapidly.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors extend an existing electrocyte model (Joos et al., 2018) based on the classical Hodgkin and Huxley conductance-based models of sodium and potassium currents to include the dynamics of the sodium-potassium (NaK) pump. The authors estimate the pump's properties based on reasonable assumptions related to the leak potential. Their proposed solutions are valid and may be employed by weakly electric fish. The authors explore theoretical solutions to electrosensing behavior that compound and suggest that all these solutions must be simultaneously active for the survival and behavior of the fish. This work provides a good starting point for conducting in vivo experiments to determine which of these proposed solutions the fish employ and their relative importance. The authors include testable hypotheses for their computational models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103781.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weerdmeester</surname><given-names>Liz</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schleimer</surname><given-names>Jan-Hendrik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aim to explore the effects of the electrogenic sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase) on the computational properties of highly active spiking neurons, using the weakly-electric fish electrocyte as a model system.

Experimental work is beyond the scope of our modeling-based study. However, we would like our work to serve as a framework for future experimental studies into the role of the electrogenic pump current (and its possible compensatory currents) in disease, and its role in evolution of highly specialized excitable cells (such as electrocytes).</p><p>Quantitative estimates of metabolic costs in this study are limited to the ATP that is required to fuel the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump. By integrating the net pump current over time and dividing by one elemental charge, one can find the rate of ATP that is consumed by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump for either compensatory mechanism. The difference in net pump current is thus proportional to ATP consumption, which allows for a direct comparison of the cost efficiency of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump for each proposed compensatory mechanism. The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump is however not the only ATP-consuming element in the electrocyte, and some of the compensatory mechanisms induce other costs related to cell ‘housekeeping’ or presynaptic processes. We now added a section in the appendix titled ‘Considerations on metabolic costs of compensatory mechanisms’ (section 11.4), where we provide rough estimates on the influence of the compensatory mechanisms on the total metabolic costs of the cell and membrane space occupation. Although we argue that according these rough estimates, the impact of discussed compensatory mechanisms could be significant, due to the absence of more detailed experimental quantification, a plausible quantitative cost estimate on the whole cell level remains beyond the scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I just have a few recommendations on the updated manuscript.</p><p>(1) When exploring the different roles of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the Results section, the authors employed many different models.

Meanwhile, the phase models are presented on page 29 and page 33. I would recommend that the authors clearly specify which equations correspond to each subsection of the Results section and explicitly state which equations were used to generate the data in each figure. This would help readers more easily follow the connections between the models, the results, and the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the links of the different voltage equations to the results could be expressed more explicitly in the article. All simulations were done using the ‘master equation’ expressed in Eq. 2, and the other voltage equations that are specified in the article (in the new version of the article Eqs. 13, 31, and 39) are reformulations of Eq. 2 to analytically show different properties of the voltage equation (Eq. 2). This has now been mentioned in the article when formulating the voltage equations, and the equation for the total leak current (in the new version Eq. 3) has been added for completeness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors may want to revisit their description and references concerning Eigenmannia virescens. For example, wave-type weakly electric fish (e.g., Eigenmannia) and pulse-type weakly electric fish (e.g., Gymnotus carapo) exhibit large differences, making references 52-55 may be inappropriate for subsection 4.3.1, as these studies focus on Gymnotus carapo. Additionally, even within wave-type species, chirp patterns vary. For example, Eigenmannia can exhibit short &quot;pauses&quot;-type chirps, whereas Apteronotus leptorhynchus (another waver-form fish) does not (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14692494/).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The citations and phrasing in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 have been updated to specifically refer to the weakly electric fish e. Virescens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Table on page 21: Please explain why the parameter value (13.5mM) of [Na<sup>^</sup>+]_{in} is 10 timeslarger than its value (1.35mM) in reference [26]? How does this value (13.5mM) compare with the range of variable [Na<sup>^</sup>+]_{in} in equation (6)?</p></disp-quote><p>The intracellular sodium concentration in reference [26] was reported to be 1.35 mM, but the authors also reported an extracellular sodium concentration of 120 mM, and a sodium reversal potential of 55 mV. Upon calculating the sodium reversal potential, we found that an intracellular sodium concentration of 1.35 mM would give a sodium reversal potential of 113 mV. An intracellular sodium concentration of 13.5 mM, on the other hand, leads to the reported and physiological reversal potential of 55 mV. This has now been clarified in the article, and the connection between this value and Eq. 6 (Eq. 7 in the new version) has also been clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Weerdmeester, Schleimer, and Schreiber uses computational models to present the biological constraints under which electrocytes - specialized, highly active cells that facilitate electro-sensing in weakly electric fish-may operate. The authors suggest potential solutions that these cells could employ to circumvent these constraints.</p><p>Electrocytes are highly active or spiking (greater than 300Hz) for sustained periods (for minutes to hours), and such activity is possible due to an influx of sodium and efflux of potassium ions into these cells after each spike. The resulting ion imbalance must be restored, which in electrocytes, as with many other biological cells, is facilitated by the Na-K pumps at the expense of biological energy, i.e., ATP molecules. For each ATP molecule the pump uses, three positively charged sodium ions from the intracellular space are exchanged for two positively charged potassium ions from the extracellular space. This creates a net efflux of positive ions into the extracellular space, resulting in hyperpolarized potentials for the cell over time. For most cells, this does not pose an issue, as their firing rate is much slower, and other compensatory mechanisms and pumps can effectively restore the ion imbalances. However, in the electrocytes of weakly electric fish, which spike at exceptionally high rates, the net efflux of positive ions presents a challenge. Additionally, these cells are involved in critical communication and survival behaviors, underscoring their essential role in reliable functioning.</p><p>In a computational model, the authors test four increasingly complex solutions to the problem of counteracting the hyperpolarized states that occur due to continuous NaK pump action to sustain baseline activity. First, they propose a solution for a well-matched Na leak channel that operates in conjunction with the NaK pump, counteracting the hyperpolarizing states naturally. Their model shows that when such an orchestrated Na leak current is not included, quick changes in the firing rates could have unexpected side effects. Secondly, they study the implications of this cell in the context of chirps-a means of communication between individual fish. Here, an upstream pacemaking neuron entrains the electrocyte to spike, which ceases to produce a so-called chirp - a brief pause in the sustained activity of the electrocytes. In their model, the authors demonstrate that including the extracellular potassium buffer is necessary to obtain a reliable chirp signal. Thirdly, they tested another means of communication in which there was a sudden increase in the firing rate of the electrocyte, followed by a decay to the baseline. For this to occur reliably, the authors emphasize that a strong synaptic connection between the pacemaker neuron and the electrocyte is necessary. Finally, since these cells are energy-intensive, they hypothesize that electrocytes may have energy-efficient action potentials, for which their NaK pumps may be sensitive to the membrane voltages and perform course correction rapidly.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors extend an existing electrocyte model (Joos et al., 2018) based on the classical Hodgkin and Huxley conductance-based models of sodium and potassium currents to include the dynamics of the sodium-potassium (NaK) pump. The authors estimate the pump's properties based on reasonable assumptions related to the leak potential. Their proposed solutions are valid and may be employed by weakly electric fish. The authors explore theoretical solutions to electrosensing behavior that compound and suggest that all these solutions must be simultaneously active for the survival and behavior of the fish. This work provides a good starting point for conducting in vivo experiments to determine which of these proposed solutions the fish employ and their relative importance. The authors include testable hypotheses for their computational models.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The model for action potential generation simplifies ion dynamics by considering only sodium and potassium currents, excluding other ions like calcium. The ion channels considered are assumed to be static, without any dynamic regulation such as post-translational modifications. For instance, a sodium-dependent potassium pump could modulate potassium leak and spike amplitude (Markham et al., 2013).</p><p>This work considers only the sodium-potassium (NaK) pumps to restore ion gradients. However, in many cells, several other ion pumps, exchangers, and symporters are simultaneously present and actively participate in restoring ion gradients. When sodium currents dominate action potentials, and thus when NaK pumps play a critical role, such as the case in Eigenmannia virescens, the present study is valid. However, since other biological processes may find different solutions to address the pump's non-electroneutral nature, the generalizability of the results in this work to other fast-spiking cell types is limited. For example, each spike could include a small calcium ion influx that could be buffered or extracted via a sodium-calcium exchanger.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed summary and the updated identified strengths and weaknesses. The current article indeed focuses on and isolates the interplay between sodium currents, potassium currents, and sodium-potassium pump currents. As discussed in section 5.1, in excitable cells where these currents are the main players in action-potential generation, the results presented in this article are applicable. The contribution of post-translational effects of ion channels, other ionic currents, and other active transporters and pumps, could be exciting avenues for further studies</p><p>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Thank you for addressing my comments.</p><p>All the figures are now consistent.
