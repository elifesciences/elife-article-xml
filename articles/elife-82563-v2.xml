Survival of this basidiomycete at host CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations has only recently been considered an important virulence trait. Through screening gene knockout libraries constructed in a CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant clinical strain, we found mutations leading to CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity are enriched in pathways activated by heat stress, including calcineurin, Ras1-Cdc24, cell wall integrity, and <italic>R</italic>egulator of <italic>A</italic>ce2 and <italic>M</italic>orphogenesis (RAM). Overexpression of Cbk1, the conserved terminal kinase of the RAM pathway, partially restored defects of these mutants at host CO<sub>2</sub> or temperature levels. In ascomycetes such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, transcription factor Ace2 is an important target of Cbk1, activating genes responsible for cell separation. However, no Ace2 homolog or any downstream component of the RAM pathway has been identified in basidiomycetes. Through in vitro evolution and comparative genomics, we characterized mutations in suppressors of <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> that partially rescued defects in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance, thermotolerance, and morphology. One suppressor is the RNA translation repressor Ssd1, which is highly conserved in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The other is a novel ribonuclease domain-containing protein, here named <italic>PSC1</italic>, which is present in basidiomycetes and humans but surprisingly absent in most ascomycetes. Loss of Ssd1 in <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ partially restored cryptococcal ability to survive and amplify in the inhalation and intravenous murine models of cryptococcosis. Our discoveries highlight the overlapping regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance and thermotolerance, the essential role of the RAM pathway in cryptococcal adaptation to the host condition, and the potential importance of post-transcriptional control of virulence traits in this global pathogen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>suppressor screen</kwd><kwd>medical mycology</kwd><kwd>virulence traits</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI147541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krysan</surname><given-names>Damian J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xiaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI140719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Xiaorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the fungal pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans,</italic> the RAM pathway, potentially through post-transcriptional regulation, plays an essential role in adaptation to host temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are over 278,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis every year, causing over 180,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajasingham et al., 2017</xref>). Cryptococcal meningitis is primarily caused by the ubiquitous environmental fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>. Airborne spores or desiccated yeast cells of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are inhaled into the lungs, where they are cleared or remain dormant until reactivation upon host immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casadevall and Perfect, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Litvintseva et al. found that most environmental <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> isolates cannot cause fatal disease in mouse models of cryptococcosis, despite having similar genotypes and in vitro phenotypes to known virulent isolates, including thermotolerance, melanization, and capsule production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litvintseva and Mitchell, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukaremera et al., 2019</xref> also observed that in vitro phenotype assays for thermotolerance, capsule production, titan cell formation, or fluconazole heteroresistance could not differentiate high-virulence strains from low-virulence strains. These observations raise the possibility that other, unidentified virulence traits are important for <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> pathogenesis. Tolerance to host levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (~5% CO<sub>2</sub> in the host vs. ~0.04% in ambient air) is likely a significant factor separating the potentially virulent natural isolates from the non-pathogenic environmental isolates that Litvintseva et al. tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krysan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Litvintseva and Mitchell, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The ability to adapt to host conditions is a prerequisite for cryptococcal pathogenesis. For instance, the ability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to replicate at human body temperature (≥37°C) has been extensively investigated. Many genes have been shown to be essential for thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perfect, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stempinski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), including calcineurin which is currently being explored for antifungal drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gobeil et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, the underlying mechanisms or genes that play a role in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance have yet to be identified. Here, we set out to identify CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive mutants and to gain the first insight into the genetic components involved in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is independent of pH</title><p>Our previous work indicates that many <italic>C. neoformans</italic> environmental strains are sensitive to 5% CO<sub>2</sub> when grown on buffered RPMI media, commonly used for mammalian cell cultures and testing antifungal susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krysan et al., 2019</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> at host concentrations also acts synergistically with the commonly used antifungal drug fluconazole in inhibiting cryptococcal growth on buffered RPMI media. Because CO<sub>2</sub> lowers the pH of aqueous environments, it is possible that the CO<sub>2</sub> growth inhibitory effect or its synergy with fluconazole is simply due to lower medium pH. To address this question, we tested sensitivity to fluconazole of wild-type (WT) strain H99 using E-test on buffered RPMI media of either pH 6 or pH 7, with or without 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In this E-test, the size of halo (clearance zone) reflects fungal susceptibility to fluconazole. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, clearance zones were much larger in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> relative to those in ambient air at both pH 6 and pH 7, indicating that CO<sub>2</sub> sensitizes cryptococcal susceptibility to fluconazole. Furthermore, CO<sub>2</sub> inhibits the growth of H99 at both pH 6 and pH 7 (smaller colony size in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> relative to that in ambient air). Additionally, growth of CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive environmental strain A7-35-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krysan et al., 2019</xref>) was severely inhibited by 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at both pH 6 and pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In general, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> grows better at acidic pH (can grow well in pH 3), and both A7-35-23 and H99 grew better at pH 6 than at pH 7 in ambient air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that cryptococcal growth inhibition by CO<sub>2</sub> is not simply due to lowered pH.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is not simply due to lowered medium pH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H99 cells were plated onto RPMI solid medium buffered to either pH 6 or pH 7. Fluconazole containing E-test strips were placed onto the lawn of H99 cells, and the plates were incubated at 37°C in ambient air or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The larger the halo surrounding the E-strip, the more sensitive the cells are to fluconazole. The intercept value of the halo with the E-strip is the minimal inhibitory concentration. (<bold>B</bold>) Cells of the previously identified CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant H99 and CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive A7-35-23 were serial diluted, spotted onto RPMI media buffered to pH 6 or pH 7, and incubated at 37°C in ambient air or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82563-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying genes important for CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance</title><p>To identify genes involved in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, we screened gene deletion mutants constructed in the CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant clinical reference strain H99. For large-scale screening, we used the nutrient rich yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium on which <italic>C. neoformans</italic> grows well. Accordingly, we tested the growth of two CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive environmental strains and the CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant H99 strain in different levels of CO<sub>2</sub> when cultured on YPD. As expected, relative to H99, the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive strains A7-35-23 and A1-38-2 grew poorly at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and worse at 20% CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using this approach, the following deletion mutant libraries were screened at 20% CO<sub>2</sub> on YPD media: a set of strains previously constructed in our lab, the collections constructed by the Madhani lab, and a set generated in the Lodge Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chun and Madhani, 2010</xref>). As some mutants are known to be temperature sensitive, we carried out the screens at 30°C rather than 37°C. From over 5000 gene knockout mutants screened (~7000 protein coding genes in the H99 genome), 96 were found to be sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> by visual observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We noticed that knockout mutants for multiple pathways known to be activated by heat stress are CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive, including the Ras1-Cdc24 pathway, calcineurin, cell wall integrity (CWI), and <italic>R</italic>egulator of <italic>A</italic>ce2 and <italic>M</italic>orphogenesis (RAM).

In <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the adenylyl cyclase pathway is crucial for the yeast-hypha transition in response to host levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klengel et al., 2005</xref>). This pathway has also been proposed to play an important role for <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> to sense CO<sub>2</sub>, and the carbonic anhydrase Can1 is required for growth at low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mogensen et al., 2006</xref>). However, we found that adenylyl cyclase pathway mutants showed no growth defects at host levels CO<sub>2</sub>, including the adenylyl cyclase mutant <italic>cac1</italic>Δ, the adenylyl cyclase associated protein mutant <italic>aca1</italic>Δ, the alpha G protein subunit mutant <italic>gpa1</italic>Δ, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase mutant <italic>pkr1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that growth defects in response to host levels of CO<sub>2</sub> are likely independent of bicarbonate activation of adenylyl cyclase. This is not unexpected given that bicarbonate is not a limiting factor under the high level of CO<sub>2</sub> used in our screen.</p><p>Because the calcineurin, Ras1-Cdc24, CWI, and RAM pathways are all activated at host temperature and were identified in our screen for CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive mutants, we reasoned their downstream effectors may be related or genetically interact. As the RAM pathway effector kinase mutant <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ showed the most severe defect in thermotolerance and CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance compared to the mutants of the other pathways, we first overexpressed the gene <italic>CBK1</italic> in the following mutants, <italic>cdc24</italic>Δ (Ras1-Cdc24), <italic>mpk1</italic>Δ (CWI), <italic>cna1</italic>Δ (Calcineurin), and the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant itself and observed their growth at host temperature and host CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Overexpression was achieved by placing the <italic>CBK1</italic> open reading frame after the inducible <italic>CTR4</italic> promoter, which is highly activated in YPD media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ory et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>CBK1</italic> overexpression construct was specifically integrated into the ‘safe haven’ locus <italic>SH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Upadhya et al., 2017</xref>) in each mutant strain background to avoid complications due to positional effects. We additionally confirmed overexpression of <italic>CBK1</italic> by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, the growth defects of the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant at 37°C with and without 5% CO<sub>2</sub> were largely restored by <italic>CBK1</italic> overexpression. At 30°C, overexpression of <italic>CBK1</italic> restored the growth of the <italic>mpk1</italic>Δ mutant, the <italic>cna1</italic>Δ mutant, and the <italic>cdc24</italic>Δ mutant in the CO<sub>2</sub> condition. In terms of thermotolerance, overexpression of <italic>CBK1</italic> restored growth of <italic>mpk1</italic>Δ but not <italic>cna1</italic>Δ, while the growth defect of <italic>cdc24</italic>Δ at 37°C was exacerbated. <italic>CBK1</italic> overexpression failed to rescue growth of any of these mutants when both stressors were present (37°C+5% CO<sub>2</sub>). We found that overexpression of <italic>CBK1</italic> in the WT H99 background caused a modest growth defect at 37°C+5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the detrimental effects from <italic>CBK1</italic> overexpression under this growth condition may partially explain its inability to fully rescue growth of these tested CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive mutants. The reciprocal overexpression of <italic>CDC24</italic>, <italic>MPK1</italic>, or <italic>CNA1</italic> in the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant background did not restore growth under 37°C and/or 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results support a hypothesis that Cbk1 integrates multiple stress response pathways to regulate both CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance and thermotolerance.</p><p>To determine the extent of Cbk1’s role in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance, we conducted NanoString gene expression profiling of the WT H99 and <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant cultured in ambient air and in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Transcript levels of 118 genes were measured, and those genes were chosen based on RNA sequencing results from a separate study (Ristow et al., in preparation). In that study, these genes were differentially expressed in CO<sub>2</sub> vs. ambient air conditions in either two CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive or two CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant natural strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Out of these 118 CO<sub>2</sub>-associated genes, 81 were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant in both ambient air and in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating they are intrinsically dysregulated in the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant. 57/81 of these genes are downregulated and 24/81 upregulated compared to the WT H99 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, 16/57 of the downregulated genes were also hits in our deletion set screening. We picked four of these deletion mutants which showed high sensitivity in our screen, to assay their sensitivity to host CO<sub>2</sub> conditions by spotting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In this intranasal infection model, the WT H99 strain establishes lung infection first and typically disseminates to other organs including the brain by 7–10 days post-infection (DPI). Mice infected by H99 normally become morbidly ill by 3–4 weeks post-infection and have a high fungal burden in the lungs, brain, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chadwick and Lin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>As expected, all mice infected with H99 were moribund by DPI 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), while those infected with the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant survived until the experiment was terminated at DPI 60. Surprisingly, <italic>sup1</italic> and <italic>sup2</italic> strains did not cause any mortality either. The organ fungal burden, however, revealed differences in virulence levels between these strains. At the time of euthanasia for H99-infected mice (prior to DPI 26), the median fungal burden in the lungs, brains, and kidneys was 2.1×10<sup>8</sup>, 1.4×10<sup>6</sup>, and 2.4×10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs) per organ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In comparison, although <italic>sup2</italic> did not cause any death during the study period, it was able to replicate in the mouse lungs. The median lung fungal burden at DPI 35 was 8.2×10<sup>4</sup>, over eightfold higher than the original inoculum.

We considered two hypotheses: (1) inability of suppressor <italic>sup2</italic> to disseminate from the lungs; (2) inability of suppressor <italic>sup2</italic> to penetrate other organs from the blood. Because <italic>C. neoformans</italic> can disseminate from the lungs to other organs by a ‘Trojan Horse’ mechanism, where <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> travels within the mobile host phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kechichian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santiago-Tirado et al., 2017</xref>), we examined phagocytosis of the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant and its suppressors to test the first hypothesis. We expected that cryptococcal mutants defective in being phagocytosed by host cells might be defective in dissemination, and the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant was previously found to have a poor phagocytosis index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>).

Because different types of opsonization can impact phagocytosis of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, opsonization was performed using either naïve mouse serum (complement mediated phagocytosis) or serum from mice vaccinated against cryptococcosis (complement+antibody mediated phagocytosis). The serum (containing antibodies) from the vaccinated mice recognizes antigens present in the capsule of cryptococcal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with our previous finding, phagocytosis of the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant was extremely low (~1% of the WT H99 level under complement mediated phagocytosis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Opsonization with serum from vaccinated mice increased phagocytosis of <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ and the suppressor mutants, but the phagocytosis indexes of these mutants were still only 20% or less than that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In both phagocytosis experiments, the suppressor mutants or the double mutants <italic>cbk1</italic>∆<italic>ssd1</italic>∆ and <italic>cbk1</italic>∆<italic>psc1</italic>∆ mutants showed increased phagocytosis relative to the <italic>cbk1</italic>∆ mutant. The poor phagocytosis of the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant and its suppressors may contribute to their lack of dissemination from the lungs to the other organs in the inhalation infection mouse model of cryptococcosis.</p><p>To test the second hypothesis, we infected mice intravenously with H99, <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ, <italic>sup1</italic>, <italic>sup2</italic>, the double mutant <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ<italic>ssd1</italic>Δ, or the control single mutant <italic>ssd1</italic>Δ. In this intravenous infection model, the barrier of the lungs is bypassed. H99 cells disseminate to the brain and other organs within hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Connor et al., 2013</xref>). Because H99 rapidly disseminates in this model, infected mice typically reach moribundity after 1 week. Therefore, we euthanized mice at DPI 5 before H99-infected mice would have become moribund. As expected, H99-infected mice showed high fungal burdens in the lungs, brains, and kidneys, with the highest fungal burden in the brain (over 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant failed to disseminate in this intravenous infection model as no viable cells were recovered in any organ. Similarly, we could not recover any <italic>sup1</italic> cells from the lungs or the brain and only detected a few fungal cells in the kidney. In contrast, <italic>sup2</italic> suppressor mutants were recovered in all three organs, albeit with reduced fungal burdens (~10<sup>4</sup> CFUs in the brain and a few hundred in lungs/kidney) compared to the WT H99 control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This finding indicates that the <italic>sup2</italic> suppressor, once disseminated into the bloodstream, can invade other organs and replicate. Combined with the earlier observations that (1) both suppressors fully restore growth at host temperature and (2) <italic>sup2</italic> is slightly more CO<sub>2</sub> tolerant than <italic>sup1</italic>, the observation that only <italic>sup2</italic> can survive, amplify, and persist in animals implicates an importance of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance in cryptococcal pathogenesis. Collectively, the results from phagocytosis, the inhalation infection model, and the intravenous infection model support the hypothesis that failure of the suppressor mutants to disseminate to other organs in the intranasal model is largely due to reduced phagocytosis and inability to escape the lungs. That said, other factors, such as increased systemic clearance by the immune system, could potentially contribute to the containment of the mutant in the lungs. Again, the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ<italic>ssd1</italic>Δ mutant recapitulated the phenotype of the <italic>sup2</italic> strain in intravenous infection model and other in vitro assays, demonstrating that our observed <italic>sup2</italic> phenotypes are due to disruption of <italic>SSD1</italic>.</p><p>As mutants that are temperature sensitive have reduced virulence in the mouse model of cryptococcosis, we decided to test the virulence of these strains in the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae infection model to remove temperature as a variable.

To further confirm the observed differences between these strains in this model conducted at 30°C, we infected five larvae with 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per strain and measured their fungal burden at day 5 post-inoculation. At DPI 5, the mean fungal burden of WT-infected larvae was 1.5×10<sup>7</sup> CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In comparison, the mean fungal burden for the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ-infected larvae was only 8.4×10<sup>2</sup> CFUs, which is almost 20,000-fold lower than the WT control group and about 60-fold lower than the original inoculum, indicating that most <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ cells have been cleared by this time point. The mean fungal burden of <italic>sup1</italic>-infected larvae was 9.6×10<sup>3</sup> CFUs, while the mean fungal burden <italic>sup2</italic>-infected larvae was 2.3×10<sup>4</sup> CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Here, we report the identification of genes required for growth at high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the fungal pathogen <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Multiple pathways important for growth at high temperature, such as the Ras1-Cdc24, CWI, Calcineurin, and RAM pathways, were found to be required for growth in high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, indicating that growth in response to host CO<sub>2</sub> may be intricately coordinated and co-regulated with response to host temperature. It is therefore likely that both host CO<sub>2</sub> and host temperature represent stressors that cryptococcal cells infecting mammalian hosts must overcome to cause disease.</p><p>Calcineurin and RAM pathways were both identified in our screen for mutants that affect cryptococcal CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. A previous study found synthetic lethality between the RAM and calcineurin pathways in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton et al., 2006</xref>). This corroborates our findings of the key differences between the basidiomycete <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and the ascomycete yeasts. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, CO<sub>2</sub> levels are sensed through bicarbonate or cAMP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase to increase hyphal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). While these pathways may also be functioning to sense CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mogensen et al., 2006</xref>), our results indicate that these pathways do not play a significant role in host CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. We also found that disruption of the RAM pathway effector kinase Cbk1 caused a severe growth defect at host CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> but not in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The vast differences between these organisms in terms of growth response to CO<sub>2</sub> may reflect the evolutionary distance between these species and/or the distinct niches they normally occupy. Indeed, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a human commensal and has adapted to host CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a powerful fermenter that thrives in conditions with high levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. For the environmental fungus <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, however, the ability to grow in a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched condition does not appear to be strongly selected for in the natural environment, and the host level of CO<sub>2</sub> (~5% CO<sub>2</sub>) is over 100-fold higher than the ambient air (~0.04% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>The RAM pathway mutants were among the most sensitive mutants to host levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. Remarkably, the growth defects of <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ could be partially restored by single mutations in the genes <italic>PSC1</italic> or <italic>SSD1</italic>. While the PARN-encoding gene <italic>PSC1</italic> represents an uncharacterized protein, <italic>SSD1</italic> is a known suppressor of <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ phenotypes that has been extensively characterized in ascomycete yeasts to regulate the translation of numerous and diverse mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wanless et al., 2014</xref>). Our genetic interaction analysis indicates that Psc1 likely functions in the same pathway as Ssd1. Interestingly, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, deletion of <italic>SSD1</italic> can suppress the lethality of the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant but not the cell separation defect, which is regulated by the transcription factor Ace2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurischko et al., 2005</xref>). However, an Ace2 homolog has not been identified in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> or any other basidiomycete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, Ssd1 plays an important role in polarized growth and hyphal initiation by negatively regulating the transcription factor Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). The observation that <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ<italic>psc1</italic>Δ and <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ<italic>ssd1</italic>Δ suppressor mutants partially rescue cell separation defects or depolarized growth suggests that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> may primarily utilize Ssd1/Psc1 rather than a potential Ace2 homolog to regulate cell separation or polarization. Differential regulation of target mRNA transcripts by Ssd1 and Psc1 may explain the functional divergence of the RAM pathway we observed between the basidiomycete <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> and the ascomycete yeasts. Our observation that the natural suppressors do not restore transcript abundances of CO<sub>2</sub>-associated genes in <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ to WT levels supports a hypothesis that disruption of Ssd1 and Psc1 suppresses the <italic>cbk1</italic>Δ mutant’s defects at a post-transcriptional level. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has been demonstrated to use post-transcriptional regulation to adapt to various host stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalem et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stovall et al., 2021</xref>).

Whether or not translatome reprogramming is initiated in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in response to host CO<sub>2</sub>, and whether such reprogramming, if occurs, relies on Ssd1 and/or Psc1, has yet to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, growth conditions, and microscopy examination</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in the key resources table.

It is worth considering two aspects of C. neoformans biology. (a) H99 is non-representative of serotype A, featuring a chromosomal rearrangement and gene loss. (b) A RAM pathway mutant in a serotype D background does not show strong temperature sensitivity (see Magditch et al. PLoS Pathogens 2012 figure 1). It may be wise to explore the CO2 impact in other background as well before drawing too many conclusions about differences between fungal phyla.

For example, it was not immediately clear which were the RAM pathway mutants or their gene names. How many of these mutants are also temperature sensitive or have other phenotypes? Do these CNAG_##### genes have other names from previous studies that could orient readers better?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors have screened for suppressor mutants of cbk1Δ using the assay described in the text (lines 183-188). A total of 11 suppressor colonies were further examined and the genomes were sequenced. Based on the sequencing result, the suppressor colonies were categorized into two groups: two colonies in the sup1 group, both of which contained an in-frame deletion in the PSC1 gene, and 9 colonies in the sup2 group that contain mutations (any of the missense, frame-shift, or premature STOP) in the SSD1 ORF. The authors have performed in vitro as well in vivo experiments in a mice model with a single suppressor colony from each group. While the nature of mutations varies in sup2 colonies, the authors have shown that the cbk1Δssd1Δ strain behaves similarly to the sup2 group. While it is unclear from the text the nature of the mutation in the sup2 colony, the authors took forward the mutants for subsequent experiments (whether missense, frameshift, or premature STOP). It may be assumed that a missense mutation found in sup2 and a frameshift mutation found in sup1, which the authors reported, lead to a suppressor phenotype similar to respective gene deletion in the cbk1Δ background. It is suggestive of the critical role(s) of the individual residues in both the proteins, mutations of which lead to complete loss of activity. We recommend the authors generate the respective point mutants in those two proteins and recapitulate the sup1 and sup2 phenotypes.</p><p>2. It is understood from the in vitro results that:</p><p>a. The cbk1Δ strain is nearly inviable (Figure 4C) at 37oC irrespective of ambient or +5% CO2.</p><p>b. The sup1, cbk1Δsup1Δ exhibit partial rescue at 37oC alone but very poor rescue at 37oC+5% CO2</p><p>c. Similarly, the sup2, cbk1Δssd1Δ strains exhibit partial rescue, slightly better than sup1.</p><p>Thus, at 37oC, in presence of ambient or 5% CO2, those strains exhibit a significant loss of viability compared to H99. However, the authors used the same number of cells as inoculum of all strains for the mice experiment ignoring the difference in the viability of the above strains. Hence, the conclusion that the sup1 and sup2 strains fail to cause any mortality (lines 255-258) is questionable. We recommend that the authors normalize the sup1 and sup2 inoculum such that viable numbers, not the total numbers, of cells, are comparable to those in H99 at the host condition. Authors may consider using an alternate model system to validate those virulence traits by taking into account the above factors.</p><p>3. The authors may consider showing the overexpression of Cbk1 using Western blots (Figure 2).</p><p>4. Adding scale bars to Figure 4D will help in understanding the morphological changes better.</p><p>5. Line 93: Adding the information on the total number of ORFs in the C. neoformans genome will help the reader understand what percentage of the genome was represented by the deletion mutant collection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript would be strengthened by an experiment comparing the suppressor strain's survival after H2O2 exposure or another general stress test to bolster the claim that sup2's increased growth at host CO2 levels at pH 6 is a solid explanation for the differences in establishment and persistence of infection in the absence of mouse mortality.</p><p>The acknowledgement that other virulence factors are also impacted by this kinase should be made more apparent in the text and/or included in a main figure.</p><p>Additionally, in SI Appendix Figure 4, the slightly increased growth of sup2 during CO2 exposure is only seen at pH 6, while at pH 7.4 both strains appear similarly negatively impacted by CO2 with growth reduced to cbk1∆ levels. Further commentary on why the change in pH appears to greatly impact the sup1 and sup2 strains in pH 7.4 compared to pH 6 would be helpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82563.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some points for consideration are as follows.</p><p>Lines 20-21: does it matter in the abstract that no ACE2 homology is known?

Carbonic anhydrase Can1 and Can2 of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are such factors and therefore they are dispensable for cryptococcal virulence in the host due to restored growth by high concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. Our study here focuses on genes important for tolerance of CO<sub>2</sub> at high concentrations. That said, we agree with the reviewer that it is on a related topic.

It is worth considering two aspects of C. neoformans biology. (a) H99 is non-representative of serotype A, featuring a chromosomal rearrangement and gene loss. (b) A RAM pathway mutant in a serotype D background does not show strong temperature sensitivity (see Magditch et al. PLoS Pathogens 2012 figure 1). It may be wise to explore the CO2 impact in other background as well before drawing too many conclusions about differences between fungal phyla. Likewise, the CO2 phenotypes seen here for the cdc24 mutant are stronger than those observed by Chang et al. PLoS Genetics 2014. What is the consequence on O2 levels of increasing CO2 levels, e.g. do they reduce leading towards hypoxia?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these observations to us. Based on the results of Magditch et al. (Magditch et al., 2012), the RAM pathway mutant phenotype in different strain backgrounds of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is similar to our mutants in the H99 background in terms of morphology and temperature sensitivity (their Figure 1 vs. our Figure 3). However, the RAM mutant phenotype is distinct from ascomycete yeasts such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (the later shown in Figure 3‐figure supplement 1), which is not temperature sensitive and exhibits depolarized growth as round yeast cells.</p><p>Our CO<sub>2</sub> incubator controls CO<sub>2</sub> directly but not the O<sub>2</sub> levels. It is possible that increasing CO<sub>2</sub> from 0.04% to 5% will accordingly lower other gases in the air including O<sub>2</sub> by 95%, which means that the O<sub>2</sub> levels should be around 21%*0.95 = 19.95%. This is hardly considered a hypoxic condition for <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. Thus, our gas conditions should be similar to their 20%O<sub>2</sub>5%CO<sub>2</sub>. However, we took pictures of our colonies after 2 days of incubation whereas they took pictures after 3 days of incubation. The prolonged incubation in their setting might have diminished the differences in growth that could be observed at earlier time points. This and other possible differences in incubators, such as humidity, may also contribute to the variation in phenotype of our <italic>cdc24</italic>Δ mutant here vs. in the publication by Chang et al. PLoS Genetics 2014. That said, there is a discernable growth defect of the <italic>cdc24</italic>Δ mutant in 20%O<sub>2</sub>5%CO<sub>2</sub> based on their Figure 1A, which is consistent with our observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suppressor phenotypes and figure 4: Magditch et al. 2012 screened for suppressors using the sensitivity of RAM pathway mutants to calcineurin inhibition.

The authors have screened for suppressor mutants of cbk1Δ using the assay described in the text (lines 183-188). A total of 11 suppressor colonies were further examined and the genomes were sequenced. Based on the sequencing result, the suppressor colonies were categorized into two groups: two colonies in the sup1 group, both of which contained an in-frame deletion in the PSC1 gene, and 9 colonies in the sup2 group that contain mutations (any of the missense, frame-shift, or premature STOP) in the SSD1 ORF. The authors have performed in vitro as well in vivo experiments in a mice model with a single suppressor colony from each group. While the nature of mutations varies in sup2 colonies, the authors have shown that the cbk1Δssd1Δ strain behaves similarly to the sup2 group. While it is unclear from the text the nature of the mutation in the sup2 colony, the authors took forward the mutants for subsequent experiments (whether missense, frameshift, or premature STOP). It may be assumed that a missense mutation found in sup2 and a frameshift mutation found in sup1, which the authors reported, lead to a suppressor phenotype similar to respective gene deletion in the cbk1Δ background. It is suggestive of the critical role(s) of the individual residues in both the proteins, mutations of which lead to complete loss of activity. We recommend the authors generate the respective point mutants in those two proteins and recapitulate the sup1 and sup2 phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>sup1</italic> group contained amino acid deletion mutations in the PARN domain of Psc1, and the <italic>sup2</italic> group contained frameshifts or gain of stop codons in Ssd1. In one suppressor mutant that contained a frameshift mutation in Ssd1, it also contains a missense mutation in Ssd1. We apologize that we mistakenly left out the asterisk that was referenced in the Figure 4 legend in the original manuscript. We have added an asterisk in Figure 4 near “MS” and a description in the figure legend in this revised version to show that this mutation was found together with a frameshift mutation in the same suppressor mutant. Based on the evidence we have gathered, we conclude that the suppressor mutants were generated by loss‐of‐function mutations in Ssd1 or Psc1 for the following reasons: (1) Based on our DNA sequencing results, we only identified high impact mutations in either Psc1 or Ssd1 in the suppressor mutants; (2) Each suppressor mutant contained a high impact polymorphism or indel in Psc1 or Ssd1; (3) The double deletion mutants recapitulate the phenotypes of the natural suppressor mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is understood from the in vitro results that:</p><p>a. The cbk1Δ strain is nearly inviable (Figure 4C) at 37oC irrespective of ambient or +5% CO2.</p><p>b. The sup1, cbk1Δsup1Δ exhibit partial rescue at 37oC alone but very poor rescue at 37oC+5% CO2</p><p>c. Similarly, the sup2, cbk1Δssd1Δ strains exhibit partial rescue, slightly better than sup1.</p><p>Thus, at 37oC, in presence of ambient or 5% CO2, those strains exhibit a significant loss of viability compared to H99. However, the authors used the same number of cells as inoculum of all strains for the mice experiment ignoring the difference in the viability of the above strains. Hence, the conclusion that the sup1 and sup2 strains fail to cause any mortality (lines 255-258) is questionable. We recommend that the authors normalize the sup1 and sup2 inoculum such that viable numbers, not the total numbers, of cells, are comparable to those in H99 at the host condition. Authors may consider using an alternate model system to validate those virulence traits by taking into account the above factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up the complexity of virulence assessment in mammalian animal models. All the cells for virulence assays were cultured in vitro at 30<sup>o</sup>C and not at 37<sup>o</sup>C. Furthermore, the viable CFUs used in inoculum were confirmed. That said, once inoculated into mice, fungal cells have to live at the host body temperature and the temperature‐sensitive mutants will fare worse in the host compared to the wild type control. Unfortunately, there is no good way to determine an appropriate inoculum for each strain for comparison of multiple strains in animal models because many different factors work together to determine the outcome of infections and temperature is just one of the factors. Furthermore, depending on the time of examination, different number of viable cells of the same strain will be recovered from the animals. To compound the issue further, variation in the number of fungal cells used in inoculation could cause different host immune responses even if the cells are heat‐killed prior to inoculation. Therefore, there has been no better way to compare virulence of different strains in mice than the current standard of using the same inoculum across different strains.</p><p>To remove the temperature sensitivity variable in a virulence assay, we have added experiments with the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> larva infection model. This model is commonly used to assay virulence at lower temperatures as the body temperature of <italic>G. mellonella</italic> is the same as the incubation environment. In this <italic>G. mellonella</italic> infection model conducted at 30°C, we observed similar virulence pattern among these strains compared to that in the mouse infection model.
