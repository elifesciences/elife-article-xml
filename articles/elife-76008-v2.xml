potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release; however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release in primary hippocampal cultures. In nonneuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of nonphotobleached probes with a time constant of ~10 s. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>glutamate release</kwd><kwd>spontaneous release</kwd><kwd>evoked release</kwd><kwd>fluorescence photobleaching</kwd><kwd>iGluSnFR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH66198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH081060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteggia</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH070727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteggia</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Camille S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chanaday</surname><given-names>Natali L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Photobleaching and recovery of a fluorescent glutamate sensor enable demonstration of the distinct spatial architectures of spontaneous versus evoked forms of glutamatergic neurotransmission within single synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses form the basis of neural communication and are exquisitely organized in facilitating point-to-point neurotransmission. Neurotransmitter release can be broadly organized into two main categories â evoked and spontaneous release. Evoked release is the more studied form of release and occurs in response to an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SÃ¼dhof, 2013</xref>). Spontaneous release, also referred to as activity independent release, occurs independently of action potentials. Several recent studies suggest that evoked and spontaneous release have functional segregation. For example, spontaneous and evoked release derive presynaptically from distinct synaptic vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sara et al., 2005</xref>), and use different release machinery as well as activate nonoverlapping sets of postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farsi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kavalali, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sara et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, spontaneous release can activate distinct postsynaptic downstream signaling pathways compared to evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horvath et al., 2021</xref>). Spontaneous release has also been implicated in mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases as well as their treatments separate from evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Autry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kavalali and Monteggia, 2012</xref>).</p><p>While studies have proposed a functional segregation of the two forms of release, the exact subsynaptic organization supporting spatial segregation remains unclear. Electrophysiology experiments utilizing use-dependent blockers to examine the segregation of postsynaptic receptors provide high temporal resolution of receptor activation, but do not contain spatial information about their subsynaptic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horvath et al., 2020</xref>). Optical imaging of fluorescent neurotransmitter probes has the advantage of reporting where neurotransmitter release occurs. For instance, wide field fluorescence imaging of fluorescent probes has examined organization of spontaneous and evoked release across different synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>), though it could not resolve subsynaptic sites of release. Other studies using super resolution microscopy found that trans-synaptic ânanocolumnsâ aligned postsynaptic receptors and scaffolding proteins with presynaptic release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that certain proteins align with and may facilitate evoked release at spatially segregated sites. These data further support the differential organization of different modes of neurotransmitter release. Nevertheless, subsynaptic organization of different modes of release remain poorly understood as the existing tools for examining this fundamental property in real-time remain limited.</p><p>Here, we used a glutamate sensing fluorescent reporter, iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>), to probe the spatial segregation of excitatory neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. iGluSnFR is a novel probe that can resolve rapid glutamatergic transients with a high signal-to-noise ratio and is commonly used for in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Helassa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marvin et al., 2018</xref>). Using photobleaching of iGluSnFR as a tool to probe the organization of spontaneous and evoked release sites, we test whether fluorescent iGluSnFR probes within subsynaptic regions are differentially affected by photobleaching. We demonstrate that photobleaching has use-dependent properties, that iGluSnFR is a highly mobile probe expressed at synaptic surfaces, and that iGluSnFR demonstrates single synapse level resolution. Furthermore, iGluSnFR imaging can reveal the organization of distinct forms of neurotransmission at the synapse, creating a broader framework to elucidate basic principles of neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>iGluSnFR localization at the plasma membrane</title><p>Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were sparsely transfected with the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR under control of a neuronal promoter (synapsin-1).

We compared synapse count in iGluSnFR transfected neurons, with two control groups: GFP transfected neurons, and nontransfected neurons immunostained for a dendritic marker (MAP2). We then immunostained for pre- and postsynaptic markers (VGluT1 and PDS95, respectively), and we measured the number of colocalized pre- and postsynaptic terminals per length of neurite to estimate synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alten et al., 2021</xref>). We found that iGluSnFR expression did not significantly change the density of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>), indicating that expression of iGluSnFR at the plasma membrane does not disrupt synaptic organization.</p><p>We next examined the resting spatial distribution of iGluSnFR probes at the plasma membrane of neurons using super resolution microscopy, which can resolve the localization of molecules past the diffraction limit of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). To visualize iGluSnFR via super resolution, we stained for the GFP protein in the iGluSnFR molecule. This allowed for quantification of all iGluSnFR molecules, both fluorescent (i.e., activated by glutamate) and not. After applying clustering analysis using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sawant, 2014</xref>), we observed that iGluSnFR has a greater density at synaptic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Pair correlation analysis of iGluSnFR clusters that colocalized with the postsynaptic marker PSD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>), revealed an increased clustering of iGluSnFR near the center of the synapse, compared to a theoretical random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggests the existence of a general trapping mechanism at dendritic spines that confines iGluSnFR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>iGluSnFR can resolve evoked and spontaneous events at the single synapse level in hippocampal neurons</title><p>Live imaging of primary neurons sparsely transfected with iGluSnFR was performed using an epifluorescence microscope equipped with an EM-CCD camera; this reduces photobleaching and toxicity during long experiments and allows resolution of fast spiking events, respectively. For this work, we focused on individual dendritic spines to isolate glutamatergic events postsynaptically. To find active synapses, we delivered a high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz, 25APs) followed by 90 mM KCl at the end of each recording, and used it to draw circular regions of interests (ROIs) of 2 Âµm diameter around local fluorescence maxima in dendritic spines. We then used these ROIs to analyze evoked and spontaneous activity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To examine whether iGluSnFR can resolve evoked transmission at single synapses, we estimated release probability (Pr), or the likelihood that a docked and primed synaptic vesicle will fuse with the plasma membrane upon depolarization from an action potential. Pr was estimated using failure analysis, where 20â40 APs at 0.2 Hz were delivered and the number of detected responses was divided by the number of stimulations. Peaks, corresponding to glutamate release events, were detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and peaks were included at amplitude values â¥3 standard deviations above the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâD</xref>). Pr has been widely reported to be low and highly variable at individual hippocampal synapses, in culture as well as in intact tissue, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanaday and Kavalali, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farsi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagliatti et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, iGluSnFR reported a low average release probability that was also highly variable among synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâG</xref>), indicating that each ROI contained a single synapse.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>iGluSnFR detects excitatory evoked events with single synapse level resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summation projection of acquired images during high-frequency stimulation to locate active synaptic boutons, as detected as local fluorescence maxima.

Pr is positively regulated by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanaday and Kavalali, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murthy et al., 1997</xref>). In iGluSnFR transfected neurons, perfusion of solutions with increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations leads to a corresponding increase of Pr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Glutamate release is completely abrogated in the absence of extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), while Pr values are shifted toward high probabilities of 0.86 Â± 0.23 in 8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, compared to 2 mM at 0.49 Â± 0.32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). We also measured the amplitude of evoked events, which correlates to the amount of glutamate released at synapses. We found that the peak amplitudes increased at higher extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Based on the literature, this could be due to multivesicular release as release probabilities increase at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>), or glutamate spill over from adjacent sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2020</xref>), or a combination of these factors.</p><p>Next, we examined spontaneous neurotransmission detected by iGluSnFR. We were able to detect individual spontaneous glutamate release events at synapses with a high signal-to-noise ratio, similar to that of evoked events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). The average frequency of spontaneous events has been reported to be approximately 0.01â0.02 Hz per synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>) and our detection of spontaneous events using iGluSnFR is comparable to this value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Due to the low probability of release, responses to action potentials at the level of individual synapses is a binary process: release of a single synaptic vesicle (one quanta) or a failure, as discussed above. At this scale, responses are fundamentally different from whole-cell measurements, where integrated signals from hundreds of synapses are measured. Thus, at individual synapses, both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission lead to release of one synaptic vesicle, thereby activating a similar numbers of probes and leading to similar event amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). Based on this, we expect to find similar results using iGluSnFR, and indeed we measured comparable peak amplitudes for evoked and spontaneous events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This provides further support that we are detecting the release of single synaptic vesicles at single synapses. When release properties were analyzed at the level of individual synapses, spontaneous neurotransmission rate and evoked release probability did not correlate within synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), similar to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>), thus reinforcing that evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission are partially segregated. Importantly, we observed that the spontaneous event frequency in a bath solution containing CNQX and APV (which blocks AMPAR and NMDARs, respectively) is not significantly different than in CNQX, APV, and the action potential blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>)), demonstrating that inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors is sufficient to suppress action potential-driven release. Furthermore, these drugs do not interact with iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>). This allowed us to monitor spontaneous neurotransmission at the same neurons and synapses used for studying evoked neurotransmission, since TTX is hard to wash off. Thus, all studies on spontaneous neurotransmission using iGluSnFR were performed in the presence of only CNQX and APV.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>iGluSnFR can resolve spontaneous events at single synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative spontaneous trace, and representative individual spontaneous events.

In contrast, fluorophores in the ground state (or nonfluorescent) cannot be photobleached, meaning that by its very nature, photobleaching is a use-dependent process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To measure the mobility of iGluSnFR at the plasma membrane, we employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), which can measure fluorophore diffusion by examining the rate at which fluorescent probes replace photobleached probes within a selected region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axelrod et al., 1976</xref>). Analysis was performed using a previously validated web-based software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koulouras et al., 2018</xref>). The rate of recovery, which is a proxy for probe mobility, was estimated by fitting the curve with a single exponential equation, and the immobile fraction of probe was defined as the difference between baseline (prebleaching) and the asymptotic (postbleaching) normalized fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Using neurons transfected with iGluSnFR, we selected neuronal dendritic spines and shaft areas to bleach (ROI size = 1 Âµm diameter for FRAP experiments only) and monitored fluorescence recovery over time using a confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>).

Immobile fractions reflect a subpopulation of probes that cannot be replenished by nonbleached probes.

This suggests that iGluSnFR likely does not have an intrinsic property that leads it to tether to intracellular proteins, and that limitations in diffusion may be partially due to the geometry and asymmetric composition of neuronal membranes. In favor of this speculation, using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) we observed the iGluSnFR was concentrated at synapses, pointing to a putative mechanical trapping mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We also observed that the immobile fraction was not significantly different in HEK cells compared to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

Based on this information, we next used photobleaching and its use-dependent properties to probe putative segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission. To do this, we measured spontaneous and evoked events in iGluSnFR transfected neurons using an epifluorescence microscope, with the same parameters used to validate single synapse neurotransmission. Synaptic ROIs were selected during high-frequency stimulation at the end of each experiment, and neuronal activity was measured retroactively. We recorded spontaneous neurotransmission for 10 min and subsequently monitored evoked release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) to minimize confounding effects on spontaneous release by the electrical stimulation. We then photobleached the entire field of view with sustained maximal-intensity illumination (by removing the light dimming filter), and then resumed normal imaging of spontaneous and evoked events from all the photobleached synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We did not observe a difference in evoked release detection following photobleaching with stimulation versus without stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). One explanation could be that spontaneous release during the photobleaching period is sufficient to occlude all evoked iGluSnFR responses. To test whether a higher baseline release probability could allow more discernment of the effect of stimulating or not during photobleaching, we repeated the experiments in a higher extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> of 8 mM. In this condition, probability of release is close to 1 during baseline recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In agreement, we observed a higher degree of photobleaching of evoked responses when electrical stimulation was applied during the bleaching period in the presence of 8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to nonstimulated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1I</xref>), indicating that the level of photobleaching of evoked responses scales up with the amount of evoked glutamate release. These results could also be explained by reduced action potential firing due to reduced excitability in the presence of high calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segal, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our results so far indicate that spontaneous neurotransmission detected using iGluSnFR is more resilient to photobleaching than its evoked counterpart. One interpretation is that iGluSnFR molecules activated by spontaneous release are in more mobile areas of the membrane and thus can be rapidly replaced by unbleached probes from other regions. If this is the case, activating all iGluSnFR molecules during the photobleaching period should abolish future detection of spontaneous neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we recorded spontaneous events followed by a total of 10 min of photobleaching, during which for 2 min we perfused 500 Î¼M glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). We found that the detection of spontaneous iGluSnFR events was significantly and nearly completely diminished after photobleaching during glutamate perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Thus, activating all iGluSnFR probes at the plasma membrane during photobleaching eliminates event detection. Importantly, this finding serves as a key negative control validating the specificity of the photobleaching approach toward bona fide glutamate release events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Fluorescence at evoked and spontaneous release sites recover at different timescales after photobleaching</title><p>We next aimed to quantify the time course of recovery after photobleaching of spontaneous and evoked iGluSnFR events. For this purpose, we used a 10-min photobleaching period. Following photobleaching, we waited for 20 min and up to 24 hr in the absence of fluorescence imaging (i.e., in the dark), then monitored glutamatergic activity in the same neurons. Both spontaneous and evoked events were significantly bleached following the 10-min photobleaching period, although evoked events were relatively more susceptible to photobleaching confirming our previous findings. Within an hour, spontaneous events were detectable at a frequency and amplitude that was similar to that prior to photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5HâI</xref>). On the other hand, evoked events remained undetectable an hour after photobleaching. After 8 hr, detection of evoked events resumed. At 24 hr after photobleaching, evoked event values returned to their original pre-photobleaching values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). By plotting the event rate over time, we found that the recovery of spontaneous events occurred on the timescale of minutes, while the recovery of evoked events occurred on a longer timescale of hours. The slower recovery rate of evoked events suggests that iGluSnFR probes that respond to evoked release have less lateral mobility at the plasma membrane. This is consistent with our previous data demonstrating an immobile fraction of iGluSnFR, which may be in part due to the evoked release architecture at synapses.</p><p>In the next set of experiments, we examined whether photobleaching altered the structure and function of synapses using electrophysiological detection of glutamatergic neurotransmission. To do this, we photobleached neurons plated on gridded coverslips on the epifluorescence microscope and located the same region and neuron for electrophysiological measurements on a separate electrophysiology rig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), or spontaneous neurotransmission, in both photobleached and control neurons, and observed no difference in the frequency nor the amplitude of mEPSCs between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The capacitance and membrane resistance of neurons are indicative of membrane integrity and overall cell health, and these values were similar between control and photobleached neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, we examined evoked excitatory neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and found no difference in the amplitude of evoked postsynaptic currents, or EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). There was also no difference in the paired pulse ratio, which is a proxy for release probability, between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These data show that photobleaching does not affect excitatory synaptic transmission as measured by electrophysiology, nor the resting properties of neurons. Thus, the decreases seen in iGluSnFR event detection reflect the effects of photobleaching on fluorescent probes, and not intrinsic changes in neurotransmission levels due to toxic effects of prolonged illumination.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological and structural properties of neurons remain intact after photobleaching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) traces with and without photobleaching, and the experimental paradigm of recording electrophysiological measurements in photobleached versus nonphotobleached neurons.

At individual synapses, spontaneous release occurs at very low frequency; thus, it is critical to have a robust negative control. We found that spontaneous events are decreased in lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. We also show that we nearly eliminate the detection of spontaneous events by photobleaching while perfusing glutamate, thus activating (and thereby making available to photobleach) all probes on the neuronal surface. These results further support the specificity of our event detection, especially spontaneous events.</p><p>Using FRAP, we established that iGluSnFR is a highly mobile probe and can replenish bleached areas within seconds, and it also possesses a sizable immobile fraction in neurons. iGluSnFR is bound to the plasma membrane by a PDGFR domain, but it is not specifically targeted to any neuronal protein; it thus theoretically should be able to freely diffuse across the entirety of the neuronal surface. We took advantage of this property of iGluSnFR and measured evoked and spontaneous release detection in varying photobleaching conditions. Photobleaching is a use-dependent process, in which only actively fluorescent probes can be bleached, and nonfluorescent probes will not be affected. While photobleaching can be an artifact of imaging that we seek to minimize, it has been used intentionally in the past â for instance, to decrease background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>). We employed photobleaching as a use-dependent blocker of fluorescence detection to probe synaptic physiology. When we photobleached neurons transfected with iGluSnFR, we found a differential effect on evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission, in which evoked release events photobleach much faster and more efficiently than spontaneous release events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâE</xref>; note that iGluSnFR activated by tonic/ambient glutamate is also bleached â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1J</xref> â). Furthermore, evoked release also takes longer to ârecoverâ its photobleached fluorescence when reimaged after a certain time period of time in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB</xref>). Previously, pharmacological use-dependent blockers and electrophysiological techniques have been used to uncover a functional segregation between these modes of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horvath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reese and Kavalali, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sara et al., 2011</xref>).

Several studies have demonstrated a mobile and immobile fraction of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>), which may coincide with the immobile fraction of iGluSnFR found in our studies. Collectively, these studies suggest that certain proteins align to facilitate evoked release within spatially restricted regions.</p><p>Our findings also revealed a consistent subsynaptic structure in which evoked release is more clustered and restricted than spontaneous release, as such an organization would lead to photobleaching having a stronger effect on evoked release. Photobleached probes within the evoked release site have greater difficulty diffusing out of the bleached region and allowing unbleached probes to enter. Thus, within a few minutes, evoked release reaches a nearly undetectable level, and it takes a much longer time for the signal to recover. In contrast, spontaneous release may occur more broadly across the synapse, likely with less pronounced surface protein alignment at the site of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These events are harder to photobleach because the mobility of iGluSnFR is high, such that by the time another spontaneous event occurs, unbleached iGluSnFR will have replenished the photobleached probes and be able to respond to subsequent spontaneous release events. iGluSnFR moves faster, on the order of seconds, than the rate of photobleaching which occurs on the order of minutes. Another explanation could be that there is a greater number of spontaneous release sites compared to evoked release sites, so that even if one release site is bleached, there are many others that have not been affected and could still fluoresce upon glutamate release. However, the latter proposal is inconsistent with the observation that 10â15 min long application of the use-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor blocker MK-801 or folimycin, a use-dependent blocker of presynaptic vesicle acidification, are sufficient to suppress spontaneous neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sara et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, our photobleaching period of 20 min is beyond this time period and should have been sufficient to suppress all events if photobleached iGluSnFRs were not rapidly replenished. Finally, the time for evoked iGluSnFR events to recover fluorescence takes longer than for spontaneous events, which further suggests that there is a greater diffusion barrier within evoked release sites compared to spontaneous sites.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model schematic demonstrating the clustered and diffusion restricted organization of evoked events, compared to the more diffusely located and freely moving structure of spontaneous event sites.</title><p>Evoked events are more readily photobleached, likely due to its clustered location and less diffusible surface. Spontaneous events are still detectable after photobleaching, likely due to the more freely diffusible nature of its structure and their dispersed location. Recovery for spontaneous release occurs on the order of minutes, likely due to synaptic and extrasynaptic diffusion of unbleached probes into the bleached regions. Recovery for evoked release occurs on the order of hours.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76008-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our experiments were performed in an in vitro culture system as much prior synaptic work has been done in primary cultures, thus our results more directly build upon previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramsey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Renner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). While we would expect the findings from primary cultured neurons to largely translate to an intact brain system, there may be some differences. For instance, the differences in extracellular matrix composition may affect diffusional properties, and the 3D nature of synapse organization within the dense neuropil could lead to differences in glutamate dynamics compared to a monolayer of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthews et al., 2022</xref>). It is also possible that more complex ex vivo brain tissues may introduce technical complications in detecting differences in photobleaching and fluorescence recovery of iGluSnFR probes. Furthermore, imaging synapses in intact brain systems would be better performed on a two-photon microscope, and this would require a recharacterization of iGluSnFR dynamics and photobleaching properties by a different microscope.</p><p>The differences in event detection after photobleaching and fluorescence recovery, as well as a clustered distribution uncovered by super resolution analysis, support a model of synaptic organization where different modes of neurotransmission are segregated. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be used to probe the spatial segregation of different modes of neurotransmission. These results demonstrate a novel use for a widely recognized property of fluorescence probes, expanding the ways in which we use photobleaching as a molecular tool, as well as demonstrating the spatial organization of different modes of neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-GFP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog 132 002</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ICC (1:300)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-PSD95 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog 124 011</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ICC/IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MAP2 (guinea pig polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog 188 004</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">vGluT1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog 135 302</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlexaFluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (polyclonal, secondary antibody)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">REF A31573</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC/ICC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (polyclonal, secondary antibody)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">REF A11004</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC/ICC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG (H + L) (polyclonal, secondary antibody)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">REF A11073</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC/ICC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt hydrate (CNQX)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog #

Outliers were identified with Robust regression and Outlier removal (ROUT) method. Differences among experimental groups were considered statistically significant when a p value â¤0.05 was reached. Specifics of statistical tests and p value denotations are listed in figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (Animal Protocol Number M1800103).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76008-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; Source Data files have been provided for all Figures and Figure Supplements.

The classical model is that the pathways utilized by action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission are the same. Multiple lines of evidence now suggest that the Venn diagrams describing the vesicle identity, regulatory systems, and postsynaptic receptors utilized by evoked and spontaneous transmission, overlap incompletely. In this paper, Wang and colleagues, explore the distribution of glutamate release sites at hippocampal synapses using a genetically encoded glutamate sensor and photobleaching, and their results indicate that evoked release is confined to a smaller region of each excitatory synapse than the more dispersed spontaneous release.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76008.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/054484h93</institution-id><institution>VA Portland Health Care System</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Dulla</surname><given-names>Chris G</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05wvpxv85</institution-id><institution>Tufts University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hoppa</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/049s0rh22</institution-id><institution>Dartmouth College</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.10.472065">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.10.472065v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chris G Dulla (Reviewer #2); Michael Hoppa (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the three reviews were consistent and positive about the submission. As you will see below, they felt the work addressed an important question using an interesting approach. However, all reviewers felt that substantial modifications are required to clarify the conclusions and make the work accessible to a general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Rather than cut and paste from the lists provided by the referees I have identified three major types of problem in the list below. However, I point out that it is essential that all of the specific points mentioned in the attached reviews should be addressed.</p><p>1) Frequently the reader has to make assumptions about what is being tested and why. The introduction to each set of experiments needs to be more explicit and include sufficient explanation of the hypothesis being tested and the rationale for the approach. In addition, there is often a deficiency of key experimental details such as the frequency of stimulation or nature of a region of interest forcing the reader to guess what was done.</p><p>2) The reviewers have suggested only a few additional experiments and suspect that these may have already been performed. Examples are included in questions 12 and 20 (reviewer 1).</p><p>3) The results clearly benefit from the high resolution imaging that can be obtained in dispersed cultures, and the preparation should be detailed in the title or abstract. Is the authors' approach feasible in a more intact system, such as in vivo or acute brain slices? In lieu of such data, the discussion should address how synaptic structure/function may be different in culture than in the intact brain and how this might affect the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study addresses an interesting and important question using a novel approach. In order to increase the impact of the work I have a number of suggestions about additional experiments that may clarify issues brought up by the manuscript. I suspect that the authors may have already performed some of these. In addition, I believe that the authors should substantially revise sections of the results to make the work accessible to the potential readers. I found it quite difficult to understand the rationale behind the order and design of experiments at times. I suspect that the authors will be able to improve the manuscript substantially by being more explicit about some of the experimental conditions and the hypotheses being tested. For instance, explicit mention of the alternate hypothesis that the same glutamate receptors are involved in spontaneous and evoked release may help the reader. Major required changes are listed below:</p><p>1. In Figure 1 the authors include live cell imaging and SRM on fixed tissue. Please indicate explicitly in the text the different conditions under study. Direct imaging of the iGluSnFR in live versus secondary antibody to GFP in fixed?</p><p>2. Is sparse transfection important? Please define and state why.</p><p>3. L 95. There are no circles on Figure 1B. Is this the best time to mention them?</p><p>4. L 95 Please define high-frequency stimulation at this point so that the reader can understand the experiment.</p><p>5. I believe figure 1B shows the fluorescence signal accumulated during or after a period of stimulation. Please clarify and consider that it may be helpful to see a control image before stimulation and after exposure to bath application of glutamate to clarify nonuniform distribution of probes.</p><p>6. L100 Please clarify if the pair correlation analysis was how you determined that the probe expression was mainly synaptic. Citation to support the use of pair correlation analysis.</p><p>7. I found the second paragraph in results very difficult to follow and wonder if this could be rewritten to improve clarity. I was unclear how the normalization to the dendritic marker was performed. Citations to support this approach.</p><p>8. Figure 1C calibration bar required. Please provide the corresponding DIC and PSD 95 images as well.</p><p>9. Supplementary figure 1B, Y axis label should be revised for dendritic marker signal and units should be per square microns.</p><p>10. Line 129 please describe more clearly how release probability was calculated.</p><p>11. L 143. Please discuss if there are other possible reasons that the size of the events was increased substantially by high extracellular calcium and why the citations suggest multi-vesicular release and spillover is likely.</p><p>12. Figure 2 D is this massive increase in event size observed in 8 mM an outlier or consistent with average? It appears there is a 5 to 10 fold increase in the size of each event. Have the authors attempted to evaluate if such a large amount of spillover is feasible. For instance, do experiments examining a small region of interest using pressure application of glutamate suggest a dynamic range of detection consistent with the suggestion of spillover.</p><p>13. L165 please clarify why comparable amplitudes for evoked spontaneous events indicate single vesicle release.</p><p>14. Line 170 please explain why seeing QNX and APV was used in these experiments.</p><p>15. L181. Explain why specifically 100 mM sucrose was utilized in this experiment.</p><p>16. Figure 3. Do the averaged spontaneous events have similar kinetics to mEPSCs?</p><p>17. L223-227. Any citations to support these statements?</p><p>18. L234 Figure 4G there seem to be some possible differences between HEK cells and neurons. The fractional bleaching, fractional recovery, and rate of recovery seem much larger in the HEK cell exemplar. How were the measurements included in 4H and I made? Was it by fitting an exponential and using the asymptote to estimate the immobile fraction?</p><p>19. Figure 4H, Y-axis label is missing.</p><p>20. L269-279. I am surprised and puzzled by the failure of electrical stimulation to influence the rate of photo bleaching. In addition to spillover the authors may wish to explicitly mention why this does not support the idea that receptors involved in spontaneous and evoked release are the same. It seems unlikely that spillover from spontaneous release during this brief time is adequate to activate all of the receptors involved in evoked release. Additional experiments to clarify this finding seem key. Would use of high bath concentrations of calcium increase evoked release sufficiently so that brief periods of stimulation could be tested. Presumably evoked release would be increased proportionately more than spontaneous release, so that less bleaching may occur in the control experiment sounds stimulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is an exciting and potentially very impactful study. The work presented is of very high quality and there is great interest in understanding spontaneous vs evoked release. Because this study is extremely technical in nature, there are a number of technical and methodological points that need some additional clarification and consideration to properly interpret the findings.</p><p>â An interesting and central finding of this study is that iGluSnFR appears to be concentrated at synapses. This seems counter intuitive. Synaptic real estate is so in demand and many molecules have specific targeting mechanisms to bring them to the synapse. How does iGluSnFR end up concentrated at the synapses without a specific synapse targeting mechanism? Is this finding solely based on imaging data gathered during high frequency stimulation? If so, one could argue that GluSnFR is not enriched in synapses but is just highly active during intense neuronal activity. Some clarification on GluSnFR protein vs GluSnFR signal localization would improve this argument.</p><p>â Second similar question â does the synaptic enrichment of GluSnFR fully recover after photobleaching and if so on what timescale? Because GluSnFR uses a DF/F approach to detect glutamate, it would be helpful in interpreting the evoked vs spontaneous FRAP recovery data to see the recovery of basal fluorescence (as in Figure 1C, expressed in AU) vs the ability to detect glutamate (as in the rest of the figures, expressed in DF/F).</p><p>â How was the mobile vs immobile fraction of iGluSnFR calculated? It's not clear from the text exactly how this ratio was arrived at.</p><p>â The photobleaching experiments used a 1 Î¼m diameter photobleaching area. ROIs used for quantifying GluSnRF activity in the synapse used a 2-3 Î¼m diameter ROI. If the photobleaching was centered over the active zone of the synapse, it stands to reason that the region associated with evoked release (central within the synapse) and the region associated with spontaneous release (peripheral within the synapse) are not equally photobleached. That could explain some of the data and should be considered as a potential caveat. Have the authors considered using a larger area of photobleaching to completely bleach everything in the synaptic ROI?</p><p>â In Figure 1 C it would be helpful to show PSD95. The figure legend says that the particles shown colocalize with PSD95 but there is no way to interpret or evaluate that with the current figure presentation.</p><p>â Because the central focus of the paper is spontaneous synaptic release, it would help the manuscript to give the reader a better description of exactly how spontaneous release events were detected. In the paper the authors state &quot;we examined parameters of spontaneous iGluSnFR events&quot; but it's not clear how they got those parameters to evaluate. Were the exact same ROIs used? Was there a signal to noise threshold used to identify events from noise? Were spontaneous events captured before or after evoked? Was that switched to control for the potential effects of stimulation of spontaneous release?</p><p>â It is not really clear why the authors did not use TTX throughout their experiments to analyze spontaneous release. Using TTX is the standard in the field for isolating action-potential independent events. I see that it allows them to do their stimulation experiments in the same cultures as their evoked experiments, which is essential to their study, but it leaves open the possibility that some spontaneous events are AP-associated. Have the authors made recordings from neurons in glutamate synaptic blockers and shown that 100% of the AP are absent? That would be a helpful control to validate their method.</p><p>â GluSnFR detection of evoked release is suppressed for hours after photobleaching while the ability to detect spontaneous release using GluSnFR recovers much more rapidly. This is a very clear and exciting finding! An implication of this result, however, is that 100% of the events that contribute to evoked release are spatially compartmentalized from any of the machinery that drives the ability to detect spontaneous release. Spontaneous release is detected using the same ROIs as evoked release (as far as I can tell), so that means within an ROI spontaneous release is being detected while evoked is not. Data presented shows that glutamate release is happening in both situations, but just can't be detected in the evoked release situation due to the photobleaching. So evoked release is somehow spatially restricted to the GluSnFR molecules in the synapse and cannot be detected by other GluSnFR molecules that detect spontaneous release in the same ROI. This is hard to reconcile with the fact that glutamate diffusion is likely the driving factor by which glutamate is cleared from the center of synapses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper by Wang CS et al., investigates the localization of spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion within a synapse. This is an important question and an interesting central finding. The authors nicely document the use of a glutamate-sensitive fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR) to measure spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion. They do a great job of characterizing iGluSnFR and take advantage of the probe's rapid bleaching to follow up previous molecular and physiological characterization of spontaneous vesicle fusion with novel findings of unique spatial segregation of spontaneous vesicle fusion. This finding is mainly based on this bleaching characteristic of GluSnFR. I was impressed by the idea of using the bleaching of a membrane probe to resolve the location of vesicle fusion. I have some questions and comments that I believe are important to be addressed to better understand the findings and their interpretation for an accepted manuscript.</p><p>1. iGluSnFR has a very high affinity to provide it with the sensitivity for detecting single vesicle fusion. A concern would be if the sensor is also detecting vesicle fusion as spillover from adjacent boutons of untransfected neurons undergoing spontaneous release. This concern is somewhat mitigated since the rate of spontaneous release is not much higher than expected from electrophysiology and good criteria are deployed for detection of events vs noise. However given that location is so important for the interpretation, these &quot;spill-over&quot; events could appear to be released from unique discrete areas of the synaptic bouton but are in fact coming from nearby synapses and the diffusing glutamate is being detected. A better characterization of the location of where spontaneous events were detected optically in the synapse relative to evoked might help resolve this concern. Were the ROIs formed from high frequency stimulation (or high potassium?) also in the same location for measuring spontaneous release? Were spontaneous vesicle fusions also detected outside of synapses identified by stimulation that might suggest spillover or solely restricted to regions with evoked release identified on dendrites?</p><p>2. The authors lead me to believe that GluSnFR bleaching is primarily dependent on activation of the indicator by glutamate binding. The difference in bleaching from glutamate perfusion compared to during rest or &quot;no stimulation&quot; for selectively impairing detection of evoked vs spontaneous release is striking and really interesting. That being said, it is very hard to understand the explanation the authors provide for the lack of difference between unstimulated and stimulated bleaching conditions. A difference here seems like the most direct experimental test to define separate release sites for evoked and spontaneous. If I understand the authors correctly, the lack of difference is the result of the spontaneous release of glutamate that contaminates this result. However, spontaneous release has a very low rate and would be releasing very small amounts of glutamate over the bleaching times identified. During 2 minutes of photobleaching when a very acute difference is found the rate of 0.1 Hz for spontaneous release the authors measured would mean that synapses experience on average 1 spontaneous vesicle fusion event during 2 minutes of photobleaching. This one release event would not be localized to sites of evoked release as the authors interpret the data yet would cause substantial bleaching equivalent to several vesicles fusing during stimulation. As it stands, 30 APs delivered during standard imaging over 2.5 minutes don't seem to cause any bleaching or decrease in detection efficiency (Figure 5A). To better understand the amount of bleaching that occurs in the three conditions, it would be useful to know both the difference in the illumination intensity between standard measurements and during photobleaching as well as the changes in resting fluorescence iat the synapse/ROIs. Presumably at the bleaching laser illumination power the same delivery of 30 APs @ 0.2 Hz (2.5 minutes) would rapidly decrease to very low levels if this interpretation of rapid bleaching when glutamate in present is correct. Otherwise, bleaching of GluSnFR doesn't require glutamate and perhaps another unknown property of local GluSnFR diffusion within a spine that the authors mention is responsible for the lack of difference in bleaching sensitivity to boutons at rest vs stimulation. This could still be in line with the authors' interpretation of unique release sites for evoked neurotransmission, but less easy to understand than selective loss from use of evoked release sites by glutamate dependent photobleaching. Perhaps lowering the &quot;bleaching&quot; laser intensity during stimulation would ablate/bleach detection of evoked release during stimulation that also preserves spontaneous release detection.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Probing the segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission via photobleaching and recovery of a fluorescent glutamate sensor&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by John Huguenard (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor and a reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some important issues that need to be addressed, (see below). The major changes required, focus on the re-organization and expansion of the manuscript to clarify the results reported by the authors in this innovative study. In addition to the recommendations below, it is important that the authors substantially expand the discussion about whether there might be differences in iGluR activation in the intact nervous system. They address this very briefly in the current discussion (lines 546- 552). Please expand this section and provide some citations to justify the rationale for the validity of the approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This resubmission describes work using a genetically encoded glutamate sniffer to study synaptic transmission in hippocampal cultured neurons. It investigates the properties of evoked and spontaneous transmission and identifies differences in the rates of photobleaching suggesting that the receptors involved in these 2 signaling pathways are localized differently. The authors have made a number of changes to the initial submission that have improved the manuscript, however, there are a number of remaining problems that need to be addressed before it is suitable for publication in Life.</p><p>Although much improved, the manuscript may be easier to read if the authors began the Results section by describing the distribution of iGluSnFR and how this compares with that for vGlut1 and PSD 95 distribution to indicate that the glutamate sniffer is found near to synapses (Figure 1 Suppl 2). They could then move on to describing iGluSnFR localization via super-resolution microscopy and then show how excitatory puncta number are similarly impacted by transfection with GFP, the sniffer, and MAP2.</p><p>The authors should also improve the description of their approach to analyzing the experiments that employed super-resolution microscopy. They describe experiments in which PSD 95 and GFP staining is identified in fixed issue and how they use the DB scan method to identify that this staining is clustered for both PSD and GFP. Some of these sites colocalize. They then go on to use pair correlation to examine the clustering of the iGluSNFR signal and show that it is not uniformly distributed within each of the clusters but highly concentrated close to its centre. It is unclear to me what criteria the authors use to justify describing this as the centre of the synapse (line 111).</p><p>In an earlier review, (question 5) I asked to see a control image from before stimulation of old Figure 1B. The summation projection is now in figure 2A but there is still no control image to illustrate how the fluorescence staining of iGluSNFR increases. Perhaps the authors have a control image for this, or another similar experiment, that could be included in this figure or a supplementary figure.</p><p>On line 155 of the manuscript the authors describe using regions of interest of 2 Âµm in diameter. However, in the methods section they mention ROIs were 2 to 3 Âµm in diameter. Please clarify if there is a discrepancy or the methods are referring to different experiments. Also, please mention if the fluorescence signal captured from the region of interest the sum, average or maximum values from the pixels therein?</p><p>Line 222, can the authors provide a citation confirming that the antagonists CNQX and APV do not interact with iGluSNFR?</p><p>Line 287, can the authors confirm that it is only in the experiments testing probe mobility that they used a 1 Âµm diameter region of interest for bleaching purposes. In all later experiments, using bleaching as a tool did they photobleach the entire field of view and were these same experiments performed using an EM CCD. Please clarify these details in the manuscript. Similarly, is it the case that in the late experiments shown in figure 5 and associated supplementary figure, that the regions of interest were always identified by activity during the evoked phase of the experiment, or were some regions of interest identified during the spontaneous phase? This information could be confirmed in the text to emphasize to the reader that the two segregated detection systems for spontaneous and evoked release are tightly associated.</p><p>Rather surprisingly the authors find the rate of bleaching of evoked signals is unchanged by stimulation during the bleaching. Given that there is no iGluSNFR response, I do not understand the hypothesis advanced concerning low probability of release and unbleached responsive sites mentioned on lines 356-358. The data appear to show that bleaching was saturated after a few minutes of photobleaching with no later responses to stimulation as mentioned in the hypothesis.</p><p>However, I think the experiments using high calcium follow-up are interesting. It seems that the high calcium is reducing the photobleaching in the lack of stimulation compared to the low calcium experiments (Figure 5 supp 1 G). I wonder if the results could also be explained by reduced action potential firing due to reduced excitability in the presence of high calcium. In addition, the bleaching is accelerated in the spontaneous release experiments using high calcium. Presumably this is because of increased rates of spontaneous release. These possibilities should be included in the discussion.</p><p>These differences reported in the rate of recovery of glutamate signaling, vividly underline the authors' thesis that movement of iGluSF was differentially impacted at sites that detect spontaneous and evoked release. Their major result showing that detection of evoked and spontaneous release detected in a 2 Âµm region of interest are so differently affected following bleaching, supports the authors' ideas that there is separation between the postsynaptic pathways mediating evoked and spontaneous release.</p><p>Have the authors estimated what fraction of excitatory synapses in their cultures express the iGluSnFR and how much of the iGluSnFR are not clustered at synapses? The first part of this question may be of interest to others and the second part may help identify the source for the iGluSnFR that reverses the bleaching as the neurons recover. If there was a wide field of bleaching and most of the iGluSnFR is clustered at synapses then one imagines that there is little expressed iGluSnFR to diffuse to the affected areas and maybe new protein formation may be required. Is it possible that the iGluSnFR at evoked sites is more sensitive to bleaching compared to that involved in mini detection and that contributes to the differences observed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As before, the findings of this manuscript are very interesting. The authors addressed many of my concerns with the initial manuscript and have now included the necessary experimental details. I believe that the measurements and experiments conducted in this paper can now be made by other groups and the results understood to support the conclusions of the authors. I believe that supplementary experiments throughout are useful.</p><p>Figure 5 still seems to me to be a critical experiment for the interpretation and I found two parts a little unclear in the revisions, and could benefit from additional edits.</p><p>Line 354-355: &quot;One explanation is basal activityâ¦.&quot; What do you exactly mean by basal activity? Does this mean spontaneous release or action potentials and evoked release occurring independently of your stimulation protocol? From the methods I was under the impression that CNQX and APV were present to block electrical activity outside of field stimulation, so I wanted to be sure you were suggesting spontaneous release, but expansion here would be helpful to know exactly what the authors mean.</p><p>Line 359-360</p><p>&quot;To test the latter hypothesis, we repeated the experiments in a higher extracellularca<sup>2+</sup> of 8 mM. In this condition, probability of release is close to 1, and most synaptic sites should be activated and photobleached.&quot;</p><p>It would be more helpful to include the exact changes in Pr from the paper in these calcium conditions, shifting from (~ 0.5 and 0.9). I could not find the exact number in Figure 2 or the manuscript but estimated from the bar graphs.</p><p>Otherwise, the changes were very helpful and made the manuscript more compelling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76008.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Frequently the reader has to make assumptions about what is being tested and why.

The reviewer is correct, we inadvertently had chosen an outlier for our representative trace. We apologize for this oversight and have removed it and replaced it with one that shows the average evoked changes closer to the ~2x increase in amplitudes (now Figure 2E), as demonstrated in Figure 2I. We have also further elaborated on our rationale for the increased event amplitude at higher calcium concentrations. The release of multiple vesicles has been found across many synapse types in the brain, including excitatory hippocampal synapses, and this form of release is increased when release probabilities are increased (i.e. with increased extracellular calcium). Glutamate diffusion, as modeled by Armbruster et al., (2020), can occur up to 2 Î¼m from the center of the synapse. While puffing glutamate may be useful, it would be difficult to recapitulate the precise manner by which glutamate is released, such as within nanocolumns at evoked release sites, which is critical for the differential effects we observe with photobleaching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

At the single synapse level, evoked release is a binary process that is due to the low probability of release. Both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission involve the release of a single synaptic vesicle at individual synapses.

L269-279. I am surprised and puzzled by the failure of electrical stimulation to influence the rate of photo bleaching. In addition to spillover the authors may wish to explicitly mention why this does not support the idea that receptors involved in spontaneous and evoked release are the same. It seems unlikely that spillover from spontaneous release during this brief time is adequate to activate all of the receptors involved in evoked release. Additional experiments to clarify this finding seem key. Would use of high bath concentrations of calcium increase evoked release sufficiently so that brief periods of stimulation could be tested. Presumably evoked release would be increased proportionately more than spontaneous release, so that less bleaching may occur in the control experiment sounds stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. One explanation as to why electrical stimulation during photobleaching did not further increase the bleaching of evoked responses is the low release probability of hippocampal synapses. Many release sites were likely not activated during the stimulation and thus could not be bleached. To test this idea, we increased the probability of release by increasing extracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 8 mM. In these conditions, detection of evoked responses was photobleached more when stimulation was applied during photobleaching (these results are shown in the new Supp. Figure 2I-J), thus indicating that electrical stimulation does influence the rate of photobleaching indeed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this is an exciting and potentially very impactful study. The work presented is of very high quality and there is great interest in understanding spontaneous vs evoked release. Because this study is extremely technical in nature, there are a number of technical and methodological points that need some additional clarification and consideration to properly interpret the findings.</p><p>â An interesting and central finding of this study is that iGluSnFR appears to be concentrated at synapses. This seems counter intuitive. Synaptic real estate is so in demand and many molecules have specific targeting mechanisms to bring them to the synapse. How does iGluSnFR end up concentrated at the synapses without a specific synapse targeting mechanism? Is this finding solely based on imaging data gathered during high frequency stimulation? If so, one could argue that GluSnFR is not enriched in synapses but is just highly active during intense neuronal activity. Some clarification on GluSnFR protein vs GluSnFR signal localization would improve this argument.</p></disp-quote><p>The STORM imaging was done on fixed hippocampal cultures. To identify iGluSnFR, we immunolabled the GFP protein that is a part of the iGluSnFR molecule to stain them for STORM imaging. Thus, we are not using the fluorescence of iGluSnFR itself but rather labeling all of the iGluSnFR proteins, and not just the ones that are near glutamate release sites. We apologize for the confusion in our initial explanation and hope the improved language in the revised manuscript is more clear. As for why we might see iGluSnFR at a more concentrated level at synapses, our findings suggest that the mechanical trapping of those very synaptic molecules may actually increase the density of iGluSnFR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Second similar question â does the synaptic enrichment of GluSnFR fully recover after photobleaching and if so on what timescale? Because GluSnFR uses a DF/F approach to detect glutamate, it would be helpful in interpreting the evoked vs spontaneous FRAP recovery data to see the recovery of basal fluorescence (as in Figure 1C, expressed in AU) vs the ability to detect glutamate (as in the rest of the figures, expressed in DF/F).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question. Synaptic enrichment was observed via STORM and seems to be independent of the activation of iGluSnFR by glutamate. The FRAP experiments on live cells suggest that iGluSnFR are trapped at evoked subsynaptic sites, but they do not provide information as to whether the synaptic enrichment is lost. Based on our experiments we speculate that synaptic enrichment of proteins in general is not altered (since electrophysiological parameters remain unchanged).</p><p>Whether the basal fluorescence changes as a result of photobleaching is an interesting question. We analyzed how the pre-photobleaching baseline fluorescence compares to the post-photobleaching baseline fluorescence.

ROIs used for quantifying GluSnRF activity in the synapse used a 2-3 Î¼m diameter ROI. If the photobleaching was centered over the active zone of the synapse, it stands to reason that the region associated with evoked release (central within the synapse) and the region associated with spontaneous release (peripheral within the synapse) are not equally photobleached. That could explain some of the data and should be considered as a potential caveat. Have the authors considered using a larger area of photobleaching to completely bleach everything in the synaptic ROI?</p></disp-quote><p>The FRAP experiments shown in Figure 4 were performed using a confocal microscope, and only the fluorescence changes inside the bleached ROI were analyzed (although a neighboring unbleached region was used as control for normalization). We did not do any analysis of evoked or spontaneous neurotransmission combined with FRAP. The experiments shown in Figure 5 were performed in an epifluorescence microscope, since this allows for the monitoring of multiple synapses (50-100) with low phototoxicity (since the experiments analyzing neurotransmission are long). The whole field of view was photobleached, which allowed the analysis of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission at the same dendritic spines before and after bleaching. For the experiments analyzing neurotransmission, the subsynaptic regions responding to evoked and spontaneous release are equally photobleached.

Was there a signal to noise threshold used to identify events from noise? Were spontaneous events captured before or after evoked? Was that switched to control for the potential effects of stimulation of spontaneous release?</p></disp-quote><p>The same ROIs were used for evoked and spontaneous release analysis. The SNR threshold was 3 SD above baseline for both evoked and spontaneous. Spontaneous events were captured before evoked to avoid potential confounding effects of stimulation, as shown in Figure 5A. We stimulated at a frequency of 0.2 Hz, which is not sufficient to induce plasticity. We also performed control experiments in which we measured evoked release before spontaneous and it did not affect the results (data not shown).

Using TTX is the standard in the field for isolating action-potential independent events. I see that it allows them to do their stimulation experiments in the same cultures as their evoked experiments, which is essential to their study, but it leaves open the possibility that some spontaneous events are AP-associated. Have the authors made recordings from neurons in glutamate synaptic blockers and shown that 100% of the AP are absent? That would be a helpful control to validate their method.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested whether the spontaneous event frequency in cultures with CNQX and APV was different to CNQX, APV and TTX. We found no significant difference in these two groups, suggesting that there is no significant contribution of action potentials when CNQX and APV are added in the imaging solution (Figure 3F). Furthermore, in earlier work our group has analyzed the frequency of spontaneous event as detected by presynaptic vGlut1-pHluorin fluorescence (Leitz and Kavalali, 2014) or postsynaptic GCAMP6-PSD95 fluorescence (Reese and Kavalali, 2016) in the presence of TTX or CNQX (also AP5 is some cases). These experiments showed that suppression of network activity with CNQX is sufficient to block AP firing and thus isolate genuine spontaneous events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â GluSnFR detection of evoked release is suppressed for hours after photobleaching while the ability to detect spontaneous release using GluSnFR recovers much more rapidly. This is a very clear and exciting finding! An implication of this result, however, is that 100% of the events that contribute to evoked release are spatially compartmentalized from any of the machinery that drives the ability to detect spontaneous release. Spontaneous release is detected using the same ROIs as evoked release (as far as I can tell), so that means within an ROI spontaneous release is being detected while evoked is not. Data presented shows that glutamate release is happening in both situations, but just can't be detected in the evoked release situation due to the photobleaching. So evoked release is somehow spatially restricted to the GluSnFR molecules in the synapse and cannot be detected by other GluSnFR molecules that detect spontaneous release in the same ROI. This is hard to reconcile with the fact that glutamate diffusion is likely the driving factor by which glutamate is cleared from the center of synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We agree, our interpretation is also that the postsynaptic regions that respond to evoked glutamate release are compartmentalized, i.e. spatially segregated from spontaneous, and have less lateral mobility.</p><p>Regarding glutamate diffusion, diffusion of glutamate at the synaptic cleft has been proposed to be slower than in solution or in non-synaptic regions (~0.5-0.7 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/ms). These values still lead to diffusion outside the synapse in just a few milliseconds, consistent with electrophysiological and optical measurements. However, the glutamate concentration nanodomain at the cleft seems to be extremely narrow and short lived. Glutamate can reach a concentration close to 1 mM for ~50-100 Âµs in a small 100-250 nm region at the cleft, and concentration drastically decays laterally. This model agrees with the experimental observation that postsynaptic glutamate receptors are not saturated by single AP stimulations, and would support the nanodomains or subsynaptic compartmentalization of signaling at synapses. Taken together, these previous antecedents are not contradictory, but rather agree with our current observations.</p><p>Bibliography used: Zheng et al., Scientific Reports 2017; Budisantoso et al., J.

This is an important question and an interesting central finding. The authors nicely document the use of a glutamate-sensitive fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR) to measure spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion. They do a great job of characterizing iGluSnFR and take advantage of the probe's rapid bleaching to follow up previous molecular and physiological characterization of spontaneous vesicle fusion with novel findings of unique spatial segregation of spontaneous vesicle fusion. This finding is mainly based on this bleaching characteristic of GluSnFR. I was impressed by the idea of using the bleaching of a membrane probe to resolve the location of vesicle fusion. I have some questions and comments that I believe are important to be addressed to better understand the findings and their interpretation for an accepted manuscript.</p><p>1. iGluSnFR has a very high affinity to provide it with the sensitivity for detecting single vesicle fusion. A concern would be if the sensor is also detecting vesicle fusion as spillover from adjacent boutons of untransfected neurons undergoing spontaneous release. This concern is somewhat mitigated since the rate of spontaneous release is not much higher than expected from electrophysiology and good criteria are deployed for detection of events vs noise. However given that location is so important for the interpretation, these &quot;spill-over&quot; events could appear to be released from unique discrete areas of the synaptic bouton but are in fact coming from nearby synapses and the diffusing glutamate is being detected. A better characterization of the location of where spontaneous events were detected optically in the synapse relative to evoked might help resolve this concern. Were the ROIs formed from high frequency stimulation (or high potassium?) also in the same location for measuring spontaneous release? Were spontaneous vesicle fusions also detected outside of synapses identified by stimulation that might suggest spillover or solely restricted to regions with evoked release identified on dendrites?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. the same ROIs were used for evoked and spontaneous release measurements and thus evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission was monitored in the same location. We did not draw ROIs on dendritic shafts or cell bodies, only dendritic spines. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors lead me to believe that GluSnFR bleaching is primarily dependent on activation of the indicator by glutamate binding. The difference in bleaching from glutamate perfusion compared to during rest or &quot;no stimulation&quot; for selectively impairing detection of evoked vs spontaneous release is striking and really interesting. That being said, it is very hard to understand the explanation the authors provide for the lack of difference between unstimulated and stimulated bleaching conditions. A difference here seems like the most direct experimental test to define separate release sites for evoked and spontaneous. If I understand the authors correctly, the lack of difference is the result of the spontaneous release of glutamate that contaminates this result. However, spontaneous release has a very low rate and would be releasing very small amounts of glutamate over the bleaching times identified. During 2 minutes of photobleaching when a very acute difference is found the rate of 0.1 Hz for spontaneous release the authors measured would mean that synapses experience on average 1 spontaneous vesicle fusion event during 2 minutes of photobleaching. This one release event would not be localized to sites of evoked release as the authors interpret the data yet would cause substantial bleaching equivalent to several vesicles fusing during stimulation. As it stands, 30 APs delivered during standard imaging over 2.5 minutes don't seem to cause any bleaching or decrease in detection efficiency (Figure 5A). To better understand the amount of bleaching that occurs in the three conditions, it would be useful to know both the difference in the illumination intensity between standard measurements and during photobleaching as well as the changes in resting fluorescence iat the synapse/ROIs. Presumably at the bleaching laser illumination power the same delivery of 30 APs @ 0.2 Hz (2.5 minutes) would rapidly decrease to very low levels if this interpretation of rapid bleaching when glutamate in present is correct. Otherwise, bleaching of GluSnFR doesn't require glutamate and perhaps another unknown property of local GluSnFR diffusion within a spine that the authors mention is responsible for the lack of difference in bleaching sensitivity to boutons at rest vs stimulation. This could still be in line with the authors' interpretation of unique release sites for evoked neurotransmission, but less easy to understand than selective loss from use of evoked release sites by glutamate dependent photobleaching. Perhaps lowering the &quot;bleaching&quot; laser intensity during stimulation would ablate/bleach detection of evoked release during stimulation that also preserves spontaneous release detection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We think that one possible explanation for the lack of difference between unstimulated and stimulated bleaching conditions is the low release probability of hippocampal synapses. Many release sites were probably not activated during the stimulation, which is why they could not be bleached. To test this hypothesis, we raised bath ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 8 mM to increase release probability. In high ca<sup>2+</sup>, iGluSnFR evoked responses were more highly reduced in the stimulated photobleaching condition compared to the unstimulated one (these results are shown in the new Supp. Figure 2I), thus indicating that electrical stimulation does influence the rate of photo bleaching and that evoked subsynaptic sites may be segregated from spontaneous ones.</p><p>Between imaging and photobleaching, we use different light intensities. During photobleaching, we remove the neutral density filter within the Î-DG4 illumination system to increase the emission light intensity to 100%. We have included this information in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the baseline fluorescence before and after photobleaching as well as with and without stimulation. While we see that baseline fluorescence is affected by photobleaching, indicating that tonically and spontaneously activated iGluSnFR is also bleached, stimulating during the photobleaching does not differentially affect this decrease (new Supp. Figure 3J).</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This resubmission describes work using a genetically encoded glutamate sniffer to study synaptic transmission in hippocampal cultured neurons.

The first part of this question may be of interest to others and the second part may help identify the source for the iGluSnFR that reverses the bleaching as the neurons recover. If there was a wide field of bleaching and most of the iGluSnFR is clustered at synapses then one imagines that there is little expressed iGluSnFR to diffuse to the affected areas and maybe new protein formation may be required. Is it possible that the iGluSnFR at evoked sites is more sensitive to bleaching compared to that involved in mini detection and that contributes to the differences observed?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done these estimations before; however, there is clearly an extrasynaptic pool as indicated in the representative image in figure 2 showing baseline fluorescence at the plasma membrane due to activation from basal levels of extracellular glutamate. Furthermore, the version of iGluSnFR we use is not targeted and thus would be expressed across the entire plasma membrane. Thus, it is expected that there is a large amount of iGluSnFR not clustered at synapses. Furthermore, we do not necessarily claim nor know that every synaptic site contains a detectable cluster of iGluSnFR.</p><p>Indeed, iGluSnFR at evoked sites is more sensitive to photobleaching compared to spontaneous bleaching, and this is because the iGluSnFR at evoked release sites does not have as much access to the extrasynaptic pool as spontaneous release sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As before, the findings of this manuscript are very interesting. The authors addressed many of my concerns with the initial manuscript and have now included the necessary experimental details. I believe that the measurements and experiments conducted in this paper can now be made by other groups and the results understood to support the conclusions of the authors. I believe that supplementary experiments throughout are useful.</p><p>Figure 5 still seems to me to be a critical experiment for the interpretation and I found two parts a little unclear in the revisions, and could benefit from additional edits.</p><p>Line 354-355: &quot;One explanation is basal activityâ¦.&quot; What do you exactly mean by basal activity? Does this mean spontaneous release or action potentials and evoked release occurring independently of your stimulation protocol? From the methods I was under the impression that CNQX and APV were present to block electrical activity outside of field stimulation, so I wanted to be sure you were suggesting spontaneous release, but expansion here would be helpful to know exactly what the authors mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We meant spontaneous release (not triggered by action potentials), and we have included this phrase to improve the clarity of this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 359-360</p><p>&quot;To test the latter hypothesis, we repeated the experiments in a higher extracellularca<sup>2+</sup> of 8 mM.
