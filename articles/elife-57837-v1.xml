of cellular respiration that can promote oxidative stress and damage cellular proteins and lipids. One canonical role of ROS is to defend the cell against invading bacterial and viral pathogens. Curiously, some viruses, including herpesviruses, thrive despite the induction of ROS, suggesting that ROS are beneficial for the virus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that ROS impaired interferon response during murine herpesvirus infection and that the inhibition occurred downstream of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We further demonstrated that ROS suppressed the type I interferon response by oxidizing Cysteine 147 on murine stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an ER-associated protein that mediates interferon response after cytoplasmic DNA sensing. This inhibited STING polymerization and activation of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that redox regulation of Cysteine 147 of mouse STING, which is equivalent to Cysteine 148 of human STING, controls interferon production. Together, our findings reveal that ROS orchestrates anti-viral immune responses, which can be exploited by viruses to evade cellular defenses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>STING</kwd><kwd>herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>redox regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI130020-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Lili</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guoxun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarek</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Alexandria</given-names></name><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Tiffany A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17SDG33670071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Lili</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guoxun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarek</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Alexandria</given-names></name><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Tiffany A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Tiffany A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP200118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Lili</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guoxun</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarek</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Alexandria</given-names></name><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Tiffany A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Redox modification of STING represents a novel target for interferon regulation and control of herpesvirus replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are reactive chemicals generated primarily in mitochondria as a byproduct of oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>). Due to their capacity to inactivate DNA, proteins and lipids, ROS induce cell death and defend cells against many pathogens. However, accumulating evidence suggests that ROS also control cellular signaling pathways. ROS regulation of signal transduction allows cellular pathways to rapidly adapt to changes in the oxidative environment.</p><p>Even though some pathogens are effectively controlled by ROS, other pathogens thrive in a cellular environment where ROS are abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paiva and Bozza, 2014</xref>). For instance, DNA viruses such as Kaposiâs sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), all induce oxidative stress in cells. Moreover, treatment with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduces viral burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paiva and Bozza, 2014</xref>). In the case of herpesviruses, ROS not only enhance replication, but also induce virus reactivation from latency and potentially contribute to virally induced cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzalez-Dosal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2011</xref>). The underlying mechanism for ROS promotion of virus replication and reactivation remains to be investigated. One possibility is that ROS regulate the signaling pathways that activate the immune response to these viruses, in particular, the DNA sensing pathways.</p><p>DNA normally localizes to the nucleus, and the presence of DNA in the cytosol serves as a universal danger signal to activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that distinguish self from non-self. Upon virus infection, cytosolic DNA is recognized by DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which catalyzes formation of an atypical cyclic di-nucleotide second messenger 2â²,3â²-cGAMP. 2â²,3â²-cGAMP binds and activates the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) to induce production of type I interferon (IFN) and stimulate an immune response that promotes virus clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu and Chen, 2014</xref>). Structural analysis of STING suggests that STING polymerization is necessary for its activation and that some cysteine residues may mediate STING polymerization by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shang et al., 2019</xref>). The chemical nature of cysteines is such that these residues are regulated by redox modifications, such as oxidation. However, post-translational modifications on STING cysteines have not been identified.</p><p>Because herpesviruses are DNA viruses that induce ROS and engage the cGAS/STING pathway, we hypothesized that ROS antagonize the production of interferon downstream of cGAS/STING during herpesvirus infection. Here, we found that ROS increased replication of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68), a close genetic relative of KSHV and EBV. We also found that ROS suppressed interferon production in a STING-dependent manner. We further showed that the murine STING cysteine residue, C147 (equivalent to human C148), was oxidized upon ROS-inducing menadione treatment and that this cysteine was required for oxidation-sensitive inhibition of STING. Collectively, our results suggested that redox modification of STING is an important regulatory mechanism for STING activity during viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ROS promote herpesvirus replication in macrophages</title><p>To determine if ROS promote a cellular environment conducive to virus replication, we used menadione as a tool to manipulate the level of ROS in cells. Menadione, also known as vitamin K3, is partially reduced by complex I in the mitochondria. The resulting semiquinone then participates in a redox cycle to partially reduce molecular oxygen, which generates ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iyanagi and Yamazaki, 1970</xref>). Although prolonged treatment of a high dose of menadione leads to cell death, we determined a dose of menadione in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that induced no significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further, short-term treatment with menadione did not induce significant cell death even at a relatively high dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Menadione treatment is reported to reduce the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio and increase accumulated cellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loor et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with these reports, we observed decreased gene expression of glutathione-disulfide reductase (<italic>Gsr</italic>) and glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (<italic>Gclm1</italic>) with low-dose of menadione treatment. Therefore, menadione treatment of macrophages resulted in elevated oxidant levels in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ROS promote herpesvirus replication in macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Fully differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with vehicle or differentÂ concentrations of menadione as indicated.

To test the effects of ROS on virus replication, we first treated macrophages with low doses of menadione for sixteen hours, which increased cellular ROS while maintaining cell viability before virus infection. Macrophages were then infected with MHV68 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and virus growth was determined at indicated time points. Menadione treatment increased replication of MHV68 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a membrane permeable ROS, which induces secondary ROS production in cells upon extended treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher, 2009</xref>). We pretreated macrophages with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at different concentrations for sixteen hours. The pretreatment was done in media containing FBS to maintain a cellular environment conducive to virus replication. We then infected macrophages with MHV68 at MOIÂ ofÂ 5. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells expressing MHV68 lytic proteins were quantified using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reese et al., 2014</xref>). Treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the percentage of lytic protein positive cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Similar to menadione treatment, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose-dependently repressed transcription of <italic>Ifnb</italic> after DMXAA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Addition of NAC after H<sub>2</sub>O2 partially rescued <italic>Ifnb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest thatÂ ROS directly inhibited interferon production downstream of cGAS sensing.</p><p>Our next question was whether ROS inhibit interferon production in non-macrophage cell types. ROS production is a critical effector mechanism for macrophages to fend off microbial challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Acker and Coenye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang, 2011</xref>). However, the high levels of ROS produced by macrophages requires the existence of intrinsic protective mechanisms against ROS, which otherwise would result in premature death of these immune cells during inflammatory responses. Indeed, macrophages are equipped with multiple mechanisms that allow them to be more resistant to ROS than other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VirÃ¡g et al., 2019</xref>). To test whether ROS inhibition of interferon production is a general immunoregulatory mechanism that functions in cells other than macrophages, we pulsed primary fibroblasts with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the same concentration as we used in macrophages, followed by activation of STING with DMXAA. The expression of <italic>Ifnb</italic> in fibroblasts was not repressed, but rather slightly increased by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that MEFs are more susceptible toÂ ROS, which induces mitochondrial DNA fragmentation and primes interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">West et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, ROS may negatively regulate interferon response in a cell-type and concentration dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Endogenous ROS regulate interferon response</title><p>Because ROS are constantly generated by cellular respiration, cells contain low levels of ROS in the absence of exogenous stimulation. We therefore tested if endogenous ROS regulate the interferon response after STING activation. We first pretreated mouse macrophages with NAC to deplete endogenous ROS, then infected cells with MHV68. We observed elevated <italic>Ifnb</italic> and ISG expression with NAC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We also observed increased <italic>Ifnb</italic> transcripts when macrophages were cotreated with NAC and DMXAA, compared with DMXAA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Peroxisomes are metabolically active organelles and are an important source of ROS in macrophages.

STING is a transmembrane protein anchored on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a dimer in the absence of stimulation. Upon activation, STING undergoes a conformational change and rearranges to form a polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka and Chen, 2012</xref>). It is then transported to the Golgi complex where it recruits TBK1, leading to TBK1 phosphorylation. STING also serves as a scaffolding protein to specify phosphorylation of IRF3 by phosphorylated TBK1 (pTBK1). Phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) translocates to the nucleus and induces IFNÎ² transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu and Chen, 2014</xref>).

Menadione increased virus growth in WT macrophages but had no effect on virus growth in STING-deficient macrophages, supporting our hypothesis that ROS inhibited interferon in a STING-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We subsequently determined if polymerization of STING was regulated by ROS, because STING polymerization is an early event in STING activation that occurs prior to translocation to the ER. In the absence of stimulus, STING monomers spontaneously form dimers. This process does not involve covalent linkage between the monomers. In contrast, STING polymerization requires the formation of interdimer disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, polymerized STING appears as a dimer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE, as SDS disrupts only the non-covalent interactions, leaving covalent disulfide bonds between the monomers intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

However, polymerization was significantly inhibited by menadione treatment, and restored by the addition of NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As a result of decreased STING polymerization, the recruitment of TBK1 upon DMXAA stimulation was also diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Recent structural studies suggest that STING polymerization and activation require formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond at Cysteine 148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>). The ability of C148-C148 disulfide bonds to bridge STING dimers suggests that the residue harbors a free thiol prior to stimulation. Because free thiol functional groups are susceptible to oxidation, we hypothesized that ROS inhibit STING function by oxidizing this free thiol group. To test this hypothesis, we treated human STING (hSTING) overexpressing fibroblast cells with menadione or hydrogen peroxide, followed by labeling of free thiols on STING with 5-iodoacetamido-fluorescein (5-IAF) in cell lysate. We then immunoprecipitated STING protein and blotted for STING and fluorescein (FITC). Treatment with either menadione or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreased the level of free thiols on STING, measured as decreased FITC signal relative to STING protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, we treated mouse macrophages with diamide, a reagent that specifically oxidizes free thiols to form disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kosower and Kosower, 1995</xref>). Although diamide treatment induced formation of the STING polymer, such polymers were likely not functional because STING activation requires ligand-induced conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shang et al., 2019</xref>). This was consistent with our observation that diamide treated macrophages failed to phosphorylate TBK1 and upregulate <italic>Ifnb</italic> upon DMXAA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

However, the function of ROS in DNA sensing pathways has not been investigated. Here, we found that ROS regulate cytoplasmic DNA sensing by inhibiting STING activity during herpesvirus infection. ROS suppressed the activation of STING, as well as the activation of TBK1 and IRF3, thus leading to reduced IFNÎ² transcription. Importantly, we also determined that ROS oxidized a particular cysteine residue, C147, of murine STING. When we mutated the equivalent human C148 residue, diamide was no longer able to oxidize STING and form functional polymers, suggesting that redox regulation of STING required this cysteine residue. We also explored the functional consequence of ROS regulation of STING activity in vivo and demonstrated that treatment of mice during herpesvirus infection with either an inducer of ROS or a neutralizer of ROS, increased or decreased MHV68 replication in mice, respectively. Consistent with these findings, a ROS inducer inhibited interferon production during herpesvirus infection in a STING dependent manner. Our work suggests that redox modification of STING is an important mechanism for regulating STING activity, which may explain how herpesviruses manipulate STING signaling and reduce interferon levels to support their replication. Notably, elevated ROS levels in the context of viral infection is of high clinical relevance, as ROS is increased in elderly people as well as in many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, lung fibrosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurundkar and Thannickal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Pietro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saadatian-Elahi et al., 2020</xref>).

On one hand, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which drives the expression of antioxidant genes, decreases STING-induced interferon and thus increases susceptibility to herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunderstofte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olagnier et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, many cysteine oxidative modifications are reversible, making them ideal for initiating and terminating signals. Redox modification can also be either activating or inhibiting for protein function. For example, sulfenylation of the EGFR catalytic site enhances kinase activity whereas oxidation-induced disulfide bond formation inactivates MKK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paulsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wani et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports indicate that cysteine residues of STING may form disulfide-containing polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">JÃ¸nsson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Motani et al., 2015</xref>).

C148 is important for forming disulfide bridges between STING dimers, leading to the formation of stabilized polymers in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ergun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shang et al., 2019</xref>). When C148 is oxidized, STING no longer forms stable polymers, thereby preventing recruitment and activation of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, our data do not distinguish whether oxidized STING can still bind to cGAMP or if oxidation prevents cGAMP binding and conformational change of STING dimers.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of ROS modification of STING.</title><p>Increasing ROS leads to oxidation of free thiol on C148 of human STING and C147 of mouse STING. This prevents polymerization of STING upon binding of 2â,3â-cGAMP and leads to reduced interferon production.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57837-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Some pathogens may have evolved to take advantage of ROS to inhibit cellular defenses. Indeed, multiple herpesviruses induce oxidative stress in infected cells and ROS promote virus replication in vitro. Using a mouse model gammaherpesvirus, MHV68, we demonstrated that in vivo treatment of mice with menadione to induce ROS increased virus replication and treatment of mice with NAC to inhibit ROS suppressed virus replication. The effects of menadione and NAC treatments were relatively modest in these in vivo experiments. However, our results are consistent with previous reports that PRRs other than STING also participate in the control of MHV68 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, another group showed that implantation of KSHV-infected cells into mice and treatment with NAC inhibits lytic replication of this human gammaherpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2011</xref>). Further work is required to determine if ROS inhibition of cytoplasmic DNA sensing promotes reactivation of herpesviruses from latency in vivo and whether particular herpesvirus-encoded genes alter the ROS levels in the cell.</p><p>Consistent with our data that STING undergoes redox modification, a recent study demonstrates that glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), an enzyme that protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and maintains redox homeostasis, is required for the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. This report also shows that GPX4 is required for innate immune responses against herpes simplex virus 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). These data, along with our data, support a model whereby ROS promote DNA virus acute replication in a STING-dependent manner.</p><p>Oxidative inhibition of STING may also be important for preventing overactivation of the interferon response due to other sources of cytosolic DNA, not just viral infection. Mitochondrial damage and release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm activates the cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McArthur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">West et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of cellular caspases, mtDNA induces type I interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, many of the stimuli that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and release of mtDNA also produce mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willems et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). Redox regulation of STING may represent a negative regulatory mechanism to limit aberrant production of type I interferon.</p><p>Multiple autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are associated with increased production of interferon and are termed type I interferonopathies. These monogenic diseases are driven by mutations in DNases or STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>). Particularly, the rare autoinflammatory disease called STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes STING, <italic>TMEM173</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Of the six patients identified with SAVI, all had point mutations in close proximity to C148, with one patient having a V147L mutation. It is therefore plausible that this region is important for negatively regulating STING activity and normalizing the âbasalâ or tonic levels of interferon in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gough et al., 2012</xref>). We found that NAC treatment of macrophages prior to viral infection increased <italic>Ifnb</italic> transcript levels but did not significantly alter MHV68 growth. The small change in basal ROS with NAC treatment may be insufficient to suppress virus replication. However, changes in the low level of endogenous ROS in cells could regulate basal interferon through STING activation and could contribute interferonopathies over the long term.</p><p>Altogether, our results identify a critical post-translational modification of STING and indicate that redox regulation of STING is important for innate immune responses against certain DNA viruses. The cysteine at position 147 in mice and 148 in humans is a critical cysteine for STING polymer formation and activation. Identifying the post-translational modifications of STING contributes not only to our understanding of the basic biology of the cGAS/STING pathway but is also critical for identifying novel immunotherapies to target interferon production.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

but can also promote replication of certain DNA viruses. The study describes the molecular mechanisms that drive ROS-dependent virus replication. Using MHV68 as model system the authors show that ROS impairs interferon response during infection and that the inhibition occurs downstream of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. Moreover, they identify that ROS suppresses the type I interferon response by oxidation of Cysteine-147 of mouse STING/Cysteine-148 of human STING. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that redox modification of STING is an important regulatory mechanism for STING activity during viral infection.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Reactive Oxygen Species Oxidize STING and Suppress Interferon Production&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your manuscript was evaluated by three reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviews are generally supportive of your results, but they raised several questions that need to be addressed in revised manuscript. Although reviewers did not explicitly ask for additional experiments, you are welcome to include new data if you feel they would be helpful in addressing reviewers' questions.</p><p>Below please find the summary of concerns raised by reviewers.</p><p>The presented findings are novel and relevant for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. The experiments are overall well performed and the data seem scientifically sound. The manuscript is well written and the conclusions are supported by the data, but some conclusions need clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As mentioned by the authors, herpesviruses have been described to induce ROS in phagocytic cells. In multiple figures the authors show that Menadione increases virus replication in multi-step growth curves in BMDM, indicating that virus-induced ROS does not reach maximum levels. Unclear is, whether high levels of ROS induced by Menadione treatment is relevant during virus infection. Can the authors discuss this and relate it to virus infection in vivo?</p><p>2) MHV68 has a broad tropism, including phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Throughout the paper bone marrow derived macrophages were used â are these findings applicable to other non-phagocytic cell types as well?</p><p>3) In Figure 4B a western blot for pTBK1 and pIRF3 is shown. The pIRF3 blot doesn't look similar to Figure 2A (pIRF3 seems constitutively expressed). Is this a typo?</p><p>4) The authors identify murine STING C147 to be oxidized upon menadione treatment using LC-MS/MS. Additionally, they show that the human STING C148A mutant is unable to form dimers in response to diamide. Even though these 2 lines of evidence indicate that C147 can be oxidized, the graphs presented in Figure 5E do not directly show oxidation of C147. Please include m/z graphs that show evidence for C147 oxidation.</p><p>5) The results on MHV68 infection in vivo show relatively modest differences, in particular in conditions treated with NAC. Day 4 post infection in the NAC treated group seem to contain 2 populations of animals, one population that has similar MHV68 levels compared to vehicle group and one population that shows potent viral control. Are there differences within the group? In the Materials and methods section, the authors do not give information on the gender and age used in the experiments. Are there differences in gender and age within the different experimental groups? Does the graph show a representative experiment or are there multiple experiments pooled?</p><p>6) Figure 7 shows an insightful model on the proposed function of ROS on STING function. The data presented in the manuscript show that oxidized C147 cannot form dimers (Figure 4E), but the model still suggests a dimer. In addition, the interpretation would be improved if C147 is indicated on the STING molecules. Appropriate modifications are needed.</p><p>7) The authors used serum-free media in Figures 4 and 5 but did not elaborate, what is the reason for carrying out those experiments specifically under this condition?</p><p>8) It is intriguing to see that the viral loads appear comparable between the WT and STING-KO BMDMs in Figure 4D. Is the same situation with IFN levels?</p><p>9) The authors solely relied on Western blotting of STING on native-gel to assess STING oligomerization and activation, other complementary assays such as STING translocation or/and STING/TBK1 complexes should be considered. For example, the STING blot in Figure 5B does not seem correlative of p-TBK1, and menadione alone apparently triggered STING oligomerization, but not p-TBK1.</p><p>10) For the in vivo MHV68 infection study, the IFN response should be measured; ideally, STING-KO mice should be used as well.</p><p>11) To study the regulatory effect of endogenously produced ROS, the authors treated mouse macrophages with the antioxidant NAC and then infected with MHV68. Under such conditions enhanced interferon-beta induction was detected, whereas MHV68 growth was not significantly affected. Thus, the presented data are not suitable to fully explain the regulatory role of endogenously produced ROS. The authors should consider formulating the respective conclusive chapters more cautiously.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57837.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As mentioned by the authors, herpesviruses have been described to induce ROS in phagocytic cells.

Unlike some bacterial pathogens, herpesviruses do not potently induce ROS production (Ma et al., 2012). Too high of a ROS level triggers reactivation of Î³ herpesvirus, which may disrupt the establishment of life-long latency in the host (Ye et al., 2011). As such, it is plausible that viruses evolve to not elicit a maximal amount of ROS production during infection. Importantly, elevated ROS levels in the context of viral infection are highly relevant, as ROS are increased in elderly people as well as in many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and cancer (Ma et al., 2012). This could suggest that, in these individuals, the antiviral responses are repressed, and Î³ herpesvirus infection are controlled less efficiently, leading to poorer clinical outcomes (Delgado-Roche and Mesta, 2020).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the possible impact of diseases associated with ROS on anti-viral response to the first paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) MHV68 has a broad tropism, including phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Throughout the paper bone marrow derived macrophages were used â are these findings applicable to other non-phagocytic cell types as well?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether our findings are applicable to non-phagocytic cells, we performed experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Briefly, we pretreated MEFs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to increase intracellular ROS and induced STING activation with DMXAA. Pretreating MEFs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the same dose as we treated macrophages (200 ÂµM) did not inhibit <italic>Ifnb</italic> expression but rather slightly increased it. While high levels of ROS inhibit interferon production in macrophages, a similar ROS dose could prime anti-viral responses by causing mitochondrial and genomic DNA fragmentation in non-phagocytic cells (West et al., 2015). This is consistent with the notion that macrophages are more resistant to ROS damages than other cell types because they constantly produce ROS (Virag et al., 2019). This new data has been added to the revised manuscript as Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 (subsection âROS inhibits interferon response upon STING activationâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4B a western blot for pTBK1 and pIRF3 is shown. The pIRF3 blot doesn't look similar to Figure 2A (pIRF3 seems constitutively expressed). Is this a typo?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight. It was a typo. Rather than pIRF3, this should be labeled as a loading control SDHA. We have corrected the mistake in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors identify murine STING C147 to be oxidized upon menadione treatment using LC-MS/MS.

Day 4 post infection in the NAC treated group seem to contain 2 populations of animals, one population that has similar MHV68 levels compared to vehicle group and one population that shows potent viral control. Are there differences within the group? In the Materials and methods section, the authors do not give information on the gender and age used in the experiments. Are there differences in gender and age within the different experimental groups? Does the graph show a representative experiment or are there multiple experiments pooled?</p></disp-quote><p>In all animal experiments, mice were 8-12 weeks old and randomly assigned to each group in a sex-matched manner prior to the experiment. The data shown in Figure 6B, in which we measured MHV68 infection with menadione treatment, were the results obtained from a pool of 2 independent animal experiments. However, the data initially shown in Figure 6C, in which we measured MHV68 infection with NAC treatment, were from 1 experiment. To better assess the treatment effect of NAC, we conducted an additional animal experiment and updated Figure 6C. In this pooled experiment, where animals were assigned with similar age and gender-matched in each group, NAC treatment still inhibited MHV68 replication. The modest effect of in vivo experiments is consistent with previous reports that PRRs other than cGAS also participate in the control of MHV68 infection (Bussey et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2015). We have updated and provided more details in both the main figure legend, the Materials and methods section and the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 7 shows an insightful model on the proposed function of ROS on STING function. The data presented in the manuscript show that oxidized C147 cannot form dimers (Figure 4E), but the model still suggests a dimer. In addition, the interpretation would be improved if C147 is indicated on the STING molecules. Appropriate modifications are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify our findings and model. In our central model, STING exists as a dimer in apo state, but cannot form polymers upon stimulation in the presence of elevated levels of ROS. At resting state, STING is a dimeric protein which is formed by non-covalent bonds and can be disrupted by SDS treatment. Ligand binding alters the conformation of STING and triggers its oligomerization through the formation of covalent disulfide bonds. The disulfide bonds are resistant to SDS treatment but sensitive to reducing reagents. As such, STING proteins that are manifested as monomers and dimers on non-reducing SDS PAGE gels are actually dimers and oligomers, respectively (Ergun et al., 2019). To clarify our findings and model, we added text (subsection âROS regulate interferon response by inhibiting STING polymerizationâ) and schematic diagrams to demonstrate theoretical band sizes under various gel conditions (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1) and labeled C147 on STING molecules in an updated Figure 7 in the revised manuscript. We also added a statement in the Discussion (fourth paragraph) to indicate that our data does not tell us whether oxidation of STING prevents cGAMP binding and/or conformational change of STING dimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors used serum-free media in Figures 4 and 5 but did not elaborate, what is the reason for carrying out those experiments specifically under this condition?</p></disp-quote><p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can be decomposed by catalase in serum. In order to maintain a stable concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we treated cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing serum-free medium for a short period of time. The only exception is when we used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for virus growth assay, in which case serum is essential for maintaining the appropriate cell status for virus growth. We have added a specific paragraph regarding chemical treatment to the Materials and methods section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is intriguing to see that the viral loads appear comparable between the WT and STING-KO BMDMs in Figure 4D. Is the same situation with IFN levels?</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison between WT and STING-KO viral loads revealed that MHV68 replicated to a significantly higher titer in STING-KO BMDMs (Figure 4D). Notably, menadione treatment increased MHV68 growth in WT macrophages to a similar level as observed in STING-KO macrophages. However, menadione treatment did not further increased viral load in STING-KO macrophages, suggesting that the effects of menadione treatment on virus replication depends on a functional STING. This is consistent with previous report that STING-KO cells do not make significant amounts of interferon after DNA virus infection (Ma et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors solely relied on Western blotting of STING on native-gel to assess STING oligomerization and activation, other complementary assays such as STING translocation or/and STING/TBK1 complexes should be considered. For example, the STING blot in Figure 5B does not seem correlative of p-TBK1, and menadione alone apparently triggered STING oligomerization, but not p-TBK1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewerâs comments that additional evidence other than non-reducing SDS-PAGE would be useful. Therefore, we attempted to perform STING translocation experiment, but we were not able to find a satisfying antibody specific for endogenous STING. To overcome this issue, we coimmunoprecipitated TBK1 with STING-specific antibody to analyze the functional state of TBK1. Consistent with our central model, menadione treatment inhibited TBK1 recruitment upon DMXAA stimulation, likely as a result of reduced functional oligomerization of STING. We have included this data as Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript (subsection âROS regulate interferon response by inhibiting STING polymerization&quot;).</p><p>Although STING oligomerization is necessary, it is not sufficient for phosphorylation of TBK1. Consistent with this notion, diamide, an oxidant that triggers STING oligomerization, did not promote TBK1 phosphorylation (Figure 5B). This is likely because apo STING oligomers were not functional, as a conformational change upon a ligand binding is essential for STING activation (Shang et al., 2019). To improve the clarity of the manuscript, we have added relevant explanations in the Results section in the revised manuscript (subsection âROS oxidization of STING at Cysteine-148 blocks STING activationâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) For the in vivo MHV68 infection study, the IFN response should be measured; ideally, STING-KO mice should be used as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs insightful suggestion. To test IFN responses mounted against gammaherpesvirus in vivo, we measured the transcript levels of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> in both WT and Sting-KO mice during MHV68 infection. While <italic>Ifnb1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> transcription was significantly upregulated in WT mice upon virus infection, such responses were diminished in mice lacking STING. Consistent with our in vitro data, menadione treatment dramatically inhibited interferon and ISG production mounted during MHV 68 infection. We have included these new data as Figure 6D-F in the revised manuscript (subsection âROS regulate MHV68 replication in vivoâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) To study the regulatory effect of endogenously produced ROS, the authors treated mouse macrophages with the antioxidant NAC and then infected with MHV68. Under such conditions enhanced interferon-beta induction was detected, whereas MHV68 growth was not significantly affected. Thus, the presented data are not suitable to fully explain the regulatory role of endogenously produced ROS. The authors should consider formulating the respective conclusive chapters more cautiously.</p></disp-quote><p>The level of endogenous ROS in resting cells is likely low. We observed that neutralization of this low-level endogenous ROS with NAC in vitro was sufficient to increase interferon levels after MHV68 infection or DMXAA treatment. However, this small increase in interferon was not sufficient to change virus replication. We did observe a modest effect of NAC treatment in enhancing MHV68 replication in vivo, likely because of more dynamic cellular respiration in the in vivo system and the prolonged treatment with NAC before and after infection. Even though there is not a large difference in virus replication, we speculate that changes in redox modification of STING could predispose to autoimmunity, particularly in certain genetic backgrounds or perhaps with repeated infections over time leading to chronic increased interferon. A recent study reported GPX4, which is an antioxidant against ROS, facilitates STING activation and is crucial for anti-DNA viral innate response. This is not only consistent with our finding but also emphasizes the important role of ROS in regulating STING function (Jia et al., 2020). Thus, oxidative regulation of STING is important for innate responses against DNA viruses.
