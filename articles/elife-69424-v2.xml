We used live-cell imaging of <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene nuclei to monitor Brahma (BRM) remodeler interactions with its chromosomal targets. In parallel, we measured local chromatin condensation and its effect on BRM association. Surprisingly, only a small portion of BRM is bound to chromatin at any given time. BRM binds decondensed chromatin but is excluded from condensed chromatin, limiting its genomic search space. BRM-chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, whereas histone-exchange is limited and much slower. Intriguingly, loss of ATP hydrolysis enhanced chromatin retention and clustering of BRM, which was associated with reduced histone turnover. Thus, ATP hydrolysis couples nucleosome remodeling to remodeler release, driving a continuous transient probing of the genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>SWI/SNF</kwd><kwd>brahma</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd><kwd>polytene chromosomes</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNA at Work</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verrijzer</surname><given-names>C Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visualization of BRM remodelers engaging their endogenous genomic targets revealed highly transient and dynamic interactions with chromatin, which are fueled by ATP-hydrolysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (remodelers) alter the structure and organization of nucleosomes, the basic building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker and Workman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jungblut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sundaramoorthy and Owen-Hughes, 2020</xref>). Core nucleosomes comprise 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone protein octamer formed by a H3-H4 tetramer that is flanked on either side by a H2A-H2B dimer. Remodelers modulate the accessibility of regulatory DNA elements by unwrapping or sliding nucleosomes, thereby presenting a fundamental level of control of transcription and other processes that require access to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2020</xref>). Remodelers are large, multi-subunit complexes that harbor a Snf2-class ATPase motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jungblut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sundaramoorthy and Owen-Hughes, 2020</xref>). Nucleosome remodeling is the result of ATP-dependent DNA translocation by the ATPase, which is locked onto the nucleosome through binding additional DNA- and histone sites. ATPase activity is directed by accessory subunits that determine targeting to specific genomic loci, and the outcome of the remodeling reaction. Different classes of remodelers, defined by their ATPase and unique sets of accessory subunits, are dedicated to distinct chromatin regulatory functions.</p><p>Members of the SWI/SNF family of remodelers have mainly been implicated in generating open chromatin at gene regulatory DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker and Workman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cakiroglu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pillidge and Bray, 2019</xref>). Recent structural studies revealed that SWI/SNF-class remodelers engage the nucleosome in a highly modular manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jungblut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mashtalir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sundaramoorthy and Owen-Hughes, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). The motor domain of the ATPase binds the nucleosomal DNA at superhelical position +2, while other modules contact the opposite DNA gyre, both faces of the histone octamer, and possibly the exiting DNA, and the histone H4 tail. SWI/SNF remodelers do not closely encompass the nucleosome, and the nucleosome remains mostly accessible. ATPase activity is only required for binding to a subset of genomic loci, but loss of ATPase activity can have dominant effects on chromatin binding, enhancer accessibility, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodges et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). Mutations in key functional domains of SWI/SNF are associated with human cancer and developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mashtalir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sundaramoorthy and Owen-Hughes, 2020</xref>).</p><p>There are two main subclasses of SWI/SNF complexes that are conserved from yeast to man. The first includes yeast SWI/SNF, <italic>Drosophila</italic> BAP and mammalian BAF, while the second class includes yeast RSC, fly PBAP, and mammalian PBAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohrmann and Verrijzer, 2005</xref>). Complexes of both classes share a common core, comprising related or identical subunits, associated with a set of signature subunits that define either SWI/SNF-BAF or RSC-PBAF. In mammalian cells, a third type of SWI/SNF complex has been described, named GBAF or non-canonical BAF (ncBAF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alpsoy and Dykhuizen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gatchalian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mashtalir et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> BAP and PBAP share a single ATPase, BRM, which is the ortholog of yeast Swi2/Snf2 and Sth1, and human SMARCA2 and SMARCA4. BRM associates with seven additional subunits to form the core of both BAP and PBAP. OSA (human ARID1A/B), D4/TTH (DPF1-3) and SS18 associate with the core subunits to form BAP, whereas POLYBROMO (PBRM1), BRD7, BAP170 (ARID2), and SAYP (PHF10) are specific for PBAF. The signature subunits play a major role in genomic targeting and functional selectivity of BAP and PBAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohrmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moshkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moshkin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, SWI/SNF remodelers can be considered holoenzymes, in which different modules provide different functionalities that direct the remodeling activity of the ATPase. Although BAP and PBAP have shared activities, forÂ example, both antagonize Polycomb repression, they also function in unique gene expression programs that control development, cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohrmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moshkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moshkin et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we use (P)BAP when making general statements that apply to both BAP and PBAP.</p><p>The natural amplification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes allows the visualization of fluorescent-tagged transcription factors on interphase chromatin at native genetic loci in living cells. This has yielded fundamental insights in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment and transcriptional dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zobeck et al., 2010</xref>). Salivary gland polytene chromosomes are the result of typically 10 rounds of DNA replication without segregation, resulting in cable-like super chromosomes comprising up to 1024 closely aligned chromatids. Interphase polytene chromosomes are visible by light microscopy and provided the first view of a physical genetic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridges, 1935</xref>). The characteristic banding pattern of polytene chromosomes reflects the degree of interphase condensation, i.e., the ratio between the length of a stretched DNA molecule and the length of the corresponding chromosomal domain. The compacted polytene bands have been linked to transcriptionally repressed topologically associated domains (TADs), which are conserved in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>). Interbands contain gene regulatory regions, origins of replication, and are characterized by marks of active, open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zykova et al., 2018</xref>). Polytene bands can be divided into moderately condensed gray chromatin, harboring the coding regions of active genes, and the highly compacted black chromatin that contains inactive developmental genes, and under-replicated, gene-poor intercalary heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zykova et al., 2018</xref>). Very high levels of transcriptional activity results in puffing, the local uncoiling of individual chromosome strands due to the accumulation of the gene expression machinery and RNA. Pertinently, there is a close correspondence between chromatin structure of polytene chromosomes and that in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zykova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (Ec) is the key regulator of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and controls major transitions such as molting and metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2013</xref>). Exposure of larval salivary glands to Ec leads to the formation of early chromosomal puffs, starting a cascade of developmental gene expression and puffing. The Ec hormone mediates gene activation via binding to the Ec receptor (EcR), which associates with specific DNA elements. EcR belongs to the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors that mediate hormone-driven gene expression. Upon hormone binding, nuclear receptors cooperate with a slew of coactivators, including the SWI/SNF remodelers, to stimulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paakinaho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous live-cell microscopy of fluorescent-tagged remodelers in diploid cells suggested a fast exchange dynamic, similar to many transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erdel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mehta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paakinaho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss and Hager, 2014</xref>). However, the in vivo kinetics of remodeler interactions with specific natural genomic loci has not been studied. In particular, the role of ATP hydrolysis in remodeler kinetics remains unclear. Here, we used vital imaging to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of (P)BAP interactions with endogenous target loci and the effect of chromatin condensation. Our results show that ATP-hydrolysis fuels a continuous probing of the genome by (P)BAP. In the absence of ATP-hydrolysis, there is increased chromatin retention and reduced turnover of (P)BAP. We discuss the implications of our in vivo findings for understanding remodeler function and chromatin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The majority of BRM is not associated with chromatin</title><p>To visualize (P)BAP interactions with genomic loci in interphase cells, we imaged BRM in 3rd instar larval salivary gland polytene nuclei. In agreement with early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohrmann et al., 2004</xref>), visualization of endogenous BRM on fixated polytene chromosome spreads by epi-immunofluorescence (IF) revealed binding to loci within interbands, and to puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). BRM is largely excluded from heterochromatic bands, which stain strongly with DAPI and with antibodies directed against the core histones (Î±-HIS). Depletion of BRM affects does not lead to gross changes in the polytene chromosome banding pattern or the binding of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Whereas confocal IF imaging of BRM in formaldehyde-fixed whole mount salivary gland nuclei confirmed its association with chromosomal interbands, it also revealed that the majority of BRM resides in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, co-localization analysis of BRM and DAPI yielded a Manders coefficient of 0.05, implying that only a small proportion of BRM is chromatin engaged at any given moment. A line-scan illustrates the preferential association of BRM with decondensed chromatin and its exclusion from highly compacted bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For comparison, the majority of RNAPII associated with well-defined chromosomal loci and has a lower abundance in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In conclusion, our IF results show that BRM preferably interacts with interbands, but that, surprisingly, the majority (~95%) of BRM is not bound to chromatin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The chromosomal and nuclear distribution of BRM in larval salivary gland polytene nuclei.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of endogenous BRM on a polytene chromosome spread determined by indirect IF using antibodies against BRM (red) and core histones (HIS, green).

Laser scanning confocal microscopy of GFP-H2A and mCh-H2B in isolated salivary glands revealed strong co-localization, and recapitulation of the polytene banding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, local chromatin condensation can be captured by live cell imaging of cultured salivary glands. Indeed, the intensity of the GFP-H2B signal corresponded to the highly compacted chromocenter, telomers and heterochromatic bands (black chromatin; yellow arrowhead), gray bands (red arrowhead) and white chromatin interbands (blue arrowhead; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Previous analysis of a range of chromatin marks suggested that approximately 5% of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomic DNA comprises promoters and regulatory sequences, forming white chromatin. About 25% of the genome corresponds to gray chromatin, harboring active genes, whereas the remaining 70% represents black heterochromatin, comprising mainly intercalary heterochromatin and inactive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Szabo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zykova et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the level of chromosomal condensation, we measured the intensity of GFP-H2B across multiple nuclei. First, we quantified the GFP-H2B intensity distribution across z-stacks of multiple individual nuclei. Next, we binned GFP-H2B intensities in three classes, corresponding to either white, gray, or black chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This analysis indicated that the volume of polytene chromosomes in nuclear space comprises about 5 (Â±1) % black, 43 (Â±4) % gray, and 52 (Â±5) % white chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Applying these estimates of GFP-H2B density distribution in living cells implies that chromatin in gray bands is on average sixfold more condensed than in interbands, whereas black chromatin is condensed an additional ~25-fold (up to ~150 more than open chromatin). Thus, visualization of fluorophore-tagged histones can be used to monitor chromatin condensation in living cells.</p><p>Next, we determined the distribution of GFP-BRM in live polytene nuclei. MOR (SMARCC1/2) co-immunopurifications (co-IPs) from dissected larval salivary gland extracts revealed the efficient incorporation of GFP-BRM in remodeler complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). IF of polytene chromosomes showed extensive co-localization of GFP-BRM with endogenous MOR, confirming that it binds chromatin normally as part of (P)BAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). MOR has a key architectural function that is essential for the structural integrity of (P)BAP and the stability of BRM in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moshkin et al., 2007</xref>). RNAi-mediated depletion of MOR in the larval salivary gland caused a concomitant loss of GFP-BRM, indicating that it predominantly exists as part of (P)BAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). We conclude that GFP-BRM is incorporated in (P)BAP and is targeted correctly. Vital imaging of salivary gland nuclei expressing mCh-H2B and GFP-BRM showed that the majority of GFP-BRM is nucleoplasmic and excluded from the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). GFP-BRM associated with interband chromatin, while its level was strongly reduced within chromosome bands. We made similar observations for another (P)BAP core subunit, GFP-SNR1 (SMARCB1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Pertinently, BRM and SNR1 levels within the condensed polytene chromosome bands are much lower than in the nucleoplasm. Note that loss of BRM does not affect polytene chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that chromosome condensation leads to (P)BAP exclusion. In contrast to BRM, GFP-Polycomb (PC) and the RNAPII subunit mCh-RBP3 each showed strong binding to specific chromosomal loci and relatively low abundance in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). In conclusion, a surprisingly small proportion of (P)BAP engages the genome at a steady state level. (P)BAP interacts with open chromatin but is largely excluded from highly condensed chromosome bands.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PBAP, but not BAP, is required for Ec-induced gene expression</title><p>We were interested in (P)BAP dynamics during developmental gene activation. Therefore, we investigated the role of (P)BAP in Ec-controlled gene transcription. We dissected salivary glands from early 3rd instar larvae and cultured them for ~1 hr, either in the presence or absence of Ec. IF of fixated polytene chromosome spreads revealed binding of the EcR to the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci, harboring Ec early response genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Like the EcR, BRM is present on the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci both before and after induction. Concomitant with RNAPII recruitment and puffing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the amount of BRM at <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> increased substantially following Ec-induction. Next, we compared the recruitment of the BAP-specific subunit OSA (ARID1A/B) and the PBAP-specific PBRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Before induction, both OSA and PBRM were present at <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic>. After puffing, PBRM accumulated on the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci, but we detected no appreciable binding of OSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci, PBRM co-localized with the EcR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, both BAP and PBAP bind the repressed <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci, but only PBAP is recruited after transcriptional activation by Ec. This observation agrees well with our earlier report that PBAP-specific mutants, but not OSA mutants, display microcephaly and leg malformations that are reminiscent of phenotypes caused by defective Ec-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest a role for PBAP in gene regulation by Ec. To test this notion, we compared the expression profiles of <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> transcripts in homozygous <italic>Bap170<sup>kim1</sup>; Pbrm<sup>33.2</sup></italic> prepupae to that of <italic>wt</italic> animals.

Two well-defined heterochromatic bands (fragments I and III) flank the GFP-EcR-marked <italic>E75</italic> puff (fragment II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We measured the lengths of these fragments in 20 different nuclei, allowing us to compare observed physical distances in living cells with genomic DNA lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The packing ratio of an 11 nm nucleosomal array is predicted to be 6.8:1. This would yield an extended fiber length for fragment I of ~18 Î¼m. However, the observed average length of fragment I in living polytene nuclei is only 0.72 (Â± 0.18) Î¼m, yielding a 25-fold compaction. Similarly, the heterochromatic band (fragment III) flanking E75 appears to be condensed ~22-fold, compared to an extended 11 nm chromatin fiber. In contrast, measurement of the GFP-EcR marked puff (fragment II) suggested a compaction of only threefold. Given that the EcR-bound enhancers and promoters form loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardo et al., 2014</xref>), and that cellular chromatin is a flexible disordered polymer, these observations are consistent with the notion that the puffed area comprises an open array of nucleosomes. When we considered the polytene chromosome as a cylinder, and included diameter measurements to calculate apparent volumes, the difference in chromatin compaction between puffs and bands became even more pronounced. For example, the chromatin in the heterochromatic fragment I appears to be ~30-fold more compacted than that in the GFP-EcR-marked puff of fragment II. Thus, vital imaging of fluorophore-tagged histones on polytene chromosomes allows measurements of relative interphase chromatin condensation at specific loci in living cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Live imaging reveals local chromatin condensation at the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal image of a polytene nucleus expressing GFP-EcR and mCh-H2B. <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> are indicated.

Western blotting established that GFP-BRM and GFP-BRM-K804R were expressed at comparable levels, which were well below that of endogenous BRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). IPs with antibodies directed against GFP followed by mass spectrometry showed that both GFP-BRM and GFP-BRM-K804R associated with the full complement of BRM complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

However, it is impossible to visualize transcription factor interactions with genomic loci in regular interphase cells. To overcome this limitation, we imaged BRM in salivary gland polytene nuclei. First, we used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)-FRAP to determine the in vivo dynamics of GFP-BRM in salivary gland polytene nuclei. Following photobleaching of half a nucleus, we observed a rapid recovery that was largely complete after ~2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The increase in fluorescence in the bleached part of the nucleus was accompanied by a comparable decrease in the unbleached part. We noted no difference between BRM in the nucleoplasm or associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast to GFP-BRM, mCh-H2B showed no recovery within a timeframe of minutes (min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Thus, (P)BAP can move freely through the nucleus, whereas the turnover of bulk histones is limited. FRAP analysis of GFP-BRM bands on chromosomes also showed a rapid and complete recovery of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).

The rapid recovery at the start probably reflects dynamic binding to the promoter, whereas the linear phase corresponds to elongating RNAPII. The turnover of bulk histone H2B is more than two orders of magnitude slower than that of (P)BAP. FRAP analysis of GFP-H2B in polytene chromosomes revealed that it takes over 40 min to obtain a ~20% recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). GFP-H2B recovery in polytene bands versus interbands appeared to be proportional, consistent with the notion that both comprise the same basic nucleosomal fiber at different degrees of condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine the turnover of BRM at highly transcribed loci that depend on BRM for expression, we activated <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> by adding Ec to isolated salivary glands.

However, similar behavior of RNAPII on fully induced heat-shock loci was shown to be caused by local recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). FRAP analysis of mCh-EcR revealed a recovery t<sub>1/2</sub> of 3.0 (Â± 1.1) s, which is comparable to BRM.

Likewise, GFP-D4 it displayed a fast turnover on BAP target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).

Digitonin-treated glands are permeable to high-molecular-weight molecules but dependent upon the addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates, retain the ability to form puffs in response to Ec. Treatment of cultured salivary glands with 0.01% digitonin resulted in a complete loss of GFP fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-GFP), whereas mCh-H2B remained bound to the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In striking contrast, chromatin-binding of GFP-BRM increased dramatically following permeabilization. Moreover, free GFP-BRM was no longer detectable in the nucleoplasm. Conversely, chromatin association of GFP-PC and mCh-RBP3 was substantially reduced in permeabilized glands. Although BRM normally only interacts transiently with chromatin and is mainly nucleoplasmatic, heat maps of GFP-BRM illustrate that permeabilization resulted in strong accumulation of GFP-BRM onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Chromatin-bound GFP-BRM in permeabilized cells was essentially immobile, as determined by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Following permeabilization, GFP-BRM remained bound for more than an hour. Tellingly, upon the addition of ATP (2 mM), GFP-BRM was immediately released from chromatin and diffused out of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We used this assay to assess the nucleotide requirements for GFP-BRM release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). First, ATP could not be replaced by ADP. Second, efficient release of GFP-BRM required ATP concentrations above 1 mM. Third, neither the slowly hydrolyzed analogue ATP-Î³-S nor the non-hydrolysable ATP ground state mimetic ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> could replace ATP. Thus, the release of GFP-BRM from polytene chromosomes requires hydrolysable ATP at concentrations greater than 1 mM. Note that ATP concentrations in living cells normally do not drop to a level below 1 mM, when it would impede remodeler dynamics. To monitor the effect on endogenous (P)BAP, we repeated the permeabilization in either the presence- or absence of ATP, followed by fixation and IF of MOR (SMARCC1/2). Similar to our vital imaging results, we found that MOR accumulated on chromatin in permeabilized glands but dissociated and diffused out of the nucleus upon addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, endogenous (P)BAP and GFP-BRM show similar behavior. Taken together, these results show that ATP hydrolysis is required for (P)BAP release, but not for binding to chromatin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ATP-hydrolysis is required for (P)BAP release from polytene chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing the nuclear distribution of NLS-GFP, mCh-H2B, GFP-BRM, GFP-PC, and mCh-RPB3 in isolated salivary glands that were either intact (top panels) or permeabilized by treatment with 0.01% digitonin (bottom panels).

The chromosomes in GFP-BRM-K804R expressing glands, however, were considerably thinner than in wt glands, and had an increased tendency to break during preparation. These observations suggest that the expression of GFP-BRM-K804R leads to DNA under-replication and fragile polytene chromosomes. Vital imaging of intact salivary glands revealed that, in contrast to wt BRM, the majority of GFP-BRM-K804R is bound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Moreover, FRAP analysis showed that GFP-BRM-K804R has no substantial turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

The clustered binding of GFP-BRM-K804R prompted us to consider the potential role of phase separation.

As reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strom et al., 2017</xref>), 1,6-hexanediol did reduce the accumulation of mCh-HP1 on the chromocenter. The insensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol and the lack of mobility revealed by FRAP suggest that phase separation does not play a major role in the clustering of GFP-BRM-K804R. Rather, we propose that inadequate release from chromatin drives the local accumulation of BRM-K804R (and that of wt BRM in the absence of ATP; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We note that the effect of the K804R mutation on BRM mobility is more pronounced in polytene nuclei than in S2 cells, which are near tetraploid.

Nevertheless, BRM-K804R captures wt (P)BAP onto polytene chromosomes, possibly via a chromatin-mediated interaction. These results raise the intriguing possibility that remodeling involves direct cooperation, or a hand-off mechanism between different BRM complexes. Finally, we studied the impact of BRM-K804R on histone turnover. We used FRAP to determine histone exchange in salivary glands that co-expressed mCh-H2B with either GFP-BRM or GFP-BRM-K804R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).

These results suggest that chromatin remodeling and remodeler release are intrinsically coupled.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We studied the role of ATP-hydrolysis during exploration of the genome by (P)BAP chromatin remodelers. We took advantage of the parallel amplification of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome in salivary gland polytene chromosomes to monitor (P)BAP interactions with endogenous targets in real time. This allowed us to distinguish between nucleoplasm and natural loci in interphase chromosomes by live-cell imaging, which is not possible in diploid cells. We found that a surprisingly small portion of (P)BAP (~5%) is associated with chromatin at any given time. This is caused by the coupling of ATP-hydrolysis during nucleosome remodeling to (P)BAP release. Consequently, (P)BAP acts through a continuous transient probing of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). (P)BAP mainly interacts with chromatin in non-condensed interbands or puffs. Conversely, (P)BAP levels within highly condensed polytene bands are much lower than in the nucleoplasm. We note that the loss of (P)BAP does not affect chromatin condensation and the polytene banding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on these observations, we postulate that chromatin condensation excludes (P)BAP, thereby reducing its genomic search space. At the height of <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> transcription, a substantial portion of RNAPII is retained locally in what Lis and colleagues named a transcription compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). On the same chromatin puffs, however, PBAP exchanges rapidly (within ~2â4 s) without a substantial immobile fraction. Thus, although essential for expression of <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic>, PBAP is not retained within a transcription compartment. The rapid exchange of (P)BAP indicates continuous cycles of nucleosome remodeling. Transient binding to chromatin might explain the relatively poor capture of remodelers by ChIP, as the crosslinking reaction has temporal constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmiedeberg et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, a mutation in the ATP-binding pocket increased the residence time on chromatin and concomitantly enhanced ChIP signals of BRM-K804R. Consistent with our earlier developmental genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>), we found that PBAP, but not BAP, is required for Ec-regulated gene expression. This finding expands the functional diversification between BAP and PBAP remodeling complexes, which is to a large extent determined by their signature subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohrmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moshkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moshkin et al., 2012</xref>). We detected the fly homolog of GLTSCR1 in GFP-BRM IPs from S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, a recent study identified and characterized the fly BRM complex that is orthologous to mammalian GBAF/ncBAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barish et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, although GBAP appears to be mainly expressed in the nervous system, it might contribute to our analysis of BRM dynamics. We note that the dynamic characteristics of SNR1, D4 and BRD7, which are all absent from GBAP, is highly similar to that of BRM.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (P)BAP remodelers act through a continuous transient exploration of the genome that is driven by the coupling between ATP-hydrolysis and remodeler release from chromatin.

Indeed, it is difficult to envision how the limited amount of free canonical histones available in the nucleoplasm could support substantial turnover of chromosomal histones. A comparison of DNA accessibility and histone occupancy during transcriptional induction revealed that changes in the former predominate the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, several recent studies indicated that promoter chromatin harbors so called fragile nucleosomes with accessible DNA, which depend on chromatin remodeler activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2020</xref>).

Indeed, measurements of black chromatin bands flanking the <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> loci, suggested a ~25-fold condensation compared to open chromatin, which falls in the range derived from HiC in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>). Our real time measurements of histone density in polytene chromosomes in living cells complements other methods to estimate condensation that all depend on chromatin fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zykova et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that euchromatin and heterochromatin are formed by the same basic nucleosomal array, but at different degrees of condensation.</p><p>Although central to the function of Snf2 remodelers, our understanding of the role of ATP hydrolysis in the nucleosome remodeling cycle remains incomplete. A mutation in the ATP-binding pocket of BRM caused up to 5-fold stronger chromatin binding and a ~2-times slower turnover of BRM-K804R in S2 cells. In polytene cells, BRM-K804R clamped down onto chromatin and displayed no measurable turnover. Likewise, in permeabilized salivary gland cells that lack ATP, wt BRM accumulated onto polytene chromosome interbands. Chromatin binding persisted for over 1 hr, but following the addition of ATP, BRM released immediately. Most likely, the high local density of target loci in polytene chromosomes amplifies the effect of prolonged chromatin binding by BRM. We speculate that in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, slow release combined with rapid re-binding to a paired chromatid, might results in the local trapping of (P)BAP on polytene chromosomes. We note that under normal physiological conditions, ATP concentrations in cells would not become depleted to a level (&lt; 1 mM) that would impair remodeler function. Finally, our results argue against a role for liquid-liquid phase separation in the clustering of (P)BAP in the absence of ATP-hydrolysis. Local (P)BAP accumulation is insensitive to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions by 1,6-hexanediol. Moreover, FRAP analysis showed that clustered BRM has a strongly reduced mobility, indicating it does not form a condensate. We consider prolonged chromatin-binding the most plausible cause of local accumulation of BRM-K804R, or wt BRM in the absence of ATP.</p><p>Studies in diploid cells often equate the formation of low-mobility aggregates of a fluorophore-tagged transcription factor with persistent chromatin binding and functional activity. However, given that chromatin typically only occupies about 3% of the nuclear volume, this interpretation remains speculative. E.g., in a study on human ISWI remodelers, an increase in the immobile fraction upon DNA damage was rationalized as an increase in activity on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erdel et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, it was concluded that loss of ATP-binding reduced chromatin association and increased mobility. In contrast, our results with BRM showed that chromatin binding is independent of ATP, but that its release is stimulated by ATP-hydrolysis. At the peak of PBAP- and EcR-dependent transcription of <italic>E74</italic> and <italic>E75</italic> genes, both retained a rapid exchange, indicating ceaseless cycles of nucleosome remodeling. Consistent with this notion, the use of small-molecule inhibitors recently showed that chromatin accessibility required continuous remodeler activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iurlaro et al., 2021</xref>). Transient remodeler dynamics enables competition at regulatory elements between epigenetic regulators with opposing effects on chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cenik and Shilatifard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kubik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohd-Sarip et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are both parallels and differences in the roles of ATP in either chromatin remodeling or in RNA-duplex unwinding by DEAD-box helicases. ATP-hydrolysis is dispensable for RNA-binding and duplex unwinding by DEAD-box helicases, but is required for fast enzyme release from RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). However, the formation of long-lived RNA-DEAD-box helicase complexes requires ATP-binding but not its hydrolysis. In contrast, chromatin binding by BRM is independent of ATP. The ATP hydrolysis-fueled transient probing of the genome by BRM we described here, dovetails well with structural observations on Swi2/Snf2 remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). When Snf2 is free in solution, the two domains that harbor the ATP-binding motifs are oriented away from one another and Snf2 cannot bind ATP. Binding to naked DNA or nucleosomal DNA induces a reorientation of the two ATPase lobes so that they now form a functional ATP-binding pocket. Combined with our results, these structural observations suggest a model in which nucleosome binding occurs independent of ATP but induces the formation of an ATP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). ATP hydrolysis can now fuel nucleosome remodeling coupled to an increased probability of remodeler release, resulting in rapid cycles of nucleosome remodeling and remodeler recycling. The absence of ATP-hydrolysis leads to prolonged chromatin binding of the remodeler and impedes nucleosome remodeling.</p><p>Our observation that ATP hydrolysis promotes remodeler release from chromatin raises the question of how many translocation steps a single remodeler takes before dissociation from a nucleosome in vivo. Previous single molecule studies on the RSC remodeler determined that an ATP concentration above 1 mM is required for optimal translocation speed and processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sirinakis et al., 2011</xref>). This value derived from in vitro experiments is remarkably similar to our in vivo estimates. Note that many biophysical studies on remodelers use much lower ATP concentrations to slow down the reaction speed and determine individual kinetic steps (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harada et al., 2016</xref>). In the presence of 1 mM ATP in vitro, RSC translocated at a speed of 25 bp/s on naked DNA and ~13 bp/s on nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sirinakis et al., 2011</xref>). Enzyme processivity in these experiments was ~35 bp on naked DNA and (albeit it with a widespread) on average ~100 bp per round of translocation on nucleosomes. Stopped-flow pre-steady state kinetic analysis of RSC translocation along naked DNA suggested a series of uniform steps yielding an average translocation distance of 20 bp before dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>). The (P)BAP turnover time of ~2â4 s in our in vivo FRAP experiments agrees well with the in vitro single molecule analyses and is compatible with multiple kinetic steps and substantial nucleosome remodeling prior to remodeler disengagement. Remodeler release might be considered as a probability during each ATPase cycle. Full remodeling, sliding or even eviction may require the cooperation of a cascade of remodelers acting subsequently.</p><p>BRM-K804R clamps to chromatin and impedes histone turnover, emphasizing that remodeling and remodeler recycling are closely integrated. Surprisingly, BRM-K804R also traps wt BRM onto polytene chromosomes. Thus, reflecting early genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elfring et al., 1998</xref>), BRM-K804R behaves as a molecular dominant mutant. The retention of wt BRM onto chromatin by BRM-K804R suggests that BRM complexes might interact on chromatin. Consequently, remodeling might involve a nucleosome hand-off mechanism between different BRM complexes. Additionally, translocation by one BRM complex might help to push another one off the chromatin. This way, the persistent chromatin binding of BRM-K804R might create a âtraffic jamâ that blocks the release of wt BRM.</p><p>In summary, our visualization of BRM remodelers engaging their endogenous genomic targets revealed highly transient and dynamic interactions. (P)BAP binds chromatin independent of ATP. However, ATP-hydrolysis couples nucleosome remodeling to (P)BAP release, resulting in rapid cycles of remodeling and remodeler turnover. Remodelers might interact on chromatin, as suggested by the trapping of wt BRM by the ATP-binding mutant BRM-K804R. Importantly, an accompanying report by Wu and colleagues, studying budding yeast remodelers through live-cell single molecule tracking, also revealed the key role of the ATPase in promoting dissociation from chromatin and fast remodeler kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these in vivo results provide a framework for understanding remodeler function in genome regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>Full-length cDNAs encoding BRM, SNR1, D4, BRD7, EcR, RBP2, RBP3, H2A, and H2B were cloned into pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO by TOPO cloning according to the manufacturerâs protocol, resulting in a series of pENTR vectors, which was used to generate derivative constructs.

factors) via nucleosome movement or eviction, and then release from that location to conduct new work. Currently, it is challenging to quantify remodeler-nucleosome dynamics in vivo and the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the retention and recycling of remodelers on chromatin/nucleosomes. Here, Tilly and co-workers address these questions using elegant live-cell imaging, applied to monitor the SWI/SNF-family Brahma (BRM) remodeler in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene nuclei, and show that fast kinetics and likely cooperation between remodelers enables chromatin opening. This manuscript will be of considerable interest to the remodeler and chromatin communities.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vivo Analysis Reveals that ATP-hydrolysis Couples Remodeling to SWI/SNF Release from Chromatin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sebastian Deindl as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bradley R Cairns (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study presents a wealth of data in a rather compact format. As a result, some arguments appear a bit abbreviated, some methods could be explained more thoroughly, and some controls are lacking for a more stringent argumentation. By addressing the corresponding reviewers' comments below, this highly interesting manuscript can be significantly improved.</p><p>Although additional data could further strengthen the manuscript, we feel that the points raised by the reviewers can be adequately addressed with textual revision and by consolidating and more rigorously quantifying the data, and more explicitly stating controls, etc. Note that no new experimentation is called for.</p><p>2) One worry is that the tagged proteins are not functional, but there may be good arguments as to why this is less of an issue (e.g., the effect of ATP depletion and KR mutation). The authors should make these arguments in the paper.</p><p>3) All three reviewers felt that the clarity of the presentation could be improved by bringing together the sections related to ATP binding and hydrolysis. We strongly recommend such a change in the order of presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Strength: Chromatin remodelers play critical roles in mobilization of nucleosomes to modulate chromatin-templated functions, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of remodelers interacting with chromatin remains incompletely understood. By using cellular imaging, this study reports that chromatin remodeler mutant, which is defective in ATP-binding, reside longer at chromatin than wild-type one, and further indicates that ATP-hydrolysis stimulates remodeler release from chromatin. By leveraging the characteristic of polytene chromatin being visible under fluorescence microscopy, the authors study that the dynamics of chromatin remodelers at native loci, providing further evidence that chromatin remodelers dynamically interact with chromatin with turn-over time less than 5 sec. Overall, these studies indicate that chromatin remodelers rapidly probe the genome and ATP-binding and hydrolysis play important roles in release of remodelers from chromatin.</p><p>Weakness: There are a few studies that have reported that remodelers dynamically exchange with chromatin. The novelty of this study is the discovery of the roles of ATP-binding and hydrolysis on the dissociation of remodelers from chromatin; however, to this reviewer, there is lack of functional significance of the destabilization or mechanistic insights into the destabilization.</p><p>1) The authors study the dynamics of BRM-K804R within polytene nuclei (Figure 7). The authors also investigate the dynamics of wild-type BRM at the E74 and E75 loci (Figure 5). It appears to this reviewer that one nice experiment would be to investigate the exchange dynamics of BRM-K804R at these two loci and to study the effects of BRM-K804R on their transcriptional levels. Thus, it would be possible to correlate the binding dynamics and transcription and to provide potential functional significances of rapid exchange of remodelers at chromatin.</p><p>2) To this review, it is not easily to follow the logic of the manuscript. It would be helpful to readers if the authors give sufficient reasonings for some experiments. For instance, why do the authors study PBAP and BAP for Ec-induced gene expression (Page 12). To me, the authors should also reorganize some figures and change the order of the presentation.</p><p>3) I would suggest that the authors quantify FRAP data to extract kinetic parameters based kinetic modelling. In the current version, when comparing t<sub>1/2</sub> between different cellular systems, it is not informative.</p><p>4) 1,6-hexanediol has been widely used in phase-separation studies. It primarily disrupts hydrophobic interactions. Given that LLPS involves multiple non-covalent interactions, the authors should re-phase some of their conclusions.</p><p>5) A schematic that describes PBAP and BAP would help non-remodeler readers in Figure 1.</p><p>6) Figure 1e shows difference in FRAP curves between wild-type BRM and BRM-K804R. BRM-K804R forms clusters while BRM not. It would be helpful if FRAP of BRM-K804R is also done in cluster and no-cluster regions.</p><p>7) Page 6, the last conclusion sentence seems over-stated since BRM-K804R impacts ATP-binding rather than hydrolysis.</p><p>8) Page 10, the second to last sentence, there is no data to support the author's claim.</p><p>9) Page 12, the conclusion remark of the first paragraph, there is no data to support hit-and-run' model.</p><p>10) To this reviewer, it appears that the retention of BRM-K804R at chromatin at polytene chromatin cannot be simply explained by a slow dissociation rate and a fast on-rate. This is because BRM-K804R can trap wild-type BRM at polytene chromatin and BRM-K804R can be recovery rapidly in S2 cells. Alternative interpretation should be given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers must scan the genome for locations to open chromatin (to help provide access to transcription and DNA repair factors) via nucleosome movement or eviction, and then release from that location to conduct new work. Currently, it is challenging to quantify remodeler-nucleosome dynamics in vivo, and the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis on the retention and recycling of remodelers at nucleosomes â aside from the known role of ATP in the process of DNA translocation. These questions are of general interest as chromatin remodelers are intimately involved in the regulation of DNA accessibility for processes such as transcription and DNA repair, and as remodelers must both associate with regions productively yet release properly to search for and conduct the scale of work needed.</p><p>Here, Tilly et al., (Verrijzer Lab) and colleagues address these questions using elegant live-cell imaging, applied to monitor the SWI/SNF-family Brahma (BRM) remodeler in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene nuclei. This method combined with cleverly chosen reagents, mutants, or physiological contexts, allowed the authors to measure chromatin condensation along with the dynamics governing the interaction of BRM with chromatin. Several conclusions of interest could be reached through the work:</p><p>â With the vast majority of BRM is unbound at any given time, BRM remodeler interacts very transiently with chromatin, browsing nucleosomes largely located in decondensed regions.</p><p>â ATP binding reduces BRM retention at chromatin, as revealed by characterizing the in vivo dynamics of a Walker A motif mutant.</p><p>â ATP hydrolysis increases BRM release from chromatin, as revealed by characterizing the in vivo dynamics in the presence of ADP, or a slow hydrolysable ATP analogue, or a non-hydrolysable ATP ground state mimic.</p><p>â When applied to the specific physiological context of highly transcribed ecdysone-induced loci, only the (BRM-containing) PBAP remodeler appears essential; and, remarkably, PBAP fulfills this function without a local retention as shown for RNAPII, but by a rapid exchange.</p><p>â Consistent with â and expanding on â the previous conclusions, the presence of the ATP-binding deficient BRM mutant leads to the clustered binding of not only mutated BRM but also wild-type BRM, without the involvement of a phase separation (as 1,6-hexanediol did not affect the punctate/clustered pattern) but likely by accumulation due to excessive retention. Notably, as the authors rightly comment, these interesting results lead to the possibility of a direct cooperation or a hand-off mechanism between different tandem SWI/SNF remodelers, and will deserve further future investigation.</p><p>The conclusions listed above are relatively convincingly as they are well supported by the data. The discussion is clearly and thoughtfully written.</p><p>Altogether, this work rigorously addresses how ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle of the Brm remodeler, affects the in vivo dynamics of nucleosome browsing, binding and recycling. I think this will be of considerable interest to the remodeler and chromatin community, and recommend publication after revision in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. To improve the manuscript, I will suggest that the authors consider slightly reorganizing the manuscript in order to bring in close proximity all the sections related to ATP binding and to ATP hydrolysis, which are currently separated by the characterization of the BRM dynamics at the ecdysone-induced loci.</p><p>2. I will also ask that the authors note that the reorientation of the two ATPase lobes is not just induced by nucleosomes, but also efficiently elicited by naked DNA, so nucleosomes do not gate that conformational change.</p><p>3. I appreciate how the kinetics of the in vivo work was linked to former in vitro studies in the Discussion â and here the authors might consider (in addition to the works cited) how prior pre-steady state stopped-flow kinetic analysis of SWI/SNF-family remodelers and resulting kinetic and probabilistic models (Fischer et al., Biochemistry 2007) also generally align with their work â and how thinking about release as a probability during each ATPase cycle might be of interest.</p><p>4. Finally â the identification of a GLTSCR1 ortholog (Figure 1) is really interesting. he authors mention this but do not explore more deeply. This affects the work in two ways â the possible existence of a GBAF/ncBAF related complex in flies, and that this complex may be participating in the processes observed. I understand that a full characterization of a possible separate fly GBAF/ncBAF complex (in addition to BAF and PBAF) is beyond the scope of the paper, but I will request that the authors revisit and discuss this issue in the Discussion to note its likely existence and possible participation in the data and processes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The polytenic chromosomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval salivary glands allow the visualization of interphase chromosomes in a linear, extended form. The authors applied confocal life-imaging confocal microscopy and FRAP analysis to polytene chromosomes to study the dynamic interactions of the (P)BAP remodeling complexes with chromatin. They observe through a series of intriguing experiments that the BRM ATPase interacts with open chromatin only transiently in the presence of hydrolysable ATP. Rapid redistribution of the complex in the nucleus requires continuous ATP hydrolysis. Polytene squashes remove ATP and lead to artefactual trapping of the complex at the sites of otherwise transient interaction. The salivary glands can be cultivated for some time and remain active so that treatment with the ecdysone triggers the characteristic site-specific 'puffing' of the chromosome as a measure of transcription. The authors manage to subject individual 'puffs' to FRAP analyses, a nice demonstration of their technical proficiency.</p><p>Although the very transient interactions of other nucleosome remodeling factors have been reported by Erdel and Rippe, the case of BRM is of interest to the chromatin community. The imaging of polytene chromosomes in their squashed and 'life' state is particularly illuminating. The authors push the system and attempt to correlate histone turnover with the presence of the BAP complex.</p><p>The study presents a wealth of data in a very compact format. As a result, some arguments appear a bit abbreviated, some methods poorly explained and some controls are lacking for stringent argumentation. This interesting manuscript that can be significantly improved by addressing the following comments.</p><p>1. Many findings are illustrated by single individual pictures (e.g. most panels in figure 2). While these illustrate the observations well, they represent individual cells and lack statistical robustness. It will be reassuring if the authors mention at strategic places that all images are representative of the large majority of cells and that similar ones have been obtained in biological replicates (i.e. same experiment on different days). Should this not be the case the readers must be warned accordingly, and the type and source of heterogeneity be detailed.</p><p>2. The authors summarize published profiles to say that 70% of chromatin can be considered 'black'. Because they find only 1% of chromatin stained with GFP-H2B at 'black' intensity, they calculate a 25- to 150-fold level of chromatin compaction. Can we assume that the GFP-H2B intensities scale linearly with compaction? Since the GFP-histones are provided by transgenes, their expression is presumably not cell-cycle regulated. What are the levels of GFP-histones relative to the endogenous ones? Can we assume that the GFP-H2B is fully functional, i.e. a substrate to remodelers?</p><p>3. Figure 2 Supplement 1C. It is stated that GFP-BRM is efficiently incorporated into remodeler complexes. Here the level of GFP-BRM appears at least 10-fold higher that the level of endogenous BRM. This suggests that GFP-BRM is overexpressed to a worrying extent, where it may compete for the endogenous ATPase. How come that the excessive amount of BRM is not seen in the input? The question here is whether the properties of the tagged ATPase reflect those of the endogenous protein. Devil's advocate says that the endogenous protein constitutes the 'immobile fraction' that is, of course, not detected.</p><p>4. &quot;Similar FRAP kinetics were observed for a low-expressing GFP-BRM <italic>Drosophila</italic> line (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-C).&quot; How is low expression defined? Given the overexpression of BRM (point 5 above), why was the analysis not done with a line with more physiological levels (since it was apparently available)?</p><p>5. It is said that &quot;Depletion of BRM affects neither the polytene chromosome condensation pattern nor the binding of RNAPII (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A)&quot;. However, the shown image suggests otherwise as the level of pol II staining appears clearly diminished. If this statement was to be maintained some kind of quantification needs to be done.</p><p>6. The authors classify polytene banding as 'white', 'grey' and 'black' using defined fluorescence intensity thresholds. How does the live signal relate to the corresponding squashed chromosomes? How well do the histone-GFP values correlate to the DNA staining?</p><p>7. Figure 2 supplement 1D: Moira antibody appears to stain everything. How do we know the staining is specific?</p><p>8. Figure 2 supplement 1E lacks all controls (Western blots).</p><p>9. It is concluded that GFP-BRM is incorporated in (P)BAP and targeted correctly. What are the criteria for correct targeting and how has it been measured?</p><p>10. It is stated: &quot;Pertinently, BRM and SNR1 levels within the polytene chromosome bands are much lower than in the nucleoplasm. This indicates that chromosome condensation leads to (P)BAP exclusion.&quot; This latter statement about causation cannot be derived from the correlative data.</p><p>11. What is the basis of the statement: &quot;Note that loss of BRM does not affect polytene chromosome condensation (Figure 2-S1A)&quot;? Is this just by looking at the image or has any other analysis been done? What is the sensitivity of the analysis â limitation of the statement?</p><p>12. It is stated &quot;Pertinently, there was no appreciable difference in recovery kinetics between BRM in the nucleoplasm or associated with chromatin.&quot; What is the basis of this conclusion? Just looking at Figure 3A one would not be able to tell.</p><p>13. From Figure 3- supplement 1A-C one may conclude that the lower-expressing GFP-BRM binds better to the chromosome. Is this conclusion justified (and if not, why not?).</p><p>14. Figure 3C: which band was frapped for RPB3? Do the recovery curves also summarize the results of 17 band-FRAPs?</p><p>15. Related to the RPB3 FRAP profile it is stated &quot;The rapid recovery at the start probably reflects dynamic binding to the promoter, whereas the linear phase corresponds to elongating RNAPII.&quot; This is pure speculation, should be removed from the 'results'.</p><p>16. The conclusion &quot;We conclude that (P)BAP acts through a continuous and rapid &quot;hit-and-run&quot; probing of the genome&quot; depends on a more stringent argumentation that the protein is functional (see above).</p><p>17. Figure 4f: Please indicate the number of biological replicates (assuming each biological replicate consists of three technical replicates).</p><p>18. Figure 4a shows the level of BRM recruitment to Ec-induced puffs. This is presumably fromn a wt larva. How does the same picture look like if the GFB-BRM overexpression line is used and stained for either GFP or BRM?</p><p>19. Figure 5C: the puffing is not visible, unlike stated in the text.</p><p>20. Figure 5H. &quot;The absence of a full recovery of RNAPII at the height of E74 and E75 expression and puffing is similar to its behavior on fully induced heat shock loci 87A and 87C, and is indicative of local RNAPII recycling (Yao et al., 2007).&quot; Might it also be possible that a certain fraction of pol II is stalled under culture conditions and thus 'trapped' in the topologically associated elongating form?</p><p>21. Figure 5J: Concluding about the absence of the D4 subunit requires some kind of a positive control and statistics.</p><p>22. Figure 6b: what is red-blue?</p><p>23. Figure 6c, 7c: How many bands were frapped?</p><p>24. &quot;IF of polytene chromosome spreads revealed co-localization of GFP-BRM-K804R with endogenous MOR (SMARCC1/2), indicating largely normal targeting of this mutant&quot;. What are the criteria for 'Largely normal targeting' â what would be your criteria for 'not normal'?</p><p>25. Figure 7k. BRM binds interbands where histones are barely detectable. It is unclear how both proteins could be frapped at the same site. For H2B FRAP- was the neighbouring band frapped? What is the resolution of the assay?</p><p>26. The authors conclude that chromatin remodeling and remodeler relased are coupled. This conclusion is premature given the possibility of indirect effects (e.g. through elongating pol II -mediated by different transcription levels). Furthermore, the discussion states: &quot;These observations suggest that the prevalent outcome of chromatin remodeling in vivo is restructuring or sliding of nucleosomes rather than eviction.&quot; The authors should acknowledge that they have very little spatial resolution: the histone dynamics could be very local. The data do not allow concluding about nucleosome remodeling mechanism.</p><p>27. The discussion states: &quot;However, given that chromatin typically only occupies about 1.5% of the nuclear volume, â¦&quot; Where does that number come from? That seems to be very odd.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69424.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study presents a wealth of data in a rather compact format.

This is significant because it shows that the remodeling process is intrinsically dynamic and does not induce a stable static state.

The use of polytene nuclei enabled us to visualize these processes on endogenous, natural gene loci in living cells. We show that induction of <italic>E74/75</italic> depends on PBAP.

To extract additional kinetic parameters by modelling, a (currently unavailable) model containing detailed information about the interaction(s) between (P)BAP and chromatin is required. Moreover, we refrain from kinetic modelling on our FRAP data because these types of analyses can easily lead to over- or misinterpretations (discussed by e.g., Mueller et al., Curr. Opin.

Importantly, our FRAP data provides an upper limit to (P)BAP residence time and establishes that (P)BAP has a very fast turnover, whereas histones are comparatively stable. Additional kinetic data on remodeler/chromatin interactions are reported in the accompanying study by Kim et al. using single molecule analysis, a system more suitable for detailed kinetic analysis. The findings of Kim et al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440742) agree well with our results.

Currently, it is challenging to quantify remodeler-nucleosome dynamics in vivo, and the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis on the retention and recycling of remodelers at nucleosomes â aside from the known role of ATP in the process of DNA translocation. These questions are of general interest as chromatin remodelers are intimately involved in the regulation of DNA accessibility for processes such as transcription and DNA repair, and as remodelers must both associate with regions productively yet release properly to search for and conduct the scale of work needed.</p><p>Here, Tilly et al., (Verrijzer Lab) and colleagues address these questions using elegant live-cell imaging, applied to monitor the SWI/SNF-family Brahma (BRM) remodeler in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene nuclei. This method combined with cleverly chosen reagents, mutants, or physiological contexts, allowed the authors to measure chromatin condensation along with the dynamics governing the interaction of BRM with chromatin. Several conclusions of interest could be reached through the work:</p><p>â With the vast majority of BRM is unbound at any given time, BRM remodeler interacts very transiently with chromatin, browsing nucleosomes largely located in decondensed regions.</p><p>â ATP binding reduces BRM retention at chromatin, as revealed by characterizing the in vivo dynamics of a Walker A motif mutant.</p><p>â ATP hydrolysis increases BRM release from chromatin, as revealed by characterizing the in vivo dynamics in the presence of ADP, or a slow hydrolysable ATP analogue, or a non-hydrolysable ATP ground state mimic.</p><p>â When applied to the specific physiological context of highly transcribed ecdysone-induced loci, only the (BRM-containing) PBAP remodeler appears essential; and, remarkably, PBAP fulfills this function without a local retention as shown for RNAPII, but by a rapid exchange.</p><p>â Consistent with â and expanding on â the previous conclusions, the presence of the ATP-binding deficient BRM mutant leads to the clustered binding of not only mutated BRM but also wild-type BRM, without the involvement of a phase separation (as 1,6-hexanediol did not affect the punctate/clustered pattern) but likely by accumulation due to excessive retention. Notably, as the authors rightly comment, these interesting results lead to the possibility of a direct cooperation or a hand-off mechanism between different tandem SWI/SNF remodelers, and will deserve further future investigation.</p><p>The conclusions listed above are relatively convincingly as they are well supported by the data. The discussion is clearly and thoughtfully written.</p><p>Altogether, this work rigorously addresses how ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle of the Brm remodeler, affects the in vivo dynamics of nucleosome browsing, binding and recycling. I think this will be of considerable interest to the remodeler and chromatin community, and recommend publication after revision in eLife.</p><p>1. To improve the manuscript, I will suggest that the authors consider slightly reorganizing the manuscript in order to bring in close proximity all the sections related to ATP binding and to ATP hydrolysis, which are currently separated by the characterization of the BRM dynamics at the ecdysone-induced loci.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, we have reorganized the manuscript according to the recommendations of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

I appreciate how the kinetics of the in vivo work was linked to former in vitro studies in the Discussion â and here the authors might consider (in addition to the works cited) how prior pre-steady state stopped-flow kinetic analysis of SWI/SNF-family remodelers and resulting kinetic and probabilistic models (Fischer et al., Biochemistry 2007) also generally align with their work â and how thinking about release as a probability during each ATPase cycle might be of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included these prescient findings in our discussion and included the insightful notion of release as a probability during each ATPase cycle (p18, line 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Finally â the identification of a GLTSCR1 ortholog (Figure 1) is really interesting. he authors mention this but do not explore more deeply. This affects the work in two ways â the possible existence of a GBAF/ncBAF related complex in flies, and that this complex may be participating in the processes observed. I understand that a full characterization of a possible separate fly GBAF/ncBAF complex (in addition to BAF and PBAF) is beyond the scope of the paper, but I will request that the authors revisit and discuss this issue in the Discussion to note its likely existence and possible participation in the data and processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the discussion and included a reference to a recent publication from the Bellen lab (Barish et al., 2020) that includes a further characterization of GBAF/ncBAF in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (page 14, line 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The polytenic chromosomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval salivary glands allow the visualization of interphase chromosomes in a linear, extended form. The authors applied confocal life-imaging confocal microscopy and FRAP analysis to polytene chromosomes to study the dynamic interactions of the (P)BAP remodeling complexes with chromatin. They observe through a series of intriguing experiments that the BRM ATPase interacts with open chromatin only transiently in the presence of hydrolysable ATP. Rapid redistribution of the complex in the nucleus requires continuous ATP hydrolysis. Polytene squashes remove ATP and lead to artefactual trapping of the complex at the sites of otherwise transient interaction. The salivary glands can be cultivated for some time and remain active so that treatment with the ecdysone triggers the characteristic site-specific 'puffing' of the chromosome as a measure of transcription. The authors manage to subject individual 'puffs' to FRAP analyses, a nice demonstration of their technical proficiency.</p><p>Although the very transient interactions of other nucleosome remodeling factors have been reported by Erdel and Rippe, the case of BRM is of interest to the chromatin community. The imaging of polytene chromosomes in their squashed and 'life' state is particularly illuminating. The authors push the system and attempt to correlate histone turnover with the presence of the BAP complex.</p><p>The study presents a wealth of data in a very compact format. As a result, some arguments appear a bit abbreviated, some methods poorly explained and some controls are lacking for stringent argumentation. This interesting manuscript that can be significantly improved by addressing the following comments.</p><p>1. Many findings are illustrated by single individual pictures (e.g. most panels in figure 2). While these illustrate the observations well, they represent individual cells and lack statistical robustness. It will be reassuring if the authors mention at strategic places that all images are representative of the large majority of cells and that similar ones have been obtained in biological replicates (i.e. same experiment on different days). Should this not be the case the readers must be warned accordingly, and the type and source of heterogeneity be detailed.</p></disp-quote><p>IF images of polytene spreads and whole mount images of salivary glands (or imaginal disks or embryos) are normally highly reproducible, therefore we did not state this explicitly. However, we have now included statements on the reproducibility of images of individual nuclei in the legends to Figure 1, 7 and 8. More importantly, we note that the IF images of different PBAF subunits in different figures are very similar. Moreover, IF and live cell imaging of polytene nuclei yield very similar images. Collectively, these comparisons emphasize the reproducibility of the images presented. In response to some later criticisms from this reviewer, we have included additional data (Figure 3C, Figure 6A-B, Figure 5-suppl.1G-H, and Figure 6-suppl.1C-D), which further illustrates the reproducibility of our imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors summarize published profiles to say that 70% of chromatin can be considered 'black'. Because they find only 1% of chromatin stained with GFP-H2B at 'black' intensity, they calculate a 25- to 150-fold level of chromatin compaction. Can we assume that the GFP-H2B intensities scale linearly with compaction? Since the GFP-histones are provided by transgenes, their expression is presumably not cell-cycle regulated. What are the levels of GFP-histones relative to the endogenous ones? Can we assume that the GFP-H2B is fully functional, i.e. a substrate to remodelers?</p></disp-quote><p>1) All data were collected using conditions that preserved linearity during data acquisition as much as possible. However, we cannot exclude small deviations at very low and very high fluorescence intensities. Moreover, there might be shielding and other effects that interfere with strict linearity. The GFP-H2B fluorescence was quantitated from 10 individual nuclei, 9 slices/nucleus. From this data set we concluded that 5% (not 1%) of the chromatin volume is âblackâ and 43% is âgreyâ. As explained in the methods, the chromocenter and telomers are recognizable structures that were used to calibrate the signal from black chromatin. Likewise, interbands and puffs were used to calibrate white chromatin. Chromatin bands that fall between âwhiteâ and âblackâ were assigned grey. This classification does not depend on linear scalability of GFP-H2B. The goal of these experiments was not to provide a very precise estimate of the amount of white, grey, and black chromatin, but to obtain an impression of their distribution in living cell polytene nuclei. What we find amazing is how well our estimates derived from vital imaging agree with those of Eagen et al. (2015), who used a completely different method (Hi-C) relying on fixed cells.</p><p>2) GFP-H2A and mCh-H2B fully co-localize (Figure 1F) and recapitulate the canonical chromosomal banding pattern. We cannot detect appreciable amounts of free histones in the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm, indicating there is no substantive over-expression. Moreover, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> expressing the tagged histones develop, pupate, and propagate normally. Thus, we have no indications that these tagged histones are not behaving normally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2 Supplement 1C. It is stated that GFP-BRM is efficiently incorporated into remodeler complexes. Here the level of GFP-BRM appears at least 10-fold higher that the level of endogenous BRM. This suggests that GFP-BRM is overexpressed to a worrying extent, where it may compete for the endogenous ATPase. How come that the excessive amount of BRM is not seen in the input? The question here is whether the properties of the tagged ATPase reflect those of the endogenous protein. Devil's advocate says that the endogenous protein constitutes the 'immobile fraction' that is, of course, not detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot detect BRM or GFP-BRM in the input extract from dissected salivary glands by western blotting. This is probably due to interfering proteins in that size range. BRM and GFPBRM are only detected in the MOR co-IPs, thus by definition as part of a remodeler complex. Note that we have no problems detecting GFP-SNR1, SNR1 and MOR. Loss of the architectural subunit MOR, leads to disintegration of the (P)BAP complexes and loss of GFPBRM (see Figure 1.suppl.1E, and Moshkin et al., 2007). This observation argues strongly that GFP-BRM only exists as part of a complex and not as a free protein. This interpretation is also in line with the published literature (see e.g., Mashtalir et al., 2018 Cell 175, p1272). Most likely, free endogenous BRM is degraded because its place in the (P)BAP complex is taken by GFP-BRM (see also Figure 4A). Importantly, all our major conclusions are supported by analysis of endogenous proteins and do not rely solely on the tagged remodeler subunits. Finally, the FRAP kinetics of GFP-SNR1, GFP-D4 and GFP-BRD7 are all very similar to those of GRPBRM (including the low expressing line).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;Similar FRAP kinetics were observed for a low-expressing GFP-BRM <italic>Drosophila</italic> line (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-C).&quot; How is low expression defined? Given the overexpression of BRM (point 5 above), why was the analysis not done with a line with more physiological levels (since it was apparently available)?</p></disp-quote><p>The primary reason is that we generated the Sgs3&gt;GFP-BRM line before the #59784 fly line became available. Expression of GFP-BRM in the salivary gland nuclei of the 59784 line is very low compared to Sgs3&gt;GFP-BRM, as judged by fluorescence. Importantly, nuclear distribution and kinetics of GFP-BRM in #59784 nuclei is indistinguishable from that in GFPBRM in Sgs3&gt;GFP-BRM. Thus, our measurements are not influenced by the expression level of GFP-BRM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is said that &quot;Depletion of BRM affects neither the polytene chromosome condensation pattern nor the binding of RNAPII (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A)&quot;.

If this statement was to be maintained some kind of quantification needs to be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. The RNAPII and DAPI stains of polytenes from the wt and BRM knockdown line both fall within the normal range of variability we observe for polytene spreads (whereas BRM is no longer detectable).

Thus volume linker DNA: 0.2 x ~ 6.10^9 x bp ~ 1nm^3 = ~1.2 Î¼m^3. The shell volume of a nucleosome is 3.28e+5 Ã^3. nucleosomal genome: 0.8 x 6.10^9 / 147 = 3.3.10^7 nucleosomes, resulting in an approximate volume of: 0.33e+8 x 3.28e+2 nm^3 = 1.1e+10 nm^3 = 11 Î¼m^3</p><p>Total volume chromatin: 1.2+11 = 12.2 Î¼m^3.
