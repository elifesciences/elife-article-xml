We investigated the biomarker potential of serum RNAs for the early detection of LC in smokers at different prediagnostic time intervals and histological subtypes. In total, 1061 samples from 925 individuals were analyzed. RNA sequencing with an average of 18 million reads per sample was performed. We generated machine learning models using normalized serum RNA levels and found that smokers later diagnosed with LC in 10 years can be robustly separated from healthy controls regardless of histology with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68–0.83). Furthermore, the strongest models that took both time to diagnosis and histology into account successfully predicted non-small cell LC (NSCLC) between 6 and 8 years, with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76–0.88), and SCLC between 2 and 5 years, with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.77–1.0), before diagnosis. The most important separators were microRNAs, miscellaneous RNAs, isomiRs, and tRNA-derived fragments. We have shown that LC can be detected years before diagnosis and manifestation of disease symptoms independently of histological subtype. However, the highest AUCs were achieved for specific subtypes and time intervals before diagnosis. The collection of models may therefore also predict the severity of cancer development and its histology. Our study demonstrates that serum RNAs can be promising prediagnostic biomarkers in an LC screening setting, from early detection to risk assessment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>prediagnostic samples</kwd><kwd>human serum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Biobanks and Health Data [229621/H10]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langseth</surname><given-names>Hilde</given-names></name><name><surname>Rounge</surname><given-names>Trine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Biobanks and Health Data [248791/H10]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langseth</surname><given-names>Hilde</given-names></name><name><surname>Rounge</surname><given-names>Trine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prediagnostic RNA levels show early lung cancer progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer (LC) continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths despite declining smoking prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wild et al., 2020</xref>). Non-small-cell (NSCLC) and small-cell (SCLC) are the two major subtypes of LC. The symptoms generally occur at a late stage and the prognosis is poor. Stage at diagnosis typically determines patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aberle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brustugun et al., 2018</xref>).

However, LDCT has limitations such as high false-positive rates, risk of overdiagnosis, and high costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gopal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peled and Ilouze, 2015</xref>). Annual CT scans also cause harmful radiation exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanash et al., 2018</xref>). Robust biomarkers can help stratify high-risk groups and increase accuracy in patient inclusion criteria for LDCT-based screening programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanash et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Liquid biopsies quantifying molecular biomarkers in circulation, such as tumor-derived DNAs, proteins, and RNAs, can be used to detect cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sandfeld-Paulsen et al., 2016</xref>). MicroRNAs (miRNA), a class of ~21 nucleotide long short RNAs, have been widely investigated for their biomarker potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fehlmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keller and Meese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pichler and Calin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>). They can be found both in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keller and Meese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murillo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Umu et al., 2018</xref>) and in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freedman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keller and Meese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murillo et al., 2019</xref>) as cell-free circulating RNAs, which may originate from dying cells or be actively secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaporozhchenko et al., 2018</xref>). Some of them are bounded by proteins or confined in layered exosomes which can protect them from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fritz et al., 2016</xref>). MiRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncomiRs and regulate tumor traits such as cell growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pichler and Calin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Svoronos et al., 2016</xref>). The search for RNA biomarkers is not limited to miRNAs. Aberrant expression of other RNA classes, such as protein coding mRNAs, tRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), has been associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slack and Chinnaiyan, 2019</xref>). Despite the immense potential of cell-free RNAs, the promise of non-invasive RNA biomarkers of cancer has not yet been fulfilled.</p><p>One explanation of the lack of circulating RNAs used in clinical settings is our limited understanding of the prediagnostic dynamics of cell-free RNAs, since studies are usually based on samples at or after diagnosis. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process that turns cell functions from normal to malignant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). It can cause temporal changes in RNA levels linked to cellular processes driven by the hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutschner and Diederichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). We have shown that prediagnostic RNA levels in serum are highly dynamic in LC patients, which may signal early carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Umu et al., 2020</xref>). A similar result was observed in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lund et al., 2016</xref>) and testicular cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2020</xref>). A lack of reproducibility among studies is also a problem, caused by technical and biological factors such as storage time, sampling procedure, age, sex, smoking history, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rounge et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore important to control for these factors.</p><p>In the present study, our objective was to identify serum RNA-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of LC using prediagnostic samples. We identified the optimal machine learning (ML) algorithm for RNA biomarker modeling. Optimization of prediction models was done with an ML workflow, including cross-validation and testing, which was repeated five times to increase the generalizability of our results. We also investigated the biological relevance of the best RNA separators in the context of cancer biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient characteristics and RNA-seq profiles</title><p>In this study, we selected 400 patients with prediagnostic serum samples including multiple samples from the same patients.

The best algorithm, XGBoost, resulted in an average accuracy of 69% without feature selection. An analysis of the features showed a large panel of selected RNAs: more than 300 out of available 3306 (with no feature selection implemented). This may be interpreted as a general shift in the levels of RNAs during cancer development, consistent with our previous study that showed hundreds of RNAs were differentially expressed up to 10 years before diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Umu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We found that some features were considerably more important (and frequent) separators than others with or without feature selection. The list includes piRNAs (e.g. piR-hsa-28723), miRNAs (e.g. hsa-miR-574–5p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p), isomiRs (e.g. isomiR of hsa-miR-423–5p (iso-20-5KP25HFF), hsa-miR-486–5p (iso-23-8YUYFYKSY)), and miscRNAs (e.g. RN7SL181P). Some of them were particularly interesting since they were associated with cancer or proposed as cancer biomarkers. Hsa-miR-30a-5p is a tumor suppressor and downregulated in LC tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yanaihara et al., 2006</xref>). It regulates oncogenes such as <italic>RAB38</italic> and <italic>RAB27B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">The RNAcentral Consortium, 2019</xref>). Another notable example is hsa-miR-574–5p which promotes metastasis in NSCLC by targeting <italic>PCP2</italic> in tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) and has been proposed as an early stage NSCLC serum biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foss et al., 2011</xref>). Hsa-miR-574–5p was among the most important features in lasso-selected and miRNA-only histology-specific SCLC models. It was also one of the most important features in our histology-specific NSCLC models. There were also isomiRs among the most important features such as hsa-miR-486–5p canonical form, which was the best separator for all histologies. Hsa-miR-486–5p targets <italic>PIK3R1</italic> to suppress cell growth. Its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and invasion and it was significantly downregulated in both tissue and serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>). Hsa-miR-486–5p was proposed as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">ElKhouly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Besides miRNAs and isomiRs, RNAs of other classes were noteworthy and linked to carcinogenesis. For example, 7SL, a member of miscRNAs, is upregulated in tumor cells. It binds to <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA at the 3'UTR region and downregulates its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmohsen et al., 2014</xref>). 7SL-related transcripts (e.g. RN7SL181P) were among the most important separators in the cell histology, NSCLC- and SCLC-specific models. Another example is Y-RNA and we found that Y-RNA and related genes (e.g. RNY4P30) were among the most important features for NSCLC models. Y-RNA was also chosen as an important feature by the lasso-selected NSCLC models. Y-RNA-derived small RNAs function as tumor suppressors in NSCLC. They inhibit cell proliferation and were proposed as circulating RNA biomarkers since they were upregulated in NSCLC EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Inclusion of both prediagnostic time and histology produced better models in certain time windows (e.g. 2–5 years before diagnosis for SCLC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This can be explained by the dynamic nature of prediagnostic RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Umu et al., 2020</xref>). Important features of these models can also be linked to early carcinogenesis and some were specific to these models. For example, hsa-miR-339–3p was among the most important features of SCLC prediagnostic models. Hsa-miR-339–3p is a tumor suppressor and was proposed as a serum biomarker of LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). We retrained some of these prediagnostic models using the most frequent features and achieved higher prediction performance than the full-time models in specific time intervals. We reported these models in supplementary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The most important features of histology-specific models also showed associations with carcinogenesis-related KEGG pathways, which were common or specific to histology. The common ones include well-known signaling (e.g. RAS, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, ErbB) and cancer-related pathways (e.g. proteoglycans in cancer and pathways in cancer). Choline metabolism in cancer pathway was one of the common ones and enriched in some histology-specific prediagnostic models. Altered choline profiles are characteristics of tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glunde et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, a lipidome serum profiling study on early stage NSCLC patients proposed choline-containing phospholipids as potential LC biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klupczynska et al., 2019</xref>). Enrichment of choline metabolism pathway years before diagnosis (i.e. NSCLC 6–8 and SCLC 2–5) supports this conclusion. We also reported enrichment of this pathway for all histologies before diagnosis in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Umu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A strength of our study is the large sample size from prediagnostic cases and a large control group from cancer-free individuals from the same cohort. We have detailed information on histological subtype and stage at diagnosis from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) and smoking history from survey data. We also accounted for other potential confounders (i.e. age, sex, and blood donor group [BDg]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rounge et al., 2018</xref>). Some of our potential biomarkers (e.g. hsa-miR-30a-5p, sa-miR-339–3p, 7SL) were already associated with carcinogenesis or proposed as biomarkers, which shows consistent results with current literature. Further, we found potential biomarkers from overlooked RNA classes which add important new knowledge into the field. We shared the average feature importance of all RNAs as supplementary tables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We investigated performance of different algorithms which showed consistent results in terms of AUCs and features. We compiled shortlists from the most important features and tested their performance in a leave-out dataset on both smokers and non-smokers. We also found that smokers with a positive test had more than two times higher risk of getting LC diagnosis in future (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>There are some weaknesses in our study that we need to address. First, an independent cohort should replicate our results. However, only a few cohorts include prediagnostic samples that can be used for discovery and validation. We tried to overcome this issue by using training-testing repeats for assessing generalisability. We also reported our results with and without feature selection since some feature selection methods (e.g. lasso and univariate) can cause overfitting. Second, using more than one sample from the same individual can potentially cause overfitting. However, we did not detect any effect related to this issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Third, our study focused only on smokers (since case samples are mostly smokers). However, our results show acceptable performance when including non-smokers as a test dataset as well. Fourth, reuse of the same data for frequent biomarker models (as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) can also result in overfitting. We tried to overcome this issue by including a leave-out dataset (which was never used) into the test set and reported performance. Lastly, since our samples are long-term stored, some unstable RNA molecules may have been degraded over the years, though we have already shown that this effect is negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Umu et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, we matched cases and controls for BDg which includes the effect of storage time (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In LC screening programs, RNA biomarkers can be used as a tool of initial assessment or combined with LDCT for early detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanash et al., 2018</xref>). We found that smokers with a positive test had higher risk of getting LC diagnosis in future (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We also found that our biomarkers can be potentially used on non-smokers, especially SCLC biomarkers. However, we do not have enough non-smoker cases to further validate this interpretation. The dynamic nature of the prediagnostic signal for cancer may pose challenges for the performance of modeling and biomarker development. However, using a set of models specific for histology and time might provide additional information useful in evaluating LC risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our proposed use of RNA biomarkers starts with risk assessment using standard full-time models which can be used for an initial assessment in smokers when the disease is undetectable. A positive signal (i.e. high probability of being in LC group) classifies those individuals into an elevated risk group. Since prediagnostic models have a 2-year peak performance, every second-year testing with these models can provide confirmation of preneoplasia or an early stage tumor for individuals with elevated risk and selection criteria for CT monitoring. Prediagnostic models had higher overall specificity (more than 80%) which can help to determine future diagnosis histology. However, it requires further research. We selected two sets of histology-specific diagnostic models for early/late NSCLC and SCLC diagnosis and reported these in the supplementary document (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). RNA biomarkers can prevent unnecessary use of LDCT while improving the chance of an early diagnosis of LC in an early stage. This hypothesis can be investigated in screening programs for validation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that LC can be detected in both smokers and non-smokers years before diagnosis and the manifestation of symptoms regardless of histological subtype. We also proposed a model on how RNA biomarkers can be utilized in clinical settings. Our top performing models can produce AUCs up to 0.9 before diagnosis suggesting a great potential for LC early prediction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population and data sources</title><p>We used the population-based Janus Serum Bank (JSB) cohort containing prediagnostic serum samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langseth et al., 2017</xref>). The study participants were identified by linking the JSB to the CRN. We restricted our analyses to patients later diagnosed with LC up to 10 years after blood donation and control samples from individuals cancer-free (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at least 10 years after sample collection. We matched cases and controls on confounders (see Bioinformatics analyses). Smoking, collected from health survey data, was classified as current, former, or never smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hjerkind et al., 2017</xref>). Since we have previously shown that smoking significantly affects RNA expression levels, we only included smokers (i.e. current and former) in the initial analyses and model building. However, non-smokers and samples not included by the frequency matching were used as an additional independent leave-out dataset to assess the level of overfitting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tumor staging</title><p>Detailed cancer information was selected from the CRN that has systematically collected mandatory notification on cancer occurrence for the Norwegian population since 1952 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsen et al., 2009</xref>). The cases were classified into histological subtypes: NSCLC, SCLC, and others, the latter referring to other less defined or multiple histologies. Stage at diagnosis was encoded with the TNM system: early (localized – stage I), locally advanced (regional – stages II and III), advanced or metastatic (distant – stage IV), and unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Registry of Norway, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Laboratory processing</title><p>We extracted RNA from 400 µL serum using phenol-chloroform and miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). We performed size selection using a 3% Agarose Gel Cassette (Cat. No CSD3010) on a Pippin Prep (Sage Science) with a cut size optimized to cover RNA molecules from 17 to 47 nt in length. Libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Small RNA kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 platform to on average 18 million sequences per sample (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bioinformatic analyses</title><p>Our bioinformatics workflow includes quality control, adapter trimming, read mapping, read counting, and creation of count tables. We used a large annotation dataset containing several RNA classes available in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Umu et al., 2018</xref>), including miRBase (v22.1) for miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozomara et al., 2019</xref>), piRBase (v1.0) for piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and the GENCODE (v26) for other RNA classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>). We used the AdapterRemoval tool for adapter trimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schubert et al., 2016</xref>) and Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) for mapping reads to the human genome (hg38) with an average mapping ratio of 70%. The SeqBuster tool was used for miRNA annotation counts and isomiR calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pantano et al., 2010</xref>). We filtered out the RNAs with fewer than five reads in less than 80% of the samples. All isomiRs passed the expression were regarded as bona fide isomiRs. We used DESeq2’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2014</xref>) variance stabilizing normalization function to normalize identified RNA counts. The <italic>optmatch</italic> (v0.9–11) R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen and Klopfer, 2006</xref>) selected appropriately matched controls while building models. Therefore, we matched LC samples and controls on sex, age at donation, and BDg. BDg is a technical cofounder combining the effect of sample treatment at donation and storage time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rounge et al., 2018</xref>). We used R function kegga from the limma package for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of selected RNA features if they are miRNA, isomiR, or mRNA. The miRNA and isomiR targets were extracted from MIRDB (v5.0) predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong and Wang, 2015</xref>) (score cutoff &gt;60). p-Values were adjusted using false discovery rate (FDR) (using <italic>p.adjust</italic> function of R).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ML classification algorithms and training/testing workflow</title><p>High dimensionality is often a problem in modeling RNA-seq data. Our preliminary analysis showed that ML algorithms with regularization produced successful models. Therefore, we selected five ML algorithms to create our initial models: lasso, elastic-net, sparse group lasso (SGL), RF, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We used fivefold cross-validation (if available) to tune hyperparameters for model training. For the SGL models, RNAs were classified by type.</p><p>R implementations of these algorithms were used: <italic>caret</italic> (v6.0–84) and <italic>glmnet</italic> (v2.0–18) packages for elastic-net and the lasso, <italic>sglfast</italic> (v0.10) and <italic>msgl</italic> (v2.3.9) for the SGL models and <italic>xgboost</italic> (v1.0.0.2) for XGBoost. Classifications were performed according to histology and time to diagnosis (for details see next paragraph) using an automated ML workflow. In the ML workflow the datasets were split into training (70%) and test (30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We repeated this step five times using designated seed numbers to select five different training and test datasets which were balanced for case/control numbers and also matched for confounders (i.e. sex, age, and BDg). Model optimization including hyperparameter tuning was done by a grid search approach followed by fivefold cross-validation using the training sets. The test datasets were only used for testing to overcome overfitting and assess true performance. The performance of the classifiers were mainly evaluated by area under the ROC curves (AUC)s. We also calculated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Confidence interval calculations were done using metrics of test datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology and prediagnostic models</title><p>We refer to models for all histologies, NSCLC and SCLC that do not take time to diagnose into account as standard full-time models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Prediagnostic models were created using a sliding windows approach and a fixed-time approach to find optimal time to diagnose intervals. We first selected three different window sizes, 2, 3, and 4 years, which were moved over the 10 years prior to diagnosis time. We then built models based on samples captured by these sliding windows. Fixed-time windows were 0–2, 0–5, and 0–8 years before diagnosis. We used the workflow described above to train and test both standard and prediagnostic models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Feature selection methods</title><p>We implemented feature selection methods to improve model performances, including single-RNA class, lasso selection, and significant selection. In the single-RNA class method, we dropped all RNA types except one. In lasso selection, all non-zero features selected by the lasso classification models were pooled. Next, we retrained new classification models which were restricted to use only these features. In significance selection, an univariate regression analysis was done per feature and significant features (multiple testing adjusted) were used to train classification models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Frequent feature models, independent leave-out test, and RR calculations</title><p>We created models for each histology which utilize the most frequent features identified in the standard full-time models.

To the test sets we also added non-smokers and samples from smokers, but not previously used in frequency matching (number of samples reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Both unmatchable samples and non-smokers were never used for model building and evaluation which we refer to as leave-out sets. We did not repeat this analysis five times as in the automated ML workflow. RRs were calculated using the test sets. The optimal threshold was identified in cross-validation.

They observed that smokers later diagnosed with LC can be robustly separated from healthy controls by using machine learning models with serum RNAs profiles. This work demonstrated that serum RNAs could be promising prediagnostic biomarkers in a LC screening setting. This finding is interesting but not convincing because only one sample cohort was evaluated in current study and the datasets generated for this manuscript are not available. Also there are some concerns as follows.</p><p>1.The analysis and result of serum RNA sequencing were not clearly presented.

In the machine learning analysis, they used 70% samples for training and 30% samples for testing. The process was repeated 5 times so that the samples can be assigned to both training and testing groups.</p><p>The strength of the study is that they include a large cohort of samples collected years before the development of LC.</p><p>The weaknesses of the study include</p><p>1. the questionable biological basis of this approach. As the samples were collected years before cancer diagnosis, the amount of tumor-derived RNA is expected to be very low. In this regard, the aberrations in serum RNA, if any, are likely to reflect the background risk of the body as a whole.</p><p>2. multiple samples from the same cancer subject. If samples from one subject go to both the training and testing set, there would be issues of overfitting. The authors would need to remove the duplicate samples from the analysis.</p><p>3. the low diagnostic performance. The sensitivity and specificity of the models were both around 70%. This would not be useful clinically. In fact, the use of relative risk for individuals with positive and negative test results would be more useful for predictive models.</p><p>4. The authors used a sliding window of fixed duration for the analysis. This analysis is counter-intuitive. If a marker is useful for predicting cancer at 3-5 years before cancer, what is the reason why it cannot predict cancers that occur within 3 years. It would be better to use windows with flexible size e.g. prediction of cancer in the next 2, then next 3, then next 5 years, etc.</p><p>5. For the analysis on lines 338 onwards, the authors further select features identified in the previous machine learning models for evaluation. What is the testing group in this analysis?

They are derived from miRs, or degradation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now improved the presentation of the analysis and results throughout the manuscript. The manuscript builds on previous publications showing feasibility and profiles of serum small RNA sequencing, confounding, long-term stability and differential expression in cancer in this biobank (Rounge et al., CEBP 2015, Umu et al., RNA Biology, 2018, Rounge et al., Sci Rep, 2018, Umu et al., Mol Oncol, 2020 and Burton et al., Front in Oncol, 2020).</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that more information about the characteristics of the RNA profiles would be helpful to the reader. To answer the specific questions: First, the average mapping rate was around 70%. We revised the materials methods section “<italic>laboratory processing and bioinformatic analyses</italic>” and included the information on mapping tools and rates. We created a separate section called “Bioinformatic analyses” (see page 4 and 5).</p><p>Regarding long-term storage, we already showed that long-term stored samples are a viable source for small RNA analysis (Rounge et al., 2015). Small RNAs (e.g. miRNA) are stable during long-term archiving (Umu et al., 2018). We showed that some traits such as sex, age of patients and blood donor group (BDg) affect RNA profiles. Therefore, these traits must be matched between cases and controls. BDg refers to a technical cofounder combining the effect of sample treatment at donation and storage time (Rounge et al., 2018). In this revision, we further explained this and added these sentences into Materials and methods:</p><p>“Therefore, we frequency matched LC samples and controls on sex, age at donation, and blood donor group (BDg). BDg is a technical cofounder combining the effect of sample treatment at donation and storage time (Rounge et al., 2018).” (see page 4)</p><p>In Umu et al., 2018, we also investigated whether RNAs were degradation products or not. We found that RNA fragments, such as tRNA derived fragments, had specific expression patterns, which can be explained by RNA biogenesis. We concluded that many RNA fragments in serum must be biological products, including tRFs and isomiRs. Therefore, in our submitted manuscript, we used the SeqCluster (miraligner) tool and we regarded all isomiRs which passed the expression threshold as bona fide isomiRs. In this version, we also included mirTOP identifiers of candidate isomiRs.</p><p>Our definition of expression threshold is:</p><p>“any RNAs with more than 5 reads mapped in 80% of the samples”.</p><p>This is a high threshold to detect robust signals of expression. We now cited SeqCluster and mirTOP and included our expression detection threshold in Materials and methods, which was missing in our initial submission. (see page 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors showed that the candidate biomarkers were involved in the cancer-related pathways. This result is somewhat overestimated because these RNAs are small RNAs and the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis is based on the targets.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. miRNAs can target multiple genes. Unfortunately there is no easy way to do pathway enrichment analysis for other important small RNAs (e.g. miscRNAs), which are underrepresented. We believe it is a plausible assumption to expect miRNAs will disrupt a large set of biological pathways including cancer related ones since they often regulate multiple mRNAs.</p><p>While predicting miRNA targets, we used a high threshold to reduce the total number of false positives. We also performed a multiple testing correction to filter out less significant enrichments. Our literature search (as discussed in the results and discussion) also showed that many biomarker candidates, such as miRNAs and some other sncRNAs, were associated with cancer-related pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A strength of this study is the large sample size from prediagnostic cases and a large control group from cancer-free individuals from the same cohort. The authors obtained RNA-seq data from 1061 serum samples. However, only samples from a total of 645 individuals with smoking history were analyzed. It would be helpful to include the samples without smoking to investigate the specificity of the potential biomarkers.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewers suggested, we included non-smokers for AUC estimation and relative risk calculation. This also assessed the robustness and overfitting issue that was brought by the reviewers (please refer to question 7). Non-smokers were not used for training and only used to evaluate frequent biomarkers. We put non-smokers characteristics table into the supplementary document (Table S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There are concerns regarding multiple samples from the same cancer subject. If samples from one subject go to both the training and testing set, there would be issues of overfitting. In the revision, the authors need to remove the duplicate samples from the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we repeated the XGBoost modelling described in the Results section “ML algorithms can differentiate between prediagnostic cases and controls regardless of prediagnostic time” without multiple samples. We selected only one sample per patient. We used the identical modelling workflow. Our results showed similar performance in terms of AUCs. We therefore concluded that multiple samples do not cause overfitting or any bias (see supplementary document, Figure S2).</p><p>We discussed this result briefly in the main manuscript by writing:</p><p>“Second, using more than one sample from the same individual can potentially cause overfitting. However, we did not detect any effect related to this issue (Figure S2).” (see page 18)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Calculate the relative risk for future cancer development for individuals with positive and negative test results.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this issue and calculated the relative risk (Table 3). We explained how we calculate the relative risk in Materials and methods. (Please also see revision answer 7)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Instead of using sliding windows of fixed duration, use windows of increasing duration.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we used a fixed duration approach as suggested by the reviewers. We used three different time windows 0 to 2 years, 0 to 5 years and 0 to 8 years before diagnosis. These points were selected because the results showed slight improvement in the model performance in some time windows. The performance is not as good as sliding window models.</p><p>However, we included the results from fixed-duration models to the supplementary document as a separate section (Table S3) and briefly discussed the results in main manuscript by adding this paragraph:</p><p>“As an alternative to sliding windows, we also performed a fixed window approach and trained models using samples from up to 2 years (0-2), up to 5 years (0-5) and up to 8 years (0-8) before diagnosis. The results showed slight improvement in model performance compared to full time models (see supplementary document and Table S1). However, sliding windows models performed better on specific time intervals.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Address the issue of over-fitting for the analysis from line 338 onwards.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that overfitting might be an issue. We tried to overcome this by including an independent dataset that was never used for testing or training.</p><p>Our machine learning workflow balances for case/control numbers and also matches samples in training and test based on “age”, “sex” and “BDg”. (Please see revision answer 1 and page 4 of the manuscript). Therefore, we previously discarded unmatchable samples for each strata and these samples were never not used. We have now utilized them to assess model performance and to assess overfitting by adding them into the testing group for section “Frequent features can create simple and accurate models”.</p><p>Furthermore, we added non-smokers into the testing dataset. We measured evaluation metrics on test datasets which returned a better estimate on the model performance.</p><p>In short, the training group contains 80% and the test group contains 20% plus smokers that have never been used for training (i.e. unmatchable samples) and non-smokers that we did not use in our original submission. We refer to these samples as independent leave-out dataset. We showed in Table 3 how many of the test set samples were never used. However, overfitting might still be an issue but we wanted to find and report a shortlist of the best biomarkers for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The proposed use of the analysis (Figure 5 and the discussion) does not appear to be realistic. The authors need to calculate the percentage of subjects falling into the test positive and negative groups based on their analysis. Then, for each group, what percentage of subjects will eventually develop LC.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and to accommodate the reviewers comments, we have updated Figure 4 and the discussion. Please see the highlighted text (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study by Umu et al., investigated the biomarker potential of serum RNAs for the early detection of lung cancer (LC) in smokers at different prediagnostic time intervals and histological subtypes. They observed that smokers later diagnosed with LC can be robustly separated from healthy controls by using machine learning models with serum RNAs profiles. This work demonstrated that serum RNAs could be promising prediagnostic biomarkers in a LC screening setting. This finding is interesting but not convincing because only one sample cohort was evaluated in current study and the datasets generated for this manuscript are not available. Also there are some concerns as follows.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately the datasets generated for this article are not readily available because of the principles and conditions set out in articles 6 (1) (e) and 9 (2) (j) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, in a collaborative setting, data is available and can be shared in a secure environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.The analysis and result of serum RNA sequencing were not clearly presented. RNA sequencing with an average of 18 million reads per sample was performed. How about the mapped rate? Since the samples are long-term stored and may be at different times of collection, it is important that the sequencing results should be consisent. How about the sample correlations? In addition, why many of the RNA candidates (1137 of 3306) are isomiRs? They are derived from miRs, or degradation?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.The authors showed that the candidate biomarkers were invovled in the cancer-related pathways. This result is somewhat overestimated because these RNAs are small RNAs and the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis is based on the targets.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.A strength of this study is the large sample size from prediagnostic cases and a large control group from cancer-free individuals from the same cohort. The authors obtained RNA-seq data from 1061 serum samples. However, only samples from a total of 645 individuals with smoking history were analyzed. It would be helpful to include the samples without smoking to investigate the specificity of the potential biomarkers.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors analyzed archived serum samples which were collected before the development of lung cancer (LC) for different species of RNA.</p><p>They used machine learning to investigate if the combination of the RNA markers would be useful for the prediction of the future development of LC. In the machine learning analysis, they used 70% samples for training and 30% samples for testing. The process was repeated 5 times so that the samples can be assigned to both training and testing groups.</p><p>The strength of the study is that they include a large cohort of samples collected years before the development of LC.</p><p>The weaknesses of the study include</p><p>1. the questionable biological basis of this approach. As the samples were collected years before cancer diagnosis, the amount of tumor-derived RNA is expected to be very low. In this regard, the aberrations in serum RNA, if any, are likely to reflect the background risk of the body as a whole.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, the origin of serum RNAs can be different tissues including immune cells or tumor cells. After diagnosis, the size of the tumor can still be too small to detect any originating RNAs. It is plausible that we detect RNAs originating from any tissues which signal cancer progression. We included a few sentences and citations that discuss the origin of circulating RNAs as well (see introduction, second paragraph).</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we calculated the RR of a positive prediction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. multiple samples from the same cancer subject. If samples from one subject go to both the training and testing set, there would be issues of overfitting. The authors would need to remove the duplicate samples from the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we tested this effect and added the results into the Supplementary documents. Please also see the essential revisions answer 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. the low diagnostic performance. The sensitivity and specificity of the models were both around 70%. This would not be useful clinically. In fact, the use of relative risk for individuals with positive and negative test results would be more useful for predictive models.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors used a sliding window of fixed duration for the analysis. This analysis is counter-intuitive. If a marker is useful for predicting cancer at 3-5 years before cancer, what is the reason why it cannot predict cancers that occur within 3 years. It would be better to use windows with flexible size e.g. prediction of cancer in the next 2, then next 3, then next 5 years, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For the analysis on lines 338 onwards, the authors further select features identified in the previous machine learning models for evaluation. What is the testing group in this analysis? Did they use all the samples without separating training and testing groups? If so, the over-fitting problem would be significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
