preserve renal function. Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and fibroblasts isolated from patients with cystinosis were transcriptionally profiled. Lysosomal fractionation, immunoblotting, confocal microscopy, intracellular pH, TEM, and mitochondrial stress test were performed for validation. CRISPR, <italic>CTNS</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs were generated. Alterations in cell stress, pH, autophagic turnover, and mitochondrial energetics highlighted key changes in the V-ATPases in patient-derived and <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs. ATP6V0A1 was significantly downregulated in cystinosis and highly co-regulated with loss of <italic>CTNS</italic>. Correction of ATP6V0A1 rescued cell stress and mitochondrial function. Treatment of <italic>CTNS</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs with antioxidants ATX induced ATP6V0A1 expression and improved autophagosome turnover and mitochondrial integrity. Our exploratory transcriptional and in vitro cellular and functional studies confirm that loss of Cystinosin in RPTECs, results in a reduction in ATP6V0A1 expression, with changes in intracellular pH, mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial function, and autophagosome-lysosome clearance. The novel findings are ATP6V0A1’s role in cystinosis-associated renal pathology and among other antioxidants, ATX specifically upregulated ATP6V0A1, improved autophagosome turnover or reduced autophagy and mitochondrial integrity. This is a pilot study highlighting a novel mechanism of tubular injury in cystinosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cystinosis</kwd><kwd>kidney disease</kwd><kwd>genetic renal</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>CKD</kwd><kwd>lysosomal storage disorder</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001590</institution-id><institution>Health Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarwal</surname><given-names>Minnie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003719</institution-id><institution>Cystinosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarwal</surname><given-names>Minnie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ATP6V0A1 was identified as a key player in nephropathic cystinosis-related renal pathology, with antioxidants like ATX emerging as potential treatments to restore V0A1 expression, mitochondrial function, and balance autophagic processes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) form a significant subgroup of inherited metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anikster et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fuller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Touchman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballabio and Gieselmann, 2009</xref>), with an incidence of more than 1:5000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gholami Yarahmadi et al., 2022</xref>). Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive LSD, caused by mutations in the <italic>CTNS</italic> gene, encoding lysosomal membrane transporter Cystinosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalatzis et al., 2001</xref>). Deletion of 57 kb of the <italic>CTNS</italic> gene is the most common mutation that accounts for approximately 75% of the affected alleles in northern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Town et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attard et al., 1999</xref>). A deficiency of  Cystinosin results in lysosomal cystine accumulation and cystine crystal formation in virtually all tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalatzis et al., 2001</xref>). The kidney is the first organ affected functionally despite lysosomal cystine loading in multiple tissues and organ systems. Based on severity and age at onset of renal injury, cystinosis is phenotypically classified into nephropathic/infantile (OMIM219800; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Town et al., 1998</xref>), juvenile (OMIM 219900; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attard et al., 1999</xref>), and ocular (OMIM 219750; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anikster et al., 2000</xref>). The most severe form is nephropathic/infantile cystinosis, characterized by the development of renal Fanconi syndrome and glomerular dysfunction, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by 10 years of age, extendable to the second decade of life with cystine depletion therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherqui and Courtoy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmonem et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, persistent Fanconi and progressive renal failure remains a reality for these patients despite robust adherence to cystine depletion therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilmer et al., 2011</xref>). These observations suggest that Cystinosin or other key molecular perturbations impact renal tubular integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellomo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hollywood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jamalpoor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Leo et al., 2020</xref>) and function besides cystine transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although associative functional roles for Cystinosin have been identified, including inactive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ivanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nevo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansanwal and Sarwal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sansanwal and Sarwal, 2010</xref>), defective autophagy, flawed clearance of damaged mitochondria by disrupted mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luciani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>), lysosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sansanwal and Sarwal, 2010</xref>), abnormal tight junction-associated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sansanwal et al., 2010</xref>), vesicular transport defects, and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luciani et al., 2018</xref>), the underlying drivers for these injuries have not been well identified, resulting in a paucity of new therapies to improve outcomes in nephropathic cystinosis. Furthermore, we and others have shown that renal biopsies from patients with nephropathic cystinosis reveal morphologically abnormal mitochondria and mitophagy with autophagic vacuoles, reduced mitochondrial numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sansanwal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raggi et al., 2014</xref>), increased ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sansanwal et al., 2015</xref>) and reduced lysosomal enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sansanwal et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that defective lysosomal clearance may be a pivotal cause of the altered function of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). Given lysosomes ubiquitous presence in all tissues and organ-systems, we hypothesized that a comparison of transcriptional profiles of renal and extra-renal tissues from patients with nephropathic cystinosis would shed light on the unique lysosomal changes in the human kidney responsible for both the renal tubular injury in Fanconi and the progressive renal tubular injury resulting in ESRD. With this in mind, we investigated whole-genome expression profiles in paired RPTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naguib, 2000</xref>; isolated from patient urine samples) and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambati et al., 2014</xref>; isolated from the same patient skin biopsies) from patients with cystinosis and healthy age- and gender-matched controls. We identified dysregulation of the vacuolar (V)-ATPase multigene family, specifically ATP6V0A1, only in cystinotic RPTECs and not in normal RPTECs and fibroblasts or cystinotic fibroblasts. To further study the structural and functional consequences of ATP6V0A1 deficiency, a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated <italic>CTNS</italic>-knock-out (<italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) immortalized RPTEC line was generated as an in-vitro model that mimicked structural and functional changes seen in patient-derived RPTECs. The <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs also demonstrated ATP6V0A1 downregulation, resulting in significant functional (loss of intracellular pH, decreased autophagic flux, compromised mitochondrial ATP-production) and structural consequences (increased vacuolization, lack of mitochondrial cristae, reduced number of mitochondria, ER-stress, and intracellular lipid droplet (LD) formation). Further, correction of ATP6V0A1 in <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs and treatment with antioxidants specifically, astaxanthin (ATX) increased the production of cellular ATP6V0A1, identified from a custom FDA-drug database generated by our group, partially rescued the nephropathic RPTEC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petri and Lundebye, 2007</xref>). ATX is a xanthophyll carotenoid occurring in a wide variety of organisms. ATX is reported to have the highest known antioxidant activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) and has proven to have various anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, and cytoprotective activities both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petri and Lundebye, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Nun et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foreman and Benson, 1990</xref>). We are the first to show that ATX can induce the expression of ATP6V0A1 and has a protective effect against cystinosis-induced autophagosome formation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We have used other antioxidants, such as, Cysteamine and Vitamin E, but both had no effect on ATP6V0A1 protein expression. Our findings lead us to believe that ATP6V0A1 is not only a potential target for therapy in cystinosis, but that ATX has the potential to be repurposed as a ATP6V0A1-inducer and has potential to be used as a combination treatment with cysteamine for the renal pathology in nephropathic cystinosis that persists despite current cystine depletion therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellomo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hollywood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jamalpoor et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> summarizes the study design. Briefly, the study is divided into three steps. First, transcriptional study with genome microarray in RPTE and fibroblast cells. Second, protein study and functional assays in primary and lab generated RPTECs. Third, correcting the error by using plasmid or inducers to express ATP6V0A1 and checking its effect on the downstream markers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> represents the schematic overview of the established (black) and hypothesized (blue) mechanisms in normal and cystinotic RPTECs. In summary, we show that compared to healthy, cystinotic RPTECs have dysfunctional <italic>CTNS</italic> that affects the expression of v-ATPases and SLCs, which reduces mTORC1 activity, increases autophagy, compromises mitochondrial function, and causes defective autophago-lysosomal clearance.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall study design, workflow, and schematic overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcriptome profiling with gene microarray performed on cystinotic, normal, and CDME-treated RPTECs and fibroblasts (<italic>Step 1</italic>). Bioinformatic analysis allowed the identification of genes that are differentially regulated in cystinosis versus normal in both the cell types. Pathway analysis was performed with all the significantly regulated genes, and 11 pathways were found to be significantly affected in cystinotic RPTECs. Most of these pathways and the genes in these pathways are crucial for lysosomal acidic pH and mitochondrial ATP production. Dysfunctional mitochondria and compromised intracellular pH were validated in <italic>Step 2</italic>. Our CRISPR-mediated <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> immortalized renal cell line mimicked cystinosis patient primary cells isolated from their urine. Further, we rescued (<italic>Step 3</italic>) the disease phenotype of the cell by over-expressing ATP6V0A1, the most significantly downregulated gene among other V-ATPases. RNP, Ribonucleoprotein; V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase; RPTEC, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. (<bold>B</bold>) A schematic overview of normal and cystinotic RPTECs. We previously showed that loss of function of Cystinosin in cystinotic cells inactivates the mTORC pathway, and induces autophagy, mitophagy, and clusterin protein expression. In this study, we show that downregulation of <italic>CTNS</italic> gene also downregulates V-ATPase expression resulting in the loss of lysosomal acidity (pH). The basic pH thus blocks lysosomal clearance after autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Inhibited autophagy flux may explain why cystinotic cells have increased LC3B-II expression. Disrupted intracellular pH also impairs proton-dependent import of amino acids and other metabolites (noted in our microarray data) into the lysosome lumen, and inhibits conversion of these imported large heterodimeric amino acids into usable form. This increases the presence of metabolites in the cytoplasm that may compromise mitochondrial function and increase ROS production through an unspecified mechanism.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94169-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global transcriptional changes in cystinotic RPTEC affect lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways</title><p>Performed genome wide transcriptional profiling of normal and cystinotic RPTECs and skin fibroblasts with and without cystine dimethylester (CDME), used to load lysosomes with cystine to mimic the basic defect in cystinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reimand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The genetic anomaly in cystinosis (mutation of the cystine: proton transporter) is quite heterogeneous with more than 140 identified mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2019</xref>). This heterogeneity affects the phenotype of the disease quite significantly. With this in mind all eight patients from whom the cells were obtained had the same 57 kb mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>). Normal CDME loaded RPTECs, and fibroblasts did not transcriptionally mimic the cystinotic phenotype suggesting that CDME loading is a poor surrogate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sumayao et al., 2013</xref>) in vitro model to study cystinosis tissue injury despite much of earlier research in cystinosis using CDME loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Specific transcriptional signatures are observed in cystinotic skin-fibroblasts and RPTECs obtained from the same individual with cystinosis versus their healthy counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). These differences between cell types, at the transcriptional level highlight tissue-specific changes in cystinosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, some overlapping genes are significantly dysregulated in both cystinotic RPTECs (n=1926; FDR &lt;0.05) and fibroblasts (n=745; FDR &lt;0.05), with 219 overlapping genes associated with DNA integrity loss and damage. Further analysis identified that certain molecular pathways were highly enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hennings et al., 2012</xref>) only in the kidney, and 11 significant pathways were found to be unique to cystinotic RPTECs alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation and acid secretion pathways are some of the significantly affected pathways in cystinosis-RPTECs. Using K-mean clustering on the genes in these significantly enriched pathways, we identified two distinct clusters (data not shown). One, is enriched in nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes crucial for energy production, and the other is enriched in v-ATPases family, which are crucial for lysosomes and kidney tubular acid secretion. Ten lysosomal v-ATPases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) were downregulated in cystinotic RPTECs, five of which are significantly downregulated and some of which play important roles in proximal tubule (PT) H<sup>+</sup> secretion to support reabsorption of luminal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and apical endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaisbich et al., 2011</xref>). The most significantly perturbed member of the V-ATPase gene family that was found to be downregulated in cystinosis RPTECs is ATP6V0A1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), hence further attention was focused on characterization of the role of this particular gene in a human in vitro model of cystinosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Microarray study design and transcriptional changes for cystinotic, normal, and CDM-treated RPTECs or fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Study design: Two types of cells were used- RPTECs and fibroblasts.

These processes are slowed but not evaded by cystine-depleting therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherqui and Courtoy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sansanwal et al., 2010</xref>). Over the years, multiple studies have shown some potential for cysteamine-combined treatments, both in in vivo and in vitro models. But none are yet approved by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellomo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hollywood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jamalpoor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Leo et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, transcriptional microarray analysis identified that the majority of the genes affected in cystinosis belong to one large cluster, which is crucial for normal lysosomal and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We identified a list of vacuolar (v)-ATPases and ATP6V0A1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) as the most downregulated genes in cystinotic RPTECs, which were also found to have a role in multiple cystinosis-related dysregulated pathways in our dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Thus, we identified a unique disruption in lysosomal pathways of RPTECs harvested from patients with nephropathic cystinosis. This was not observed in normal RPTECs, nor in paired skin fibroblasts from the same cystinosis patients.</p><p>To assess and cross-validate the structural and functional impact of these lysosomal changes in human cystinotic RPTECs, we generated a <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> in vitro, HuIm RPTEC cystinosis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jamalpoor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hollywood et al., 2022</xref>). We found an association between the knocking out of the <italic>CTNS</italic> and the downregulation of v-ATPases. We selected <italic>ATP6V0A1,</italic> the most downregulated v-ATPase, crucial for lysosomal acidification and investigated its association with the cystinosis phenotype. We aimed to find out if this relationship could explain the early occurrence of lysosomal acidification defect in renal Fanconi syndrome and progressive structural and functional loss of renal reserve. Cystinotic cells are known to have an increased autophagy or reduced autophagosome turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ivanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nevo et al., 2017</xref>). Autophagic flux in a cell is typically assessed by examining the accumulation of the autophagosome or autophagy-lysosome marker LC3B-II. This accumulation can be artificially induced using bafilomycin, which targets the V-ATPase, thereby inhibiting lysosomal acidification and degradation of its contents. Taken together, the observed innate increase in LC3B-II in cystinotic RPTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) without bafilomycin treatment suggests dysfunctional lysosomal acidification and thus could be linked to inhibited v-ATPase activity. Similar to the study by Andrzejewska et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansanwal and Sarwal, 2012</xref>), we have observed reduced immunopositivity and expression of total and phosphorylated-p70S6 kinase protein, a direct downstream substrate of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>) and a common marker for mTORC1 activity. This might be due to the essential role of Cystinosin in active mTORC1 signaling. Its absence results in decreased levels of both total and phosphorylated p70S6k in cells, directly impacting downstream processes like endocytosis and mTORC activity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ivanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nevo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansanwal and Sarwal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrzejewska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gahl and Thoene, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brodin-Sartorius et al., 2012</xref>). Further, we identified drugs with strong antioxidant activity by using a collated FDA-drug functional database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffey et al., 2014</xref>): Cysteamine, vitamin E, and ATX. However, ATX was the only agent that upregulated ATP6V0A1 and provided recovery of the specific RPTEC injury phenotype in cystinosis.</p><p>Our data indicates that the absence of functional Cystinosin downregulates ATP6V0A1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), resulting in loss of intracellular acidic pH, decreased autophagy flux, increased autophagosome accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), loss of mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and a compromised mitochondrial structure and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>); moreover, collectively the results suggest a possible mechanistic explanation for the PT dysfunction in cystinosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, all these pathophysiology known to be compromised in cystinotic RPTECs, and are not recovered by Cysteamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jefferies et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>V-ATPases play a critical role in the acidification of organelles within the endocytic, lysosomal, and secretory pathways and are required for ATP-driven proton transport across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). Hence, the measurement of lysosomal pH was important. However, none of the available methods to measure lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Webb et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DePedro and Urayama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2017</xref>) worked for cystinotic RPTECs as these cells are too sensitive; therefore, we used BCECF-AM dye, which is a cell-membrane permeable dye that can enter the cell and its organelles. Intracellular pH measured using BCECF-AM represents the overall pH of the cytoplasm and its organelles. We showed that the absence of functional Cystinosin results in less acidic or more basic intracellular-organelle pH in cystinotic RPTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). An increase of approximately 0.8 pH units in cystinotic RPTECs results in a 6.3-fold difference in hydrogen ion concentration, which is significant enough to disrupt the cellular function of normal RPTECs. According to published literature, an elevation of 0.2–0.3 pH units in lysosomes has been associated with reduced pH-dependent cleavage and chronic alterations in autophagy and degradation processes. Re-acidifying the lysosomes with cAMP was shown to reverse these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffey et al., 2014</xref>). In both yeast and humans, the absence of an acidic pH within lysosomes impairs their degradation function, leading to lysosomes filled with autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farmer et al., 2020</xref>) and also reducing pH-dependent amino acid storage in the vacuolar lumen, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gahl et al., 1988</xref>). Our work will be the first to demonstrate that in cystinotic RPTECs, the absence of Cystinosin affects v-ATPase expression, disrupts the acidic pH balance in the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and impairs mitochondrial function. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Successful transfection of a plasmid carrying the ATP6V0A1 gene into <italic>CTNS<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPTECs corrected the v-ATPase expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At the functional level, correcting ATP6V0A1 expression in <italic>CTNS<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPTECs reduced LC3-II protein expression, indicating decreased autophagy or improved autophagosome turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and partially improved mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, correcting ATP6V0A1 had no effect on cellular cystine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), likely because Cystinosin is known to have multiple roles beyond cystine transport. Cystinosin is demonstrated to be crucial for activating mTORC1 signaling by directly interacting with v-ATPases and other mTORC1 activators. Cystine depletion using cysteamine does not affect mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrzejewska et al., 2016</xref>). Our data, along with these observations, further supports that Cystinosin has multiple functions and that its cystine transport activity is not mediated by ATP6V0A1.</p><p>Structurally, this correction increased the number of mitochondria and improved their structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>) and decreased the number of autophagosomes or vacuoles by either enhancing autophago-lysosomal clearance or reducing autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These findings suggest that ATP6V0A1 plays a critical role in autophagosome turnover and mitochondrial function in <italic>CTNS<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPTECs. However, more research is needed to fully understand how ATP6V0A1 regulates these mechanisms in <italic>CTNS<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RPTECs.</p><p>The compromised mitochondrial function observed in cystinotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that the mitochondrial inner membrane in these cells is already damaged, as the injection of inhibitors had little effect on the already compromised mitochondria. The findings indicate that the decline in total ATP-linked respiration is primarily due to reduced mitochondrial ATP production. Alteration in mitochondrial functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) likely also results in ER stress or vice versa; ER stress was previously demonstrated in nephropathic cystinosis. Our study revealed increased ER wrapping of mitochondria in <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), a phenomenon referred to as mitochondria-ER-associated membranes (MAMs). This observation is known to occur in ER that is stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardini et al., 1985</xref>). MAMs mediate apoptosis, which is known to be higher in nephropathic cystinosis. However, curiously, ATP6V0A1 correction did not rescue ER-wrapping of mitochondria or intracellular LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) in <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs. LDs are known to be induced by inflammation and ROS and have been linked with neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jefferies et al., 2008</xref>). Previously, LDs have been shown in muscle biopsies from patients with cystinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chitchumroonchokchai et al., 2004</xref>); however, further studies are needed to understand LD’s role in renal pathology in cystinosis. V-ATPases are needed for ATP-driven proton transport across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), which explains the significant downregulation of several amino acid and metabolite transporters, including SLC17A1, SLC17A3, SLC17A5, SLC3A1, and SLC7A7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) in cystinotic RPTECs. These findings were a little surprising as there is no clear explanation as to why sialic acid transporters would be affected. Moreover, to gauge the clinical impact of this perturbation we would require an exclusive study.</p><p>Another notable finding of our study is the specific effect of antioxidant ATX on <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTEC, which corrects the ATP6V0A1 levels, enhances autophagosomal turnover, improves cystinosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and rescues mitochondrial membrane potential. The rescue pattern of ATX in <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs is in many ways similar to the metabolic correction of <italic>CTNS</italic> knock out cells by plasmids bearing ATP6V0A1. This suggests that ATX may ameliorate the impaired autophagy phenotype occurring in cystinotic RPTEC via regulating ATP6V0A1 expression. However, further studies are warranted to understand how ATX regulates ATP6V0A1 expression and its other protective mechanism in <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs. We noticed a significant increase in cystine levels with ATX treatment alone (data not shown in the manuscript), while the combined ATX and cysteamine treatment significantly reduced cystine accumulation to the normal level. This may suggest that when co-administered with cysteamine, they have the potential to complement each other’s shortcomings. We believe that the increase in cystine with ATX alone could be due to interactions between ATX’s ketone or hydroxyl groups and cystine’s amine or carboxylic groups. Further research on this interaction is ongoing. In various disease models, ATX is shown to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by inhibiting JNK1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiao et al., 2017</xref>), affect AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by inhibiting mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), affect Cerulein mediated increase in LC3 expression—causing reduced apoptosis, autophagy and improved cell potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ikeda et al., 2008</xref>)— and impedes inflammation by inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). ATX is also known to ameliorate oxidative stress, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhuvaneswari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kitahara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kleta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nesterova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilmer et al., 2007</xref>). Cumulatively, all these studies support ATX as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. We are currently planning additional in vivo experiments to study ATX’s effects on lysosomal degradation.</p><p>There are a few limitations to our study, which are inherent to any life science studies involving humans, wherein experimental controls cannot be tightly imposed. Firstly, since cysteamine treatment does not reverse Fanconi syndrome or inhibit ESRD, we hypothesized the presence of other confounding genes that could be affected in cystinosis other than <italic>CTNS</italic>. These would be those genes, whose expression or lack of it, cannot be corrected by cystine-depleting therapy. However, there are a few reports of preservation of some renal tubular function when cysteamine was initiated early after birth, but even these patients succumb to ESRD in their second decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sansanwal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sansanwal et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, Cysteamine treatment is initiated at one year of age, and maybe, even at this young age, lysosomal cystine-accumulation has started, and at the cellular level irreversible tubular cell damage is progressing to renal Fanconi or ESRD. Second, we also acknowledge that our RPTECs were exposed to CDME for only 30 min, after which they began to lose cystine from their lysosomes because of their normal contingent of Cystinosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilmer et al., 2007</xref>). Regardless of how long the cells were harvested after loading, the exposure of the cells to increased lysosomal cystine cannot be compared to longstanding exposure of the knock-out cells to lysosomal cystine. This also explains the similarity in transcriptional profiles of CDME-loaded cells to normal and cystinotic cells. Third, we also noted the loss of some epithelial markers in the patient derived RPTECs, which may have occurred with time but is less relevant to this paper as we are looking at a focused pathway in nephropathic cystinosis. We recognized the need for other cell lines that closely mimic the cystinosis-mediated renal pathology; hence, we created the CRISPR-mediated <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs. Nevertheless, we believe that urine RPTECs harvested from Cystinosis patients and the <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> model system are closer mimics of the human disease phenotype and, hence, suit our pursuit—the understanding of molecular injury pathways in cystinotic RPTECs. Fourth, BCECF-AM measures whole cell rather than lysosomal pH, but due to the fragility of the cystinotic RPTEC, direct lysosomal pH measurement was not possible. We acknowledge that additional studies needed to understand the interplay between transcriptional regulations of ATP6V0A1 in cystinosis and if <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, chronically treated with cysteamine, acquire any further changes to ATP6V0A1 expression. An important observation in our paper is that the abnormalities present in RPTECs are absent in fibroblasts; we believe that some of these differences are due to the unique changes in v-ATPases, many of which are tissue-specific in expression. A thorough study of other tissues that are also affected by cystinosis, such as the retina, esophagus, skeletal muscle, CNS, and endocrine tissues may provide a more valuable information. It is possible that minor and slower onset of functional perturbations in extra-renal organs is largely due to the intracellular cystine accumulation in lysosomes and not due to V-ATPase changes, as seen in the kidney. More specialized and targeted studies are warranted to study V-ATPase as a confounding gene in cystinosis and to confirm it as the pathophysiological variable behind the slow evolution of renal Fanconi and the progression of renal tubular and renal cortical damage, resulting in renal failure by the second decade of life. Understanding this mechanism of injury will be critical also for early detection of kidney damage, as renal injury detection at a functional level is delayed as compensatory mechanisms in the kidney result in a delayed rise in the serum creatinine, used to calculate the renal reserve by the eGFR formulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bjornsson, 1979</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the novel findings of this study are ATP6V0A1’s role in cystinosis-associated renal pathology and, among other antioxidants, ATX specifically upregulated ATP6V0A1, improved autophagosome turnover, reduced autophagy, and secured mitochondrial integrity. Although this is only a pilot study, our finding that ATX, in vitro, can ameliorate cystinosis-associated dysfunctional pathways is of paramount importance and requires further study in cystinotic animal models, to clarify its utility in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">RPTECs; Skin Fibroblasts</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gift from Drs.

The patient derived RPTECs has its limitations, which are highlighted in the discussion section. Both normal RPTECs and fibroblasts were treated with cysteine dimethyl ester (CDME) to artificially load lysosomes with cystine, as this method has been used previously as a disease model for cystine RPTEC loading, although it is unclear how accurate this model is for functional analysis of molecular changes in cystinosis patient derived RPTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmonem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider et al., 1967</xref>). In addition, we utilized a human immortalized (HuIm) RPTEC line (Clone TH1, passage 8, Cat No. ECH001, Kerafast, Boston, MA), as control, and used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> knock out HuIm RPTECs that was then structurally and functionally characterized to evaluate it as an in vitro model system to study human cystinosis RPTEC injury. This purchased HuIm RPTECs are derived from primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) immortalized by two lentiviral vectors carrying the human telomerase and the SV40 T antigen. All cells were verified to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Details of the study design and its findings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>  All RPTECs were cultured in renal epithelial growth medium (REGM; Lonza, Bend, OR); fibroblast cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) with Earl’s salts, supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L- glutamine, 2 X conc. of non-essential AA, 100  μg/ml Penicillin, 100 U/ml Streptomycin and 0.5  μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

These preformed complexes were then delivered to immortalized RPTECs by nucleofection for editing. We used benchling to design the guide RNA to specifically cut at exon 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tusher et al., 2001</xref>).Though this is not a known cystinosis-causing mutation but such a knockout causes complete inactivation of Cystinosin, which is the common output of all the known mutations associated with nephropathic cystinosis. Since efficiency of gene-knockout varies from one cell to other, we sorted single cells by FACS and created a pure culture from a single cell., amplified over the cut-site using touch-down PCR amplification, and then submitted the PCR products for Sanger sequencing using both the forward and reverse TIDE oligos originally used for amplification. Once the chromatograms were returned, we chose to populate and use cells with at least 95% allelic editing, which provided a rough estimate of knock-out percentages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).   Briefly, we cultured these single cells and isolated the DNA from both, the control RPTECs and <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs, and then performed PCR amplification over the cut site from their genomic DNA. We designed single-stranded DNA oligos to serve as PCR primers for <italic>CTNS</italic> over the targeted cut site. We then amplified over the cut site using a touch-down PCR amplification strategy with appropriate annealing temperatures for the <italic>CTNS</italic>-specific primers. After this step we submitted the amplified DNA along with both the forward and reverse oligos originally used for amplification the <italic>CTNS</italic> gene for Sanger sequencing. If the nucleofection was successful, then it will be evident in the chromatogram obtained after Sanger. An estimated percentage of Indels was generated by uploading the experimental and control chromatograms to the TIDE webtool online.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Validation of the generated <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPTECs at the functional level by HPLC-MS/MS</title><p>To detect the phenotype of these newly developed <italic>CTNS</italic><sup>-/-  </sup>cell lines, we performed a functional assay measuring intracellular cystine levels using an HPLC-MS/MS method (UCSD Biochemical Genetics, San Diego).

This deficiency results in early dysfunction of proximal tubule (PT) cells and proximal tubulopathy, which progresses to chronic kidney disease and multisystem complications later in life. The authors utilize patient-derived cell lines and knockout (KO) strategies in immortalized PT cell systems, alongside transcriptomics and pathway enrichment analyses, to demonstrate that the loss of CTNS function reduces V-ATPase subunits (specifically V-ATP6V0A1), impairing autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis. These findings are consistent with their prior work and follow-up studies conducted in preclinical models (mouse, rat, and zebrafish) of cystinosis and CTNS deficiency.</p><p>Importantly, the authors highlight rescue strategies that involve correcting V-ATP6V0A1 expression or modulating redox dyshomeostasis through ATX treatment. These interventions restore cellular homeostasis in patient-derived cells, providing actionable therapeutic targets for patients in need of novel causal therapies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The implications for health, disease, and therapeutic discovery are considerable, given the central role of autophagy and lysosome-related pathways in regulating critical cellular processes and physiological functions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite these promising findings, further experimental research is required to strengthen the study's framework and conclusions. This includes characterizing the physiological properties of the PT cellular systems used, performing appropriate control or sentinel experiments in lysosome function assays, and further delineating disease phenotypes associated with cystinosis. Follow-up investigations into lysosome abnormalities and autophagy dysfunctions are also needed, along with a detailed exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the rescue of lysosomal, autophagic, and mitochondrial phenotypes through ATX treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94169.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sur</surname><given-names>Swastika</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kerwin</surname><given-names>Maggie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pineda</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sansanwal</surname><given-names>Poonam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>Benin</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sigdel</surname><given-names>Tara K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sirota</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sarwal</surname><given-names>Minnie M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Cystinosis is a rare hereditary disease caused by biallelic loss of the CTNS gene, encoding two cystinosin protein isoforms; the main isoform is expressed in lysosomal membranes where it mediates cystine efflux whereas the minor isoform is expressed at the plasma membrane and in other subcellular organelles. Sur et al proceed from the assumption that the pathways driving the cystinosis phenotype in the kidney might be identified by comparing the transcriptome profiles of normal vs CTNS-mutant proximal tubular cell lines. They argue that key transcriptional disturbances in mutant kidney cells might not be present in non-renal cells such as CTNS-mutant fibroblasts.</p><p>Using cluster analysis of the transcriptomes, the authors selected a single vacuolar H+ATPase (ATP6VOA1) for further study, asserting that it was the &quot;most significantly downregulated&quot; vacuolar H+ATPase (about 58% of control) among a group of similarly downregulated H+ATPases. They then showed that exogenous ATP6VOA1 improved CTNS(-/-) RPTEC mitochondrial respiratory chain function and decreased autophagosome LC3-II accumulation, characteristic of cystinosis. The authors then treated mutant RPTECs with 3 &quot;antioxidant&quot; drugs, cysteamine, vitamin E, and astaxanthin (ATX). ATX (but not the other two antioxidant drugs) appeared to improve ATP6VOA1 expression, LC3-II accumulation, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Respiratory chain function was not studied. RTPC cystine accumulation was not studied.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, as an initial step, we have studied the first step in respiratory chain function by performing the Seahorse Mito Stress Test to demonstrate that the genetic manipulation (knocking out the <italic>CTNS</italic> gene and plasmid-mediated expression correction of <italic>ATP6V0A1</italic>) impacts mitochondrial energetics. We did not investigate the respirometry-based assays that can identify locations of electron transport deficiency, which we plan to address in a follow-up paper.</p><p>We would like to draw attention to Figure 3D, where cystine accumulation has been studied. This figure demonstrates an increased intracellular accumulation of cystine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major strengths of this manuscript reside in its two primary findings.</p><p>(1) Plasmid expression of exogenous ATP6VOA1 improves mitochondrial integrity and reduces aberrant autophagosome accumulation.</p><p>(2) Astaxanthin partially restores suboptimal endogenous ATP6VOA1 expression.</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest that astaxanthin might constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to ameliorate defective mitochondrial function and lysosomal clearance of autophagosomes in the cystinotic kidney. This might act synergistically with the current therapy (oral cysteamine) which facilitates defective cystine efflux from the lysosome.</p><p>There are, however, several weaknesses in the manuscript.</p><p>(1) The reductive approach that led from transcriptional profiling to focus on ATP6VOA1 is not transparent and weakens the argument that potential therapies should focus on correction of this one molecule vs the other H+ ATPase transcripts that were equally reduced - or transcripts among the 1925 belonging to at least 11 pathways disturbed in mutant RPTECs.</p></disp-quote><p>The transcriptional profiling studies on ATP6V0A1 have been fully discussed and publicly shared. Table 2 lists the v-ATPase transcripts that are significantly downregulated in cystinosis RPTECs. We have also clarified and justified the choice of further studies on ATP6V0A1, where we state the following: &quot;The most significantly perturbed member of the V-ATPase gene family found to be downregulated in cystinosis RPTECs is ATP6V0A1 (Table 2). Therefore, further attention was focused on characterizing the role of this particular gene in a human in vitro model of cystinosis.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A precise description of primary results is missing -- the Results section is preceded by or mixed with extensive speculation. This makes it difficult to dissect valid conclusions from those derived from less informative experiments (eg data on CDME loading, data on whole-cell pH instead of lysosomal pH, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer highlighting areas for further improving the manuscript's readership. In our resubmission, we have revised the results section to provide a more precise description of the primary findings and restrict the inferences to the discussion section only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Data on experimental approaches that turned out to be uninformative (eg CDME loading, or data on whole=cell pH assessment with BCECF).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided data whether it was informative or uninformative. Though lysosome-specific pH measurement would be important to measure, it was not possible to do it in our cells as they were very sick and the assay did not work. Hence we provide data on pH assessment with BCECF, which measures overall cytoplasmic and organelle pH, which is also informative for whole cell pH that is an overall pH of organelle pH and cytoplasmic pH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The rationale for the study of ATX is unclear and the mechanism by which it improves mitochondrial integrity and autophagosome accumulation is not explored (but does not appear to depend on its anti-oxidant properties).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided rationale for the study of ATX; provided in the introduction and result section, where we mentioned the following: “correction of ATP6V0A1 in CTNS-/- RPTECs and treatment with antioxidants specifically, astaxanthin (ATX) increased the production of cellular ATP6V0A1, identified from a custom FDA-drug database generated by our group, partially rescued the nephropathic RPTEC phenotype. ATX is a xanthophyll carotenoid occurring in a wide variety of organisms. ATX is reported to have the highest known antioxidant activity and has proven to have various anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, and cytoprotective activities both in vivo and in vitro_”._</p><p>We are still investigating the mechanism by which ATX improves mitochondrial integrity, and this will be the focus of a follow-on manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Thoughtful discussion on the lack of effect of ATP6VOA1 correction on cystine efflux from the lysosome is warranted, since this is presumably sensitive to intralysosomal pH.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included a detailed discussion on the plausible reasons why ATP6V0A1 correction has no effect on cysteine efflux from the lysosome. We have now added to the Discussion – “However, correcting ATP6V0A1 had no effect on cellular cystine levels, likely because cystinosin is known to have multiple roles beyond cystine transport Cystinosin is demonstrated to be crucial for activating mTORC1 signaling by directly interacting with v-ATPases and other mTORC1 activators. Cystine depletion using cysteamine does not affect mTORC1 signaling. Our data, along with these observations, further supports that cystinosin has multiple functions and that its cystine transport activity is not mediated by ATP6V0A1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Comparisons between RPTECs and fibroblasts cannot take into account the effects of immortalization on cell phenotype (not performed in fibroblasts).</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of examining different tissue sources of primary cells in nephropathic cystinosis was to assess if any of the changes in these cells were tissue source specific. We used primary cells isolated from patients with nephropathic cystinosis—RPTECs from patients' urine and fibroblasts from patients' skin—these cells are not immortalized and can therefore be compared. This is noted in the results section - “Specific transcriptional signatures are observed in cystinotic skin-fibroblasts and RPTECs obtained from the same individual with cystinosis versus their healthy counterparts”.</p><p>We next utilized the immortalized RPTEC cell line to create CRISPR-mediated <italic>CTNS</italic> knockout RPTECs as a resource for studying the pathophysiology of cystinosis. These cells were not compared to the primary fibroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) This work will be of interest to the research community but is self-described as a pilot study. It remains to be clarified whether transient transfection of RPTECs with other H+ATPases could achieve results comparable to ATP6VOA1. Some insight into the mechanism by which ATX exerts its effects on RPTECs is needed to understand its potential for the treatment of cystinosis.</p></disp-quote><p>In future studies we will further investigate the effect of ATX on RPTECs for treatment of cystinosis- this will require the conduct of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies which are beyond the scope of this current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Sur and colleagues investigate the role of ATP6V0A1 in mitochondrial function in cystinotic proximal tubule cells. They propose that loss of cystinosin downregulates ATP6V0A1 resulting in acidic lysosomal pH loss, and adversely modulates mitochondrial function and lifespan in cystinotic RPTECs. They further investigate the use of a novel therapeutic Astaxanthin (ATX) to upregulate ATP6V0A1 that may improve mitochondrial function in cystinotic proximal tubules.</p><p>The new information regarding the specific proximal tubular injuries in cystinosis identifies potential molecular targets for treatment.

Importantly, the manuscript lacks a clear description of experimental Results. This section begins with speculation, then wanders through experimentation that didn't work (could be deleted). Figure 1A and lines 94-102 could be deleted. Data from CDME loading was found to be a &quot;poor surrogate&quot; for cystinosis and could be deleted from the manuscript or mentioned as a minor point in the discussion. The number of individual patient cell lines used for experimentation is unclear - 8 patients are mentioned on line 109, Figure 2B shows 6 normal fibroblasts, 3 CDME-loaded fibroblasts, and an indeterminate number of normal vs CDME-loaded cells (both colored red). Cluster analysis refers to two large gene clusters - data supporting this key conclusion is not shown. It is unclear why ATP6VOA1 was selected as the most significantly reduced H+ATPase from Table II. Thus, the focus on this particular gene appears to be largely &quot;a hunch&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we aim to establish a new concept by using multiple cell types and various assays tailored to each affected organelle, which might be confusing. Therefore, we believe Figure 1a provides a roadmap and helps clarify what to expect from this paper.</p><p>This study was started a decade back, when CDME-mediated lysosomal loading was regularly used as a surrogate in vitro model to study cystinosis tissue injury. That was the reason to include CDME in the study design. Since we already had the CDME-treated data and in this article we are talking about another superior in vitro cystinosis model, we would like to include it.</p><p>In the Result and Methods section, we mentioned “8 patients” with nephropathic cystinosis from whom we collected the RPTECs and Fibroblasts. These cystinotic cells are shown in blue and purple dots, respectively in figure 2B. Normal RPTEC and fibroblast cells were purchased from company and these cells were then treated with CDME to artificially load lysosomes with cystine. Details on the cell types and its procurement can be found in the Methods section under “Study design and Samples”. Normal and CDME-loaded RPTECs are shown in red and orange dots, whereas normal and CDME-loaded fibroblasts are shown in green and yellow dots, respectively in figure 2B.</p><p>We removed this figure from the manuscript because the data is already detailed in Tables 1 and 2. As a sub-figure, the string pathway analysis output was illegible and did not add any new information.

Since the kidneys are the first organs to deteriorate in cystinosis, it is postulated that transcriptome differences might be more obvious in kidney cells than in non-renal tissues, such as fibroblasts. A potential pitfall is that the RPTECs were transformed cell lines whereas fibroblasts were not.</p></disp-quote><p>Transcriptional profiling was done on primary cells isolated from patients with nephropathic cystinosis—RPTECs from patients' urine and fibroblasts from patients' skin—these cells are not immortalized and can therefore be compared.

It would be incorrect to take this measurement as support for their hypothesis that intralysosomal pH is increased. Since these experiments cannot be interpreted, they should be deleted from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now corrected the term to &quot;intracellular pH.&quot; Although measuring lysosome-specific pH would be important, it was not feasible in our cells as knocking out cystinosin gene made them fragile, making the assay ineffective. Therefore, we provide data on pH assessment using BCECF, which measures the overall pH of the cytoplasm and organelles. This information is still valuable for understanding the whole cell pH, encompassing both organelle and cytoplasmic pH. We have mentioned this as one of our limitations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The choice of ATX as a potential therapy is puzzling. Its antioxidant properties seem to be irrelevant since two other antioxidants had no effect. The mechanism by which it appears to correct some aspects of the cystinosis phenotype remains unknown and this should be pointed out. A key experiment to assess whether ATX reduces lysosomal cystine accumulation is missing. While the impact of ATX on cystinosis is interesting, the mechanism is unexplored.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed study on the mechanism by which ATX corrects certain aspects of the cystinosis phenotype is currently underway and will be presented in a follow-up paper. We have measured the effect of ATX and cysteamine, both individually and combined, on cystine accumulation using HPLC, as shown in the figure below. Our results indicate a significant increase in cystine levels with ATX treatment alone, while the combined ATX and cysteamine treatment significantly reduced cystine accumulation to the normal level. This suggests that ATX addresses specific aspects of the cystinosis phenotype through a different mechanism, not by reducing the accumulated cystine levels. When co-administered with cysteamine, they have the potential to complement each other's shortcomings. We believe that the increase in cystine with ATX alone may be due to interactions between ATX's ketone or hydroxyl groups and cystine's amine or carboxylic groups. Further research on this interaction is ongoing.</p><p>We have now added to the Discussion – “We noticed a significant increase in cystine levels with ATX treatment alone (data not shown in the manuscript), while the combined ATX and cysteamine treatment significantly reduced cystine accumulation to the normal level.

A discussion of this issue would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included a detailed discussion on the plausible reasons why ATP6V0A1 correction has no effect on cysteine efflux from the lysosome. We have added to the Discussion – “However, correcting ATP6V0A1 had no effect on cellular cystine levels (Figure 7C), likely because cystinosin is known to have multiple roles beyond cystine transport. Cystinosin is demonstrated to be crucial for activating mTORC1 signaling by directly interacting with v-ATPases and other mTORC1 activators. Cystine depletion using cysteamine does not affect mTORC1 signaling (47). Our data, along with these observations, further supports that cystinosin has multiple functions and that its cystine transport activity is not mediated by ATP6V0A1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The arguments on lines 260-273 are not comprehensible. The authors confirm that RPTC LC3-II levels are increased, a marker of active processing of autophagosome cargo, prior to delivery to lysosomes. Discussion of balfilomycin (not used), mTORC activity, and endocytosis are not directly relevant and wander from interpretation of the LC3-II observation. One possibility is that the 50% decrease in ATP6VOA1 transcript is sufficient to slow the transfer of LC3-II-tagged cargo from autophagosome to lysosome - however, it would be important to offer a plausible explanation for why decreased ATP6VOA1 expression alone does not appear to be the key limitation on lysosomal cystine efflux.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rephrased our explanation in the Discussion section – “Cystinotic cells are known to have an increased autophagy or reduced autophagosome turnover rate. Autophagic flux in a cell is typically assessed by examining the accumulation of the autophagosome or autophagy-lysosome marker LC3B-II. This accumulation can be artificially induced using bafilomycin, which targets the V-ATPase, thereby inhibiting lysosomal acidification and degradation of its contents. Taken together, the observed innate increase in LC3B-II in cystinotic RPTECs (Figure 5A) without bafilomycin treatment suggests dysfunctional lysosomal acidification and thus could be linked to inhibited v-ATPase activity”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
