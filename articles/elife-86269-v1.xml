However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor <italic>Axl</italic> and its ligand <italic>Gas6</italic>. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our skin is constantly exposed to potential damage from the outside world, and it is vital that any injuries are repaired quickly and effectively. Diabetes and many other health conditions can hamper wound healing, resulting in chronic wounds that are both painful and at risk of becoming infected, which can lead to serious illness and death of patients.</p><p>After an injury to the skin, the wound becomes inflamed as immune cells rush to the site of injury to fight off infection and clear the wound of dead cells and debris. Some of these dead cells will have died by a highly controlled process known as apoptosis. These so-called apoptotic cells display signals on their surface that nearby healthy cells recognize. This triggers the healthy cells to eat the apoptotic cells to remove them from the wound. Previous studies have linked changes in cell death and the removal of dead cells to chronic wounds in patients with diabetes, but it remains unclear how removing dead cells from the wound affects healing.</p><p>Justynski et al. used a genetic technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to study the patterns of gene activity in mouse skin cells shortly after a wound. The experiments found that, as the area around the wound started to become inflamed, the wounded cells produced signals of apoptosis that in turn triggered nearby healthy cells to remove them. Other signals relating to the removal of dead cells were also widespread in the mouse wounds and treating the wounds with drugs that inhibit these signals resulted in multiple defects in the healing process.</p><p>Further experiments used the same approach to study samples of tissue taken from foot wounds in human patients with or without diabetes. This revealed that several genes involved in the removal of dead cells were more highly expressed in the wounds of diabetic patients than in the wounds of other individuals.</p><p>These findings indicate that for wounds to heal properly it is crucial for the body to detect and clear apoptotic cells from the wound site. Further studies building on this work may help to explain why some diabetic patients suffer from chronic wounds and help to develop more effective treatments for them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>efferocytosis</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010848</institution-id><institution>Gruber Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Justynski</surname><given-names>Olivia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Justynski</surname><given-names>Olivia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis &amp;

Repair of mammalian tissues requires highly dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to correctly heal tissue, usually resulting in a scar rather than true tissue regeneration. Cell death is a common event during tissue injury, and several studies from hydra to mice have shown the importance of apoptosis in the initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenhalgh, 1998</xref>). Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing, when fibroblasts, blood vessels, and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate, forming new tissue to repair the wound. While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerin et al., 2021</xref>), the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood.</p><p>The skin is an excellent model to define the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells regulate tissue repair. After injury, mammalian skin undergoes stages of repair beginning with inflammation, which removes debris and pathogens. As inflammation regresses, the proliferative phase leads to the coordination of epidermal keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells to reseal the epidermal barrier and generate a reparative scar including new ECM production and revascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eming et al., 2014</xref>). Apoptosis occurs after skin injury, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells â or efferocytosis â by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosurgi et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peiseler and Kubes, 2019</xref>). Yet, it is unclear how apoptosis controls skin wound healing.</p><p>Apoptotic cell death is characterized by cytomorphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases and other regulators, and finally membrane alterations including outer membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), which allows the recognition of apoptotic cells by cellular receptors on phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore, 2007</xref>). The most well-studied receptors that allow phagocytes to bind and phagocytose apoptotic cells include the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) tyrosine kinases and the TIM (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain) family of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemke, 2019</xref>). While TIM receptors can directly bind PtdSer, TAM receptors require their ligands growth-arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) and protein S (Pros1) to bind to PtdSer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliott et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury. We found that transcriptional alterations in apoptotic pathways occur in this interval in fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. In addition, inhibition of two efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, abrogates proper wound repair. The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dramatic transcriptional heterogeneity during early skin inflammation after injury</title><p>To assess cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the wound bed during the inflammatory phase, we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from 4 mm full-thickness biopsy punches on mouse back skin at 24 hr and 48 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shook et al., 2016</xref>).

We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, our data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair.</p><p>We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds, which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair. Apoptotic cells are required for tail regeneration of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>) and tissue regeneration of planaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang et al., 2004</xref>) and have been widely implicated in early wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenhalgh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arya et al., 2014</xref>). Mechanistically, apoptotic cells can release signaling factors including Wnts and PGE2 to promote proliferation of tissue resident cells and tissue repair in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Codispoti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>). Detection of apoptotic cells has also been linked to inflammation and context-dependent integration of IL-4 signaling to activate an anti-inflammatory and tissue repair gene program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosurgi et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Exposure of PtdSer on the outer leaflet of apoptotic cell membranes acts as a sensor for engulfment in evolutionarily conserved mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rothlin and Ghosh, 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that in skin wounds, apoptotic cells are rapidly detected and removed via efferocytosis, which is consistent with the large number of phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages in early wounds. We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds. Interestingly, efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts, which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility, migration, and ECM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romana-Souza et al., 2021</xref>), and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells.</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that distinct efferocytosis receptors elicit cell- and tissue-specific responses. Axl and Mer exhibit differential ligand specificity and shedding upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">ZagÃ³rska et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Axl</italic> null bone marrow-derived macrophages are unable to perform efferocytosis with TLR3 activation in vitro, which suggests that Axl plays a central role in efferocytosis in inflammatory environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosurgi et al., 2017b</xref>). Here, we show that in early murine skin wounds, Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner, but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors. Furthermore, we did not detect differences in <italic>Axl</italic> expression in <italic>TLR3</italic> null and control wounds, further suggesting the inflammatory wound environment in vivo displays activation of <italic>Axl</italic> receptor expression independent of TLR3. Axl may function in skin wounds by interacting with other tyrosine kinase receptors, which has been shown for EGFR, MET, and PDGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, Axl/Gas6 signaling can also regulate tumorigenesis to support tumor cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linger et al., 2008</xref>), migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Future work exploring Axlâs function in a cell type-dependent manner, including possibly directly activating angiogenesis in skin wounds, will decipher these possibilities.</p><p>Our data also implicate an important role for resident macrophages in regulating early wound repair mechanisms. In particular, we identified the expression of several efferocytosis receptors and ligands on Lyve1<sup>+</sup> resident macrophages including Timd4. Timd4 is expressed on tissue resident macrophages in multiple tissues including in the peritoneal and resident cardiac macrophages. In the heart, Lyve1<sup>+</sup> resident macrophages act in a cardioprotective manner during myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dick et al., 2019</xref>) and are immunoregulatory and promote engraftment of cardiac allografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thornley et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, similar to our data, Timd4 promotes efferocytosis in the heart. During cardiac infarction, Timd4 is also required for T cell responses and support of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foks et al., 2016</xref>). In the skin, Timd4 is essential for allograft survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeung et al., 2013</xref>), which has been proposed to act through DCs to support Tregs. Indeed, Timd4 is expressed in DCs in later stages of wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haensel et al., 2020</xref>). Our future studies will test the role of Timd4 on DCs and resident macrophages, T cell immunity, and how they impact wound repair phenotypes noted with Timd4 inhibition.</p><p>In summary, our data implicate apoptosis recognition receptors as an important regulator of skin wound healing. We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair. Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells, skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher the mechanisms by which distinct cells recognize and respond to interactions with apoptotic cells. Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds, it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic, non-healing wounds, particularly in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>WT C57BL/6J mice (Strain #:000664), B6;129S1-Tlr3tm1Flv/J (<italic>TLR3</italic> KO) mice (Strain #:005217), Lyz2tm1(cre/ERT2)Grtn/J (<italic>Lyz2</italic>CreER) mice (Strain #:031674), and B6.129(Cg)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J (mTmG) mice (Strain #:007676) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. <italic>Pdgfra</italic>CreER mice were developed in the laboratory of B.

cleared from the wound site in order to promote effective repair of the damaged tissue. Interestingly, the authors find that the components of this clearance pathway are abnormally high in diabetics who have difficulty healing wounds and their results suggest that tampering them down may be a therapy to restore normal wound healing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86269.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Jamora</surname><given-names>Colin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/007wpch15</institution-id><institution>Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.17.523241">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.17.523241v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are uniform in finding the manuscript a valuable contribution to the field and generally solid in methodology. However, there were a few consistent points that the technical rigor of the manuscript needs to be improved in order to better support the conclusions that are drawn from them. For instance, the suggested additional experiments are relatively straightforward and would substantially improve the data:</p><p>1. Quantify the apoptotic cells observed in the sections (Figure 1 I and J) and compare to control treatment on sections. It is not clear from the data presented whether the number of apoptotic cells increases or not in the time frame analyzed since the controls are lacking.</p><p>2. In a similar vein, it would be important to demonstrate in their system that there is actually an increase in apoptotic cells in the wounds. This data is absent and the inclusion of this would provide temporal insights into the initiation and speed of efferocytosis.</p><p>3. Conclusions based on CellChat analysis should be experimentally validated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>More recent datasets of efferocytosis related genes involved in diabetic wound healing such as SLC7 gene family members could be included in the analysis as it has direct bearing on the work.</p><p>The inhibition of Axl seems to have a dramatic effect scab formation, fibroblast representation in the wound bed, and vascularization but no significant effect on wound closure rates. This is a surprising observation and perhaps too much weight is given to ITGA6 staining and other assays of reepithelialization should be assessed. In addition, the potential therapeutic applications that the authors note for chronic wounds suggest that they should test the physiological parameters of the healed skin to determine how &quot;normal&quot; it truly is.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86269.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are uniform in finding the manuscript a valuable contribution to the field and generally solid in methodology.

We have repeated this staining experiment with the recommended antibody for cleaved (active) caspase 3. These data are now included in Figures 1H-J and Figure 1 â figure supplement 1F. While these were untreated samples, we were able to quantify the apoptotic cells visible by cleaved caspase 3 staining in 24h and 48h wounds. We found that, when quantified via IF staining, the apoptotic cells visible in the wound bed significantly increased between 24h and 48h after injury (Figure 1 â figure supplement 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To analyze the initiation and speed of efferocytosis, we injected labeled apoptotic neutrophils into the wound bed at 1, 3, and 5 days after injury. 1 hour after this injection, we collected the wound beds for sectioning and staining and quantified the stained cells (either whole neutrophils or neutrophils undergoing efferocytosis) remaining in each wound bed. We found that significantly more neutrophils undergoing efferocytosis remained in 5D wound beds and that the rate of efferocytosis (calculated by dividing stained cells in efferocytosis by all stained cells) was constant over time, indicating that efferocytosis is active throughout the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing. These data are now included in Figures 2H-M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Conclusions based on CellChat analysis should be experimentally validated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have compared the presence of Gas6 and Gas6<sup>+</sup> macrophages in diabetic and nondiabetic human wounds via IF staining and found that, in accordance with the CellChat analysis, more macrophage Gas6 expression is observed in diabetic wounds. These data are included in Figures 3C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>More recent datasets of efferocytosis related genes involved in diabetic wound healing such as SLC7 gene family members could be included in the analysis as it has direct bearing on the work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion.
