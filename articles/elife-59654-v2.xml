cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to perturbation of the splicing machinery compared to normal cells. To identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer (PCa) fitness, we performed pooled shRNA screens in vitro and in vivo. Our screens identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM) as a regulator of PCa cell growth. RNA- and eCLIP-sequencing identified HNRNPM binding to transcripts of key homeostatic genes. HNRNPM binding to its targets prevents aberrant exon inclusion and backsplicing events. In both linear and circular mis-spliced transcripts, HNRNPM preferentially binds to GU-rich elements in long flanking proximal introns. Mimicry of HNRNPM-dependent linear-splicing events using splice-switching-antisense-oligonucleotides was sufficient to inhibit PCa cell growth. This suggests that PCa dependence on HNRNPM is likely a result of mis-splicing of key homeostatic coding and non-coding genes. Our results have further been confirmed in other solid tumors. Taken together, our data reveal a role for HNRNPM in supporting cancer cell fitness. Inhibition of HNRNPM activity is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy in suppressing growth of PCa and other solid tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group

intronic sequences that are removed during RNA splicing and transcript maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Venter et al., 2001</xref>). This process is regulated by the spliceosome, comprising small non-coding RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6), the core spliceosomal proteins (i.e., U2AF1, U2AF2, SF3B1, etc.), and other auxiliary factors (i.e., HNRNPs, SRSFs, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, proper regulation of splicing provides the cell an opportunity to control gene expression in the absence of genetic alterations. By expressing alternative isoforms of the same gene, the cell can regulate both the inclusion/exclusion of specific protein and/or RNA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>) or change transcript half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">'t Hoen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lareau and Brenner, 2015</xref>), thus impacting both transcript fate and function.</p><p>The regulation of alternative splicing plays a central role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>), cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in the cellular response to external or internal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shalgi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haque et al., 2018</xref>). However, the same phenotypic plasticity offered by the splicing machinery can work against the cell and organism, and confer competitive advantages to cells under pathological conditions such as cancer. Indeed, alterations in the expression of specific isoforms of certain genes and of splicing factors themselves can promote cell proliferation (e.g., androgen receptor [AR]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), metastasis (e.g., CD44; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Todaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), or avoid apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewaele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwerk and Schulze-Osthoff, 2005</xref>) in cancer. Some of these changes in isoform ratios may be direct results of mutations in the linear motifs that comprise the splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Puente et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2015</xref>) or in the splicing machinery itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graubert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the differential splicing of specific genes, there is also increasing evidence that some molecular subtypes of cancer, which bear mutations in non-splicing-related genes such as MYC, are highly dependent on a functional core spliceosome for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). This may be related to their high proliferation rates, which require them to heavily rely on the splicing machinery.</p><p>Given the strong involvement of RNA splicing in cancer, the splicing machinery and its associated factors may offer selective therapeutic vulnerabilities. However, the identification of critical targets, the context in which they function, their mechanisms of action, and the functional impact of the individual splicing factors in cancer remain largely unexplored.</p><p>To address this, we performed parallel pooled in vivo and in vitro shRNA screens against core and auxiliary splicing factors in prostate cancer (PCa). Through this screen, we were able to uncover a novel role for the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM). HNRNPM expression is higher in PCa than in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), and its loss affects PCa cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results have further been confirmed in other solid tumors (i.e., melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma). RNA-seq and eCLIP suggest that HNRNPM binding differentially impacts the splicing and/or expression of distinct classes of transcripts. Interestingly, we found that HNRNPM limits circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis within cells. Overall, our work offers mechanistic insight into the function of HNRNPM in prostate and other cancers, suggesting that HNRNPM could serve as a potential marker or drug target in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A targeted pooled shRNA screen identifies splicing-related dependencies in PCa</title><p>In order to identify major splicing factor dependencies in PCa, we conducted parallel pooled in vitro and in vivo shRNA screens in the LNCAP PCa cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In such a screen, shRNAs targeting essential genes and oncogenes are generally depleted as the cell population increases, whereas shRNAs that target tumor suppressors and negative regulators of proliferation become enriched. The screens utilized a lentiviral library of 520 shRNAs targeting 102 core and auxiliary splicing factors, meaning 3–5 shRNAs targeting each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). After puromycin selection, we harvested a portion of the cells to be used as the control input pool (P1). The remaining cells were either passaged continuously in vitro for about 28–30 population doublings (about 1 month; approximately nine passages), or xenografted into the flanks of SCID mice and allowed to form tumors over time. In vitro passaged cells were harvested at every other passage for DNA isolation (P3, P5, P7, P9). In vivo tumors were harvested for DNA isolation when they attained a size of 400 mm<sup>3</sup> or more. shRNA hairpin enrichment levels in individual samples were quantified via high-throughput sequencing.

Tumor samples were clustered away from P1 samples, indicating a shift in overall hairpin distribution in these samples.

Consistently, we identified five well-defined clusters of hairpin enrichment/depletion, with similar patterns of enrichment/depletion in both in vitro passaged and in vivo tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To identify top hits in our screen, we subjected our dataset to a rotational gene set analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). This analysis considers the overall enrichment levels of individual hairpins targeting the same gene and compares them against each other. Using this analysis, we were able to identify a common set of seven genes (<italic>HNRNPL</italic>, <italic>SYNCRIP</italic>, <italic>HNRNPM</italic>, <italic>HNRNPF</italic>, <italic>SF3A1</italic>, <italic>SRSF2,</italic> and <italic>SRSF1</italic>) that were significantly enriched or depleted in both the in vitro and in vivo screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These hits included previously characterized oncogenic splicing factors <italic>SRSF1 </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karni et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>HNRNPL </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fei et al., 2017</xref>), further confirming the validity of our screen. The majority of hairpins in our screen appeared to be depleted over time both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that some of the hits we found could have essential functions within cells. To distinguish between essential genes from genes that had oncogenic function, we further performed a short-term (96 hr), independent siRNA screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) for our top hits (two-sided p≤0.01, false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05) on normal, untransformed PrEC. We rationalized that an acute reduction in expression of essential genes would likely be deleterious in these cells. On the other hand, reduced expression of genes that were more likely to be important for oncogenic growth should minimally inhibit PrEC growth. Indeed, short-term, reduced expression of several genes, such as <italic>SF3A1</italic>, <italic>SRSF1</italic>, and <italic>SRSF2</italic>, which are essential genes that form part of the core spliceosomal machinery, was rapidly deleterious in the PrECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On the other hand, reduced expression of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> and <italic>HNRNPF</italic> mildly affected proliferation in the PrEC line, suggesting a long-term oncogenic role rather than an essential role in PCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further narrow down the hits from our screen, we reanalyzed publicly available gene expression datasets for PCa (PRAD) generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This analysis correlated with the increased expression of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> with poorer disease-free survival over time, while this was not the case for <italic>HNRNPF</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analysis of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> mRNA expression in normal and tumor prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) patient samples in the same datasets suggested that HNRNPM mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in tumor samples when compared with normal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis of PrEC and PCa cell lines, LNCAP and PC3 further corroborated these observations, showing that protein expression of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> was increased in PCa cells, but not in normal PrECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, <italic>HNRNPM</italic> is a valid target for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HNRNPM is required for PCa cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo</title><p>We first validated our screen results using shRNAs (TRCN0000001244; 2B7, TRCN0000001246; 2B9) present in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the LNCAP cell line. These hairpins were efficient in reducing HNRNPM protein and RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A , B</xref>). A third hairpin we tested (TRCN0000001247; 2B10) did not reduce HNRNPM protein levels significantly and was discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). In line with the screen results, reduced <italic>HNRNPM</italic> mRNA and protein levels in LNCAP cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, we showed that HNRNPM depletion impairs colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and anchorage-independent cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), underscoring a broad role for <italic>HNRNPM</italic> in preserving cell fitness. <italic>HNRNPM</italic> dependency appeared similar in the PC3 PCa cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>), which bears different driver mutations (<italic>PTEN</italic> null, <italic>TP53</italic> null, androgen independent) from LNCAP (<italic>PTEN</italic> null, <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype, androgen dependent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Bokhoven et al., 2003</xref>). We were also able to validate our findings in two independently derived human primary PCa cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that the impact of HNRNPM in PCa is not dependent on specific tumor genotypes or hormone dependency. Finally, the ability of LNCAP cells to form tumors when xenografted in mice was impaired in HNRNPM-depleted cells as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, tumor growth in these mice correlated to the potency of the shRNA used. Tumors treated with the less potent 2B7 shRNA (n = 11) were initially significantly smaller than scrambled shRNA treated tumors (n = 11); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, day 19), but escaped shRNA suppression by day 60 post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, tumors treated with the more potent 2B9 shRNA (n = 11) remained significantly smaller than scrambled treated tumors throughout the course of the experiment. The reduction in cell proliferation and growth correlated with potency of HNRNPM protein depletion by individual hairpins supports an on-target effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These analyses revealed that the majority of significant splicing events affected by HNRNPM loss (p&lt;0.05, FDR &lt; 0.05, ∆PSI &gt; 0.2) were the increased inclusion of cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In long introns, RNA secondary and tertiary structures, stemming from competitive long- and short-range pairings between short inverted repeat (IR) sequences, have been shown to be partially required for appropriate splice site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>).

Such IR pairs tend to be derived from repetitive elements (short-interspersed nuclear elements [SINEs], long-interspersed nuclear elements [LINEs]). We therefore examined if there was differential association of HNRNPM with these elements in mis-spliced transcripts but not in unaffected transcripts. Approximately 43.7% of HNRNPM-bound peaks across the transcriptome were associated with at least one class of repetitive element (LINE, SINE, repetitive DNA, or long terminal repeats [LTR]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>; all binding sites; bottom panel).

In linear transcripts, we observed an increased incidence of potential GQ-forming sequences per kb of intron length in the intron upstream of the mis-splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>; left panel) compared to other introns in the same transcript.

This, in turn, leads to changes in both the cell’s transcriptome and proteome, manifesting as phenotypic transformations. Since changes in alternative splicing, but not gene expression, were the main impact of HNRNPM depletion, we focused on the exon inclusion and circularization events that were changed upon HNRNPM knockdown. Gene ontology analysis of these genes suggested that most of these genes are involved in specific key cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), including histone lysine methylation and the regulation of microtubule polymerization.</p><p>The majority of HNRNPM-dependent linear-splicing events were predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or alternative reading frames in their target protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that the functions or protein levels of many of these targets were likely to be altered in HNRNPM<sup>low</sup> cells.

To rule out the possibility that reduced cell proliferation was due to toxicities of SSO chemistry, we either designed SSOs that targeted our introns of interest, but did not induce switching (ZNF548, SSO-1, and PRKAB2 SSO-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wahl et al., 2009</xref> used a different backbone chemistry (2′-O-methoxyethyl) that is known to have reduced toxicity and increased binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teplova et al., 1999</xref>; see EED, MOE backbone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In the latter case, we found that growth was inhibited in SSO-treated cells, regardless of the SSO backbone used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To determine if increased inclusion of HNRNPM-regulated exons is similarly predictive in patient samples, we obtained the PSIs of HNRNPM-dependent exons for patients within the PRAD TCGA dataset. We found that patients that expressed more HNRNPM-regulated exons at PSI higher than the population median had significant survival benefit over those who expressed less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the reduction in cell growth in HNRNPM-deficient cells is likely a result of perturbing multiple genes across different pathways, rather than from a single target.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>EED isoform 2 is a novel splicing target of HNRNPM</title><p>While HNRNPM loss resulted in NMD events, a significant portion of them also resulted in alternative proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). One such event occurred in the <italic>EED</italic> transcript, which our SSO data suggested was growth inhibitory. We were interested in understanding why this was so. Loss of HNRNPM expression resulted in increased inclusion of <italic>EED</italic> exon 10, resulting in a 25-amino acid added in-frame to the EED protein. To determine how this may affect EED function, we analyzed and modeled the structure of EED protein with or without the peptide extension. Wildtype EED contains seven copies of the WD-repeat motif and folds into a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure. We found that addition of the peptide sequence into the structure results in disruption of hydrogen bonding within the beta sheet of WD repeat 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This is likely to disrupt the stability of the WD repeat and affect EED function. In support of this, we find that induction of this specific isoform of EED in LNCAP cells is correlated with reduced H3K27me3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results suggest that loss of EED function is likely to contribute to the reduced proliferation we observed upon HNRNPM. Indeed, analyses of the TCGA datasets suggest that patients with reduced EED expression have improved disease-free survival compared to patients with high EED expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>HNRNPM regulates growth in other cancers</title><p>Finally, we asked if the effects we see with HNRNPM for PCa could be further extended to other cancers with different cell of origins. Assays conducted in Calu-3, Panc-1, SKMEL147, and MEL501 cell lines, representing lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and melanoma, respectively, showed that HNRNPM loss resulted in growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>), similar to what we had observed with PCa. In addition, loss of HNRNPM in these four cell lines similarly resulted in the same mis-splicing event in <italic>USP33</italic> and <italic>EED</italic> in a dosage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that HNRNPM similarly regulates splicing events across different cell types. Interestingly, the same assay did not impact viability of HepG2, a hepatoblastoma cell line, despite promoting similar HNRNPM-dependent downstream splicing perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, rightmost panels). Finally, given the effects that we observed in the melanoma lines SKMEL147 and MEL501, we additionally validated the effects of HNRNPM expression on circRNAs in an independent dataset available to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanniford et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed that the expression of the HNRNPM-dependent circRNAs, which we identified in PCa, is significantly negatively correlated with <italic>HNRNPM</italic> expression (R = −0.42, p&lt;2.2e-16) across 10 different primary melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HNRNPM regulates growth and splicing in other cancer cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proliferation curves of PANC1, Calu3, Mel501, SKMEL147, and HepG2 cells, representing cell lines derived from pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and hepatoblastoma, upon treatment with scrambled (SCR; black) or HNRNPM-specific (2B7; orange or 2B9; red) shRNAs.

This is thought to be a consequence of the increased proliferative rates and transcriptional outputs of cancer cells, resulting in ‘addiction’ to a highly functioning spliceosome. Despite this, splice signatures can vary across different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sebestyén et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that unique or sets of splicing factors may regulate different splicing programs across different cancer types. For instance, ESRP1 has been suggested to drive both oncogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fagoonee et al., 2017</xref>) and tumor-suppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ueda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>) programs in the context of different cancers. Another important point to consider is that splicing factors involved in oncogenesis may also play essential roles in normal cells. Indeed, while we were able to validate known oncogenic splicing factors such as SRSF1 and SRSF2 in our in vivo and in vitro shRNA screens, we have found that short-term depletion of these factors inhibits normal prostate cell growth. Identification of key factors that underpin a cancer-type-specific splicing program, without disrupting normal cell function, is, therefore, important in the development of downstream therapeutics.</p><p>Here, we have identified HNRNPM as a potential vulnerability in PCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). HNRNPM-depleted LNCAP PCa cells fail to expand both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our data suggest that the arrest in cell proliferation in HNRNPM-depleted cells is likely a consequence of mis-splicing as opposed to an alteration of transcript abundance. Indeed, using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to mimic several of these splicing events in cells that expressed HNRNPM was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In support of this, we modeled an exon inclusion event in the EED transcript that suggests that destabilization of one of its WD repeats likely contributes to reduced PRC2 complex activity in PCa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). We have also showed that the majority of circRNAs regulated by HNRNPM are expressed in PCa patients, and that their expression levels are anti-correlated with those of HNRNPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Reduced expression of some of these circRNAs correlated with poorer disease-free survivals in these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Taken together, HNRNPM likely regulates PCa cell proliferation by suppressing exon inclusion and circularization of multiple transcripts across many key homeostatic pathways in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the phenotypic manifestation of HNRNPM loss in PCa cells is different from what was previously described. Here we describe a role for HNRNPM in maintaining cell fitness but did not observe changes in cell identity programs in PCa cells. In breast cancer cells, loss of HNRNPM inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but not cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we have shown that cells derived from other cancer types (PANC-1, Calu3, melanoma) are sensitive to HNRNPM knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data are consistent with a context-dependent function for HNRNPM in cancer, which might depend on its downstream targets and cell of origin. Interestingly, the herein identified downstream target EED controls cell proliferation and EMT in context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serresi et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiments with induced exon 10 inclusion in EED add a further layer to these observations because they suggest that chromatin templates in the cell can be reprogrammed not only by changing the expression of chromatin factors, but also by altering their splicing. Understanding the extent to which mis-splicing of chromatin factors contributes to establishment of cancer, whether through HNRNPM or other splicing factors, will be important for future studies.</p><p>Splicing defects occurring during HNRNPM deficiency primarily involve increased exon inclusion and exon circularization, indicating that HNRNPM normally functions to suppress splice site usage in PCa. This is consistent with previous observations on splicing during HNRNPM loss in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huelga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damianov et al., 2016</xref>). Our data indicate that mis-spliced linear-splicing and circularization events occurring during HNRNPM deficiency are located in exons that are flanked by HNRNPM-bound introns. HNRNPM occupancy is much lower in other introns in the same transcripts, suggesting that its recruitment is important for ensuring appropriate splice site selection.</p><p>Members of the hnRNP family of proteins have been shown to be important in ensuring correct splice site selection in target genes. These proteins tend to interact with cis-regulatory splicing silencer sequences in pre-mRNA, and several hnRNPs have also been identified as repressors of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matlin et al., 2005</xref>). hnRNP-mediated splicing repression has been attributed to several modes of action, including antagonizing core spliceosomal components and/or splicing enhancer proteins from binding to pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayeda and Krainer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayeda et al., 1993</xref>), as well as alteration of long-range secondary structure in pre-mRNA to inhibit/promote alternate splice site usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solnick and Lee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchette and Chabot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez-Contreras et al., 2006</xref>). These modes of action are not mutually exclusive, and some hnRNPs (e.g., hnRNPA1) have been shown to rely on both, depending on their binding context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayeda and Krainer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayeda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchette and Chabot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez-Contreras et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses suggest that HNRNPM specifically prevents mis-splicing in the context of long genes and is especially enriched in long introns across the genome. Increased intron length has been shown to adversely affect correct splice site selection. For one, cryptic splice sites that compete with the original 5′ and 3′ splice sites are more likely to be found within a longer intron. Secondly, increased intron length extends the delay between RNA polymerase II-dependent synthesis of the 5′ and its associated 3′ splice sites, resulting in a higher probability of RNA secondary and/or tertiary interactions forming to bridge a 5′ss and an incorrect proximal cryptic 3′ss.</p><p>Formation of RNA secondary and tertiary structures has been shown to be partially required for correct splice site selection in long introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In vertebrates, large introns bear relatively high densities of repetitive regions that are predicted to form both intra- and inter-intron complementary base pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shepard et al., 2009</xref>). Such pairings may be long range (&gt;1.4 kb apart; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aktaş et al., 2017</xref>) and are typically formed between LINEs or SINEs. Competition between such pairs of complementary sequences has been shown to significantly alter splice site selection in both linear and circular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It may be that HNRNPM is required to regulate the formation or interactions between these structures at such transcripts in order to maintain correct splice site selection. In line with this, HNRNPM was previously shown to interact with several ATP-dependent RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brannan et al., 2016</xref>), pointing to a possible association with RNA secondary/tertiary structure. We also observe that HNRNPM is more enriched at repetitive elements in mis-spliced transcripts than other bound transcripts. Long flanking introns that flank mis-splicing events in HNRNPM deficiency also have a higher tendency to form G-quadruplex structures. Interestingly, we do not observe local (&lt;1 kb flanking HNRNPM-bound sites) changes in secondary structure immediately surrounding HNRNPM-bound sites. It could be that HNRNPM is more important for mediating cross-intron interactions or required for regulating RNA tertiary structures.</p><p>Finally, it has been previously reported that long, alternatively spliced genes, bearing elevated intron length to exon length ratios, are highly enriched in pathways associated with cancer and other multi-genic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sahakyan and Balasubramanian, 2016</xref>). Understanding how this class of genes is regulated may thus be critical for developing therapeutics against these diseases. Because of their lengths, expression of this class of genes can be rate-limiting for cell survival and/or function. Inhibition of transcription elongation by blocking topoisomerase activity is sufficient to impair their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 2013</xref>). In a similar way, we have shown that expression of these genes may also be especially vulnerable to depletion of splicing factors such as HNRNPM. One prediction that arises from this observation is that expression of these genes may be modulated through synergistic interactions between inhibitors targeting transcription elongation and splicing factors. Indeed, there is some evidence in the literature pointing towards this. Mutations in the splicing factors SRSF2 and U2AF1 have been shown to impair transcription pause-release and drive R loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that these two pathways are intimately linked. Identification of other factors similar to HNRNPM that may similarly affect homeostasis of these genes can thus be important for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>LNCAP (ATCC; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0395">CVCL_0395</ext-link>) and PC3 (ATCC; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0035">CVCL_0035</ext-link>) cells were cultured and maintained in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza) 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), non-essential amino acids (Gibco; 11140050), and 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140163).

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate the p-value of the difference in survival curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>CircRNA expression and HNRNPM expression in PCa patients</title><p>Patient clinical attributes and circRNA expression levels were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>. A circRNA was considered as highly expressed in a patient if it was expressed at levels that were at the 75th percentile of that of the cohort. To calculate HNRNPM expression levels in different groups of patients, the number of highly expressed circRNAs was first counted per patient. Patients were stratified by those that had most numbers of high-expressed circRNAs (&gt;75th percentile of cohort; group = high), least (≤25th percentile of cohort; group = low), or mid-range (25th–75th percentile of cohort; group = mid). HNRNPM levels for each group were then plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>CircRNA expression and BCR survival in PCa patients</title><p>Patients' clinical attributes and circRNA expression levels were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>. For each circRNA, patients were stratified by those that had high-expression circRNAs (&gt;75th percentile of cohort; group = high), low-expression (≤25th percentile of cohort; group = low), or mid-expression (25th–75th percentile of cohort; group = mid). Biochemical relapse survival curves and hazard ratios were then calculated using the ‘Survival’ package in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>CircRNA expression and HNRNPM expression in melanoma samples</title><p>Melanoma short-term cultures (patient samples surgically excised at NYU Langone Health and then adapted to tissue culture conditions) were processed with the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina) for RNA-sequencing. Paired-end reads were processed with the DCC pipeline (version 0.4.7) in order to identify circRNAs. RNA-seq data is deposited in GEO, accession code GSE138711. For further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanniford et al., 2020</xref>.

Briefly, RG6 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI. Inserts corresponding to HNRNPM-binding regions for APMAP1 (chr20:24945080–24945163; Hg19) and USP33 (chr1:78224956–78225074; Hg19) were cloned in. Sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Where necessary, HNRNPM-binding sites were mutated using QuikChange XLII Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For flow cytometry assays, 5 µg of each plasmid was transfected into 5E5 HEK293T cells. 1 day post transfection, cells were trypsinized and strained through a 40 µM filter. Flow cytometry experiments were performed on the BD Fortessa. Only singlet and live cells (as determined by DAPI dye exclusion) were analyzed. To avoid biases in data because of differences in transfection efficiency, non-fluorescent cells were gated out using an untransfected control. The relative percentages of GFP and dsRed single- and double-positive cells amongst all fluorescent cells were then determined. Analysis was performed with FCS Express 7.0. p-values were calculated using Student’s t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>In vivo DMS probing</title><p>LNCaP cells were trypsinized for 1 min at 37°C, trypsin was neutralized by addition of fresh serum-containing medium, and harvested by centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min. After aspiring medium, cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in DMS Probing Buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9; 140 mM NaCl; 3 mM KCl). DMS was pre-diluted 1:6 in ethanol, then added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 100 mM. Cells were incubated at 25°C with moderate shaking for 2 min. Reaction was quenched by placing cells in ice and immediately adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.7 M. Cells were briefly collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 9600 g (4°C). Supernatant was aspired, and cells were washed once with a solution of 0.7 M DTT in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Isolation of nascent RNA</title><p>The pellet from a 75%-confluence 100 mm plate was resuspended in 150 μl of Cytoplasm Buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7; 150 mM NaCl) by pipetting using a cut P1000-tip. 50 μl of Cytoplasm Lysis Buffer (0.6% NP-40; 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7; 150 mM NaCl) were slowly added dropwise, after which the sample was incubated on ice for 2 min. The lysate was then layered on top of a 500 μl cushion of Sucrose Buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7; 150 mM NaCl; 25% sucrose). The sample was then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min (4°C). The supernatant (representing the cytosolic fraction) was discarded, and the nuclei were washed in 800 μl of Nuclei Wash Buffer (0.1% Triton X-100; 1 mM EDTA in 1× PBS), then collected by centrifugation at 1150 g for 1 min (4°C). After removing the supernatant, nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of Glycerol Buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8; 75 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; 50% glycerol; 10 mM DTT) and resuspended by pipetting, then transferred to a clean tube. 200 μl of Nuclei Lysis Buffer (1% NP-40; 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 300 mM NaCl; 2 M urea; 0.2 mM EDTA; 10 mM DTT) were then added dropwise, while gently vortexing the sample. The sample was then incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 18,500 g for 10 min (4°C). The supernatant (representing the nucleoplasm) was discarded, and the chromatin fraction was washed once with Nuclei Lysis Buffer, without letting the pellet detach from the bottom of the tube. After discarding the supernatant, 1 ml of ice-cold TRIzol was added directly to the chromatin fraction, and the sample was incubated at 56°C for 5 min to solubilize chromatin. RNA extraction was performed by adding 200 μl of chloroform, vigorously mixing for 15 s, then centrifuging at 12,500 g for 15 min (4°C). After centrifugation, the upper aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube, and mixed with three volumes of ethanol by vigorously vortexing for 15 s.

Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify regions not exceeding a length of 600 nt. Reverse transcription was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl. 1 μg of nascent RNA was initially mixed with 2 μl of 10 mM dNTPs and 1 μl of 10 μM gene-specific primers, then denatured at 70°C for 5 min, after which the sample was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature by incubation for 5 min on the bench. Reaction was started by addition of 4 μl 5× RT Buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 375 mM KCl; 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 1 μl 0.1 M DTT, 20 U SUPERase• In RNase Inhibitor, and 200 U TGIRT-III Enzyme. The sample was incubated at 50°C for 5 min, followed by 2 hr at 57°C. Reaction was stopped by addition of 1 μl NaOH 5M. Then the sample was incubated at 95°C for 3 min to detach the reverse transcriptase and degrade the RNA. cDNA cleanup was performed using Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 columns, following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of target intronic regions was performed using 10% of the purified cDNA for each primers pair and AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase (high fidelity), following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, the bands of the expected size were gel-purified and pooled in equimolar amounts. The sample was then sheared by 20 cycles of sonication using a Diagenode Bioruptor sonicator (30'' on; 30'' off; power: high).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Juan Valcárcel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ho et al. report the results of a targeted pooled shRNA screen to identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in mouse xenografts. One of the hits corresponds to the gene encoding hnRNP M, an RNA binding protein overexpressed in prostate cancer cells lines compared to untransformed prostate epithelial cells. They further demonstrate that HNRNPM knockdown (KD) reduces cell proliferation, colony formation, anchorage independent growth in vitro, as well as tumor-xenograft size in vivo. eCLIP, RNA-seq and mutational analysis in minigenes identify GU-rich hnRNP M binding sites in (long) introns flanking exons that become included upon hnRNP M knock down as well as flanking exons undergoing circularization by back-splicing. Modulation of three hnRNP M-regulated alternative splicing events using splice switching antisense oligonucleotides leads to inhibition of cell growth and in the case of the EED gene to reduction of H3K27me3 modifications, which might contribute to the anti-proliferative effects observed upon hnRNP M knock down.</p><p>This is an elegant and thoroughly performed study on the splicing factor hnRNPM, revealing circuits of post-transcriptional regulation relevant for prostate cancer cell growth. There are however some issues that the reviewers feel that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. One important question is the extent to which these observations connect with prostate cancer biology. In the absence of results with an animal model, questions could still be asked by examining human tumors:</p><p>– First, are there alterations in hnRNP M levels/activity in prostate cancer? The results of Figure 1E are consistent with this but the comparison is limited to three cell lines, which is far from conclusive for assessing the impact of hnRNP M levels on real tumor samples. Analysis of public datasets of tumor samples (including TCGA) could be helpful in this regard.</p><p>– Second, are there splicing alterations consistent with changes in hnRNP M activity in tumor samples? The result of Figure 7G shows that the levels of EED transcript correlate with disease progression, but it is unclear what is the connection between EED transcript abundance and the ratio between EED isoforms controlled by hnRNP M (both isoforms are in frame and therefore inclusion or skipping of the alternative exon is not predicted to affect mRNA levels). Splicing-focused bioinformatic tools for the analysis of patient prognosis (e.g. Psichomics) may be helpful in this regard for EED, PRKAB2, ZNF548 and other targets of hnRNP M. The results of Figure 5J are potentially interesting but given the difficulty to predict functional effects of circRNAs, it is difficult to conceptualize these observations.</p><p>2. Is hnRNPM actually differentially required in prostate cancer versus normal prostate epithelial cells? While the authors suggest that hnRNPM may not simply be an essential protein in prostate epithelial cells, the data to support this are not clear. For example, what is the effect of hnRNPM depletion in PrEC cells (or, alternatively, does hnRNPM expression alter growth of PrEC, LNCAP, or PC3 cells)? The data presented in the manuscript are valuable regardless of the conclusion of these experiments but it would be helpful to clarify this point.</p><p>3. Figure 7C: judging from the changes in growth rates (y axis in panels for individual events), it seems that SSOs induce stronger effects on cell proliferation while inducing substantially more limited changes an alternative splicing in these target genes, how can this be explained? Are these results suggesting a potential toxicity issue with the SSO chemistry? Are these results replicated? Are the effects on cell growth recapitulated by combining the effects of SSOs targeting EED, PRKB2 and ZNF548? Finally, please discuss the fact that in Figure 7F, AON1 leads to EED protein decrease, but AON2 does not, and AON1 also leads to increased HNRNPM expression, suggesting a potential feedback loop. Can restoration of normal EED expression/splicing rescue the effects of hnRNPM loss in prostate cancer cells? As with most splicing factors, the protean number of splicing targets makes it difficult to ascertain if the effects of hnRNPM depletion are related to a few or a multitude of mis-spliced targets. Given the nice work presented on EED splicing here, it may be interesting to investigate if restoring correctly spliced EED could rescue the effects of hnRNPM loss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59654.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We had tried to address this question in the original Figure S1B (now Figure 1-Supplement 1). We used the TCGA PRAD dataset to stratify patients by their <italic>HnRNPM</italic> expression levels. We found that, in line with our hypothesis, patients that expressed higher levels of <italic>HnRNPM</italic> had significantly worse disease-free survival (p=0.019 by logrank test) compared to patients with lower levels of <italic>HnRNPM</italic>.</p><p>This is not the case for the closely related <italic>HnRNPF</italic>.</p><p>In addition, we used the TCGA PRAD dataset to look at the overall levels of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> mRNA expression in normal versus tumor samples. Consistent with our observations in cell lines, we saw that tumor samples expressed significantly more <italic>HNRNPM</italic> transcripts when compared to normal controls.</p><p>Finally, we performed knockdowns of HNRNPM in primary patient derived prostate cancer cells and showed that HnRNPM was required for the growth of these cells (Figure 2G). These data suggest that the effects that we see in the LNCAP and PC3 cell lines were physiologically relevant and can be extended to real tumor samples.</p><p>We nonetheless agree with the reviewer that the connection to prostate cancer biology was limited in scope. We thus extended the analysis to other tumor cell lines, including Panc-1 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), Calu-3 (lung adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatoblastoma), SKMEL147 and MEL501 (melanoma), to assess how generalizable was the observed mechanism (Figure 7).</p><p>As with the effects we saw in prostate cancer, we found that loss of HNRNPM in multiple cancer cell lines, with different cell of origins also lead to reduced proliferation as well as changes in splicing of HNRNPM-targets. This suggests that the effects of HNRNPM extend beyond prostate cancer. Interestingly, in HepG2, despite observing changes in splicing of hnRNPM targets, we did not observe any effect on cell growth. These results point at the fact that hnRNPM is not an essential gene, but acts more as a context-dependent factor in different cancer types.</p><p>Finally, given the effects that we observed in the melanoma SKMEL147 and MEL501 cell lines upon HNRNPM knockdown, we additionally validated the effects on HNRNPM-dependent circRNA in an independent dataset available to us. We found a significant negative correlation (R = − 0.42, p &lt; 2.2e−16) between HNRNPM expression and circRNA expression across 10 primary melanoma cell lines in this dataset (Figure 7-Supplement 1), suggesting that HNRNPM likely has similar functions in melanoma as it does in prostate cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Second, are there splicing alterations consistent with changes in hnRNP M activity in tumor samples?

To address this question, we looked at EED exon 10 inclusion in the context of high (&gt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile) or low HNRNPM mRNA (≤ 90<sup>th</sup> Percentile) expression in the TCGA data set. Since HNRNPM is generally more highly expressed in tumors compared to normal tissue, we chose this cutoff to distinguish between tumors that expressed HNRNPM at levels closer to normal tissues (“low hnrnpm”) or tumors that expressed HNRNPM at levels greater than that of normal tissues (“high hnrnpm”) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Overall, we see a trend where patients with the high levels of HNRNPM tend to have low EED exon 10 inclusion (p=0.144, Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). In interpreting these results, it is important to note that the levels of <italic>HNRNPM</italic> in tumor samples do not fall to the levels that we see under knockdown conditions (below “normal tissue expression levels”). We therefore will not expect to see as strong a difference in PSI as seen in a knockdown experiment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of EED exon10 inclusion in TCGA patient samples.</title><p>(a) To stratify patients between “high hnrnpm” and “low hnrnpm” expression, we used a 90<sup>th</sup> percentile cutoff within tumor samples.

For EED, we see a trend where patients with higher levels of EED exon 10 inclusion have better survival prognosis (based on a 70<sup>th</sup> percentile cutoff of PSI levels across all patients), although this is not statistically significant based on a logrank significance test. The same is true for other events (example: ZNF548, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Increased inclusion of single HNRNPM-regulated exons poorly correlates with improved patient survival.</title><p>Disease free survival plot of TCGA PRAD patients, stratified by the total number of events per patient where the PSI of the indicated HNRNPM-regulated exon exceeds that of the median PSI within the patient population.

This aligns with our predictions that the lower HNRNPM levels (which promote exon inclusion events) confer survival benefit in patients. Overall, these data, together with the results that we show in Figure 5J for the circular RNAs, suggest that the effects of HNRNPM depletion are likely an accumulation of multiple mis-splicing events, rather than single driver events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is hnRNPM actually differentially required in prostate cancer versus normal prostate epithelial cells? While the authors suggest that hnRNPM may not simply be an essential protein in prostate epithelial cells, the data to support this are not clear. For example, what is the effect of hnRNPM depletion in PrEC cells (or, alternatively, does hnRNPM expression alter growth of PrEC, LNCAP, or PC3 cells)? The data presented in the manuscript are valuable regardless of the conclusion of these experiments but it would be helpful to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards to PrEC cells, we had used siRNA to reduce HNRNPM levels, and showed that reduced HNRNPM levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in these cells. This data is shown in Figure 1D. We were unable to use the lentiviral system to test the effect of knockdown on growth in these cells due to technical limitations – these cells have a limited number of population doublings before senescing and lentivirus transduction efficiency was low.</p><p>On the other hand, reduction of HnRNPM levels in PC3 cells results in inhibition of growth, similar to what we saw with the LNCAP cells. This data was presented in the original Figure S2 (now Figure 2-Supplement 1). We have now made detailed references to this data in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 7C: judging from the changes in growth rates (y axis in panels for individual events), it seems that SSOs induce stronger effects on cell proliferation while inducing substantially more limited changes an alternative splicing in these target genes, how can this be explained? Are these results suggesting a potential toxicity issue with the SSO chemistry? Are these results replicated?</p></disp-quote><p>Aside from the scrambled control SSOs, our experiments with PRKAB2 and ZNF548 also include SSOs (see ZNF548 SSO-1 and PRKAB2 SSO-1 in Figure 6C) that do not induce exon inclusion events as controls. Cells that are treated with these SSOs proliferate to the same extent as cells treated with the scrambled non-targeting ones, suggesting that SSO chemistry used is not toxic to the cells. The results shown in Figure 7C represent 2 independently performed experiments for cell proliferation.</p><p>In addition, for EED, we have repeated experiments using a different SSO chemistry. SSOs were synthesized with the MOE backbone compared to the 2-OMe backbone we used. We still observe the same reduction in cell proliferation, as well as changes in splicing, suggesting that the effects of reduced cell growth that we see are most likely sequence specific, rather than chemistry specific (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the effects on cell growth recapitulated by combining the effects of SSOs targeting EED, PRKB2 and ZNF548?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have performed the experiment in question, and we see that effects of cell growth is recapitulated by combining the effects of SSOs targeting EED, PRKAB2 and ZNF548 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Note that to avoid potential issues of toxicity with due to increased lipofectamine and overall SSO concentrations in this combinatorial experiment, we used a 4-fold lowered concentration of individual SSOs (25nM/SSO/sample) for this experiment as compared to what we have used (100nM/SSO/sample) in experiments we had previously shown. Where necessary, scrambled (SCR), non-targeting SSOs were added to ensure that the total final concentration of SSOs cells were exposed to remained the same.</p><p>Overall, due to the lower concentration used, we did not observe strong synergy among the different SSOs. It is likely though that combination of multiple events (there are 135 mis-spliced events, of which 110 are bound by HNRNPM) are indeed causing the phenotype, which is somewhat hard to reproduce in vitro.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Combined knockdown of multiple splicing events results in inhibition of cell proliferation.</title><p>LNCAP cells were transfected with 2OMe SSOs targeting ZNF548 (ZNF548 SSO-3), PRKAB2 (PRKAB SSO-2) and EED (EED SSO-1).

A second independent replicate of the protein blot, performed alongside samples that were treated with the MOE chemistry is shown in Figure 6G. H3K27me3 levels, normalized to H3 and ACTB is quantified in Figure 6G. The lower EED isoforms are clearly visible, and are depleted by both EED and HNRNPM SSOs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can restoration of normal EED expression/splicing rescue the effects of hnRNPM loss in prostate cancer cells? As with most splicing factors, the protean number of splicing targets makes it difficult to ascertain if the effects of hnRNPM depletion are related to a few or a multitude of mis-spliced targets. Given the nice work presented on EED splicing here, it may be interesting to investigate if restoring correctly spliced EED could rescue the effects of hnRNPM loss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As the reviewer suggested, we tried to perform rescue experiments by overexpressing the wild type EED protein in HNRNPM depleted cells. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve rescue in proliferation, suggesting that the effects of HNRNPM depletion is not solely dependent on misplicing of <italic>EED</italic> alone.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>EED overexpression in HNRNPM knockdown cells.</title><p>LNCAP cells were transduced with either a control (empty vector) or EED overexpressing lentivirus (Blasticidin resistant).
