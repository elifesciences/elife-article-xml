behavior, and hemodynamic signals in un-anesthetized, head-fixed mice. Mice frequently fell asleep during imaging, and these sleep events were interspersed with periods of wake. During both NREM and REM sleep, mice showed large increases in cerebral blood volume ([HbT]) and arteriole diameter relative to the awake state, two to five times larger than those evoked by sensory stimulation. During NREM, the amplitude of bilateral low-frequency oscillations in [HbT] increased markedly, and coherency between neural activity and hemodynamic signals was higher than the awake resting and REM states. Bilateral correlations in neural activity and [HbT] were highest during NREM, and lowest in the awake state. Hemodynamic signals in the cortex are strongly modulated by arousal state, and changes during sleep are substantially larger than sensory-evoked responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurovascular coupling</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>optical imaging</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>2-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>arousal state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS078168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>Patrick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS079737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>Patrick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sleep-related hemodynamic signals are much larger than those in the awake brain, so it is crucial to monitor the arousal state during studies of spontaneous activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a ubiquitous state in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anafi et al., 2019</xref>) that is controlled by an ensemble of nuclei and their brain-wide interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sakai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saper et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cirelli, 2009</xref>), sleep is broadly comprised of two stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM or slow-wave sleep) and rapid eye movement (REM or paradoxical sleep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weber and Dan, 2016</xref>). Each of these states is associated with distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain. During NREM sleep, there are broad-band increases in the local field potential (LFP) power in the cortex that are modulated atÂ &lt;1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amzica and Steriade, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta and Maclean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saper and Fuller, 2017</xref>). During REM sleep, gamma band power (nominally 30â100 Hz) is elevated in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Le Van Quyen et al., 2010</xref>). In the hippocampus, REM sleep is also associated with a marked increase in power in the theta band (nominally 4â10 Hz) in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the dynamics of neural activity in the cortex and other brain structures during sleep are well characterized, the cerebrovascular manifestations of sleep are less clear. Pioneering studies using positron-emission tomography (PET) or <sup>133</sup>Xenon in humans have suggested that cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism is reduced during NREM sleep as compared with those during awake levels, and increased above said levels during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Townsend et al., 1973</xref>), though the temporal and spatial resolutions of these techniques are poor. The degree to which CBF changes during the different sleep states appears dependent upon brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madsen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maquet and Phillips, 1998</xref>), complicating the interpretation of functional connectivity studies looking at correlations between brain regions where subjects may be transitioning among arousal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). Several fMRI studies have shown significant alterations in hemodynamic signals and functional connectivity during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dang-Vu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fukunaga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horovitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larson-Prior et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes during sleep. Because BOLD signals are generated by a complicated interplay of cerebral metabolism and changes in blood flow and volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim and Ogawa, 2012</xref>), the vascular basis of these changes and their relation to neural activity are not well understood. Although functional ultrasound measures indicate cerebral blood volume rises during sleep (likely due to arterial dilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>) and is correlated with hippocampal theta and gamma band power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergel et al., 2018</xref>), the relationship of cortical vascular changes to local cortical neural activity is unknown.</p><p>Understanding the vascular basis of hemodynamic signals during sleep is relevant to many aspects of brain health and function. First, BOLD signal changes during sleep are associated with movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fultz et al., 2019</xref>), and the movement of CSF is thought to play an important role in maintaining brain health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Simon and Iliff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarasoff-Conway et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Elucidating the vascular changes associated with these fluid movements would help resolve the actual drivers of fluid movement. Secondly, there is accumulating evidence that arousal state transitions drive large hemodynamic changes, both in animals performing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>), and in humans and animals undergoing âresting-stateâ studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>). If the hemodynamic signals during the periods of altered arousal are large or correlated enough, the activity during the sleep states could dominate the functional connectivity signal. Complicating mechanistic studies in mice is the fact that head-fixed mice do not close their eyes during NREM and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">YÃ¼zgeÃ§ et al., 2018</xref>), meaning that without careful monitoring or a task it is possible that many studies examining âresting-stateâ correlations in head-fixed mice were compounded by sleep.</p><p>Here we measured behavior, neural activity, blood volume and arteriole dilations from head-fixed mice during the awake state and NREM and REM sleep. We found that arteriole dilations and blood volume changes during NREM and REM sleep could be two to five times larger than those occurring in the awake animal. The correlations between neural activity and hemodynamic signals was greatly increased during NREM sleep, and the functional connectivity between interhemispheric regions of somatosensory cortex also increased.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used intrinsic optical signal (IOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Winder et al., 2017</xref>) (14 mice, nine males) and 2-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Echagarruga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shih et al., 2012a</xref>) (six mice, two males) in concert with electrophysiology to measure neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harris et al., 2016</xref>) from the whisker representation of somatosensory cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in un-anesthetized, head-fixed C57BL6/J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) during the light cycle. After mice were habituated to head-fixation, data was acquired from each mouse for 5â7 days. We obtained 357.2 total hours of data from these mice (mean: 23Â Â±Â 5.1 hr per mouse from IOS mice <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), 5.8Â Â±Â 2.0 hr per mouse from 2-photon imaged mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All experiments were performed during the animalâs light cycle. We tracked whisker position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kleinfeld and DeschÃªnes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Connor et al., 2010</xref>), body movement, and nuchal muscle EMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta and Maclean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Veasey et al., 2000</xref>), as spontaneous âfidgetingâ behaviors drive a substantial portion of neural activity and hemodynamic signals in the awake mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Winder et al., 2017</xref>), and these measures can be used to determine the arousal state of the animal. We recorded neural activity differentially across stereotrodes from the whisker representation of the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus to reject non-local electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nicholson and Freeman, 1975</xref>). For IOS data, we used a bootstrap aggregation random forest to determine the arousal state from these behavioral measures and hippocampal and cortical LFPs (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), categorizing every non-overlapping five second interval into one of three categories: rfc-Awake, rfc-NREM, or rfc-REM, where ârfcâ denotes the arousal state assigned via an automated random forest classifier. rfc-Awake periods were further characterized into <italic>awake rest</italic> (defined as periods lasting longer than 10 s that lack whisker and body movement), <italic>awake whisking</italic> (defined as bouts of whisking lasting between 2 and 5 s in duration), and <italic>awake stimulation</italic> (directed air puffs to contralateral whiskers). Each of these three awake behaviors were manually identified in rfc-Awake data to exclude transitional arousal states. Periods of <italic>contiguous NREM</italic> sleep and <italic>contiguous REM</italic> sleep were defined as events lasting at least 30 s and 60 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The 2-photon microscopy data was manually scored in a fashion similar to rfc-IOS data (Manual(m)-Awake, m-NREM, m-REM) and then further subdivided into awake rest, awake whisking, contiguous NREM, and contiguous REM (no whisker was stimulation presented during 2-photon experiments) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As awake behaviors can be much shorter in duration than NREM and REM events, we used different durations when categorizing each arousal state. We chose the specific durations for each arousal state based on the typical minimum duration of each event, allowing us to catch the neural and vascular dynamics of each behavior. All reported values are meanÂ Â±Â standard deviation, unless otherwise indicated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sleep drives large changes in cerebral blood volume.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of IOS experimental setup.

To assist in arousal state classification, we also recorded the CA1 hippocampal LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), nuchal muscle electromyography (EMG), motion of the whiskers, body motion, and heart rate. Hemodynamic measurements were taken from a region of interest within a 1 mm diameter circle centered on the pixels that showed the highest cross-correlation between reflectance and gamma band power (1â2 s lag) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Winder et al., 2017</xref>) during the first 15â60 min of data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>).

Volitional, awake whisking led to an increase in gamma band power and [HbT] that increased with the duration of the whisking event.

A hypnogram for a single mouse over 6 days with 5 s resolution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The white lines denote brief breaks in recording while data is saved. From this example, it is clear that the mouse has many periods of NREM and REM sleep interspersed with awake. Periods of REM sleep canonically follow NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saper et al., 2010</xref>). REM periods are typically followed by awakening, though REM sleep can be followed by NREM periods. The mean percentage of each classified state is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and the breakdown for individual animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We noted no clear difference in (rfc-)Awake:NREM:REM sleep ratios between males and females, so they were pooled for other analyses. Plotting the probability of finding the mouse in each of the states as a function of time throughout the imaging session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) shows that as time goes by the mouse is more likely to be asleep. As awake mice typically whisk everyÂ ~10 s, we quantified the probability that the mouse had fallen asleep after a given period lacking whisking and body movement (âRestâ) across all animals. We found that during onlyÂ ~50% of ârestingâ events lasting 10â15 s were the mice awake for the whole event, and with longer ârestingâ events showing even lower probability of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result is reminiscent of studies in humans showing the probability of being awake falls rapidly with time during a resting-state fMRI scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>), though human sleep/wake behavior is much less fragmented than in the mouse, and the transition times are correspondingly longer.

In comparison to the awake state, arteriole diameter during NREM sleep follows a low-frequency dilation/constriction with peak dilations that can exceed those seen during moderate whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). During REM sleep, the arterioles slowly dilate over tens of seconds, and can reach peak dilations in excess of 50% of the baseline diameter during periods of awake rest. The dilation amplitudes during NREM and REM sleep dwarf those seen in the awake animals. Penetrating arterioles had similar sleep-wake dynamics as the pial arterioles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>) and were combined into a single group for all analysis.

We used transitions between two arousal states, where time in each arousal state was at least 30 s in duration. Mammals will typically progress through the Awake-NREM-REM-Awake pattern of the sleep cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saper et al., 2010</xref>), even if the awake periods between the end of a REM event and the initiation of the subsequent NREM period are very brief. The transition from the rfc-Awake state into rfc-NREM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) shows an increase in total hemoglobin from the baseline of very low [HbT] in the awake state, up to 30 ÂµM over the course of 30 s. During this time, the EMG power decreases with similar temporal dynamics. The LFP power in the vibrissa cortex shows increased power in the delta band [1â4 Hz] of around 300%. The transition from rfc-NREM into the rfc-Awake state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) was largely a temporally reversed version of the awake to NREM transition, where [HbT], LFP, and EMG signals all quickly return to baseline values as the animal wakes up. During the transition from rfc-NREM to rfc-REM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) there was a slow increase in total hemoglobin from 45 ÂµM up to 75 ÂµM. During the NREM-REM transition, the muscles become atonic and the EMG power decreased even more. The theta band [4â10 Hz] power in the hippocampal LFP increased by approximately 300%. The transition from rfc-REM into the rfc-Awake state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) was the largest in terms of the magnitude of the total hemoglobin change, as the large blood volume increase seen during REM rapidly reverses (within seconds) as the animal wakes up.

To see if these relationships held true for neurovascular coupling in other arousal states, we looked at the relationship between the power in different frequency bands of the LFP or multi-unit activity and â[HbT] during periods of contiguous NREM and REM sleep. Correlations between the MUA and â[HbT] as well as the LFP and â[HbT] during awake rest showed a peak correlation of 0.24Â Â±Â 0.06 for the MUA and 0.16Â Â±Â 0.04 for the gamma band, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Winder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>).

During NREM, there were similar dynamics in the lag of the hemodynamic response to the MUA as during awake rest (1.28Â Â±Â 0.11 s, GLME, p&lt;0.08) and for the gamma band power (1.26Â Â±Â 0.12 s, GLME, p&lt;0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

However, the distribution of correlations across frequencies differed across states. In addition to a highly correlated gamma band, the correlations during contiguous NREM extended down into the beta band [13â30 Hz]. These results show that the correlation between neural activity and cerebral blood volume change markedly across states, though the hemodynamic lag differences are of order a few hundred milliseconds. We found weak to negative correlations for frequencies below 30 Hz in the awake state and during contiguous REM. In contrast, there were strong positive correlations between lower frequencies of LFP power and the [HbT] in contiguous NREM sleep. This suggests that the positive correlations between lower frequencies of the LFP and vasodilation seen in some studies may be due to the inclusion of NREM sleep in the âresting-stateâ.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Neurovascular coupling is strongest during NREM sleep.</title><p>Cross-correlation between neural activity and changes in total hemoglobin â[HbT] during different arousal states, averaged across hemispheres.

The power in the gamma band envelope at 0.1 Hz was substantially higher during sleep (awake rest: 0.9Â Â±Â 0.1; contiguous NREM sleep: 13.3Â Â±Â 37.4, GLME, p&lt;0.01; contiguous REM Sleep: 12.8Â Â±Â 23.4, GLME, p&lt;0.02). All power normalized by the peak in the power spectrum during rest.

The correlation between the left and right hemisphere â[HbT] was 0.74Â Â±Â 0.06 during the awake resting condition. They were elevated during awake whisking 2â5 s in duration (0.82Â Â±Â 0.09, GLME, p&lt;4.8Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â8</sup>), during periods of contiguous NREM (0.9Â Â±Â 0.03, GLME, p&lt;9.8Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â20</sup>) and contiguous REM (0.91Â Â±Â 0.03, GLME, p&lt;1.4Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â21</sup>). These correlations, however, were not fully explained by the correlations in underlying neural activity, which were much lower. This may be explained by a lower signal-to-noise ratio for neural signals. The correlation coefficients for the envelope of bilateral gamma band power [30â100 Hz] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>) were relatively small during rest (0.16Â Â±Â 0.07), and were not significantly elevated during awake whisking (0.15Â Â±Â 0.05, GLME, p&lt;0.47) or during contiguous REM sleep (0.21Â Â±Â 0.13, GLME, p&lt;0.11). However, correlations in gamma band power doubled during contiguous NREM sleep (0.3Â Â±Â 0.12, GLME, p&lt;6.6Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â7</sup>). Analysis of the cross-hemisphere delta band [1â4 Hz], theta band [4â10 Hz], alpha band [10â13 Hz], and beta band [13â30 Hz] power showed similar trends as the gamma band, with elevated power, MoC2, and Pearsonâs correlations during contiguous NREM/REM sleep compared to awake rest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The exception was the delta band, where the sleeping MoC2 and Pearsonâs correlations were not statistically different than those during rest. These results show large changes in gamma band power during sleep, but relatively low cross-hemisphere correlations in neural activity. In contrast, the correlation coefficients for the left and right â[HbT] were uniformly high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), and significantly elevated by awake whisking.

Using only [HbT], the strength of the coupling between spontaneous neural activity and changes in blood volume is relevant to resting-state fMRI.

Coherence at lower frequencies was highest in contiguous NREM sleep and for all data, and lowest during awake rest and during contiguous REM sleep. It may seem puzzling that the coherence is higher when taking all the data together than for any individual subset, but this can be explained by a restriction of range effect when grouping by arousal state. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, we show the â[HbT] versus the power in the gamma band for all of our ârfcâ data including stimulation. When all the data is considered together, it is clear that there was a robust relationship between neural activity and blood volume. However, as the level of neural activity and [HbT] were different across the arousal states, within any given state this relationship may not be so strong, again due to a restriction of range effect. All in all, we would like to emphasize the observation that correlations between ongoing neural activity and hemodynamic signals appear to be lowest during the awake state and highest during sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>) and is most prominent in the lower frequencies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using optical imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed mice, we found that sleep was associated with large increases in blood volume and arterial dilation in the somatosensory cortex. These vasodilations and increases in cerebral blood volume were very large, up to five times the size of those evoked by sensory stimulation or fidgeting behaviors like whisking. We found that the correlation and coherence between neural activity and blood volume were substantially stronger during NREM sleep than during any other arousal state, as were bilateral correlations and coherency. Because, at least under our imaging conditions, mice frequently and rapidly enter into sleep, the hemodynamic signals due to sleep will dominate over any awake signals due to the very large changes in neural activity and blood volume in the sleeping cortex. The net effect is that, without careful monitoring of arousal state, sleep-related hemodynamics and neural activity will dominate any âresting-stateâ study in the un-anesthetized mouse.</p><p>We note that care should be taken in interpreting these results. The sleep patterns and depth may be altered by head-fixation. We only imaged cortical blood volume changes, and other areas of the brain may have different patterns of vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Townsend et al., 1973</xref>). We used electrophysiology to assay neural activity as it is used in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>), and calcium indicators buffer intracellular calcium, can cause epilepsy, and do not report the majority of spikes even under optimal imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McMahon and Jackson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Theis et al., 2016</xref>). The activity of interneurons that express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) can drive vasodilation without causing detectable changes in the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Echagarruga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krawchuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), so the overall neural activity captured in the LFP may not reflect the activity of neurons that drive hemodynamic responses. We note there may be a difference in sleep-state identification with local LFP recordings when compared with conventional EEG, which sum electrical signals over a larger area. Previous studies in rats have shown discrete regions of cortex going into periods of âlocalized sleepâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</xref>), and in some cases, slow-wave oscillations can be seen during REM sleep in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Funk et al., 2016</xref>), either of which may reduce the accuracy of our arousal state classifications. We noted no arousal state discrepancies between left and right somatosensory cortices during manual sleep scoring, however, this does not exclude localized sleep in other cortical regions. The spatial resolution of IOS and our electrodes are of order 100 Âµm, and any vascular or neural changes on smaller spatial scales would be âblurredâ, potentially resulting in lower estimates of neurovascular coupling strength. Additionally, as hemoglobin is the major absorber of both visible and infrared light in the brain, and changes in the level of hemoglobin can cause decreases in florescence signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), sleep-related vasodilations attenuate signals from calcium indicators in neurons when visualized with either 1- or 2-photon methods. As there are multiple pathways by which neurons (and astrocytes) communicate with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drew, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iadecola, 2017</xref>), it is likely that multiple mechanisms underly the vasodilation we observed during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ãzbay et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>There are several implications for our work. First, it shows that it is critical to monitor arousal state, particularly in head-fixed mice, as they frequently fall asleep. Arousal state cannot be detected by simple monitoring of the face/eyes, as mice can sleep with their eyes open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">YÃ¼zgeÃ§ et al., 2018</xref>), and thus requires additional methods such as a combination of EMG/LFP/whisker tracking. If an animal falls asleep, this will result in larger neurovascular and bilateral correlations than in the awake state. There has been some disagreement as to how well hemodynamic signals track neural activity in the absence of any sensory stimulation (the âresting-stateâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drew et al., 2020</xref>). With a few exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Winder et al., 2017</xref>), these studies did not carefully monitor arousal state, and it could be that studies finding higher neurovascular correlations have episodes of sleep in them. Similar issues have been noted for human resting-state fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>) and with non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2016</xref>), so this is likely a ubiquitous problem with any experiment where the subject is unmotivated to stay awake. On a more fundamental level, these results show that the vasodilation seen in the awake brain is smaller than the hemodynamic changes seen during sleep. This vasodilation during sleep may serve to circulate cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldea et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fultz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kedarasetti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van Veluw et al., 2020</xref>) or some other physiological role.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Strain: C57BL6/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Fluorescein isothiocyanateâdextran 150 kDa</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Stock No: FD150S</td><td>100 ÂµL, 5% (weight/volume)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Data analysis software</td><td>MathWorks</td><td>MATLAB 2019a</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/KL-Turner/Turner_Gheres_Proctor_Drew_eLife2020">https://github.com/KL-Turner/Turner_Gheres_Proctor_Drew_eLife2020</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Turner et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>IOS and 2PLSM data acquisition software</td><td>National Instruments</td><td>LabVIEW 2018</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DrewLab/LabVIEW-DAQ">https://github.com/DrewLab/LabVIEW-DAQ</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Drew, 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>2PLSM data acquisition software</td><td>Sutter Instrument</td><td>MSCAN 2015</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>PFA-coated tungsten microwires</td><td>A-M Systems</td><td>Stock No: #795500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>PFA-coated 7-strand stainless-steel microwires</td><td>A-M Systems</td><td>Stock No: #793200</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The model consisted of a âbaggingâ (bootstrap aggregation) of 128 decision trees where each tree is grown with an independent bootstrapped replica of the input data (MATLAB function(s): TreeBagger). 128 trees were chosen as sufficient where the out-of-bag-error asymptotes as a function of the number of total trees. The model used the largest mean cortical LFP power from the two hemispheres in the delta band power [1â4 Hz], beta band power [13â30 Hz], and gamma band power [30â99 Hz]. The mean hippocampal theta band power [4â10 Hz], the mean normalized EMG power, the mean heart rate, and the total number of binarized whisking events were also included. To train the random forest classification models, all of the data from the first (session 1) and last (session 6) was manually scored 5 s at a time as either rfc-Awake, rfc-NREM, or rfc-REM based on the known behavioral and electrophysiology characteristics of the various sleep states. For example, an increase in cortical delta band power with a low heart rate and little whisker motion is associated with NREM sleep, while an increase in hippocampal theta band power with a low EMG muscle tone is associated with REM sleep. Half of the manually scored data (1/6 of the total amount) was used to train the random forest classification model, with the other half being used to further validate the modelâs accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The rfc-Awake class from the random forest classification model will include all awake resting data, whisking behavior, as well as all of the âdrowsyâ data where the animals was transitioning between states that did not clearly fall into the NREM or REM categories. For these reasons, quantifications of awake rest, awake whisking, and awake stimulation were taken from manually verified periods of wakefulness (a subset of rfc-Awake) to reduce contamination.</p><p>For data to be classified as either a contiguous NREM or REM sleep epoch, it requires 6 consecutive 5 s bins (30 s) for contiguous NREM or 12 consecutive 5 s bins (60 s) for contiguous REM. This filter ensures that only very clear NREM and REM sleep events make it into the final data sets that are used in the relevant analysis. It also provides a minimum length for each event for analysis that require for all data to be the same length (such as cross-correlations, coherence, and power spectra). To prevent REM events of several minutes in duration from occasionally being broken up into multiple separate events, up to 10 s of data in-between rfc-REM classifications were linked after model scoring. While the majority of contiguous NREM/REM epochs occurred in the absence of whisker stimulation, the epochs that did occur in the presence of whisker stimulation were excluded from these contiguous sleep categories. As the total duration of the 2-photon data was substantially less than that of IOS experiments, it was all manually scored. In our experience, the mice tended to sleep less during 2-photon imaging than during IOS, likely because of the high-frequency noise from the scan mirrors and the lack of illumination (mice are nocturnal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peirson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pilorz et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Sleep model accuracy validation</title><p>The out-of-bag error during random forest classification model training provides an initial estimate on the modelâs classification accuracy, where <italic>out-of-bag</italic> refers to the mean classification error using training data from the trees that do not contain the data in their bootstrap sample (MATLAB function(s): oobError).

Error bars show the standard deviation (nÂ =Â 14 mice, 28 hemispheres for IOS, nÂ =Â 6 mice for 2PLSM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Pearsonâs correlation coefficients during different arousal states</title><p>The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient between bilateral cortical changes in total hemoglobin, bilateral envelopes of each discrete LFP band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) during each arousal state was taken during awake resting events (â¥10 s), awake whisking events (2â5 s in duration), contiguous NREM sleep events (â¥30 s), contiguous REM sleep events (â¥60 s), alert data (15 min), asleep data (15 min), and all data (15 min). Awake resting and whisking events occurred at least 5 s after a whisker stimulus, with the correlation value of the whisking behavior taken between the initiation of the whisk to 5 s later. All resting events and whisking events occurred within the manually defined <italic>true awake</italic> periods outlined previously in the <italic>Establishment of awake rest and baseline</italic> section. All arousal state events for each bilateral data type were mean-subtracted and digitally lowpass filtered (&lt;1 Hz) with a fourth-order Butterworth filter (MATLAB function(s): butter, zp2sos, filtfilt) and then take the Pearsonâs correlation coefficient (MATLAB function(s): corrcoef) within each time series. All correlation coefficients for each bilateral data type during each arousal state were then averaged within animals and then averaged across animals. Error bars show the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Probability of sleep as a function of hemodynamics</title><p>The probability of an arousal state classification with respect to [HbT] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) or arteriole diameter (âD/D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) was determined by taking the mean of each 5 s epoch and binning the value into a histogram (1 Î¼M â[HbT] or 1% âD/D). Each of the three arousal state classifications (rfc-Awake, rfc-NREM, rfc-REM for IOS, manual versions for 2PLSM) corresponding to each bin was summed over the total number of counts per bin to create a probability curve. Each curve was then smoothed with a 10-point median filter (MATLAB function(s): medfilt1). All 5 s bins were weighted equally with no grouping or averaging within animals (nÂ =Â 14 mice, 28 hemispheres for IOS, nÂ =Â 6 mice for 2PLSM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>[HbT]-Gamma relationship</title><p>The mean gamma band power (âP/P) and â[HbT] in each cortical hemisphere during each arousal state classification (rfc-Awake, rfc-NREM, rfc-REM) was taken from all IOS animals. A 2D histogram (MATLAB function(s): histogram2) was made comparing the mean gamma band power (âP/P) vs. the mean â[HbT] of each individual classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) to highlight the clusters of each arousal state class.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical comparisons were evaluated using generalized linear mixed-effects models (MATLAB function(s): fitglme). The arousal state was treated as a fixed effect, the mouse identity as a random effect, and mouse identity:hemisphere/arteriole combination treated as an interaction. For example, the formula for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: 'HbTÂ ~1 + ArousalState + (1|Mouse) + (1|Mouse:Hemisphere)' evaluates the mean changes in [HbT] (nÂ =Â 14 mice, 28 hemispheres) of each arousal state (fixed effects) with the mouse (random effect) and an interaction between the mouse and hemisphere (left vs. right hemispheres are not fully independent). Each arousal state was compared to either the ârfc-Awakeâ, âawake restâ, or âalertâ condition as the intercept term, depending on the analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank X Liu, A Shih, A Winder, and N Zhang for comments and discussion on the manuscript and F Bahari for advice on electromyography.

to reveal how vascular dynamics and neurovascular coupling are modulated across arousal states. During sleep, cerebral blood flow and its correlation with neuronal activity increase at much higher levels than during wakefulness and sensory stimulation. This study stresses out the importance of carefully monitoring brain states when measuring cerebral blood flow in relation to behaviour and sensory processing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neurovascular coupling and bilateral connectivity during NREM and REM sleep&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Aniruddha Das (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The present study reports important findings which shed new light on the physiological basis of brain hemodynamic response. The authors address how hemodynamic measurements are affected by arousal states. Specifically, they show that sleep cycles moving between wakefulness and different sleep stages lead to changes in hemodynamic measurements that are much higher, sometime many-fold, relative to the changes driven by sensory stimulation. These results will be of great interest for researchers in the field of sleep and arousal, neurovascular coupling, fMRI, and the large community of systems neuroscientists performing head-fixed experiments. All three reviewers have expressed enthusiasm about the quality of the study and have, overall, only minor comments regarding the manuscript.</p><p>1) Mouse NREM sleep is usually assessed via a more global measure, e.g. EEG, rather than stereotrodes. The use of LFP based measures opens the possibility of detecting local arousal states in awake animals (e.g. Vyazovskiy et al., 2011). The authors should comment on how this may affect their results.</p><p>2) The authors should justify why different segment durations were used to quantify wake, NREM, and REM hemodynamics (10 s, 30 s, 60 s) in the &quot;Cortical hemodynamic signals increase during NREM and REM sleep.&quot;</p><p>3) Figure 6 lacks accompanying statistics in the text.</p><p>4) The authors should clarify how they computed average LFP power in Figure 7A of LFP power.</p><p>5) Some of the statements about the weakness of neurovascular coupling in the awake state seem overstated, as there can be robust local coupling in the awake state that is not spatially coherent enough to lead to an easily detected correlation with a relatively macroscopic signal such as the 1mm (HbT). The authors should perhaps tone down these statements or justify more clearly their conclusion.</p><p>6) The sentence in subsection âSleep drives larger fluctuations than awake behaviorsâ regarding hemodynamic measurements should be clarified.</p><p>7) Previous works on the topic should be properly cited and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62071.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The present study reports important findings which shed new light on the physiological basis of brain hemodynamic response.
