Recent studies revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory. Thus, the caudal prelimbic area (PL), rostral part of the anterior cingulate area (ACA), medial visual area (VISm), and the ventral part of retrosplenial area (RSPv) form a highly interconnected circuit that presents a differential increase in Fos expression in response to predator exposure. Cytotoxic lesions of the elements of this cortical circuit apparently had no impact on innate fear responses during predator exposure but had a profound impact on contextual fear memory largely disrupting learned contextual fear responses in a predator-related environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Andrade Rufino et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The ACA occupies a central position in this cortical network and establishes dense bidirectional connections with all other elements of the circuit. Importantly, lesions in the ACA had a larger impact on decreasing learned contextual fear responses versus lesions of the other elements of this cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Andrade Rufino et al., 2019</xref>). However, at this point, it is not clear how the ACA is involved in processing predator-related fear memory.</p><p>Previous studies in the literature using fear conditioning to physically aversive stimuli (i.e., footshock) reported important roles for the ACA in fear memory. The ACA seems to be necessary for the acquisition of contextual fear. Pretraining inactivation of the ACA blocked fear acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissière et al., 2008</xref>), and pretraining activation of the ACA using a mGluR agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissière et al., 2008</xref>) enhanced fear learning thus suggesting an involvement of the ACA in the acquisition of fear responses.</p><p>Of relevance, the insertion of an empty temporal gap, or trace, between the CS and UCS makes learning the association critically dependent on the prefrontal cortex. Recording studies in trace fear conditioning revealed units called “bridging cells” in the prefrontal cortex that maintain firing during the trace intervals, perhaps reflecting the maintenance of attentional resources during the CS-USC interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmartin et al., 2014</xref>). These findings from trace fear conditioning suggest that the prefrontal cortex strengthens the predictive value of the available cue to influence memory storage. The ACA is also required for memory consolidation. Infusion of the protein-synthesis inhibitor anisomycin in the ACA impairs memory consolidation of recent and remote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Einarsson and Nader, 2012</xref>), and virally mediated disruption of learning-induced dendritic spine growth in the ACA impairs memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vetere et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, the ACA has been largely associated with the encoding and retrieval of contextual fear memory at remote time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined how that ACA mediates predator fear memory. To this end, we exposed mice to cats and investigated innate and contextual fear responses. We started by asking whether the ACA is involved in the acquisition and/or expression of predator fear memory and applied pharmacogenetic silencing in the ACA during exposure to the predator or to the context. Next, combining retrograde tracing and Fos protein immunostaining, we examined the pattern of activation of ACA source of inputs during acquisition and expression of predator fear responses. We could see how the ACA would be able to combine predator and contextual cues particularly during the acquisition phase. To complement these findings, during the cat exposure, we applied optogenetic inhibition to the anteromedial thalamic nucleus&gt;ACA path, which putatively relays information related to the predator cues, and examined the effect on the acquisition of predator fear memory.</p><p>Next, using optogenetic silencing and functional tracing combining Fluoro Gold and Fos immunostaining, we examined how the ACA entrains selected targets to influence acquisition or expression of predator fear memory. The data help to clarify how the ACA influences both the acquisition and expression of predator fear memory. Overall, the ACA offers predictive relationships between the threatening stimuli and the context to influence memory storage in amygdalar and hippocampal circuits. It also has a role in memory retrieval and the expression of contextual fear. Our results open interesting perspectives for understanding how the ACA is involved in processing contextual fear memory to predator threats as well as other ethologic threatening conditions such as those seen in the confrontation with a conspecific aggressor during social disputes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ACA is involved in both the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to predator threat</title><p>To specifically evaluate the contribution of the ACA in the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to a predatory threat, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) to selectively silence the activity of the ACA during the cat exposure and during the exposure to the predatory context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We examined how the ACA entrains selective targets to influence the acquisition or expression of predator fear memory. Among the ACA targets, we start by exploring projections to the BLA and the perirhinal area—these are key targets for the prefrontal cortex to influence associative plasticity and memory storage in the amygdala and hippocampus (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmartin et al., 2014</xref>). Next, we examined the ACA projection to the postsubiculum (POST), which has a large influence on the medial performant path, and conceivably in the memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding, 2013</xref>). Finally, we explored the projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal because studies have shown its putative roles both in the acquisition and the expression of contextual fear memory to predator threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cezario et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Andrade Rufino et al., 2019</xref>); therefore, a likely ACA target to influence such responses.

This suggests a larger engagement of the ACA cells projecting to the PAGdl during the expression compared to the acquisition of contextual fear responses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Combining the use of pharmaco- and optogenetic circuit manipulation tools and functional tracing, we untangled the ACA role in processing contextual fear memory to a predator threat.</p><p>To test the acquisition and expression of predator contextual fear responses, we used a two-phase paradigm composed of cat exposure (acquisition phase), and, on the following day, exposure to the context where the predator had been previously encountered (expression phase) (see Appendix – Behavioral Protocol). Notably, the defensive responses in mice differ somewhat from those seen in rats exposed to cats and then to the predator-associated context. During cat exposure, rats spend close to 90% of the time freezing and 2% of the time risk assessing the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>; mice froze for approximately 30% of the time and risk assessed the environment for close to 30% of the time (see Appendix – Behavioral Protocol). During exposure to the predatory context, rats only froze a little and then spent time risk assessing the predator-related context for 70% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>), which is different from mice that presented no freezing and a relatively weaker risk assessment response—close to 50% of the time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>To uncover whether the ACA response is specific to threat and threat paired context, we examined the ACA activity in four different conditions: exposure to the cat, the cat-related context, the novel non-threat stimulus (plush cat), and the context paired with non-threat stimulus (see Appendix – Comparison of ACA activity). This analysis revealed that ACA Fos expression in response to the cat and cat-related context was significantly higher relative to its expression level in response to exposure to a novel non-threat stimulus and to the context paired with a non-threat stimulus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacogenetic inhibition of the ACA during cat exposure did not change innate responses but significantly reduced contextual fear responses. This suggests that the ACA is involved in the acquisition of predator-related contextual fear responses. In line with these results, studies using fear conditioning to physically aversive stimuli (i.e., foot shock) have also supported the idea that the ACA appears to be necessary for the acquisition of contextual fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissière et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our functional tracing analysis combining retrograde tracer in the ACA and Fos immunostaining revealed that the ACA is particularly influenced by afferent sources of inputs conveying contextual information and predator cues during the acquisition phase. Among the cortical inputs, the ventral retrosplenial (RSPv) and medial visual (VISm) areas presented the largest percentage of FG retrogradely labeled cells expressing Fos (around 50% of the retrogradely labeled cells). The retrosplenial cortex is critical for the recognition of an environment directly paired with an aversive event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies using two-photon imaging revealed that landmark cues served as dominant reference points and anchored in the retrosplenial cortex the spatial code, which is the result of local integration of visual, motor, and spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>). The VISm is necessary for the visuospatial discrimination used in the integration of allocentric visuospatial cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sánchez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Espinoza et al., 1999</xref>) and may as well be involved in integrating contextual cues. Therefore, the results suggest that cortical fields projecting to the ACA particularly active during the acquisition phase of predator fear memory are involved in computing contextual landmarks.</p><p>In the thalamus, our functional tracing revealed that the CL and AMv nuclei contained more than 50% of the FG retrogradely labeled cells expressing Fos during the acquisition phase of predator fear memory. Both the CL and AMv are likely to convey information regarding the predatory threat. The CL receives projections from the dorsal part of the periaqueductal gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kincheski et al., 2012</xref>), and the AMv receives substantial inputs from the dorsal premammillary nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canteras and Swanson, 1992</xref>). The dorsal premammillary nucleus is part of the predator-responsive circuit of the medial hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>) and is the most responsive site to a live predator or its odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cezario et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dielenberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In order to test whether the information relayed through the projection from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AM) to the ACA influences the acquisition of predator fear memory, we silenced the AM&gt;ACA pathway during cat exposure. Photoinhibition of the AM&gt;ACA projection during cat exposure did not change innate fear responses but significantly reduced contextual fear responses. This suggests that silencing the AM&gt;ACA projection impairs the acquisition of contextual fear response to a predator threat. In line with this result, studies from our group have shown that pharmacological inactivation of the AM drastically reduced the acquisition but not the expression of contextual fear responses to predator threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lima et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the AM&gt;ACA pathway does not seem involved in the expression of contextual fear. It is noteworthy that anterior thalamic lesions slow down the acquisition of contextual fear conditioning but do not affect contextual fear memory tested in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marchand et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our findings collectively support the idea that the ACA integrates contextual and predator cues during the acquisition phase to provide predictive relationships between the context and the threatening stimuli and influence memory storage. The ventral hippocampus and BLA appear as critical sites for memory storage of contextual fear to predator threats. Ventral hippocampal cytotoxic lesions significantly reduced conditioned defensive behaviors during re-exposure to the predator-associated context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pentkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, cytotoxic NMDA lesions in the BLA impaired contextual fear responses to predator threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bindi et al., 2018</xref>). In line with these ideas, recent findings from our lab indicate that cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) injection in the BLA or the ventral hippocampus impairs contextual fear responses to predatory threat (F. Reis and N.S. Canteras personal observations). Therefore, we investigated how the ACA would facilitate associative plasticity and memory storage in the BLA and hippocampus. To this end, we used optogenetic silencing and functional tracing combining Fluoro Gold and Fos immunostaining to examine how the ACA entrains selective targets to influence acquisition or expression of predator fear memory.</p><p>Among the ACA targets, we start by exploring projections to the BLA and the perirhinal region (PERI). Previous model of the prefrontal regulation of memory formation suggests that the prefrontal cortex is likely to influence memory storage in the amygdala and hippocampus using two branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmartin et al., 2014</xref>). One direct branch is to the BLA and conveys information about the predictive value of the relevant clues during learning. The other branch is to the perirhinal cortices, which occupies a strategic position in this network influencing both the hippocampus and the amygdala. Tract-tracing studies revealed that the PERI provides dense projections to the BLA and the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi and Cassell, 1999</xref>). Photoinhibition of both ACA&gt;BLA and ACA&gt;PERI pathways during cat exposure significantly reduced contextual fear responses thus suggesting a role in the acquisition of predator fear memory. In contrast, photoinhibition of both pathways did not influence the expression of contextual fear memory. Corroborating these findings, our functional tracing revealed that both ACA&gt;BLA and ACA&gt;PERI paths are significantly more active during the acquisition compared to the expression of predator contextual fear memory. Triple retrograde tracing experiments revealed that the ACA cells projecting to the BLA and the PERI were mostly found in the supragranular layers (layers II and III), and close to 50% of these cells provided a branched projection to the BLA and PERI (see in the Appendix, Triple retrograde tracing and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The POST in turn is necessary for normal acquisition of contextual and auditory fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robinson and Bucci, 2012</xref>). Thus, we tested the ACA&gt;POST pathway as a putative candidate to influence predator fear memory. However, the ACA&gt;POST pathway’s photoinhibition did not impair either the acquisition or the expression of contextual fear memory. Notably, we showed that the position of the optic fibers was consistent across these experiments and suitable to silence the ACA&gt;POST pathway. In favor of the lack of effect of the ACA&gt;POST pathway, our functional tracing examined the percentage of Fos positive cells in the ACA projecting to the POST and revealed a relatively low percentage of double-labeled cells both in the acquisition and the expression of predatory contextual fear memory. Moreover, among the ACA paths that received optogenetic silencing in the present investigation, we noted that the ACA&gt;POST projection presented the smallest density of terminals (see in the Appendix, Quantification of ACA terminal fields and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacogenetic inhibition of the ACA during the exposure to the predatory context significantly reduced contextual fear responses. This result further suggests that the ACA is also involved in the expression of predator-related contextual fear responses. Exposure to the predatory context yielded a different activation pattern among the sources of inputs to the ACA compared to those seen during cat exposure. Unfortunately, our functional tracing does not offer any plausible hint regarding the putative source of inputs to the ACA driving retrieval of memory traces to influence contextual fear expression. In this regard, we note that the ACA is involved in the consolidation of contextual fear conditioning to physically aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Einarsson and Nader, 2012</xref>). Future work could investigate whether the ACA is also involved in the consolidation of contextual fear memory to predator threat and how this consolidation would influence the retrieval predator fear memory in the ACA.</p><p>The dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (PAGdl) appears to be a likely ACA target to influence the expression of contextual fear responses to predator threats. Exposure to the predatory context yields a significant Fos expression in the dorsal PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cezario et al., 2008</xref>)—a region where electrical, pharmacological, and optogenetic stimulation have been shown to produce freezing, flight, and risk assessment behavior in the absence of a predatory threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittencourt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). The present findings showed that photoinhibition of the ACA&gt;PAGdl pathway during cat exposure did not change innate or contextual fear responses. Conversely, photoinhibition of the ACA&gt;PAGdl projection during predatory context altered contextual fear responses. In line with these findings, the functional tracing revealed that the ACA contained a significantly larger proportion of double-labeled Fos/FG cells for the PAGdl FG injected animals in response to the context versus the cat exposure. Collectively, our findings revealed that the ACA&gt;PAGdl pathway is significantly more active during exposure to the predatory context and influences the expression of contextual fear to predator threat. Triple retrograde tracing experiments revealed that ACA cells projecting to the PAGdl are in the infragranular layers (layers V and VI) and do not overlap with the cells projecting to the BLA or PERI (see in the Appendix, Triple retrograde tracing and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that all ACA paths involved in the acquisition or expression of contextual fear responses were differentially activated between acquisition and expression of fear memory and are unlikely to provide a condition to produce a state-dependent effect on contextual fear memory. However, regardless of endogenous activity patterns, there is a hypothetical possibility of a disruptive effect if memory is encoded in the absence of a given pathway and tested in its presence. In this case, it is important to bear in mind that as much as the optogenetic silencing of a given pathway is effective, it is unlikely to provide a complete inactivation of the entire pathway.</p><p>Overall, the ACA can provide predictive relationships between the context and the predator threat and influences fear memory acquisition through projections to the BLA and PERI and the expression of contextual fear through projections to the PAGdl. These findings may be applied in more general terms to understand memory processing of fear threats entraining hypothalamic circuits (i.e., such as the predator- and conspecific-responsive circuits underlying predatory and social threats, respectively) that engage the AMv&gt;ACA pathway (Gross and Canteras, 2019). Notably, both the predator- and conspecific-responsive hypothalamic circuits comprise the dorsal premammillary nucleus that projects densely to the AMv nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canteras and Swanson, 1992</xref>), and therefore, engage the AMv&gt;ACA pathway. Of relevance, previous studies showed that the anteromedial thalamus' cytotoxic lesions impair contextual fear in a social defeat-associated context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rangel et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the present results open interesting perspectives for understanding how the ACA is involved in processing contextual fear memory to predator threats as well as other ethologic threatening conditions such as those seen in confrontation with a conspecific aggressor during social disputes.</p><p>We observed that male and female mice present similar defensive responses during exposure to the predator or predatory context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Here, it is important to note that regardless of similar innate and contextual fear responses seen in males and females, the underlying circuits are not necessarily the same. In fact, in the literate, there is a lack of investigation on the neural circuits mediating anti-predatory responses in female rodents, and this is certainly a limitation of the present investigation. A recent study carried out in male and female mice examining the role of the dorsal premammillary nucleus—a key element of the hypothalamic predator-responsive circuit—on coordination of anti-predatory responses did not report differences between sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, sex differences are expected in terms of the responsivity of elements of defensive circuits, especially considering that critical sites in these circuits, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, are responsive to gonadal steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simerly et al., 1990</xref>). At this point, further studies are needed to investigate sex differences in the circuits mediating contextual fear memory to predatory threats.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

present study. The mice were obtained from local breeding facilities and were kept individually housed under controlled temperature (23°C) and illumination (12 hr cycle) in the animal quarters with free access to water and a standard laboratory diet. All experiments and conditions of animal housing were carried out under institutional guidelines (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal [COBEA]) and were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23, 1996). All of the experimental procedures had been previously approved by the Committee on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil (Protocol No. 085/2012).

The anesthesia was maintained with 1–2% Isoforine/oxygen mix and body temperature was controlled with a heating pad. Viral vectors were injected with a 5-µl Hamilton Syringe (Neuros Model 7000.5 KH). Injections were delivered at a rate of 5 nl/min using a motorized pump (Harvard Apparatus). The needle was left in place for 5 min after each injection to minimize upward flow of viral solution after raising the needle. For the photoinhibition experiments, immediately after the viral injections, optical fibers (Mono Fiber-optic Cannulae 200/230-0.48, Doric Lenses Inc, Quebec, Canada) were implanted and fixed onto animal skulls with dental resin and micro screws (DuraLay, IL). The animals were allowed 1 week to recover from the surgery, and 3 weeks later, we started the behavioral experiments.</p><p>For the pharmacogenetic inhibition, ACA was injected bilaterally with 150 nl of AAV5-hSyn-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine (Dr. Bryan Roth; Addgene plasmid #50464) or AAV5-hSyn-eGFP (titer≥7×10¹² vg/ml; Addgene viral prep #50465-AAV5) as control.

Resting membrane potential was measured immediately after breaking into the cell. Electrode capacitance and series resistance were monitored and compensated throughout recording; cells were held between –65 and –66 mV with injected current. Input resistance was calculated as the slope of the V-I curve using 500 ms current steps from ⫺300 to 0 pA at 50 pA steps. APs were evoked using ramp current pulses (100 ms pulses ranging from 100 to 500 pA at 100 pA steps).

The specific design varied depending on the structure of each experiment, ranging from one-way to three-way ANOVAs. Due to an expressive number of analyses performed and to maintain the overall type I error at 5%, the significance level employed in each ANOVA was adjusted downward by means of a Bonferroni’s correction (α=0.0028).

id="s8-1" sec-type="appendix"><title>Exposure to the predator and predatory context</title><p>In the present study, mice were exposed to a predator (a live cat) and tested for innate and contextual fear responses. Animals were tested in an experimental apparatus that consisted of a 25×15×30 cm<sup>3</sup> home cage (Box 1) connected to another 30×45×30 cm<sup>3</sup> chamber (Box 2) by a hallway that was 10 cm wide, 25 cm long, and 30 cm high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>, during 5 days before testing, animals were habituated to the apparatus. The relatively long habituation period seems necessary to optimally stabilize both innate and contextual defensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>). On the sixth day, a neutered 2-year-old male cat was placed and held in the Box 2 by an experimenter, and the mouse was placed into Boxes 1 and 5 min after, the Box 1 sliding door was opened, and the animals were exposed for 5 min to the cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>, Predator Exposure Test – PET Condition). Male and female mice exposed to the cat presented clear innate defensive responses, they froze for approximately 30% of the time and presented clear risk assessment responses, characterized by crouch sniff, and stretch postures toward the cat, close to 30% of the time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). After the cat was removed at the end of the 5-min period, the mouse was placed back into its home cage and the hallway and Box 2 were then cleaned with 5% alcohol and dried with paper towels. On the following day, animals were exposed to the same environment of the cat exposure during 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>, Context Condition) and, presented risk assessment responses close to 50% of the observational period, but no freezing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>), contextual fear responses to a predator threat are characterized mostly by risk assessment behaviors. In the case of mice, we observed only risk assessment with no freezing, and in rats exposed to the predatory context, it has been reported a great deal of risk assessment with a reduced amount of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>). In the present experiments, mice presented a few escape episodes during cat exposure, which occurred mostly when the mice became aware of the cat and fled back to Box 1, and only occasional escape responses during exposure to the predatory context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). An important feature of the experimental procedure used here was that the behavioral responses were very stable among the animals tested within each individual phase of the testing schedule. This feature may be, at least in part, accounted for by the long habituation period, which appears to stabilize anti-predatory behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro-Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental apparatus used for exposure to the Predator and Predatory

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dayu Lin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Methodological. Some concerns over the design were raised, some of which can be addressed through clarifications in the text, but others may require further examination/studies.</p><p>1) Inactivation at both time points would help determine if there are state-dependent effects. At minimum this requires discussion, if not additional data.</p><p>2) The presence of the experimenter during the acquisition session was a concern shared by the reviewers. It was unclear if the experimenter was present only during acquisition or also during test. If the former, was the position consistent? If the experimenter was not present during test then the authors need to rule out that the presence/absence of the experimenter from acquisition to test did not influence the performance of the mice. This would require additional experiments.</p><p>3) Having the laser on for 5 min is long and some evidence that there were no tissue damaging effects would be of value. A control for this stimulation at some timepoint between acquisition and test in the control group is also needed.</p><p>4) The efficiency of terminal inhibition using eNpHR3.0 is relatively low. Please use slice recording to confirm that the terminal inhibition can reduce spiking evoked EPSCs of postsynaptic cells and that it does not lead to rebound excitation upon laser off.</p><p>5) Additional behavioural measures such as freezing during the test and escape-like responses should be coded and presented.</p><p>6) Do the same ACA cells project to BLA, PERI, POST and PAG? It is likely that these projections originate from ACA cells at different cortical layers. The FG tracing experiment should provide some clues. Please use dual retrograde tracing to address the question.</p><p>7) For the double FG-Fos double labeled cells, please perform further statistical analysis by comparing the actual overlap with chance level overlap based on Fos% and FG%.

Was the manipulation of this pathway insufficient to obtain an effect; or is it due to the relatively weak projection? The FG+Fos data speak to this somewhat, but those data raise the question with regard to the location of the optical fibers. When there is greater overlap the position of the optical fibers may be less of a concern as it is more likely to target some of those overlapping cells, but this likelihood is decreased in the lower percentage overlap. The histological data may shed light on this issue. Please provide a quantification of the terminal fields in BLA, PERI, POST and PAG.</p><p>2) Additional controls are required for the Fos study. These include: Fos expression when the animal is exposed to a non-threat but novel stimulus; Fos expression when the animal is exposed to a novel context or a context paired with a non-threat stimulus. This will help uncover whether the ACA response is specific to threat and threat paired context.</p><p>Impact. The lack of female mice is problematic from rigor, translation, and impact perspectives.

Since all studies are following up on prior work, there is a logical flaw in using this argument to exclude females because it would prevent females from ever being included in investigations following from work conducted in males. Moreover, the topic investigated here is of high relevance to both males and females and thus inclusion of females is important for the rigor and impact of the work. The authors are asked to provide behavioural data from the task using females. These data must be carefully contrasted to those observed in males and similarities and differences in behaviour and behavioural strategies must be explored and discussed. This is the bare minimum expected. A neurobiological analysis of the effect in females, of course, would strengthen the paper in orders of magnitude. In addition, the term &quot;sex&quot; should be used in place of &quot;gender&quot; because gender is not a construct that can be examined in non-human animals.</p><p>4) The response to the ACA-POST projection question regarding whether the pathway is involved or whether it is merely a weak projection does not seem to be addressed in a way that clarifies the concern.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The anterior cingulate cortex and its role in controlling contextual fear memory to predatory threats&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In order for a given condition to produce a state-dependent effect on memory, the condition should be present during both the acquisition and the expression phases. Therefore, for a given pathway to generate a condition to produce a state-dependent effect on memory, the pathway would be expected to be activated to the same degree during both encoding and retrieval. In this case, manipulation of the activity of the pathway during either encoding or retrieval would impair memory recall. However, in our case, all pathways involved in memory acquisition or expression were differentially activated during each stage and is not expected to generate a state-dependent condition that affects memory. Thus, the pathways that affect memory encoding (i.e., the AM &gt; ACA, ACA &gt; BLA and ACA &gt; PERI pathways) were more active in the encoding rather than retrieval phase. Conversely, the pathway that influenced memory expression (i.e., the ACA &gt; PAG pathway), was more active during the retrieval than during the acquisition phase. In the revised manuscript, we clarified that all ACA paths involved in the acquisition or expression of contextual fear responses were differentially activated between acquisition and expression of fear memory and are unlikely to provide a condition to produce a state-dependent effect on contextual fear memory (see Discussion, pg. 26, lines 13 – 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The presence of the experimenter during the acquisition session was a concern shared by the reviewers.

Note that the controls for optic stimulation comprised the experimental groups injected with AAV5-hSyn-mCherry—the control groups not expressing halorhodopsin (HR; controls)—that were stimulated continuously for 5 min with a yellow laser (589 nm) during either the acquisition or the expression phases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The efficiency of terminal inhibition using eNpHR3.0 is relatively low.

Moreover, the revised manuscript clarifies that our protocol conditions yielded only occasional escape responses. Thus, only a few escape episodes were noted during cat exposure, which occurred mostly when the mice became aware of the cat and fled back to Box 1; furthermore, only occasional escape episodes were seen by the mice during exposure to the predatory context (see Appendix – Behavioral Protocol). Considering that the mice did not display any contextual freezing and only engaged in a minimal number of escape attempts, these responses were not coded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Do the same ACA cells project to BLA, PERI, POST and PAG? It is likely that these projections originate from ACA cells at different cortical layers. The FG tracing experiment should provide some clues. Please use dual retrograde tracing to address the question.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that the effects on acquisition or expression of contextual defensive responses were found in the ACA projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), perirhinal area (PERI), and dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (PAGdl), we performed triple retrograde tracing in the same animal to investigate the distribution of ACA neurons projecting to the BLA, PERI, and PAGdl. In four animals, three different retrograde tracers were ipsilaterally injected, namely, the retrograde AAV-Retro-Ef1a-mcherry- IRES-Cre, Fluoro Gold, and subunit B of the cholera toxin (CTb) in the PAGdl, BLA, and PERI, respectively (see Appendix – Triple retrograde labeling).</p><p>There is a layering pattern of the ACA neurons projecting to BLA, PERI, and PAGdl. Our analysis revealed that the ACA neurons projecting to the PAGdl are located predominantly in infragranular layers (layers V and VI; Appendix Figure 9E, G), and neurons projecting to the PERI are located predominantly in the supragranular layers (layers II and III; Appendix Figure 9F, G). The ACA neurons projecting to the BLA were found mainly in supragranular layers (layers II and III), but retrogradely labeled cells in the layer V were also occasionally found (Appendix Figure 9D, G). No double-labelling was found in the ACA &gt; PAGdl projecting neurons (Appendix Figure 9G). Conversely, 51.66% and 46.98% of the ACA cells projecting to the BLA and those projecting to the PERI, respectively, were double-labeled (Appendix Figure 9G–I). These data suggest that nearly 50% of the ACA cells provided a branched pathway to the BLA and PERI.</p><p>These results are presented in the Appendix – Triple retrograde labeling and commented on the Discussion (pg. 25, lines 1 – 4, and pg. 26, line 9 – 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the double FG-Fos double labeled cells, please perform further statistical analysis by comparing the actual overlap with chance level overlap based on Fos% and FG%. This helps understand whether there is a preferential overlap between Fos and FG.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, the observed FG/Fos immunofluorescence double-labelling was compared to chance-level overlap by calculating a double-to-chance ratio as follows: <italic>double labelling</italic> = (number of FG/Fos double-labeled cells)/(total number of DAPI-positive cells); <italic>chance level</italic> = (number of FG-labeled cells/total number of DAPI-positive cells) × (number of Fos-labeled cells/total number of DAPI-positive cells); <italic>double-to-chance ratio</italic> = <italic>double labelling/chance level</italic> (see Methods – pg. 37, lines 5 – 16). These results were incorporated into previous chi-square tests to compare the proportion of FG/Fos double-labeled cells between the cat exposure condition and the predatory context condition (see Results – pg. 13, lines 20 – 23; pg. 16, lines 1 -5; pg. 18, lines 1 – 6; pg. 20, lines 8 – 12; and Methods – pg. 37, lines 5 – 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation.</p><p>1) The lack of effect in the ACA&gt;POST pathway inhibition study is taken as evidence that this pathway is not involved. Was the manipulation of this pathway insufficient to obtain an effect; or is it due to the relatively weak projection? The FG+Fos data speak to this somewhat, but those data raise the question with regard to the location of the optical fibers. When there is greater overlap the position of the optical fibers may be less of a concern as it is more likely to target some of those overlapping cells, but this likelihood is decreased in the lower percentage overlap. The histological data may shed light on this issue. Please provide a quantification of the terminal fields in BLA, PERI, POST and PAG.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we first examined the position of the optic fibers, which was consistent across the experiments. In the revised manuscript, we illustrate the fiber optic position for 5 animals from the HR+ group that received optogenetic silencing of the ACA &gt; POST pathway during cat exposure (see Appendix Figure 10). Next, we quantified the ACA terminal fields in the BLA, PERI, PAGdl, and POST. We selected three cases that received AAV5-hSyn-eNpHR3.0-mCherry injection into the ACA, and we used the software Fiji (Image J) to measure the density of terminals in the ACA projection fields. The corrected total field fluorescence (CTFF) was estimated and revealed the densest ACA projection field in the BLA, followed by the projections to the PERI, PAGdl, and POST, which contained the weakest projections from the ACA in all cases examined (see in Appendix, Quantification of ACA terminal fields and Figure 8). Note that the functional tracing also revealed that the ACA &gt; POST pathway is weakly activated during both the acquisition and expression phase of contextual fear memory. Therefore, these observations (i.e., consistency of optic fiber position, relatively weak projection from the ACA to the POST, and low activation of this pathway during both phases of contextual fear memory) support the findings that silencing the ACA &gt; POST projections had no effect on contextual fear memory of a predatory threat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional controls are required for the Fos study. These include: Fos expression when the animal is exposed to a non-threat but novel stimulus; Fos expression when the animal is exposed to a novel context or a context paired with a non-threat stimulus. This will help uncover whether the ACA response is specific to threat and threat paired context.</p></disp-quote><p>In the ACA, DAPI and Fos quantification were performed in four conditions: exposure to the cat, the predatory context, the novel non-threat stimulus (plush cat), and the context paired with non-threat stimulus. Accordingly, approximately 44% and 28% of the neurons during exposure to the cat and cat-related context, respectively, expressed Fos protein. Conversely, Fos-labeled cells in response to exposure to the plush cat and plush cat context were approximately17% and 11%, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that ACA Fos expression in response to the cat and cat-related context was significantly higher relative to its expression level in response to exposure to a novel non-threat stimulus and to the context paired with a non-threat stimulus (see in the Appendix, Comparison of ACA activity and Figure 3; and Discussion – pg. 22, lines 18 – 24).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Impact. The lack of female mice is problematic from rigor, translation, and impact perspectives. At minimum please provide a discussion regarding the potential effect of sex on these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, all reports examining the neural pathways underlying anti-predator responses to natural threats have been carried out in male rodents (rats and mice), and the present study is a follow-up investigation to reveal core circuits implicated in contextual fear. Conceivably, and as discussed in the revised version of the manuscript, the basic circuits organizing these responses should be similar in both genders. However, gender differences are expected in terms of the responsivity of elements of these circuits, especially considering that critical sites in these circuits, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, are responsive to gonadal steroid hormones (Simerly et al., 1990). In line with this view, studies have shown higher baseline levels of anti-predator responses in female rodents (Blanchard et al. 1989, 1992). Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate gender differences in the responsivity of circuits mediating contextual fear memory to predatory threats (see Discussion – pg. 26, lines 32 – 33 and pg. 27, lines 1 – 7).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers acknowledge that the revised manuscript and the added data constitute a considerable improvement.

Considering the pathways involved in acquisition or expression of contextual fear in the present investigation, we argued that all pathways involved in memory acquisition or expression were differentially activated during each stage and they are not expected to generate a state-dependent condition that affects memory. Thus, the pathways that affect memory encoding (i.e., the AM &gt; ACA, ACA &gt; BLA and ACA &gt; PERI pathways) were more active in the encoding rather than retrieval phase. Conversely, the pathway that influenced memory expression (i.e., the ACA &gt; PAG pathway), was more active during the retrieval than during the acquisition phase. However, regardless of endogenous activity patterns, there is a hypothetical possibility of a disruptive effect if memory is encoded in the absence of a given pathway and tested in its presence. In this case, it is important to bear in mind that as much as the optogenetic silencing of a given pathway is effective, it is unlikely to provide a complete inactivation of the entire pathway (see Discussion, pg. 26, lines 15 – 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors offer a descriptive response of the other behaviours observed in their task.

For escape-like responses, as we discussed (see Appendix – Behavioral Protocol), our protocol conditions yielded only occasional escape responses. During cat exposure, most of the animals flee away from the cat as they notice its presence and present no more clear escape responses during the predator exposure test (PET). During exposure to the predatory context, the animals presented only occasional escape responses, and several animals from the control groups do not even show clear escape responses remaining most of the time risk assessing the environment (see Appendix – Behavioral Protocol). Therefore, in our experimental conditions, escape-like response is a poor index to probe defensive responses, and this is the reason why we did not include in the analysis. Nevertheless, for the sake of transparency, in the Appendix Table 2, we provide the escape responses for all behavioral experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The response to lack of sex-dependent examination was considered insufficient.

We observed that male and female mice present similar defensive responses during exposure to the predator or predatory context (Appendix Table 1). Conceivably, the basic circuits organizing these responses should be similar in both sexes. In line with this view, a recent study carried out in male and female mice examining the role of the dorsal premammillary nucleus – a key element of the hypothalamic predator-responsive circuit – on coordination of anti-predatory responses did not report differences between sexes (Wang et al., 2021). However, sex differences are expected in terms of the responsivity of elements of defensive circuits, especially considering that critical sites in these circuits, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, are responsive to gonadal steroid hormones (Simerly et al., 1990).

We believe that these are the main points that give support to our findings that the ACA &gt; POST is not involved in either the acquisition or expression of contextual fear memory. Finally, we also revealed that the ACA &gt; POST pathway was the weakest compared to the other paths shown to influence fear memory (see Discussion, pg. 25, lines 7 – 17).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The response on state-dependency did not have page numbers and lines that corresponded to appropriate text in the paper or the response in the letter did not align with the wording in the text.
