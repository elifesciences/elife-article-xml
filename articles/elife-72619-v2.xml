influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against variants. Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent severe COVID-19. Two doses of mRNA vaccine protect against serious illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. They do this, in part, by encouraging the immune system to make specialised proteins known as antibodies that recognise the virus. Most of the vaccine research so far has focussed on these antibodies, but they are only one part of the immune response. Vaccines also activate immune cells called T cells. These cells have two main roles, coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected with viruses. It is likely that they play a key role in preventing severe COVID-19.</p><p>There are many kinds of T cells, each with a different role. Currently, the identity and characteristics of the T cells that protect against COVID-19 is unclear. Different types of T cells have unique proteins on their surface. Examining these proteins can reveal details about how the T cells work, which part of the virus they recognise, and which part of the body they protect. A tool called cytometry by time of flight allows researchers to measure these proteins, one cell at a time.</p><p>Using this technique, Neidleman, Luo et al. investigated T cells from 11 people before vaccination and after their first and second doses. Five people had never had COVID-19 before, and six had already recovered from COVID-19. Neidleman, Luo et al. found that the T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the two groups differed. In people who had never had COVID-19 before, the second dose of vaccine improved the quality and quantity of the T cells. The same was not true for people who had already recovered from COVID-19. However, although their T cells did not improve further after a second vaccine dose, they did show signs that they might offer more protection overall. The proteins on the cells suggest that they might last longer, and that they might specifically protect the nose, throat and lungs. Neidleman, Luo et al. also found that, for both groups, T cells activated by vaccination responded in the same way to different variants of the virus.</p><p>This work highlights the importance of getting both vaccine doses for people who have never had COVID-19. It also suggests that vaccination in people who have had COVID-19 may generate better T cells. Larger studies could show whether these patterns remain true across the wider population. If so, it is possible that delivering vaccines to the nose or throat could boost immunity by mimicking natural infection. This might encourage T cells to make the surface proteins that allow them to home to these areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>mRNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>antigen-specific T cells</kwd><kwd>CyTOF</kwd><kwd>lymphocyte subsets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sulggi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fast Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fast Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fast Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sulggi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-elicited T cells recognize variants of concern and phenotypically differ depending on number of vaccine doses and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A year and a half since the December 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the novel betacoronavirus had already infected almost 200 million people and taken the lives of over 4 million, nearly collapsed worldwide health systems, disrupted the global economy, and perturbed society and public health on a scale not experienced within the past 100 years. Fortunately, multiple highly efficacious vaccines, including the two-dose mRNA-based ones developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which confer ~90 % protection against disease, were approved for emergency use before the end of 2020. Although the vaccines provide the most promising route for a rapid exit from the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns remain regarding the durability of the immunity elicited by these vaccines and the extent to which they will protect against the variants of SARS-CoV-2 now spreading rapidly around the world.</p><p>The first variant observed to display a survival advantage was the D614G, which was more transmissible than the original strain and quickly became the dominant variant throughout the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korber et al., 2020</xref>. This variant, fortunately, did not evade immunity and in fact appeared to be more sensitive than the original strain to antibody neutralization by convalescent sera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weissman et al., 2021</xref>. More worrisome, however, was the emergence at the end of 2020 of rapidly spreading variants in multiple parts of the world, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429 (originally identified in United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and California, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plante et al., 2021</xref>, followed by additional highly transmissible variants in 2021 including the B.1.617.2 which was first detected in India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Callaway, 2021</xref>. Some variants, including B.1.1.7, may be more virulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2021</xref>. While antibodies against the original strain elicited by either vaccination or infection generally remain potent against B.1.1.7, their activity against B.1.351 and P.1 is compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">The CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Planas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuzmina et al., 2021</xref>.

Among 280 CD4+ and 523 CD8+ T cell epitopes from the original SARS-CoV-2, an average of 91.5 % (for CD4) and 98.1 % (for CD8) mapped to regions not mutated in the B.1.1.7, B1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429 variants. Focusing on just the spike response, the sole SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the mRNA-based vaccines, then 89.7 % of the CD4+ epitopes and 96.4 % of the CD8+ epitopes are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>. In line with this, the magnitude of the response of T cells from convalescent or vaccinated individuals was not markedly reduced when assessed against any of the variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>. The relative resistance of T cells against SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion is important in light of the critical role these immune effectors play during COVID-19. T cell numbers display a strong, inverse association with disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woodruff et al., 2020</xref>, and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predicts recovery from severe disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can also provide long-term, self-renewing immunological memory: these cells are detected more than half a year into convalescence and can proliferate in response to homeostatic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>. Furthermore, the ability of individuals with inborn deficiencies in B cell responses to recover from COVID-19 without intensive care suggests that the combination of T cells and innate immune mechanisms is sufficient for recovery when antibodies are lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soresina et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>Although T cells against the ancestral strain display a response of similar magnitude and breadth to the variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>, to what extent these T cells’ phenotypes and effector functions differ during their response to variant detection is a different question. Small changes in the sequences of T cell epitopes, in the form of altered peptide ligands (APLs), can theoretically alter how the T cells respond to stimulation. Indeed, change of a single residue can convert a proliferative, IL4-secreting effector response into one that continues to produce IL4 in the absence of proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evavold and Allen, 1991</xref>. Furthermore, APLs can activate Th1 cells without inducing either proliferation or cytokine production, shift Th1 responses into Th2-focused ones, and in some instances even render T cells anergic or immunoregulatory by eliciting TGFβ production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996</xref>.</p><p>Another important aspect that has not been explored is to what extent vaccine- vs. infection-induced T cell responses differ phenotypically and functionally, and to what extent convalescent individuals benefit from vaccination as they already harbor some form of immunity against the virus. Studies based on the antibody and B cell response suggest that for COVID-19 convalescents, a single dose of the mRNA vaccines is helpful while the additional booster is not necessary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebinger et al., 2021</xref>; how this translates in the context of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity is not clear.</p><p>To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted 39-parameter phenotyping by CyTOF on 33 longitudinal specimens from 11 mRNA-vaccinated individuals, six of whom had previously contracted and recovered from COVID-19. For each participant, blood specimens were obtained prior to vaccination, two weeks following the first dose, and two weeks following the second. For every specimen, we assessed in depth the phenotypes and effector functions of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responding to the original SARS-CoV-2 spike, to spike from variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and to nucleocapsid. By conducting analyses on the resulting 165 high-dimensional datasets generated, we find a reassuringly unaltered T cell response against the variants, an ability of the booster dose to alter the phenotypes of vaccine-elicited T cells, and a striking impact of prior infection on qualitative features of T cells elicited by vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>To characterize the phenotypic features of mRNA vaccination-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, we procured 33 longitudinal blood samples from the COVID-19 Host Immune Response and Pathogenesis (CHIRP) cohort. Four of the participants had received the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine, while the remaining seven had received the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) one. For all participants, longitudinal specimens were obtained at three timepoints: prior to vaccination, ~ 2 weeks (range 13–18 days) after the first vaccine dose, and ~2 weeks (range 6–38 days) after the second dose. Five of the participants were never infected with SARS-CoV-2, while the remaining six had completely recovered from mild (non-hospitalized) COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For each participant and time point, similar numbers of cells were stimulated by exposure to the ancestral or variant spikes. This finding suggests that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells recognize ancestral and variant spike equally well, and is consistent with their recently reported ability to recognize variant strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>. The response of vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells to spike peptides was weaker, and mostly apparent only after the second dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>).

Convalescent donor PID4112 had a large frequency of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells that increased to &gt;1% of the total CD4+ T cell frequency after the first dose and then dampened after dose 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> , <italic>bottom left</italic>). PID4112 also exhibited an elevated nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cell response after the first vaccination dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>bottom left</italic>), which may have been due to bystander effects resulting from the concomitant large spike-specific response. In comparison, PID4112’s spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was low after dose 1, and boosted after dose 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic>). In contrast to PID4112, the remaining five convalescent donors exhibited an overall weak spike-specific T cell response. In fact, when comparing these five donors to the five infection-naïve donors, there was a significant decrease in the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response, while the spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was equivalent between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results were unexpected and suggest that, when excluding outlier PID4112, the magnitude of the vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cell response (after full vaccination) was lower in convalescent individuals than in infection-naïve individuals.</p><p>These assessments of the magnitude of the spike-specific T cell response together suggest that (1) in infection-naïve individuals the CD4+ T cell response is boosted by the second vaccination dose, (2) convalescent individuals exhibit a more disparate response, with most donors mounting a weaker response than infection-naïve individuals, and (3) the response is more robust among CD4+ than CD8+ T cells. As a higher number of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were available for analysis, we focused on this subset for our subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells responding to B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike are indistinguishable from those responding to ancestral spike</title><p>Leveraging our ability to not only assess the magnitude but also the detailed (39-parameter) phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells, we first determined whether the ancestral and variant spike epitopes stimulated different subsets of vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Such differences could theoretically result from the fact that ~5–10% of the spike epitopes differ between variants and ancestral strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>, and may therefore act as APLs steering responding cells towards different fates. We isolated the datasets corresponding to both post-vaccination timepoints for all eleven donors, and then exported the data corresponding to spike-specific CD4+ T cells (as defined by IFNγ production, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> ). After reducing the multidimensional single-cell data for each individual specimen to a two-dimensional datapoint through multidimensional scaling (MDS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>, we observed the ancestral spike-stimulated samples to be interspersed among the B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-responding ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then visualized the spike-specific CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level. When visualized alongside total (baseline) CD4+ T cells, spike-specific cells occupied a distinct ‘island’ defined by high expression of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting unique phenotypic features of these cells. To better analyze these spike-responding CD4+ T cells, we visualized them in isolation within a new tSNE which clearly demonstrated complete mixing of the cells stimulated by the ancestral, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 spike proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Almost all the responding cells expressed high levels of CD45RO and low levels of CD45RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting them to be mostly memory cells. These memory CD4+ T cells included central memory T cells (Tcm), T follicular helper cells (Tfh), and those expressing multiple activation markers (CD38, HLADR, CD69, CD25) and receptors known to direct cells to tissues including the respiratory tract (CXCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CD49d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The expression levels of these and all other antigens quantitated by CyTOF were not statistically different between CD4+ T cells responding to the three spike proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm the identical phenotypes of the three groups of spike-responding cells, we implemented unbiased clustering by FlowSOM. Spike-stimulated cells were clustered into eight subsets, and no subset was preferentially enriched in any one of the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data suggest that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells respond in the same manner to spike epitopes from the ancestral or variant strains, and would probably mount similar responses in vivo to infection by all three virus types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells responding to B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike have the same phenotypes as those responding to ancestral spike.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Datasets corresponding to spike-specific CD4+ T cells after vaccination were visualized as a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot.

As the data presented above suggested no phenotypic differences between CD4+ T cells responding to the ancestral, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 spike proteins, our subsequent analyses combined these datasets. We first assessed whether, among infection-naïve individuals, the phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells were different after the first and second doses. While MDS and tSNE visualizations of the data revealed that the cells from the two timepoints were somewhat interspersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>), FlowSOM clustering suggested some differences in cluster distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Direct comparison of the cluster frequencies revealed a cluster (B8) significantly enriched after the first dose, and a different cluster (B5) significantly enriched after the second dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As these two clusters differentially expressed the Tcm markers CD27 and CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we then assessed whether Tcm cells were differentially represented among spike-specific CD4+ T cells after each of the vaccination doses. Indeed, Tcm cells were significantly higher after the first dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), consistent with Cluster 8 (enriched after the first dose) expressing high levels of these two receptors. Assessment of other canonical CD4+ T cell subsets – in particular naïve (Tn), stem cell memory (Tscm), effector memory RA (Temra), effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Tfh, and regulatory T cells (Treg) – revealed Tn cells, like the Tcm subset, to be decreased after the second dose. By contrast, Ttm cells were found to be higher after the second dose, while the remaining subsets were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-H</xref>). Overall, Tcm and Tfh were the most abundant subsets among the spike-specific CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-H</xref>). These data together suggest that after receiving the second dose, infection-naïve individuals’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells increase in quantity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and alter their phenotypes as reflected by a decrease Tcm cells and an increase in Ttm cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-naïve individuals following first and second dose of vaccination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDS plot depicting samples of spike-specific CD4+ T cells in vaccinated infection-naïve individuals, showing some interspersion of the cells from the two post-vaccination timepoints.

CXCR4, the second preferentially-expressed marker among the convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells, was recently suggested to direct bystander T cells to the lung during COVID-19, and to be co-expressed with the T resident memory / activation marker CD69 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>.

The last differentially expressed antigen, CCR7, is a chemokine receptor that directs immune cells to lymph nodes. As CD62L, a selectin that also mediates lymph node homing, was also on our panel, we assessed whether CCR7+ CD62L+ cells were enriched among the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent donors, and found this to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that the convalescent donors’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells were preferentially CXCR4+ CD69+ and CCR7+ CD62L + suggested that they may preferentially migrate out of the blood into lymphoid tissues. Supporting this possibility was our observation that, after the second vaccine dose, the percentages of CCR7+ CD62L + spike-specific cells increased as the percentages of spike-specific CD4+ T cells decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that the low spike-specific CD4+ T cell response after the second dose of vaccination in some convalescent donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) may have resulted from these cells preferentially leaving the blood compartment. This was further supported by our finding that the expression levels of CCR7 and CD62L on spike-specific CD4+ T cells inversely correlated with the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). To assess whether the CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells have the potential to migrate into the nasopharynx, the most common site of SARS-CoV-2 entry, we obtained paired blood and nasal swabs from one of the participants (PID4101) and phenotyped total CD4+ T cells isolated from these specimens. There was a marked enrichment of both CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells in the intranasal specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggesting that CD4+ T cells expressing these markers preferentially exit the blood and enter the nasopharynx. Together, these data suggest that after vaccination, spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals differ from those in infection-naïve individuals in that they appear to be more long-lived, and may more readily migrate out of the blood to mucosal sites, thus explaining their overall lower frequencies measured from the blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phenotypic features of spike-specific CD8+ T cells from vaccinated, convalescent individuals are unique but differ from their CD4+ T cell counterparts</title><p>Finally, we assessed to what extent the main similarities and differences observed with spike-specific CD4+ T cells were also seen for spike-specific CD8+ T cells.

Instead, the differences appear to be due to other phenotypic changes, including elevated frequencies of activated cells in the convalescent donors, in particular those co-expressing the Tcm marker CD27 and activation marker CD38, and the checkpoint inhibitor molecule CTLA4 and activation marker 4-1BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>). These results suggest that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD8+ T cells, like their CD4+ counterparts, respond equivalently to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, and exhibit qualitative differences in convalescent individuals but via different phenotypic alterations than their CD4+ counterparts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>T cells are important orchestrators and effectors during antiviral immunity. They may hold the key to long-term memory due to their ability to persist for decades, yet these cells have been disproportionately understudied relative to their humoral immune counterparts in the context of COVID-19. Here, we designed a longitudinal study assessing both the frequency and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in order to address the following questions: (1) Do SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells elicited by vaccination respond similarly to ancestral and variant strains?; (2) To what extent is the second dose needed for boosting T cell responses in infection-naïve and convalescent individuals?; and (3) Do vaccine-elicited memory T cells differ in infection-naïve vs. convalescent individuals?</p><p>To answer the first question, we compared post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses against ancestral vs. the variant B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains.

We further demonstrate that the phenotypic features of these cells are identical, whether they are stimulated by ancestral or variant spike proteins. This was important to establish because of prior reports that effector T cells can respond differently to APLs by altering their cytokine production or by mounting an immunoregulatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evavold and Allen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996</xref>.

That both the quantity and quality of T cell responses is maintained against the variants may provide an explanation for the real-world efficacy of the vaccines against variants.

For example, in South Africa where B.1.351 is dominant, the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine only prevented ~10 % of mild-to-moderate disease cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madhi et al., 2021</xref>, while more recent data from Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine administered in Qatar, where both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are dominant, revealed that fully vaccinated individuals were 75 % less likely to develop COVID-19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2021</xref>. The overall diminished vaccine-mediated protection against milder disease in variant-dominated regions of the world might be explained by the likely important role of antibodies to prevent initial infection by blocking viral entry into host cells (manifesting as protection against asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infection), and the observation that vaccine-elicited antibodies are generally less effective against the variant than against ancestral spike in lab assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">The CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Planas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuzmina et al., 2021</xref>. Reassuringly, there is no evidence that vaccinated individuals mount a weaker immune response to variants than do unvaccinated individuals, which could theoretically result through a phenomenon termed original antigenic sin (where the recall response is inappropriately diverted to the vaccination antigen at the expense of a protective response against the infecting variant strain) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klenerman and Zinkernagel, 1998</xref>.</p><p>To address the second question of whether a booster dose is needed, we compared the T cells after the first vs. second vaccination doses, among the infection-naïve and convalescent individuals. In infection-naïve individuals, spike-specific responses were observed after the first vaccination dose, and were further boosted after the second. This enhancement of the T cell response after the second dose is similar to the reported increase in anti-spike IgG levels after a second dose in infection-naïve individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebinger et al., 2021</xref>. Interestingly, phenotypic changes were also observed after the second dose in that the B cells producing the anti-spike antibodies differentiated from IgM-dominant to IgG-dominant producers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>. We also observed some phenotypic changes among spike-specific CD4+ T cells after the second dose, as reflected by an increase in the Ttm response at the expense of the Tcm response. Importantly, however, after either dose, spike-specific CD4+ T cells were still primarily Tcm and Tfh cells, the latter of which are important for providing helper function for B cells. The prominence of SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells after just one dose of vaccination is consistent with prior reports that a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in mice is sufficient to elicit potent B and Tfh cell responses in germinal centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lederer et al., 2020</xref>. These results suggest that with regard to T cells, the booster dose is necessary for enhancing the magnitude and results in some phenotypic changes although a robust Tfh response is already established the first dose. Overall, our conclusions are in line with those drawn from serological studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebinger et al., 2021</xref>: that it is important to administer the second vaccine dose in infection-naïve individuals to boost spike-specific responses.</p><p>A different situation appears to be the case for convalescent individuals. Longitudinal serological studies suggest that the spike-specific antibody response in convalescent individuals after the first mRNA dose is already equivalent to that of infection-naïve individuals after their second mRNA dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebinger et al., 2021</xref>, suggesting that convalescent individuals may only need a single dose of vaccination. We found no evidence of increased numbers of spike-specific CD4+ T cells after the second dose, and minimal phenotypic changes between the cells at the two post-vaccination timepoints. Spike-specific CD4+ T cells from these individuals did however exhibit marked phenotypic changes as they transitioned from the pre- to the post-vaccination timepoints. This was expected since the cells from the pre-vaccination timepoint are resting memory CD4+ T cells that were primed months prior, while the post-vaccination timepoints were more recently-reactivated memory cells. Interestingly, unlike for the infection-naïve individuals where all individuals responded similarly to each dose of vaccination, the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response differed markedly between different convalescent individuals. PID4112 had a large pool of spike-specific CD4+ T cells prior to vaccination, and their numbers increased to extremely high levels after the first vaccination dose. Surprisingly, this large peak in the spike-specific response was accompanied by an increase in the nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells, which was unexpected since the vaccine does not contain nucleocapsid. We suspect this high response to nucleocapsid was due to inflammation-mediated bystander activation of T cells in an antigen-independent manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, the participant reported severe side effects (severe headache, chills, myalgia, nausea, and diarrhea) after the first dose. The remaining five convalescent donors, by contrast, never exhibited a robust T cell response, and in fact after full vaccination actually exhibited a highly significantly lower CD4+ T cell response than the infection-naïve vaccinees. We speculate on an explanation further below. Overall, our results suggest that a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may provide less benefit than in individuals who have not previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2; these findings are in line with recommendations from previously published serological studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stamatatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebinger et al., 2021</xref>.</p><p>One of the most striking observations from this study, and the third and final question we set out to answer, was the remarkably distinct phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-naïve vs. convalescent individuals who were fully vaccinated. The spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent individuals harbored features suggesting increased potential for long-term persistence: they were enriched for Tcm cells, which are have longer in vivo half-lives than their Tem and Ttm counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacchus-Souffan et al., 2021</xref>, and express elevated levels of CD127, a marker of long-lived memory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>. Interestingly, CD127 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells has been implicated in COVID-19 disease amelioration and in these cells’ long-term persistence. CD127 expression was more frequent on spike-specific CD4+ T cells from ICU patients who eventually survived severe COVID-19 than in those that did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>. IL7, the ligand for CD127, can drive homeostatic proliferation and expansion of spike-specific CD4+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>, and CD127 is not only expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but its levels increase further over the course of convalescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2021</xref>. Together, these findings suggest that after vaccination, spike-specific CD4+ T cells in convalescent individuals may persist longer than those from infection-naïve individuals, but additional long-term follow-up studies will be required to directly test whether this indeed is the case.</p><p>Another interesting characteristic of post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals relative to infection-naïve individuals was their expression of multiple tissue-homing receptors. In particular, these cells were preferentially CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+. CCR7 and CD62L mediate homing to lymph nodes, while CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor important in migration of hematopoietic stem cells to bone marrow, but also able to direct immune cells to the lung during inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mamazhakypov et al., 2021</xref>. Interestingly, we recently observed co-expression of CXCR4 with CD69 (an activation marker that also identifies T resident memory cells) in pulmonary T cells from COVID-19 patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>. Many of these cells were bystander (non-SARS-CoV-2-specific) CXCR4+ CD69+ T cells whose numbers in blood increased prior to death from COVID-19. We therefore proposed a model whereby recruitment of non-SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells into the lungs of severe patients may exacerbate the cytokine storm and thereby contribute to death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>. In the case of the vaccinated convalescent individuals, however, expression of CXCR4 and CD69 on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is expected to be beneficial as it would direct the T cells capable of recognizing infected cells into the lung. CCR7 and CD62L co-expression would further enable these cells to enter draining lymph nodes and participate in germinal center reactions. Supporting the hypothesis that the post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals may better home to lymphoid tissues is our observation that frequencies of these cells in blood correlated negatively with the extent to which they co-expressed CCR7 and CD62L. This was further supported by our finding that CD4+ T cells from the nasopharynx of the upper respiratory tract were preferentially CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ relative to their blood counterparts. All together, these results imply that compared to infection-naïve individuals, convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells may be superior in surviving and migrating to the respiratory tract. Directly testing this hypothesis will require obtaining large numbers of respiratory tract cells from vaccinated, infection-naïve vs. convalescent individuals (e.g. via bronchoalveolar lavages or endotracheal aspirates), or from animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for quantitation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Of note, vaccination of infection-naïve individuals might not induce a strong humoral immunity in the respiratory mucosa either, as neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Planas et al., 2021</xref>. If it turns out that current vaccination strategies do not ensure robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the respiratory tract, then strategies that better elicit mucosal-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific B and T cells in infection-naïve individuals – for example by implementing an intranasal route of mRNA immunization – may hold a greater chance of achieving sterilizing immunity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>As this study was aimed at using in-depth phenotyping as a discovery tool, it focused on deeply interrogating many different conditions (e.g. spike variants, longitudinal sampling) rather than many donors. Therefore, although a total of 165 CyTOF specimens were run, only 11 donors were analyzed. The main findings reported here should be confirmed in larger cohorts using more cost-effective and high-throughput alternatives to CyTOF such as conventional flow cytometry. Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g. effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A second limitation of the study was the need to stimulate the specimens in order to identify and characterize the vaccine-elicited T cells, and our limiting our analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to those inducing IFNγ, which may have restricted our ability to characterize subsets such as Tfh cells that are relatively poor producers of this cytokine. We note however that we limited peptide exposure to 6 hours to minimize phenotypic changes caused by the stimulation, similar to our prior studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>. Our analysis focused on CD4+ T cells because the overall numbers of detectable spike-specific CD8+ T cells were low. Nonetheless, the main findings we made with the CD4+ T cells – that they recognize variants equivalently, and that the phenotypes of the responding cells differ by prior SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status – were recapitulated among CD8+ T cells. Future studies should assess the phenotypes of non-stimulated, vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using peptide-MHC tetramers/multimers. Such studies, however, would be limited to analyzing responses against a small number of epitopes, although use of combinatorial tetramers in conjunction with high-parameter phenotyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newell et al., 2013</xref> would increase the ability to characterize a larger breadth of the vaccine-elicited T cell response. Such studies however would be limited for the most part to CD8+ T cells as tetramer reagents for CD4+ T cells are less robust. A final limitation is that serological analyses were not performed in this study. As coordination between the humoral and cellular arms of immunity are likely key to effectively controlling viral replication, future studies should assess to what extent the breadth, isotypes, and functional features of spike-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination associate with the herein described phenotypic features of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec

To establish the phenotypes of total T cells in the absence of stimulation, 2 million cells were cultured in parallel with the stimulated samples, but in the presence of only 3 μg/ml Brefeldin A.</p><p>After culture, the cells were treated with cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a live/dead marker and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2020</xref>. Cisplatin treatment and fixation was performed as follows: first, cells were resuspended in 2 ml PBS (Rockland) with 2 ml EDTA (Corning), followed by addition of 2 ml PBS/EDTA supplemented with 25 μM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 s. Cisplatin staining was then quenched with 10 ml of CyFACS (metal contaminant-free PBS (Rockland) supplemented with 0.1 % FBS and 0.1 % sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich)), centrifuged, and resuspended in 2 % PFA in CyFACS. Fixation was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at room temperature, after which cells were washed twice with CyFACS, and then resuspended in CyFACS containing 10 % DMSO. Fixed cells were stored at –80 °C until analysis by CyTOF. For paired blood/swab specimens from PID4101, cells were immediately cisplatin-treated and fixed, without prior cryopreservation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CyTOF staining and data acquisition</title><p>CyTOF staining was conducted in a fashion similar to recently described methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neidleman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neidleman et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2021</xref>.

FlowJo software (BD Biosciences) was used to identify CD4+ T cells (live, singlet CD3+ CD19 CD4+ CD8-) and CD8+ T cells (live, singlet CD3+ CD19 CD4-CD8+) among all analyzed samples. IFNγ+ in the stimulated samples were considered to be the SARS-CoV-2-responsive cells. For high-dimensional analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells among the stimulated samples, we excluded samples with an insufficient number of events ( ≤ 3) to limit skewing of the data. Manual gating analysis was initially performed using FlowJo, and then select populations were exported as FCS files and then imported into R software as GatingSet objects. Using the <italic>CytoExploreR</italic> package, 2D-gates were manually drawn on the imported samples. The 2D dot plots and statistical results were exported for data visualization, bar-graph generation, and statistical comparisons as previously described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DillonHammill/CytoExploreR">https://github.com/DillonHammill/CytoExploreR</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hammill, 2021</xref>).

The study confirms that mRNA vaccine-elicited T cell responses maintain recognition of peptides derived from VOC, and identifies several phenotypic differences in the T cell response elicited by infection, vaccination, or vaccination following infection. The insights generated by this work will inform further study of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and their role in supporting protective immunity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In fact, just as we went very “deep” into the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in this study, we are at the moment optimizing techniques to, in an analogous fashion, deeply characterize the serological response to vaccination. This entails optimizing a flow cytometry-based approach we recently introduced and implemented on a small number of specimens (Ma et al., J Immunol 207(5):1344, PMID 34389625), to be able to simultaneously assess the levels of IgA1, IgA2, IgE, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgM against the S1, S2, and RBD domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a large number of patient specimens. Once we’ve optimized the assay and applied it on the vaccine specimens, we plan to associate the resulting 24-parameter serological datasets (8 isotypes of antibodies each against 3 antigens = 24 parameters total) with the high-dimensional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell datasets from this study, but that will be its own separate (and large) study and beyond the scope of this current one. As generating such serological data will take at least 3-6 months to complete, and the focus of this study is on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (and all conclusions we drew were based only on the T cell data), we think it appropriate that we limit this study to deep-phenotyping of the T cells. We have now brought up in the last part of our “Limitations” section the lack of serological analysis in this current study as a limitation, and how follow-up studies should associate serological responses with the T cell responses characterized here.</p><p>Lines 506-511: “A final limitation is that serological analyses were not performed in this study. As coordination between the humoral and cellular arms of immunity are likely key to effectively controlling viral replication, future studies should assess to what extent the breadth, isotypes, and functional features of spike-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination associate with the herein described phenotypic features of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer #2 has highlighted that, as an observational study, the discussion could be strengthened by acknowledgement of how future studies could identify the protective roles of the T cell phenotypes identified in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point by adding to the discussion how future studies should define the protective roles of the T cells characterized in this study, and that such studies will require animal models (Lines 488-491: “Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g., effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, the manuscript is clearly written, the experiments are performed well, and the conclusions are supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My comments are largely restricted to modifications of the text that can improve the interpretation of the results and discussion of some of the limitations of the study.</p><p>1) The authors have chosen to base their identification of spike-specific T cells on IFNγ secretion, which is understandable.

We have now added to Figure S1 the data showing our inability to find any vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific Th2 and Th17 cells.</p><p>We also note that although CD40L was not on our panel, other activation markers typically used in AIM assays (Ox40, 4-1BB, and CD69) were, and as shown in Figure S1 of our original manuscript, could not be used to specifically identify SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells as the background (AIM+ cells detected when no peptide was added) was too high. Although stimulating with peptide for 24 instead of 6 hours would be expected to increase the ability to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, such a long period of stimulation would also be expected to more drastically alter the phenotypes of the cells from their original baseline state, which we did not want for our phenotyping studies.</p><p>To acknowledge the limitation of our restricting our analyses to IFNg+ responding cells, we have now added to our “Limitations” section our having limited “our analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to those inducing IFNg, which may have restricted our ability to characterize subsets such as Tfh cells that are relatively poor producers of this cytokine” (Lines 491-494). In addition, we have commented that future studies should take advantage of tetramer technology (which would enable analysis beyond just the IFNg-responding ones), whilst acknowledging that such studies would for the most part be limited to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses as tetramer reagents for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are less robust (Lines 500-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2E appears to show high CCR6 expression on nearly all of the spike-specific T cells – given that these cells were identified by IFNγ (typically associated with Th1/CXCR3 expression), is it surprising that these cells are enriched for CCR6 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, in fact the heatmaps in Figure 2E were scaled from 0 to the maximal signal within each channel. The overall yellow coloring of the CCR6 heatmap did not mean that all the cells expressed high levels of CCR6, but rather that the dynamic range of CCR6 expression was low relative to other antigens, and most cells shown in the Figure 2E heatmap in fact expressed intermediate levels of CCR6.</p><p>To illustrate this point, we have shown within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> tSNE heatmaps corresponding to total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the specimens. This tSNE space was depicted in Figure 2B of the original manuscript. As shown in panel A, the “island” at the bottom corresponds to the IFNg+ (SARS-CoV-2-specific) T cells in the stimulated sample; that these cells are mostly Th1 cells is confirmed by their preferentially expressing the Th1 transcription factor Tbet (right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Panel B shows CCR6 expression levels in the same tSNE space, where it’s apparent that CCR6 expression is not especially high among the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but rather somewhat uniform throughout the entire CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population. By contrast, as shown in panel C, two other chemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) show a much larger dynamic range, where there are were clearer distinctions between the low (blue) and high (red) expressors of these antigens.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72619-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Consistent with CCR6 being relatively “uniform” among all the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was our visualization of CCR6 expression levels as 2D dot plots, where it’s apparent that the highest expressers of CCR6 were in fact not IFNg+ but were IFNg<sup>low</sup> and infrequent (region highlighted by red arrow within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72619-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In conclusion, it was not the case that the IFNg+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were enriched for CCR6 expression, but rather that they expressed moderate levels of CCR6 comparable to that expressed by other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Such studies will most certainly necessitate not only larger cohorts, but also studies in animal models. We in fact are planning pushing forward on all these fronts. We are collecting patient specimens from additional vaccinated patients (including those with breakthrough infections) to increase our “n”; we have initiated studies in a mouse model of pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 infection; and we have upcoming plans (after having received a pilot grant) to characterize vaccine-elicited tissue SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in non-human primates. To highlight the importance of these future studies, we have now in the revised version of the manuscript highlighted the need to perform validation and functional studies in additional donors and in animal models (Lines 486-491: “The main findings reported here should be confirmed in larger cohorts using more cost-effective and high-throughput alternatives to CyTOF such as conventional flow cytometry. Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g., effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
