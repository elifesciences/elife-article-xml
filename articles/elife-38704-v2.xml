The mechanisms that control such adaptive processes remain unclear. Here we define populations of POMC neurons in mice that are activated or inhibited by insulin and thereby repress or inhibit hepatic glucose production (HGP). The proportion of POMC neurons activated by insulin was dependent on the regulation of insulin receptor signaling by the phosphatase TCPTP, which is increased by fasting, degraded after feeding and elevated in diet-induced obesity. TCPTP-deficiency enhanced insulin signaling and the proportion of POMC neurons activated by insulin to repress HGP. Elevated TCPTP in POMC neurons in obesity and/or after fasting repressed insulin signaling, the activation of POMC neurons by insulin and the insulin-induced and POMC-mediated repression of HGP. Our findings define a molecular mechanism for integrating POMC neural responses with feeding to control glucose metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd>protein tyrosine phosphatase</kwd><kwd>cellular signalling</kwd><kwd>POMC neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA207288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhong-Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cowley</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrikopoulos</surname><given-names>Sofianos</given-names></name><name><surname>Spanswick</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiganis</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG051459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG052986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK111178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Feeding and fasting associated alterations in proopiomelanocortin neuronal responses to insulin coordinate glucose metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin acts on peripheral tissues including liver, muscle and adipose tissue to directly control glucose metabolism, while also acting in the brain to concordantly regulate nutrient fluxes, feeding behaviour and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). The CNS effects of insulin on metabolism are mediated by different brain regions, in particular the hypothalamus, acting via autonomic circuits to influence peripheral organs, including the pancreas, liver, white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue to modulate insulin secretion, endogenous glucose production and glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obici et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogt and Brüning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). Although our understanding of the neural circuitry controlling feeding behaviour and energy expenditure has grown considerably in the last few years, the neural processes by which insulin elicits its effects on glucose metabolism are less clear.</p><p>The insulin receptor (IR) is widely expressed throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Havrankova et al., 1978</xref>). Mice lacking the IR in the brain exhibit whole-body insulin resistance accompanied by increased food intake and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brüning et al., 2000</xref>). The contributions of the IR in controlling feeding and energy expenditure are best understood in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, a specialized brain region comprising of neurons proximal to the fenestrated capillaries of the median eminence. This position allows ARC neurons to respond to peripheral circulating factors such as leptin and insulin that convey information on the nutritional and metabolic status of the organism. In particular, the ARC comprises of two opposing neuronal populations, the appetite suppressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons and the orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The activation of POMC neurons results in POMC processing to generate α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is released and agonises melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R) on neurons in other regions of the brain, such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). The activation of AgRP/NPY neurons promotes the synthesis and release of AgRP and GABA that antagonise α-MSH/MC4R interactions and directly inhibit POMC neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tong et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Insulin binds to its tyrosine kinase receptor and signals via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase PKB/AKT pathway to hyperpolarise and inhibit AgRP/NPY neurons and repress <italic>Agrp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanswick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogt and Brüning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Leptin also hyperpolarizes and inhibits NPY/AgRP neurons and represses <italic>Npy/Agrp</italic> expression acting via several pathways, including the Janus-activated kinase (JAK)−2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)−3 pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elias et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van den Top et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In this way leptin and insulin act to alleviate the inhibitory constraints on POMC neurons and the melanocortin response. IR signaling in AgRP neurons is important for the control of peripheral glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dodd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>) acting through vagal efferents to the liver and α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to repress hepatic glucose production (HGP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). Central insulin signaling suppresses HGP by activating Kupffer cells to release interleukin- 6 (IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Obici et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obici et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocai et al., 2005</xref>). IL-6 in turn acts on hepatocytes via STAT-3 to repress the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase (encoded by <italic>G6pc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inoue et al., 2004</xref>). IR deletion in AgRP neurons in mice results in defective inhibition of HGP accompanied by decreased <italic>Il6</italic> and increased <italic>G6pc</italic> hepatic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Leptin depolarises and activates POMC neurons and promotes <italic>Pomc</italic> expression and α-MSH secretion to repress feeding, increase energy expenditure and repress HGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berglund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). By contrast insulin has been traditionally viewed as an inhibitor of POMC neuronal excitation, hyperpolarising POMC neurons through the engagement of ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanswick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). More recent studies have shown that insulin can depolarise and activate POMC neurons via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRPC)−5 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>), whereas several studies have shown that insulin can promote <italic>Pomc</italic> expression and the melanocortin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). The advent of single-cell transcriptomics has yielded unprecedented insight into the heterogeneity of hypothalamic cell types and has led to the identification of different subsets of POMC- and AgRP-expressing neurons that exhibit distinct transcriptional responses to changing energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). Such heterogeneity may at least in part explain the seeming discordant effects of insulin on POMC neuronal excitability, but this remains to be formally examined. Irrespective, whereas insulin signaling in AgRP neurons overtly affects glucose metabolism through the control of HGP and brown adipose tissue glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), gene deletion and pharmacogenetic experiments have suggested that insulin signaling in POMC neurons may not be so important; neither IR deletion in POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) nor the acute activation of POMC neurons using DREADDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>) influences glucose metabolism. Nonetheless, the combined deletion of the IR plus leptin receptor in POMC neurons profoundly affects glucose homeostasis and results in systemic insulin resistance and increased HGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the contribution of insulin signaling in POMC neurons on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure may be more nuanced and dictated by the hormonal milieu.</p><p>We report that insulin can elicit discordant effects on the electrophysiological activity of POMC neurons and that this is regulated by T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tiganis, 2013</xref>), an IR phosphatase whose abundance in the ARC is increased by fasting and repressed by feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover we demonstrate that the regulation of IR signaling by TCPTP dictates whether POMC neurons are activated or inhibited by insulin and that this serves to coordinate hepatic glucose metabolism with feeding and fasting.

To determine the extent to which the differential insulin responses in POMC neurons from <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed (at 9–11 am) mice may relate to the expression of TCPTP, we intracellularly labelled recorded cells with biocytin and processed the coronal slices for TCPTP immunohistochemistry. We found that the majority of inhibited (25/27) and around half of all unresponsive (11/20) POMC neurons in the patch-clamped coronal slices from <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP mice expressed TCPTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>). On the other hand, most (5/6) of POMC neurons that were excited by insulin did not express TCPTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Therefore, these results are consistent with TCPTP status determining whether POMC neurons are excited by insulin, or whether they are inhibited by insulin. The extent to which TCPTP may influence non-responsive neurons is unclear and it possible that these neurons do not express the IR. Nonetheless, to explore the influence of TCPTP status on the excitation versus inhibition of POMC neurons we crossed mice in which TCPTP (encoded by <italic>Ptpn2</italic>) had been deleted in POMC neurons (<italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre;<italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>: POMC-TC) on the Z/EG reporter background (POMC-TC;Z/EG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Novak et al., 2000</xref>), where Cre-mediated recombination can be tracked by the expression of GFP. TCPTP deleted GFP-positive POMC neurons in coronal slices from <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed adult mice were subjected to whole-cell recordings, monitoring once more for changes in membrane potential and firing frequency in response to insulin. Recordings were undertaken on 33 ARC POMC neurons with a resting membrane potential of −40.1 ± 1.2 mV. Strikingly TCPTP-deficiency significantly increased the number of cells that were excited (12/33, 36.4%) in response to insulin and decreased the number of inhibited (12/33, 36.4%) POMC neurons; TCPTP-deficiency tended to decrease the number of unresponsive (9/33, 27.3%) POMC neurons but this was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Excited neurons were significantly depolarised in response to insulin (baseline membrane potential −42.1 ± 1.8 mV; insulin −37.9 ± 1.7 mV) and firing rate increased (baseline 0.69 ± 0.33 Hz; insulin 1.58 ± 0.66 Hz), whereas insulin-inhibited neurons were significantly hyperpolarised (baseline membrane potential −43.0 ± 1.8 mV; insulin −46.8 ± 2.3 mV) and the firing rate reduced (baseline 0.63 ± 0.25 Hz; insulin 0.10 ± 0.05 Hz) in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>). Given that the <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre transgene can delete in roughly 25% of NPY/AgRP neurons in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), we cannot exclude that a proportion of the inhibited neurons were in fact AgRP neurons that are inhibited by insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanswick et al., 2000</xref>). Nonetheless these results are consistent with TCPTP-deficiency, which emulates the fed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>), increasing the proportion of POMC neurons activated and decreasing the proportion of POMC neurons inhibited by insulin.</p><p>To independently assess the impact of TCPTP deficiency on the excitation of POMC neurons in response to insulin we also recorded GFP-positive ARC POMC neurons from <italic>ad libitum</italic> (at 9–11 am) fed <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter mice that had been treated ICV with the highly potent and selective TCPTP inhibitor compound 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) that we have shown previously elicits effects in wild-type but not TCPTP-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loh et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, TCPTP inhibition significantly altered POMC responses to insulin such that the proportion of GFP-positive POMC neurons activated by insulin increased to 33% (19/58 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These results indicate that the deletion or inhibition of TCPTP can increase the proportion of POMC neurons that are activated by insulin.</p><p>Next, we determined whether the converse may be true and if increased TCPTP might be associated with an increased proportion of POMC neurons that are inhibited by insulin. To this end we recorded from GFP-positive POMC neurons in coronal slices from <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP mice that had been fed a high-fat diet (23% fat) for 12 weeks to render them obese. We have reported previously that hypothalamic TCPTP levels are elevated in diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loh et al., 2011</xref>), whereas more recently we have shown that feeding-induced repression of hypothalamic TCPTP expression is defective in obesity resulting in elevated TCPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, TCPTP protein levels, as assessed by immunoblotting mediobasal hypothalamic homogenates from fed [allowed to feed for 4 hr after start of dark cycle till satiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>)] mice that had been administered a high fat diet for 12 weeks, were increased by 6.3 ± 0.49 fold when compared to those in corresponding chow-fed lean controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Importantly, the increase in TCPTP occurred in hypothalamic neurons of the ARC, including POMC neurons, as assessed by the increased coincidence of TCPTP with GFP-positive POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and was accompanied by the repression of insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling that was restored by TCPTP-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Accordingly, we reasoned that sustained/elevated hypothalamic TCPTP levels in diet-induced obesity might shift POMC neural responses so that the majority of POMC neurons are unresponsive or inhibited by insulin. Consistent with this, we found that in high-fat-fed obese mice the proportion of GFP-positive POMC neurons inhibited by insulin ex vivo increased from 51% (27/53 cells) to 65% (22/34 cells; p=0.045; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), whereas the proportion of cells being activated fell from 11% (6/53 cells) to 3% (1/34 cells; p=0.027, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Insulin-inhibited neurons were significantly hyperpolarised (baseline membrane potential −45.8 ± 0.9 mV; insulin −49.9 ± 1.3 mV) and the firing rate reduced (baseline 1.33 ± 0.37 Hz; insulin 0.11 ± 0.05 Hz) in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). To determine the extent to which this might be attributable to the increase in TCPTP in POMC neurons we recorded GFP-positive neurons in slices prepared from 12 week high-fat-fed mice that had been treated ICV with compound 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). Strikingly, TCPTP inhibition significantly altered POMC responses to insulin such that only 20% (7/35 cells) of GFP-positive POMC neurons were inhibited by insulin, whereas the proportion of cells being activated increased from 3% (1/34 cells) to 37% (13/35; p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–l</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Inhibited neurons were hyperpolarised (baseline membrane potential −47.6 ± 1.3 mV; insulin −49.9 ± 1.6 mV) and the firing rate reduced in the presence of insulin (baseline 1.20 ± 0.78 Hz; insulin 0.07 ± 0.05 Hz), whereas activated neurons were significantly depolarised (baseline membrane potential −46.0 ± 0.8 mV; insulin −42.6 ± 0.7 mV) and the firing rate increased (baseline 0.53 ± 0.22 Hz; insulin 0.83 ± 0.30 Hz) in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). Therefore, these results are consistent with increased/sustained hypothalamic TCPTP in obesity orchestrating a switch in neuronal excitability such that POMC neurons are principally inhibited by insulin.</p><p>Our results indicate that TCPTP status may define POMC neural responses to insulin so that feeding-associated diurnal fluctuations in TCPTP or elevated TCPTP levels in obesity might dictate whether POMC neurons are activated by insulin or are otherwise inhibited or remain unresponsive. To determine whether TCPTP status and altered POMC neuronal responses to insulin might be of functional relevance in vivo we monitored the influence of TCPTP deficiency in POMC neurons on the activation of second order neurons in the PVH in mice that had been fasted and administered a bolus of insulin. TCPTP-deficiency in POMC-TC mice increased c-Fos staining (a surrogate marker of neuronal activation) in the PVH of fasted mice and this was exacerbated by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>); although systemic insulin administration resulted in hypoglycemia, this was similar in <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and POMC-TC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with TCPTP deficiency promoting the activation of POMC neurons in vivo. Taken together these results establish the potential for POMC neurons in the ARC to be either activated or inhibited by insulin. Moreover, our studies indicate that response of POMC neurons to insulin may be dictated by the levels of TCPTP, so that diurnal fluctuations in TCPTP in ARC POMC neurons [TCPTP is increased in the fasted state and eliminated in the fed/satiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>)] may alter the proportion of neurons that are activated or inhibited by insulin and thereby alter the functional melanocortin output response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The activation or inhibition of POMC neurons regulates hepatic glucose metabolism</title><p>Neurons in the hypothalamus and other regions of the brain can respond to peripheral signals such as insulin, leptin, glucose and free fatty acids, to influence peripheral glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berglund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buettner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gelling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obici et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). In particular, insulin-responsive ARC neurons can function via vagal efferent inputs to the liver to repress HGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Obici et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obici et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocai et al., 2005</xref>). Gene deletion experiments indicate that AgRP neurons are instrumental in the insulin-mediated repression of hepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand IR deletion in POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>) or the acute pharmacogenetic activation of POMC neurons in fasted mice have no effect on glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>). Since our studies indicate that distinct POMC neuronal subsets exist that can be inhibited (hyperpolarised) or activated (depolarised) by insulin, we reasoned that previous gene deletion studies may have been confounded by the existence of POMC neurons with potentially diametrically opposing consequences on glucose metabolism. Accordingly, we compared the effects of chronically inhibiting versus activating POMC neurons on hepatic glucose metabolism. To this end we took advantage of the G<sub>i</sub>-coupled hM4Di inhibitory DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), which is activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and induces neuronal silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2011</xref>), versus the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled hM3Dq stimulatory DREADD, which depolarises neurons and induces firing in response to CNO. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) capable of expressing either the hM4Di or the hM3Dq DREADDs fused to mCherry in a Cre-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>) were administered into the ARC of 12-week-old <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre mice on the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter background; post-mortem analyses confirmed mCherry expression in 77.5 ± 12.0% and 74.1 ± 13.9% of GFP positive POMC neurons respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). mCherry was not expressed in non-GFP expressing neurons in the ARC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>), consistent with the DREADDs being expressed specifically in POMC neurons. This is also consistent with studies showing that Cre-dependent AVV expression in the ARC of adult <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre mice occurs specifically in POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the influence of POMC neuronal inhibition, we administered CNO in the dark phase, 4 hr after lights were turned off when mice were satiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>), so that HGP would be low and any effects otherwise arising from the POMC-mediated repression of feeding would be limited. This would allow us to examine if the insulin-mediated inhibition of POMC neurons might promote hepatic gluconeogensis. Mice expressing hM4Di-mCherry in POMC neurons were administered either a single dose of CNO 30 min before analysis, to examine the influence of acute POMC inhibition, or two doses of CNO over 6 hr to assess the effects of more sustained POMC neuronal inhibition and any accompanying effects on gene expression on hepatic glucose metabolism (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>).</bold> In the first instance, we measured HGP by performing pyruvate tolerance tests (pyruvate increases blood glucose by promoting gluconeogenesis). We found that the acute inhibition of POMC neurons had no effect, whereas the inhibition of POMC neurons over 6 hr increased blood glucose levels in response to pyruvate, consistent with the promotion of HGP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>); CNO had no effect on the electrophysiological response of non-DREADD expressing POMC neurons (data not shown) and did not alter glucose metabolism (as assessed by measuring glucose excursions in response to pyruvate, glucose or insulin) in C57BL/6 control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). Hypothalamic neurons may influence HGP by regulating hepatic Il6 expression, which activates STAT3 in hepatocytes to suppress the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (encoded by <italic>G6pc</italic>) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; encoded by <italic>Pck1</italic>), rate-determining gluconeogenic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Obici et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obici et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocai et al., 2005</xref>). We found that the chronic, but not acute inhibition of POMC neurons was accompanied by the significant repression of hepatic <italic>Il6</italic> expression and diminished hepatic STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>). This in turn was associated with increased expression of the gluconeogenic genes <italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These results are therefore consistent with POMC neuronal inhibition promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis. To explore this further we assessed the influence of chronic CNO administration on glucose turnover and hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity by subjecting mice to hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>). We found that chronic POMC neuronal inhibition was associated with attenuated insulin-mediated repression of endogenous glucose production and an overall decrease in insulin sensitivity as assessed by the reduced glucose infusion rate (GIR) necessary to maintain euglycemia during the clamp and the reduced glucose disappearance rate (Rd; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The attenuated repression of endogenous glucose production was accompanied by decreased <italic>Il6</italic> and increased hepatic <italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), in keeping with the attenuated repression of HGP. Therefore, inhibition of POMC neurons promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose production and results in decreased whole-body insulin sensitivity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38704.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Pharmacogenetic stimulation or inhibition of hypothalamic POMC neurons modulates hepatic glucose metabolism.</title><p>8-week-old <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre mice (on the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter background) were bilaterally injected with rAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry into the ARC.

TCPTP-deficiency was accompanied by lower fasted (6 hr) blood glucose and plasma insulin levels, in keeping with overall improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>). This was reflected in greater reductions in blood glucose levels in response to insulin and improved glucose clearances in response to a bolus of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>). Moreover, excursions in blood glucose in response to pyruvate were attenuated in keeping with reduced endogenous glucose production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). To further explore the influence of POMC TCPTP-deficiency on glucose metabolism we subjected mice to hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps. We found that the glucose infusion rate (GIR) necessary to maintain euglycemia was significantly enhanced in POMC-TC mice, consistent with enhanced whole-body insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Importantly we found that the glucose disappearance rate (Rd), which primarily measures muscle and adipose tissue glucose uptake, was unaltered by TCPTP-deficiency under the conditions tested, whereas the insulin-induced repression of endogenous glucose production, a measure of hepatic and renal glucose production, was significantly enhanced in POMC-TC mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>)</bold>. The repressed endogenous glucose production was accompanied by decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes (<italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). In keeping with the overall improvement in insulin sensitivity we found that insulin-induced IR Y1162/Y1163 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in the liver (as monitored by AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation) were dramatically enhanced by POMC TCPTP deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). By contrast insulin-induced PI3K/Akt signaling was not altered in skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). Therefore, these findings are consistent with POMC TCPTP deficiency influencing hepatic glucose metabolism in two ways. First by enhancing the CNS insulin-induced and POMC-mediated repression of STAT3 signaling and gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver, and second by selectively enhancing the peripheral response of the liver to the actions of insulin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38704.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Deletion of TCPTP in POMC neurons improves whole-body glucose homeostasis and represses HGP.</title><p>Fed and fasted (<bold>a</bold>) blood glucose and (<bold>b</bold>) plasma insulin from 12-week-old POMC-TC or <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> male mice; significance was assessed using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test.

Moreover, our studies indicate that the presence or absence of TCPTP in POMC neurons determines the gluconeogenic status and insulin responsiveness of the liver. We have reported recently that TCPTP levels in the ARC exhibit diurnal fluctuations that are linked to feeding, so that fasting increases TCPTP expression and feeding represses TCPTP expression and actively promotes its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Such fluctuations in TCPTP were seen in both AgRP and POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, we reasoned that elevated TCPTP in POMC neurons during fasting would render POMC neurons inhibited by insulin, to antagonise the CNS insulin-induced repression of hepatic glucose metabolism, whereas decreased TCPTP in response to feeding, would render POMC neurons activated by insulin, to facilitate the CNS insulin-induced repression of hepatic glucose metabolism. In this way feeding-associated fluctuations in TCPTP in POMC neurons would coordinate POMC neuronal responses and HGP to maintain euglycemia in response to feeding and fasting. To test this, we first compared the effects of centrally administered insulin on hepatic glucose metabolism in C57BL/6 mice that had been fed for 4 hr from the start of the dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>) when mice are satiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), to the corresponding mice where food was withdrawn at the start of the dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–f</xref>). We found that in fed mice, ICV administered insulin repressed hepatic gluconeogenesis as assessed by the attenuated glucose excursions in response to pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) and the inhibition of gluconeogenic gene expression (<italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This was accompanied by the promotion of hepatic <italic>Il6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). By contrast, in food-restricted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), ICV administered insulin had no effect on pyruvate-induced glucose excursions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) or the expression of <italic>Pck1</italic>, <italic>G6pc</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). These results are in keeping with the feeding-induced repression of TCPTP and the activation of POMC by insulin, repressing hepatic glucose metabolism. Next, we specifically explored the contributions of TCPTP in POMC neurons. To this end we ICV administered insulin to food-restricted <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> or POMC-TC mice and assessed hepatic glucose metabolism and gluconeogenic gene expression. As in food-restricted C57BL/6 mice, ICV insulin had no effect on glucose excursions in response to pyruvate in food-restricted <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), nor did it alter the expression of <italic>Pck1</italic>, <italic>G6pc</italic> or <italic>Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). By contrast glucose excursions in vehicle-treated POMC-TC mice were reduced relative to <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and reduced further in response to ICV insulin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). As noted in overnight fasted POMC-TC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), the hepatic expression of <italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic> was elevated in vehicle-treated food-restricted POMC-TC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).

First, we assessed the influence of TCPTP-deficiency on insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling. To this end we crossed POMC-TC mice (on a <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter background) onto the <italic>Insr<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> heterozygous background to generate POMC-TC-IR mice so that insulin signaling might approximate that in <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls. Neither TCPTP-deficiency, nor combined TCPTP deficiency and IR heterozygosity affected the number of ARC POMC neurons in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2015</xref>) we found that TCPTP deficiency enhanced insulin-induced ARC PI3K/AKT signaling in POMC neurons, as assessed by monitoring for AKT Ser-473 phosphorylation (p-AKT) in mice on the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter background. Importantly, we found that the enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling otherwise associated with TCPTP-deficiency was significantly repressed, albeit not completely corrected by IR heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>). To explore if the enhanced IR-dependent signaling in POMC-TC mice might impact on electrophysiological activity and the proportion of POMC neurons activated versus inhibited by insulin we recorded from GFP-positive POMC neurons in coronal slices from POMC-TC-IR mice (on the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter background). IR heterozygosity significantly decreased the number of POMC neurons that were activated by insulin in POMC-TC mice, from 36% (12/33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to 17% (8/48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), so that the proportion of activated neurons in POMC-TC-IR mice was not significantly different from controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Excited neurons in POMC-TC-IR mice were significantly depolarised in response to insulin (baseline membrane potential −50.9 ± 3.74 mV; insulin −41.71 ± 3.66 mV) and firing rate increased (baseline 0.149 ± 0.26 Hz; insulin 1.141 ± 1.08 Hz), whereas insulin-inhibited neurons were significantly hyperpolarised (baseline membrane potential −41.56 ± 5.96 mV; insulin −49.31 ± 9.02 mV) and the firing rate reduced (baseline 0.891 ± 0.22 Hz; insulin 0.22 ± 0.10 Hz) in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Accordingly, we reasoned that the increase in TCPTP in POMC neurons in obesity and the consequent shift in POMC neuronal responses (so that a greater proportion of POMC neurons are inhibited by insulin) might promote HGP and perturb glucose metabolism and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in obesity. To explore this, we determined if the deletion of TCPTP in POMC neurons in obese mice might enhance the insulin-POMC-mediated repression of hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose metabolism. To test this, we ICV administered insulin to <italic>Ptpn2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> or POMC-TC mice that had been fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks and subjected mice to pyruvate tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>); TCPTP-deficiency in POMC neurons did not alter body weight or adiposity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Whereas control mice remained unresponsive to ICV insulin, TCPTP deficiency in POMC neurons repressed pyruvate-induced glucose excursions in response to ICV insulin and this was accompanied by increased hepatic <italic>Il6</italic> expression and STAT-3 signaling and the repression of <italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>). These results are consistent with TCPTP deficiency enhancing the ICV insulin-induced repression of HGP. To examine whether this might influence whole-body glucose metabolism, we first measured blood glucose and plasma insulin levels and subjected mice to insulin and glucose tolerance tests. As noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2015</xref>), TCPTP deficiency in POMC neurons did not alter glucose excursions in insulin and glucose tolerance tests that primarily measure the abilities of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to clear glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). However, blood glucose and plasma insulin levels in 12 hr fasted mice were reduced, consistent with improved whole-body insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–f</xref>). To further explore this, we subjected 12 week high fat fed mice to hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps. Glucose infusion rates were significantly increased in POMC-TC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1e</xref>), consistent with enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity. Although glucose disappearance (Rd) was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>), endogenous glucose production was suppressed in POMC-TC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>) and accompanied by reduced hepatic gluconeogenic (<italic>Pck1</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic>) gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>). Therefore, TCPTP-deficiency in POMC neurons in obesity improves glucose metabolism through the repression of HGP.

Moreover, we demonstrate that TCPTP may orchestrate these effects through the regulation of IR signaling to coordinate the melanocortin response and hepatic glucose metabolism in response to feeding and fasting. This provides an elegant system for integrating the melanocortin circuit with the nutritional state of the organism and coordinating feeding with the CNS control of glucose metabolism.</p><p>The IR is widely expressed in the hypothalamus and is present in both POMC and AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Havrankova et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>). Although its role in AgRP neurons and HGP has been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>), its importance in POMC neurons and glucose metabolism has received less attention, as early studies showed that IR deletion in POMC neurons had no effect on HGP and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>). Our studies suggest that at least one explanation for this could be that any effect on glucose metabolism would be negated by the concomitant deletion of IR in POMC neurons that are excited and inhibited by insulin. Moreover, our studies indicate that any response of POMC neurons to insulin would be dictated by the nutritional state of the organism. C57BL/6 mice feed predominantly at night during the first four hours of the dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies addressing the role of IR deletion in POMC neurons would have been conducted during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), when mice are effectively fasted and TCPTP levels are elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>) and/or in overnight fasted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>). Under these conditions, the TCPTP-mediated suppression of insulin signaling would render POMC neurons largely unresponsive or inhibited by insulin and antagonise the CNS insulin-mediated repression of HGP. Therefore, it is likely that the responses seen in our studies would have been missed by previous studies. Consistent with this assertion we found that ICV insulin repressed HGP in fed mice, but not in fasted mice. In addition, Steculorum <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>) have reported that the acute activation of AgRP neurons using DREADDs has no effect on HGP, but represses brown adipose tissue glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, whereas the acute activation of POMC neurons has no discernible influence on glucose metabolism. Although this is consistent with the acute CNS regulation of glucose metabolism being independent of the melanocortin circuit, our studies demonstrate that the chronic inhibition or activation of POMC neurons, via DREADDs, or deletion of the phosphatase TCPTP, profoundly influences hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. The chronic activation or inhibition of POMC neurons decreased or increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and was accompanied by the promotion or repression of hepatic <italic>Il6</italic> expression and STAT3 signaling and the repression or induction of gluconeogenic gene expression respectively. The impact of the pharmacogenetic inhibition of POMC neurons with DREADDs on hepatic glucose metabolism was substantiated in hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps where endogenous glucose production was markedly increased and systemic insulin sensitivity decreased. Conversely TCPTP deletion in POMC neurons resulted enhanced IR signaling and POMC neuronal excitation to repress HGP and significantly enhanced hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the acute activation of AgRP neurons may elicit melanocortin-independent effects on brown adipose tissue glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steculorum et al., 2016</xref>), our recent studies indicate that TCPTP-deletion in AgRP enhances the insulin-mediated inhibition of AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>) and the IR-dependent repression of HGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dodd et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the chronic activation of POMC neurons and concomitant inhibition of AgRP neurons by insulin would drive melanocortin-dependent responses to modulate HGP and glucose homeostasis. This may allow for a graded response to changing nutritional states, with acute changes in insulin acting via AgRP-dependent but melanocortin-independent pathways to affect BAT glucose uptake, and the sustained hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia accompanying more intense caloric intake additionally engaging the melanocortin circuit and the liver to allow for a concerted systemic response to lower postprandial blood glucose levels.</p><p>Our studies indicate that the abundance of the IR phosphatase TCPTP determines whether POMC neurons are excited or inhibited by insulin and controls the intensity of IR signaling. TCPTP deletion in POMC neurons (marked by the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter), or inhibition with the TCPTP selective inhibitor compound 8, shifted POMC neural responses so that the majority of POMC neurons were activated by insulin. Our recent studies have shown that TCPTP abundance in AgRP and POMC neurons is subject to diurnal fluctuations linked to feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Increases in circulating corticosterone that accompany fasting drive hypothalamic TCPTP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, feeding inhibits TCPTP expression and promotes its rapid degradation via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). We have reported that in AgRP neurons this serves to coordinate the browning and thermogenic activity of white fat with the expenditure of energy linked to feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). In other studies we have shown that such fluxes in TCPTP in AgRP neurons also influence hepatic glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dodd et al., 2018</xref>), which is in keeping with the previously established role for the IR in AgRP neurons in glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Könner et al., 2007</xref>). Although we did not assess the influence of feeding and fasting on the activation of POMC neurons by insulin, we demonstrated that insulin administered ICV repressed hepatic gluconeogenesis in fed mice, when TCPTP is repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>), but not in food restricted or fasted mice, when TCPTP expression is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly we found that deleting TCPTP in POMC neurons, which enhanced IR signaling and resulted in a recruitment of POMC neurons activated by insulin, reinstated the ICV insulin-induced repression of gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output in otherwise unresponsive fasted mice. In keeping with this assertion, we found that chow-fed mice lacking TCPTP in POMC neurons exhibited a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity (as assessed in hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps) that was accounted for by a reduction in endogenous glucose production (a measure of HGP) and decreased gluconeogenesis, as assessed in pyruvate tolerance tests and the decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. The improvement in glucose homeostasis was corrected in POMC-TC-IR mice, where the enhanced insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling in mice lacking TCPTP in POMC neurons was corrected to that of control mice. This would suggest that TCPTP deletion, or decreased TCPTP in POMC neurons in response to feeding, represses HGP by enhancing IR signaling and permitting POMC neurons to be activated by insulin. A caveat of these findings is that early in development <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre is active in roughly 25% of NPY neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Padilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), so that the improved glucose metabolism in POMC-TC mice might at least in part reflect the enhancement of insulin signalling in AgRP/NPY neurons. However, given that (i) TCPTP abundance in POMC neurons (marked by the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP reporter) correlated with insulin-induced electrophysiological responses, (ii) TCPTP inhibition in POMC neurons (marked by the <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP) increased the proportion of activated neurons, (iii) α-MSH staining in the PVH was increased in POMC-TC mice, and iv) DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons repressed HGP as seen in POMC-TC mice, our findings are consistent with feeding-associated TCPTP fluxes in POMC neurons coordinating POMC neuronal activity and thereby hepatic glucose metabolism in response to feeding.</p><p>Precisely how TCPTP influences POMC neuronal electrophysiological responses to insulin remains to be determined. One mechanism could involve TCPTP affecting synaptic plasticity by influencing pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory inputs, including GABAergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich and Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvath et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sternson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). However, our studies indicate that there is no overt change in relative excitatory and inhibitory inputs into POMC perikarya (Horvath <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished observation). Another mechanism could involve IR-dependent pathways that directly influence the activation of TRPC channels that depolarise POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>), or inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels that inhibit POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plum et al., 2006</xref>). Yet another mechanism could involve TCPTP altering mitochondrial dynamics, as mitochondrial fusion in AgRP neurons drives ATP production and excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nasrallah and Horvath, 2014</xref>), whereas mitochondrial fusion in POMC neurons drives α-MSH production and the melanocortin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneeberger et al., 2013</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, insulin-induced PI3K signaling promotes mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parra et al., 2014</xref>), but it remains to be established if insulin similarly alters mitochondrial dynamics in POMC neurons and whether TCPTP influences POMC neuron electrophysiologial responses through the IR-mediated control of mitochondrial fusion. Irrespective, our studies define an exquisite mechanism by which to link feeding and fasting and the associated changes in insulin levels and glucocorticoids that drive TCPTP expression with the control of POMC neuronal excitability and the coordination of hepatic glucose metabolism for the maintenance of euglycemia. Our studies point towards this glucoregulatory mechanism being defective in obesity. The increased hypothalamic TCPTP in obesity probably occurs as a consequence of the heightened glucocorticoid and leptin levels that we have shown previously to drive TCPTP expression in the ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loh et al., 2011</xref>). Irrespective, our studies point towards the heightened hypothalamic TCPTP levels in obesity resulting in the majority of POMC neurons being inhibited by insulin, to contribute to the increased HGP and fasting hyperglycemia that accompany the obese state. In humans, peripheral insulin resistance in obesity has been linked to CNS insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthony et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirvonen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tschritter et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover the ability of intranasally administered insulin to elicit effects in the hypothalamus and suppress HGP and promote glucose uptake in lean individuals is defective in overweight individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heni et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we propose that perturbations in glucose metabolism in obesity, may at least in part be due to TCPTP repressing the IR-dependent activation of POMC neurons and the overall melanocortin output response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Dong Kong (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This interesting manuscript presents a large amount of information regarding the role of a specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, TCPTP, in the control of insulin responsiveness in POMC neurons in relation to control of systemic insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose metabolism. The data strongly suggest both a key role for TCPTP in the responsiveness of POMC cells to insulin and that enhanced insulin signaling depolarizes and increases the firing of in these neurons, while the opposite effect is observed in POMC neurons with high levels of TCPTP. The data also offer a welcome new perspective on the role of POMC neurons in the control of HGP and a potential resolution to controversy surrounding this issue stemming from earlier work, and the impact of changes in nutritional state on POMC cell insulin responsiveness is also novel and of interest.</p><p>The reviewers of this paper found the results to be of great interest and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after some revisions. It was not possible to assemble the comments into a few key points for consideration (<italic>eLife</italic> normal procedure) because the three reviewers had non-overlapping concerns. Thus, all of the comments are included below. The reviewers had a number of concerns that can, in general, be addressed without further experiments. However, explanations of the many points raised are necessary and caveats to the data interpretation should be included. Additional experiments that address concerns are, of course, welcome.</p><p>One issue raised by reviewers is that the use of <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre mice is problematic because Cre recombinase is activated in neurons that go to develop into AgRP (and other) neurons. Thus, some of the data are probably derived from a mixed population of arcuate neurons.</p><p>The other issue is that the mitochondria data are correlative and do not provide compelling evidence linking mitochondrial dynamics and glucose regulation. Some reviewers, including the editor, suggest either providing a causal link between mitochondrial dynamics and glucose regulation, or removing the mitochondrial experiments from this story.</p><p>The authors should define TCPTP on first usage and note the mouse gene names do not include hyphens, e.g. Il6, not Il-6.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Dodd et al. investigate the role of TCPTP in POMC neurons upon insulin signaling and glucose metabolism control. The authors report a correlation between TCPTP expression in POMC neurons and the level of neuron responsiveness to insulin. High expression of TCPTP in obesity or fasting hampers insulin-induced signaling, POMC neuron activation and repression of HGP. In contrast, genetic inactivation of TCPTP in POMC neurons causes enhanced insulin-stimulated signaling, activation of POMC neurons and inhibition of HGP. The authors also report changes in mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-ER contacts in POMC neurons upon TCPTP deletion. The authors propose that physiological (fed/fast) and pathophysiological (HFD) changes in TCPTP expression in POMC neurons may influence neuronal activity and HGP via insulin signaling-mediated modulation of mitochondrial fusion and contacts with the ER.</p><p>The study uses a nice combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, pharmacology as well as physiological and molecular biology techniques. Generally speaking, the conclusions are supported by the data although some statements in specific parts of the manuscript should be softened. Overall, the study fulfils the highest standards in the field and seems appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I do not have major concerns that require additional experiments but I would suggest further analysis of the electrophysiology results. In particular, the authors compare the number (population size) of POMC neurons that are activated, inhibited or unresponsive to insulin amongst a number of experimental settings. Table 1 provides statistical comparisons for some of these studies, but not all (only for KO's and double Ko's). However, the authors claim that pharmacological TCPTP inhibition &quot;significantly altered POMC responses to insulin&quot; but statistical evidence is not provided. The same for the HFD study. The authors should provide a complete table of comparisons amongst the diverse experimental settings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Insulin's effect on POMC neurons, their neuronal heterogeneity, and the related blood glucose regulation have been interesting topics in the field of brain-controlled metabolism for quite a while. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Whether POMC neurons regulate glucose homeostasis is also under debate. In the current study, Dodd et al. focused on these questions, performed a series of studies, and made multiple important and exciting findings. First, they documented heterogenous responses of POMC neurons to insulin and further demonstrated a dependence of such responses on the expression of TCPTP phosphatase in these neurons. Then, the author performed glucose clamp studies by combining with chemogenetic tools and assessed the peripheral mechanisms. They found that TCPTP in POMC neurons regulated blood glucose by mainly inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Finally, they also used multiple mouse models and discovered that feeding/fasting and HFD-feeding induced TCPTP expression in POMC neurons regulated insulin receptor signaling and mitochondrial dynamics to manipulate responses to insulin and peripheral glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is very well prepared, the studies were properly designed, performed, and analyzed, and the conclusions were well reached. The current study has thus established an elegant system to understand the central control of glucose metabolism. I believe the manuscript will be of great interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and I have the following comments for the authors to address.</p><p>1) The authors performed a large number of current-clamp recordings on POMC neurons to assess their responses to insulin. However, the results of membrane potential seem problematic in the current study. For example, in the first paragraph of the subsection “TCPTP defines POMC neurons that are activated or inhibited by insulin”, POMC neurons after insulin stimulation exhibited an averaged membrane potential of -40.1+/-2.5 mV; in the next paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, excited neurons had a membrane potential as depolarized as -37.9+/-1.7 mV. How could POMC neurons be so depolarized?</p><p>2) As shown previously by Padilla, Carmody and Zeltser, et al. (Nat Med 2010, and in a more convincing way recently by Xu et al., 2018, POMC-Cre exhibited ectopic Cre activity during development, particularly in AgRP neuron. Breeding <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre with floxed mice could yield a manipulation of 25% AgRP neurons as well (Xu et al.). In Figure 1G-H, since the authors used Z/EG reporter instead of <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP transgenic mice to indicate POMC neurons, AgRP neurons were expected to be patched on as well. Since AgRP neurons are known to be inhibited by insulin, the ratio for the insulin-inhibited POMC neurons (12/33, 36.4%) may need to be adjusted.</p><p>3) Subsection “The activation or inhibition of POMC neurons regulates hepatic glucose metabolism”, the authors utilized inhibitory DREADDs to inhibit POMC neurons and included convincing expression data of hM4Di in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. However, a direct test of CNO's activity on POMC neurons with current-clamp recording shall also be included since hM4Di works through the activation of GIRK channels and not all neurons express them. In addition, CNO was recently reported to activate other endogenous receptors as well (Gomez et al., Science 2017). CNO's effects on non-DREADD-expressing animals shall also be included as a control.</p><p>4) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors discussed about the potential mechanisms with regards to synaptic regulation. Deletion of TCPTP in POMC neurons clearly suggested a post-synaptic mechanism but the authors believed in an existence of pre-synaptic regulation. This is confusing. Do the authors think of the involvement of a retrograde mechanism or different action sites of TCPTP from POMC neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This interesting manuscript presents a large amount of information regarding the role of a specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, TCPTP, in the control of insulin responsiveness in POMC neurons in relation to control of systemic insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose metabolism. The data strongly suggest both a key role for TCPTP in the responsiveness of POMC cells to insulin and that enhanced insulin signaling depolarizes and increases the firing of in these neurons, while the opposite effect is observed in POMC neurons with high levels of TCPTP. The data also offer a welcome new perspective on the role of POMC neurons in the control of HGP and a potential resolution to controversy surrounding this issue stemming from earlier work, and the impact of changes in nutritional state on POMC cell insulin responsiveness is also novel and of interest. These considerable strengths are offset to some extent by the following concerns.</p><p>1) A key unanswered question is how increased insulin receptor signal transduction associated with reduced TCPTP is tied to a reversal of the effect of insulin on POMC neuron membrane potential and firing rate (from inhibitory to stimulatory). The authors state that this &quot;phenotype switch&quot; in the insulin response reflects direct (rather than an indirect) effects of insulin, but how increased IR-PI3K-Akt signal transduction in these cells might achieve this effect is unresolved. In an effort to shed light on this key question, the authors investigate whether changes in POMC cell mitochondrial dynamics underlie this phenotype switch. Although changes of insulin responsiveness appear to be coupled to morphological and genomic alterations affecting mitochondria, the data fail to establish a connection between these mitochondrial responses and changes of membrane potential and firing rate. Consequently, the data on mitochondrial dynamics seem somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper, and might be more appropriate for a separate publication.</p><p>2) The authors finding of a robust effect of POMC-specific TCPTP deletion to enhance insulin suppression of HGP begs the question as to what other responses to insulin might also be affected. Given that ICV insulin has previously been reported to reduce food intake, body weight and body adiposity, and that brain-specific IR deletion promotes positive energy balance and weight gain, one wonders whether the effect of ICV insulin on food intake, body weight and body adiposity are also increased. Given the marked improvement of whole-body insulin sensitivity attributed to POMC-specific TCPTP deletion, one also wonders why the basal glucose and insulin levels were not reduced in these animals.</p><p>3) A related question is whether reduced body adiposity results from POMC-specific TCPTP deletion, and if so, did this contribute to enhanced insulin-induced suppression of HGP reported by the authors? Conversely, if POMC-specific TCPTP deletion has no effect on energy balance or body adiposity, this seems surprising given the expected increase of POMC neuron firing.</p><p>4) The question of how pronounced changes of POMC expression of TCPTP are associated with feeding, fasting and DIO was not addressed.

Since POMC-Cre was used to delete TCPTP, one expects the gene to be deleted across multiple arcuate nucleus neuronal cell types. Some effort to address this concern is warranted.</p><p>6) The authors state that diet-induced obesity reduces POMC neuron insulin responsiveness via a mechanism involving induction of TCPTP. Is this effect of DIO causally linked to associated responses such as inflammation, reactive gliosis, ER stress, etc.? Discussion of this question seems warranted.</p><p>7) The authors report (Discussion, last paragraph) that TCPTP deletion has no detectable effect on glucose homeostasis in DIO mice, which they attribute to the fact that other mechanisms can account for impaired POMC insulin responsiveness in this setting. But they stop short of investigating whether TCPTP deletion enhances insulin responsiveness to POMC neurons in this setting. This question should be addressed since, if POMC neuron insulin responsiveness is in fact restored and yet there is no whole-body phenotype, the physiological relevance of POMC neuron insulin responsiveness would be called into question.</p><p>8) What precedent exists for a change in hormone responsiveness reversing its effect on the firing of a distinct neuronal subset? If such a response has been reported previously, was it referred to as &quot;neural plasticity&quot;? Certainly, this is not the type of response that comes to mind in association with that term. In this context, the term &quot;neural plasticity&quot; seems potentially misleading and for this reason, it is recommended that it be removed from the manuscript title.</p><p>9) The effect of IP insulin to induce c-Fos in the PVH (Figure 1M) could have resulted from hypoglycemia, which was presumably well established by 90 min following the dose of insulin that was given. The effect of neuroglucopenia to activate PVH neurons is well established (e.g., Briski, Neuroreport, 1998; Briski, Brain Res Bulletin, 2000; Evans, AJP, 2001), and it is conceivable that changes of POMC cell insulin responsiveness affected the degree of insulin-induced hypoglycemia.</p><p>10) When insulin is given ICV and HGP or other highly insulin-responsive endpoints are measured, it's important to verify that none of the centrally-administered insulin leaked into the periphery to have direct effects on the liver.</p><p>11) Relevant to this point is the use of a study design in which ICV insulin (0.1 mU) or vehicle was given as 5 separate injections over 5 hours. It is difficult to imagine that 5 ICV injections over 5 hours would be well-tolerated, which in turn raises the possibility that the authors were inadvertently measuring the impact of insulin on a stress response, which might explain the basal hyperglycemia reported in some studies. Beyond this, insulin in CSF has a relatively long half-life, so it's not clear why a repeated injection protocol over 5 hours was required. Were the animals anesthetized during this period?

By comparison, basal glucose levels of 7 mM are reported for the same test in Figure 2J, and are uniformly &lt;10 mM in all other such studies (Figures 4, 5 and 6). This discrepancy is all the more notable in light of the remarkably small variances (SEMs) around the glucose data, which is inconsistent with known biological variability inherent in the response.</p><p>13) The Discussion is longer than it need be, and tends to reiterate points made in the Results section.

It was not possible to assemble the comments into a few key points for consideration (eLife normal procedure) because the three reviewers had non-overlapping concerns. Thus, all of the comments are included below. The reviewers had a number of concerns that can, in general, be addressed without further experiments. However, explanations of the many points raised are necessary and caveats to the data interpretation should be included. Additional experiments that address concerns are, of course, welcome.</p><p>One issue raised by reviewers is that the use of Pomc-Cre mice is problematic because Cre recombinase is activated in neurons that go to develop into AgRP (and other) neurons.

Accordingly our studies defining the existence of POMC neurons that are activated or inhibited by insulin, the increased proportion of activated POMC neurons after TCPTP inhibition, the decreased proportion of POMC neurons in obesity that is corrected by TCPTP inhibition and the capacity of activating and inhibitory DREADDs to alter glucose metabolism are not compromised by the off target effects of the <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre transgene. Collectively, our studies are entirely consistent with alterations in insulin-induced POMC neuronal excitability regulating hepatic glucose metabolism, but we have acknowledged that some of the effects on glucose metabolism in POMC-TC mice might be due to deletion in AgRP/NPY neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other issue is that the mitochondria data are correlative and do not provide compelling evidence linking mitochondrial dynamics and glucose regulation.

In particular, the authors compare the number (population size) of POMC neurons that are activated, inhibited or unresponsive to insulin amongst a number of experimental settings. Table 1 provides statistical comparisons for some of these studies, but not all (only for KO's and double Ko's).

However, the results of membrane potential seem problematic in the current study. For example, in the first paragraph of the subsection “TCPTP defines POMC neurons that are activated or inhibited by insulin”, POMC neurons after insulin stimulation exhibited an averaged membrane potential of -40.1+/-2.5 mV; in the next paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, excited neurons had a membrane potential as depolarized as -37.9+/-1.7 mV. How could POMC neurons be so depolarized?</p></disp-quote><p>The data are presented as the absolute read-out at the time of experiments and do not account for the liquid junction potential, which for our recording conditions amounts to 10/11mV. Thus, the values are depolarised.

(Nat Med 2010, and in a more convincing way recently by Xu et al., 2018, POMC-Cre exhibited ectopic Cre activity during development, particularly in AgRP neuron. Breeding Pomc-Cre with floxed mice could yield a manipulation of 25% AgRP neurons as well (Xu et al.). In Figure 1G-H, since the authors used Z/EG reporter instead of Pomc-eGFP transgenic mice to indicate POMC neurons, AgRP neurons were expected to be patched on as well. Since AgRP neurons are known to be inhibited by insulin, the ratio for the insulin-inhibited POMC neurons (12/33, 36.4%) may need to be adjusted.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Editors. The reviewer is correct. Although we have discussed the caveat associated with the off-target effects of the <italic>Pomc</italic>-Cre transgene in POMC-TC mice on glucose metabolism in the Discussion and included a specific statement in the results highlighting the fact that we cannot exclude a proportion of inhibited neurons being AgRP neurons, we are reluctant to retrospectively adjust the number of neurons inhibited by insulin in POMC-TC;ZE/G mice without staining for NPY/AgRP neurons. Irrespective this would only under represent the number of POMC neurons being activated by insulin. Moreover to complement our findings we have also assessed POMC neuronal excitation/inhibition in <italic>Pomc</italic>-eGFP mice treated with the TCPTP inhibitor where we similarly show that TCPTP inhibition is accompanied by an increase in POMC neurons being activated by insulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “The activation or inhibition of POMC neurons regulates hepatic glucose metabolism”, the authors utilized inhibitory DREADDs to inhibit POMC neurons and included convincing expression data of hM4Di in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

These previous studies showed conclusively that in response to CNO administration, hM4Di attenuates c-Fos expression (a surrogate marker of neuronal activity) in ARC POMC neurons and reduces POMC neuronal firing rate as determined by current-clamp recordings. We have also conducted further electrophysiological experiments showing POMC neurons that do not express hM4Di, fail to respond to CNO.

Deletion of TCPTP in POMC neurons clearly suggested a post-synaptic mechanism but the authors believed in an existence of pre-synaptic regulation. This is confusing.

Our EM analyses indicated that there was no overt change in relative excitatory and inhibitory inputs into POMC perikarya.

We found that glucose infusion rates were significantly increased in POMC-TC mice (Figure 7G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1E), consistent with enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity.

However, the term plasticity itself by definition refers to changes in neuronal function, be it learning and memory, development whatever. This is clearly as we have seen in our study in relation to hormone responsiveness and therefore we consider the term entirely appropriate. Clearly these neurons do show plasticity in their responsiveness to hormones, which leads to changes in physiological function. Whilst we understand the referee’s point of view in that tradition has restricted the use of the term to phenomena such as LTP and LTD etc. we believe our use of the term to relate to functional plasticity of hormone responsiveness under a range of physiological conditions entirely appropriate. With regards to precedents for this, hormone responsiveness (noradrenaline) has previously been shown to reverse (excitation to inhibition) in orexin neurons following a short period of sleep deprivation (Grivel et al., 2005). In a metabolic context, glucose sensing responses in ARC neurons change depending on metabolic status in an energy-status-dependent manner (van den Top et al., 2017). These studies show a functional plasticity in these neural populations and set a precedence for such changes in response to hormones or nutrients in specific neuronal populations. We also believe that we are leading the way in driving awareness of the functional, energy-status-dependent plasticity of energy-sensing neural networks. We therefore respectfully consider our use of this term is entirely appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The effect of IP insulin to induce c-Fos in the PVH (Figure 1M) could have resulted from hypoglycemia, which was presumably well established by 90 min following the dose of insulin that was given.
