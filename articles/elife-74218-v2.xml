Central to the sensing of DSBs is the ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family. In response to DSBs, ATM is activated by the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) protein complex through a poorly understood process that also requires double-stranded DNA. Previous studies indicate that the FxF/Y motif of Nbs1 directly binds to ATM, and is required to retain active ATM at sites of DNA damage. Here, we report the 2.5 Å resolution cryo-EM structures of human ATM and its complex with the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif. In keeping with previous structures of ATM and its yeast homolog Tel1, the dimeric human ATM kinase adopts a symmetric, butterfly-shaped structure. The conformation of the ATM kinase domain is most similar to the inactive states of other PIKKs, suggesting that activation may involve an analogous realigning of the N and C lobes along with relieving the blockage of the substrate-binding site. We also show that the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif binds to a conserved hydrophobic cleft within the Spiral domain of ATM, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of activation. We evaluate the importance of these structural findings with mutagenesis and biochemical assays.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F32CA247320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pavletich</surname><given-names>Nikola P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structures of the human ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase alone and bound to the C-terminus of Nbs1 show the mechanisms underlying ATM autoinhibition and binding by a portion of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) activating complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a large protein kinase with a central role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and related genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiloh, 2006</xref>). Mutations in ATM are responsible for Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), which is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, sensitivity to radiation, and cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savitsky et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>ATM, which belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savitsky et al., 1995</xref>), is essential for the sensing of DSBs during the cell cycle. It functions in association with the MRN protein complex consisting of the Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Syed and Tainer, 2018</xref>). MRN contributes to the localization of ATM to DSBs, and together with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), it activates ATM as a protein kinase. ATM then phosphorylates a wide range of downstream effector proteins, such as p53, Chk2, Brca2, and H2A.X, leading to the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and homology-directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinkelmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paull, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uziel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Paull, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>). Mutations in all three members of the MRN complex cause disorders that are phenotypically similar to AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Digweed and Sperling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ragamin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The MRN complex rapidly associates with DNA ends upon DSB formation, and it is a known component of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lukas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haince et al., 2008</xref>). The Mre11 subunit has endonuclease and exonuclease activities that are implicated in DNA end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myler et al., 2017</xref>), although nuclease-inactive mutants in yeast have only mild defects in responding to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). Rad50 is a member of the structural maintenance of chromatin (SMC) family of proteins. It contains an ATPase domain, a long antiparallel coiled coil, and a zinc hook domain that is thought to tether multiple MRN complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Jager et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hopfner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno-Herrero et al., 2005</xref>). Nbs1 contains N-terminal FHA and BRCT domains that are required for association with phosphorylated proteins such as H2A.X, CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP), and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (Mdc1) at IRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spycher et al., 2008</xref>). While the C-terminal half of Nbs1 is largely disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2009</xref> it contains short sequence motifs for binding to Mre11 and ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">You et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The activation of ATM by MRN is incompletely understood. The yeast homolog of ATM, Tel1, can associate with each of the individual subunits of the corresponding Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailemariam et al., 2019</xref>). In the yeast system, Xrs2 is required for Tel1 recruitment to DSBs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2018</xref>), but in vitro Tel1 activation appears more dependent on Rad50, as either Rad50-Mre11 or Rad50-Xrs2 but not Mre11-Xrs2 can partially activate Tel1 in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailemariam et al., 2019</xref>). The ATM-binding segment of Nbs1 has been mapped to a sequence motif termed FxF/Y (residues 740–749) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">You et al., 2005</xref>). Those of Mre11 and Rad50 have not yet been identified. The Nbs1 FxF/Y motif is necessary for ATM recruitment to MRN-bound DSBs and for ATM activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">You et al., 2005</xref> and human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falck et al., 2005</xref>). However, FxF/Y deletion affects only a subset of the checkpoint functions, with non-uniform effects on downstream substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falck et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, fibroblasts from mice harboring an Nbs1 C-terminal deletion (Nbs1<sup>∆C/∆C</sup>) do not display overt sensitivity to IR, although they exhibit defective intra-S phase checkpoint activation, apoptosis induction, and phosphorylation of a subset of ATM targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stracker et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the ATM-Nbs1 interaction is not strictly required to initiate ATM activation, but it is likely necessary to stabilize activated ATM at sites of DNA damage and is critical for certain ATM-mediated checkpoint functions. This may reflect the ability of the remaining MRN subunits to also interact with ATM, or additional factors within IRIFs may aid in the recruitment of ATM in vivo to partially compensate for the loss of the Nbs1 C-terminus.</p><p>Along with ATM, the PIKK family also includes ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, SMG1, and TRRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imseng et al., 2018</xref>). These mammalian PIKKs coordinate diverse cellular processes, with ATR involved in the response to collapsed replication forks, DNA-PKcs in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), mTOR in metabolism and cellular homeostasis, SMG1 in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and the catalytically inactive TRRAP in scaffolding chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lovejoy and Cortez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baretić and Williams, 2014</xref>). Like ATM, these PIKK kinases are switched on by binding to their cognate activating proteins or protein complexes. The PIKKs share sequence homology across their C-terminal portion that consists of the ~700-residue FAT domain (residues 1899–2613 of ATM) and subsequent ~400-residue kinase domain (KD; residues 2614–3056 of ATM). Their N-terminal regions are divergent, and they adopt α−α solenoid structures typically consisting of two or more helical-repeat domains.</p><p>The cryo-EM structure of human ATM, based on a reconstruction of 4.4 Å to 5.7 Å resolution, showed that it forms a dimer through interactions between the FAT domains and also between the FAT and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>). The FAT-KD interactions involve a region of the KD, termed the PRD (PIKK Regulatory Domain), that sequesters the putative polypeptide substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langer et al., 2020</xref>), as deduced from comparisons to canonical protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1999</xref>). This arrangement was thus suggested to maintain ATM in an inactive state by inhibiting substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>). The N-terminal α−α solenoids are uninvolved in dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>). A subsequent cryo-EM analysis reported a monomeric form at 7.8 Å resolution, in addition to the canonical dimer at 4.3 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). The Tel1 homolog has been amenable to higher resolution structure determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xin et al., 2019</xref>), with recent structures of the <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> and <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Tel1 reported at overall resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.9 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2020</xref>). These Tel1 structures exhibited similar dimerization interfaces as ATM, including the region that blocks part of the putative substrate-binding site. Based on the higher resolutions of the Tel1 reconstructions, it was suggested that the kinase active site residues are in a catalytically competent organization, with the implication that the inaccessibility of the substrate-binding site is the primary mechanism of keeping ATM inactive. While Tel1 and ATM share a similar structural organization, the N-terminal ~1,800 residues preceding the FAT domain do not have detectable sequence homology.</p><p>Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human ATM as well as the structure of ATM bound to a peptide containing the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif, both at an overall resolution of 2.5 Å. The organization of residues in the ATM catalytic cleft are very similar to those of the inactive states of mTOR and DNA-PKcs, the two PIKKs for which high-resolution structures have been reported for both the inactive and active states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sibanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaplin et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, ATM does not exhibit the conformational change that is characteristic of the active states of mTOR and DNA-PKcs kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sibanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). Together with biochemical data, this suggests that activation of ATM by MRN may involve a conformational change that, in addition to relieving the partial blockage of the substrate-binding site, also realigns catalytic residues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the human ATM dimer</title><p>FLAG-tagged ATM was purified from a stably-transfected cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The mobility originates in part from flexibility within the Pincer domain, which forms the elbow-like structure of the α-solenoid arm that extends from the N-terminus to the start of the FAT domain.

The majority of these intermolecular interactions are van der Waals contacts by hydrophobic residues, along with a small hydrogen bond network and electrostatic interactions at the periphery of the hydrophobic residues. Additional buried intermolecular salt bridges between highly conserved residues Arg2032-Glu2272 and Lys2044-Glu2304 likely function to further stabilize the dimer interface.</p><p>TRD3, which is composed of 10 α helices (fα13 to fα22), accounts for the largest number of dimerization contacts and for slightly over half the surface area buried. In addition to the aforementioned TRD3-TRD2 intermolecular contacts, TRD3 also contacts the kinase domain of the second protomer. These contacts, which account for approximately one-quarter (~930 Å<sup>2</sup>) of the surface area buried on dimerization, involve a C lobe surface patch that extends to the edge of the catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). The most prominent interactions are made by the TRD3 fα21-fα22 helices, which form a long coiled coil that extends across the dimer interface and packs with the C lobe near the catalytic cleft. These contacts are centered on the C lobe kα9b helix (prefix ‘k’ denotes kinase domain helices) that is part of the PRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

A second set of contacts, made by the TRD3 helices fα19 to fα20, are centered on the FATC kα11 helix located at the end of the C lobe patch, distal from the catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The FAT domain thus appears to serve multiple functions: it clamps down on the KD N and C lobes in an arrangement thought to be critical in stabilizing the inactive KD conformation of other PIKKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), it is critical for the dimerization of ATM, and it may help stabilize the kα9b conformation that occludes the putative substrate-binding site of the other protomer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Kinase domain conformation</title><p>The binding of the AMP-PNP cofactor to the catalytic cleft is overall similar to those of other PIKKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>).

Whether the lysine residue has an analogous role in PIKKs is not yet known. In addition to this lysine residue, canonical kinases have an N lobe β hairpin, rich in glycine residues, that packs against the phosphate groups when both the ATP and peptide substrates are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knighton et al., 1991</xref>).

As with previous studies of ATM and Tel1, these loops are well ordered and their catalytic residues show clear density in our maps. The catalytic loop contains Asp2870, Asn2875 (a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ligand) and His2872. Asp2870 acts as the catalytic base to deprotonate and likely orient the hydroxyl group of the incoming substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vadas et al., 2011</xref>) and His2872 is thought to stabilize the transition state of the phosphoryl transfer reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The activation loop is named for its conformational change in the activation of canonical kinases, where it makes up part of the polypeptide substrate-binding site. Previous studies showed that the activation loop of ATM/Tel1 packs with the kα9b helix of the PRD, and by analogy to canonical kinases it was suggested that the kα9b helix may block substrate binding. This was recently confirmed by the cryo-EM analysis of the PIKK Smg1, which, like ATM, is specific for a glutamine residue in the position (P<sub>+1</sub>) after the serine/threonine phosphorylation site. In the Smg1-UPF1 substrate structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langer et al., 2020</xref>), the glutamine side chain of the peptide substrate makes a pair of hydrogen bonds to backbone amide and carbonyl groups on the activation loop. This interaction is effectively mimicked in our ATM structure by the side chain of Gln2971 on the kα9b helix of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that the Tel1/ATM active site residues are in a catalytically competent conformation, and thus the occlusion of the substrate-binding site would be the main mechanism of keeping the kinase autoinhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2020</xref>). However, studies of mTOR have shown its activation involves a conformational change in the FAT domain, which in turn allows the KD N and C lobes to move relative to each other. This results in the realignment of catalytic residues on the N and C lobes relative to each other, bringing them into the correct register for efficient catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The recently reported active-state structure of DNA-PKcs recapitulates the N-C lobe conformational change on activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>), raising the possibility that this is a common activation mechanism of PIKKs, irrespective of their distinct activators and N-terminal solenoid structures to which these activators bind.</p><p>Thus, to help evaluate whether the ATM active site residues are in a catalytically competent conformation, we superimposed the KD domains of ATM, mTOR and DNA-PKcs, the latter two in both their active and inactive conformations, by aligning their C lobe catalytic and activation loops. In this superposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), the ATM N lobe is positioned remarkably similar to those of inactive mTOR and inactive DNA-PKcs, with the three N lobes forming a tightly clustered set clearly distinct from the cluster of active mTOR and active DNA-PKcs N lobes. The positions of the N lobe hairpin and other ATP-interacting residues relative to the C lobe catalytic and magnesium-coordinating residues are much closer to those of the inactive mTOR and DNA-PKcs structures compared the active ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). This positioning thus suggests that in addition to relieving the blockage of the substrate-binding site, the activation of ATM may well involve a conformational change within the FAT domain and the associated change in the relative orientation of the N and C lobes of the kinase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure of ATM bound to the C-terminus of Nbs1</title><p>Previous studies indicated that the Xrs2 C-terminal FxF/Y motif and the acidic region that immediately precedes it bind to two Tel1 regions spanning the Spiral and Pincer domains near the elbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">You et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The initial map had additional density, absent in the apo ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), at the ATM Spiral domain.

After focused refinements of the ATM Spiral domain, we built a 10-residue Nbs1 segment (<sup>740</sup>ADDLFRYNPY<sup>749</sup>) into the improved density guided by the unambiguous density of the side chains for Phe744 and Tyr746. According to local resolution estimation, the focused reconstruction has a resolution better than ~3.5 Å in the central portions of the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). There is no interpretable density for residues 727–739 preceding the built segment or residues 750–754 after. We note that in contrast to previous yeast two-hybrid assays indicating that the C-terminus of Xrs2 interacts with both the Spiral and Pincer domains of Tel1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">You et al., 2005</xref>), we find no evidence of the ATM Pincer domain being involved in binding to the Nbs1 peptide.</p><p>The Nbs1 peptide adopts an overall extended conformation except for one turn of a 3<sub>10</sub> helix in the middle (residues Asp742 to Arg745; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). It binds to a hydrophobic groove between two helical repeats formed by helices sα39 to sα42 (denoted ‘s’ for Spiral domain helices). The most extensive ATM contacts are made by Nbs1 Leu743 and Phe744, which pack together preceding the 3<sub>10</sub> helix. Phe744 inserts deepest into the hydrophobic groove and makes van der Waals contacts to the side chains of Ser978, Arg981, Cys987, Val1021, Ala1024, Phe1025, Leu1028, and Tyr1034 of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Leu743, which is closer to the solvent exposed surface of the ATM groove, packs with Ala1024, Leu1028, and His1027 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Of the two acidic residues that precede the Leu743-Phe744 pair, Asp741 hydrogen bonds with Ser978 and Arg981, while Asp742 is solvent exposed and uninvolved in ATM contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Arg745, the last residue of the 3<sub>10</sub> helix, has weaker side chain density, although its guanidinum group is positioned between the side chains of Asn975 and Ser978 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Tyr746 is the last Nbs1 residue that contacts ATM. Its side chain, which is stabilized by intramolecular stacking with Pro748, packs with side chain and backbone groups of Gly1016, Gln1017, and Thr1020 of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p><p>The ATM residues that make up the Nbs1 binding site, and in particular those at the Leu743-Phe744 binding pocket, are highly conserved compared to the rest of Spiral domain residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, many of these ATM residues have been found mutated in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D and E</xref>). Ser978 is a hotspot for cancer-associated missense mutations and the structure suggests that the S978P mutation would disrupt the sα39 helix that forms part of the Nbs1-binding site, whereas S978A and S978Y would eliminate the interactions of Ser978 with Asp741 of Nbs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D and E</xref>). Other cancer-associated missense mutations at the Nbs1 binding groove occur at lower frequencies. The structure suggests that the S974F mutation, in a region of limited solvent accessibility due to the Nc28 peptide, would likely cause a steric clash either with Arg745 of Nbs1 or other ATM backbone and side chain groups; R981C/H would eliminate the contact to Asp 741 of Nbs1; C987Y/W and F1025S/L, which map to a local hydrophobic core behind the sα39 and sα42 helices, would disrupt the structural integrity of the binding site of Nbs1 Phe744 and its vicinity. The abundance of mutations at the Nbs1-binding site suggest that the ATM-Nc28 interaction is functionally important for the ATM-mediated DNA damage response. Reported mutations in Nbs1 are fewer, but include the F744L mutation that would disrupt the most critical portion of the ATM-Nc28 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5F</xref>).</p><p>The ATM structural elements at the Nbs1 binding site, including the hydrophobic pocket and adjacent cleft, are nearly identical in both the apo and Nc28-bound structures, indicating that Nc28 binding does not induce any noticeable structural rearrangements to this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, no significant changes to the structure of the kinase domain were observed when comparing the unbound and Nc28-bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Consistent with these observations and with reports that ATM activation requires all three members of the MRN complex and dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>), we observed no increase in ATM catalytic activity in steady-state kinase assays containing high concentrations of this peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Finally, although previous studies suggest that the Nbs1 C-terminus may interact with the ATM FATC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogi et al., 2015</xref>), we observe no additional electron density within this region of ATM despite our sample containing a large molar excess of the Nc28 peptide.</p><p>The N-terminal acidic half of the peptide is not visible in our map. However, the orientation of the visible portion indicates that it likely extends into a basic patch created by ATM residues Arg981, Arg982, and Lys1033, raising the possibility that the acidic residue clusters (Glu728, Glu736, and Glu737) contribute to binding through long-range electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Alternatively, the acidic residues may engage in ATM interactions in the context of the intact MRN complex. Similarly, while the C-terminal 4 residues of Nbs1 (<sup>750</sup>LKRRR<sup>754</sup>) are also not visible, they would be in the vicinity of an acidic patch of ATM (Glu964, Asp965, Asp1007, Glu1009, and Asp1013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the relative contributions of the ATM-Nbs1 contacts, we made several mutations in the FxF/Y motif and tested the ability of these mutant peptides to bind to ATM in a GST pull-down assay. Four mutations (F744A, R745A, Y746A, and <sup>744</sup>FRY<sup>746</sup> to <sup>744</sup>AAA<sup>746</sup>) were introduced into a GST-tagged polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 147 residues of Nbs1 (GST-Nc147). While the wild-type GST-Nc147 and the R745A mutant both enriched for ATM in pull-down assays, all other mutations disrupted this interaction at least partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). F744A and FRY to AAA mutations appeared to disrupt the interaction almost completely, whereas Y746A showed an intermediate effect. These results indicate that Nbs1 Phe744 is central to ATM binding, Tyr746 clearly contributes, while Arg745 makes at most a minor contribution in our assay.</p><p>The Mre11 binding motif of Nbs1 (residues 682–693) is located approximately 60 residues N-terminal to the FxF/Y motif, indicating that the MRN complex likely binds along the Spiral and/or Pincer domains of ATM. Interestingly, we mapped multiple patches of conserved residues to the inner portion of the Spiral domain α-solenoid, which may represent binding sites for MRN-dsDNA or other effector proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Notably, the Nbs1 interaction site is located over 100 Å away from the active site. This is reminiscent of mTOR and DNA-PKcs, whose activators, respectively Rheb and Ku-DNA, bind far from the KD and activate their respective kinases allosterically<sup>42,44</sup>. This mechanism would suggest that the full MRN-dsDNA complex induces structural changes that are transmitted through the Spiral and Pincer domains to the FATKD, although the Rad50 coiled coil domain may be long enough to extend from the head of the MRN complex and make direct contacts to the KD and/or FATC to promote activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Biochemical analysis of MRN-mediated ATM activation and the role of the Nbs1 C-terminus</title><p>To better understand how human ATM kinase is activated and to further evaluate the role of the Nbs1 C-terminus, we expressed the human MRN complex in mammalian cells via transfection of a polycistronic vector (see Materials and methods) and purified it to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Each protein contains a C-terminal FLAG tag and Mre11 harbors the H129N mutation, which abolishes nuclease activity without interfering with DNA binding and ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buis et al., 2008</xref>). We first evaluated the effect of increasing concentrations of the purified MRN complex on ATM activity using a substrate peptide from p53, whose phosphorylation by ATM activates the transcription program associated with the G1/S DNA-damage checkpoint. In keeping with findings with the Tel1-MRX homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailemariam et al., 2019</xref>), MRN alone stimulated the ATM kinase activity only modestly, by a factor of ~4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of MRN was ~27 nM, indicative of a high affinity for ATM.</p><p>We next tested linear dsDNA fragments of lengths ranging from 100 to 2000 base pairs (bp) for their ability to stimulate ATM (25 nM) in the presence of MRN (250 nM; concentration ~10 fold above its EC<sub>50</sub> toward ATM alone). The dsDNA fragments were added at a constant base-pair concentration of 3.85 µM (2.5 ng/µL of each fragment). dsDNA lengths greater than ~200 bp lead to maximal ATM activation, representing an additional ~25 fold increase in p53 phosphorylation relative to ATM-MRN alone, or a ~100 fold increase relative to ATM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This dsDNA length dependency for ATM-MRN activation is qualitatively similar to that reported for the Tel1-MRX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailemariam et al., 2019</xref>). We then performed a dose response analysis for dsDNA of 100, 250 and 500 bps lengths. 250 and 500 bp dsDNA fragments stimulated with very similar EC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.8 nM and 1.5 nM, while stimulation by 100 bp dsDNA fragment was a factor of 5 lower compared to the maximal levels of the longer DNA fragments, even at the ~1000 fold higher concentration of 2.3 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that the low-level activation of shorter dsDNA fragments is likely not due to their reduced affinity for ATM-MRN, and that structural aspects of longer DNA, such as the ability to span an extended binding site across the ATM dimer or to link distal binding sites on ATM-MRN, may be important. Stimulation by dsDNA is strictly dependent on the presence of the MRN complex, as in the absence of MRN, 350 bp dsDNA at a concentration of 25 nM, which is more than 10-fold above the EC<sub>50</sub> of the 250 and 500 bp DNA failed to activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ATM activation requires MRN and long dsDNA, but not the FxF/Y motif of Nbs1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Top</italic>: Steady-state ATM kinase assay using 25 nM ATM, 250 nM MRN, and 25 µM p53 substrate with 2.5 ng/µL of dsDNA of various lengths added. <italic>Bottom</italic>: Quantification of ATM enzymatic velocity as a function of DNA length.

Nevertheless, this conformational flexibility does not translate to any noticeable structural rearrangements within the FATKD segment, nor does it break the inherent symmetry of this segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Previous cryo-EM studies of human ATM and yeast Tel1 have observed asymmetric dimers and monomers, the latter of which was shown to have increased catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>).

While it is not clear how the asymmetric dimers and monomers arise, it is conceivable that expression and purification conditions may play a role.

As the kα9b helix packs with the TRD3 coiled coil of the other protomer in the dimer, an interaction that possibly stabilizes the kα9b conformation, the TRD3 coiled coil was proposed to couple ATM dimerization to autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baretić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The kα9b helix is part of the PRD domain, which was first described based on a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the part of the ATR PIKK that interacts with its activator TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mordes et al., 2008</xref>). The screen led to a minimal ATR fragment that encompasses kα9b and kα10. While scanning mutagenesis identified an ATR kα10 residue that disrupts TopBP1-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mordes et al., 2008</xref>) it is not clear what role kα10 plays in PIKK activation. The mutation (K2589E) maps to a surface residue uninvolved in any interactions in the inactive ATR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), and the corresponding ATM residue (Glu3007) is similarly surface-exposed and devoid of any interactions. In addition, the kα10 helix is an integral part of the PIKK C lobe structure, and it is structurally invariant among inactive and active PIKK structures. It is thus unlikely that kα10 has a significant role in conformationally regulating the kinase. In ATM, the kα9b and kα10 helices are connected by a 27-residue loop (residues 2975–3000) that is not conserved across species and is not visible in our map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). An unstructured loop intervening the kα9b and kα10 helices is present in most PIKK structures reported to date, including a &gt;1000 residue insertion in Smg1<sup>35</sup>.</p><p>In structures of inactive DNA-PKcs, kα9b and subsequent kα9c, a helix unique to DNA-PKcs, also pack against the substrate-binding site and occlude it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sibanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). However, even though DNA-PKcs is glutamine directed as ATM, it does not have the equivalent of the Gln2971-activation loop interaction of ATM. Nevertheless, upon DNA-PKcs activation, the pair of kα9b and kα9c helices move to an alternate packing position on the C lobe and fully expose the substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). The movement of kα9b-kα9c is likely due entirely to the realignment of the N and C lobes of DNA-PKcs, as this segment only interacts with the kinase domain (DNA-PKcs does not have the equivalent of the ATM TRD3 coiled coil packing with and possibly stabilizing kα9b across a dimer interface). By contrast, in mTOR, which is not glutamine directed and instead prefers a hydrophobic residue at the P<sub>+1</sub> position, the kα9b helix does not block the putative substrate-binding site, nor does it change conformation on activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, while kα9b may play a role in the autoinhibition of ATM and a number of other PIKKs, this is not a conserved feature of the PIKK family.</p><p>Rather, several lines of evidence point to the realignment of the N and C lobes of the kinase domain as the key event in the activation of ATM. As discussed above, the relative orientation of the N and C lobes of ATM is remarkably similar to those of the inactive-state mTOR and DNA-PKcs structures, and distinct from those of the active-state counterparts, which cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The proper alignment of the N and C lobes is central to kinase activation, as residues critical for substrate binding and catalysis are distributed across the two lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of a PIKK activation was initially established by comparing the inactive and active states of the mTOR holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). That work pointed to the FAT domain being the key autoinhibitory element that keeps the N and C lobes and their active site residues in an unproductive configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Binding of the mTOR activator, the small GTPase Rheb, causes a motion of the N-heat solenoid (comparable to the ATM Spiral in its location in the primary sequence but not in its structure). The motion of the N-heat solenoid pulls and twists the FAT domain on which it is anchored, causing it to undergo an extensive conformational change. This shifts the HRD of the FAT domain away from the N lobe, allowing the N lobe to relax to a productive configuration relative to the C lobe. The inhibitory effect of the FAT domain is supported by activating mTOR mutations, which map to residues that couple the N and C lobes and the FAT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The recent cryo-EM structures of activated DNA-PKcs recapitulate the FAT conformational change observed in mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). DNA-PKcs activation is triggered by the N-heat solenoid binding to the dsDNA end, stabilized by the Ku70-Ku80 complex. The Ku complex interacts with DNA and the N- and M-heat DNA-PKcs domains, but it also utilizes two flexibly linked elements for additional contacts to DNA-PKcs. These may reflect an initial recruitment interaction, a role that the Nbs1 Nc28 peptide may also be involved in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). On DNA-end binding, the DNA-PKcs N-heat solenoid moves relative to M-heat. As with mTOR, N-heat is anchored on the FAT domain, and its motion allosterically induces a conformational change in the FAT domain that realigns the N and C lobes.</p><p>In both mTOR and DNA-PKcs, the N-heat solenoids that move are anchored on the FAT TRD2-TRD3 interface, at essentially the same location. And, even though their overall N-heat solenoids are structurally distinct, they both use 4-helix bundle followed by a loop to interact with their respective FAT domains. Our ATM structure reveals a remarkably similar interface between the FAT domain and the Pincer (equivalent to M-heat of mTOR and DNA-PKcs) from the same protomer. The similarities include an identical TRD2-TRD3 site of the FAT domain and a 4-helix bundle and loop element from the Pincer that binds to it, in essentially the same configuration as those of mTOR and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Based on this structural conservation and the high level of FAT conservation across the PIKK family, it is conceivable that ATM activation also involves this same mechanistic step, with the activator MRN-dsDNA complex triggering the Pincer to pull on and twist the FAT domain to realign the N and C lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>If movement of the Pincer domain is on the pathway of ATM activation, we presume dsDNA and MRN binding will involve portions of ATM beyond the Spiral that binds to Nc28 and which has been proposed to have site(s) of dsDNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma et al., 2020</xref>. The Spiral has a single, isolated interface with the Pincer domain, and it makes no other interactions to the remainder of the ATM dimer. As such, binding events that are limited to the Spiral would be unlikely to cause a movement or conformational change at the Pincer domain. With mTOR, the activator Rheb bridges one end of the N-heat solenoid to portions of mTOR that are invariant during activation, thus providing a pivot point for the movement of the other N-heat end anchored on the FAT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). While DNA-PKcs is more complex, the extensive interactions of N-heat and M-heat along their solenoids appear to similarly serve as pivot point(s) for the movement of N-heat at its FAT anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). It is thus likely that dsDNA-MRN either engage additional ATM domains beyond the Spiral, or they bridge the two Spiral domains of the dimer in a manner that changes their relative orientation, with the resulting change propagating to the Pincer domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Because the FAT domain plays a central role in the dimerization interface of the inactive ATM dimer, a conformational change in the FAT domain may well affect the relative arrangement of the two ATM protomers. This may disrupt the packing of kα9b with the TRD3 coiled coil from the second protomer, allowing the movement of kα9b to expose the P<sub>+1</sub> substrate-binding site. Our steady state kinetic analysis showed that MRN + dsDNA increases the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value of ATM phosphorylating a p53 substrate by over two orders of magnitude without affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> to H). This mirrors the steady-state kinetic constants of mTOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). However, activation having no effect on the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value was unexpected, given that the presumed binding site for the P<sub>+1</sub> position of the substrate is blocked in the structure. This may be analogous to findings with the canonical Cdk2-CyclinA kinase, which is activated by phosphorylation on its activation loop. Even though phosphorylation reorganizes the substrate-binding site on the Cdk2 activation loop, the majority of the increase in catalytic efficiency is reflected in an increased rate of phosphoryl group transfer step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagopian et al., 2001</xref>). Based on the model proposed for Cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagopian et al., 2001</xref>), it is possible that the blocked P<sub>+1</sub> position in inactive ATM allows substrate binding, but with the phospho-acceptor group in an unfavorable position or orientation that reduces the rate of phosphoryl group transfer.</p><p>In conclusion, our structural data supports the model that activation of the ATM kinase domain may be mechanistically analogous to the activation of mTOR and DNA-PKcs. While it is not known how Rad50 and Mre11 interact with ATM, we find that the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif binds to the ATM Spiral domain, and the Spiral domain of Tel1 was shown to bind to dsDNA independently of MRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansma et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is possible that these Spiral interactions cooperate with additional contacts by MRN to trigger a motion of the Pincer domain. This would then result in a conformational change in the FAT domain that not only realigns the N and C lobes of the kinase domain but also relieves the blockage of the substrate-binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptides, reagents, and antibodies</title><p>A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 28aa of Nbs1 (Nc28) was purchased from Genscript and dissolved in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4 to a concentration of 2 mM as measured by 205 nm absorbance.

For apo-ATM, all processing steps are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>. A total of 8,973 micrographs were selected based on a CTF estimated resolution cutoff of 10 Å. ~2.5 million particles were autopicked using 2D templates generated from a previously collected, smaller ATM dataset collected using a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Picked particles were cleaned by multiple rounds of binned and unbinned 2D and 3D classifications. The remaining ~1.5 million particles were subjected to two rounds of per-particle Bayesian training, polishing and CTF refinement taking per particle astigmatism and beam tilt into account. Additional rounds of 2D and 3D classifications were performed after polishing to remove truncated ATM dimers. The resulting 303,604 particles were refined while applying C2 symmetry to an overall resolution of 2.5 Å. An additional round of 3D classification using six classes was performed to subclassify the overall ATM dimer particles into open and closed states. The most open class containing 44,152 particles and the most closed class containing 44,114 particles were each refined while applying C2 symmetry to an overall resolution of 2.7 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively. For each particle set (overall, open, and closed), partial signal subtraction and symmetry expansion procedures were performed to align the ATM protomer using a soft mask generated from an initial build of the ATM protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheres, 2016</xref>). Refinements were performed using masks generated for the overall promoter, N-terminal solenoids (roughly corresponding to residues 1–1588), and FAT + Kinase domains including FAT-proximal portions of the N-terminal solenoids (roughly corresponding to residues 1588–3056). An initial model was docked into each focused map in Chimera software, and focused maps were combined using the combine_focused_maps tool in Phenix software with the local_weighting flag set to True and local_residues set to 10. The final overall, open, and closed protomers were iteratively built and refined against these composite maps using Coot and Phenix software. All structure and model-to-map validations were performed using Molprobity tools as implemented in Phenix software using composite protomer maps.

A total of 6,531 micrographs were selected based on a CTF estimated resolution cutoff of 5 Å. ~2 million particles were autopicked using 2D templates generated from a previous ATM dataset collected using a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Picked particles were cleaned by multiple rounds of binned and unbinned 2D and 3D classifications, with truncated ATM dimers removed prior to polishing. The remaining 287,615 particles were subjected to 2 rounds of per-particle Bayesian training, polishing and CTF refinement also taking per particle astigmatism and beam tilt into account. The polished particles were refined while applying C2 symmetry to an overall resolution of 2.5 Å. Partial signal subtraction, symmetry expansion, and focused refinement procedures were performed in the same manner as unbound ATM. Focused maps were combined in the same manner as unbound ATM, and an initial model was refined against the composite map. At this stage, we identified extra density adjacent to a hydrophobic cleft in the Spiral domain of ATM. A 7-residue segment (<sup>742</sup>DLFRYNP<sup>748</sup>) of the Nbs1 peptide had unambiguous density, especially for Phe744, Tyr746, and Pro748, and it was built into the map. Because the peptide density level was lower than the surrounding ATM density, we performed 3D classification without alignment to separate Nc28-bound and unbound particles using RELION. For this, we used the initial Nc28 model to generate a soft mask around this area including ATM residues 917–1101, and we performed iterative rounds of focused 3D classification without alignment using particles pre-aligned on the Spiral domain, with three classes and tau_fudge factor set to between 150–600. After multiple rounds of 3D local classification, one class containing ~75% of the original symmetry-expanded set of particles (481,066 particles) had strong density within the pocket. Focused refinements were repeated and maps were again combined using this subset of particles. The peptide density was better defined in the resulting composite map and we were able to extended the Nbs1 model to 10-residues (<sup>740</sup>ADDLFRYNPY<sup>749</sup>). The final protomer was built and refined against this composite protomer map using Coot and Phenix software.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The kinase reactions are missing an important control: Please provide a phosphorylation reaction with DNA, MRN and no ATM. This will exclude that MRN co-purified with a contaminating kinase (as noted e.g. by the Burgers laboratory in yeast).</p><p>2) Since ATM has structural analogies to ATR and PRD is important for ATR activation, the authors could further discuss the PRD activation in ATM, e.g., the equivalent mutant (K3016 in ATM?) of K2589E in ATR, or others? There are also evident structural analogies with DNA-PKcs. On the most basic scale there appear to be parallels between the DNA binding sensor and the flexible attachment to the PIKK could the authors discuss this in the paper for readers striving to understand how this important new structure impacts understanding for this key kinase family?</p><p>3) Although disruption of the Nbs1 peptide binding site does not seem to greatly affect ATM activation by MRN, could the authors discuss and/or test if any of the cancer mutations around the Nbs1 binding site impact ATM activity? Here background discussion could be strengthened. Substantial structural and biological information exists for MRN, so readers might benefit from citing a suitable review on this dynamic complex (e.g. PMID: 29709199 DOI: 10.1146/annurev-biochem-062917-012415) and also on the biochemical and biological results on ATM activation (e.g. PMID: 25580527 DOI: 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034335). The Nbs1 structured domains and C-terminal disorder were originally experimentally defined in the Nbs1 structure paper by combined X-ray crystallography and X-ray scattering, and this could be cited (PMID: 19804755 DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.033) and discussed in the Nbs1 peptide choice.</p><p>4) Comment on the local resolution in the region where the peptide has been built, although overall 2.6 A resolution from Figure S9 that region looks closer to 4.7-5 A?</p><p>Comment on the ease and confidence of building the peptide, it looks like it was based on density for the Phe and Tyr? It also looks like from opening the map and pdb in coot and chimera that the peptide could fit into the density better – Arg 745 and Pro 748 need to be moved into the density more – you can see this is Figure 4C (right).</p><p>Comment on the percentage of particles which went into the peptide bound structure, did you observe any without peptide bound in this dataset?</p><p>Add cryo-EM view distribution to show preferred orientation – this is now standard for cryo-EM data. 262 (page 13): typo: would the main mechanism</p><p>5) ATM activation by MRN requires long DNA (&gt;200 bp).

Other cancer-associated missense mutations at the Nbs1 binding groove occur at lower frequencies. The structure suggests that the S974F mutation, in a region of limited solvent accessibility due to the Nc28 peptide, would likely cause a steric clash either with Arg745 of Nbs1 or other ATM backbone and side chain groups; R981C/H would eliminate the contact to Asp 741 of Nbs1; C987Y/W and F1025S/L, which map to a local hydrophobic core behind the sα39 and sα42 helices, would disrupt the structural integrity of the binding site of Nbs1 Phe744 and its vicinity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here background discussion could be strengthened.
