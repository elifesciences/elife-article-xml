outer surface membrane (OSM), but how their location impacts their function is unknown. Here, we developed a technology based on size exclusion to explore the function of β-ARs located in the OSM. We synthesized a PEG-Iso molecule by covalently linking isoprenaline (Iso) to a 5000 Da PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG) chain to increase the size of the β-AR agonist and prevent it from accessing the T-tubule network. The affinity of PEG-Iso and Iso on β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs was measured using radioligand binding. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess PEG-Iso conformation and visualize the accessibility of the Iso moiety to water. Using confocal microscopy, we show that PEGylation constrains molecules outside the T-tubule network of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) due to the presence of the extracellular glycocalyx. β-AR activation in OSM with PEG-Iso produced a lower stimulation of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> than Iso but a larger stimulation of cytosolic PKA at equivalent levels of [cAMP]<sub>I</sub> and similar effects on excitation–contraction coupling parameters. However, PEG-Iso produced a much lower stimulation of nuclear cAMP and PKA than Iso. Thus, OSM β-ARs in ARVMs control mainly cytosolic cAMP/PKA pathway and contractility, while TTM β-ARs control mainly nuclear cAMP, PKA, and consequent nuclear protein phosphorylation. Size exclusion strategy using ligand PEGylation provides a unique approach to evaluate the respective contribution of T-tubule vs. OSM proteins in cardiac cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T-tubules</kwd><kwd>membrane compartmentation</kwd><kwd>β-adrenergic receptors</kwd><kwd>PEGylation</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>cyclic AMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moine</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsapis</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischmeister</surname><given-names>Rodolphe</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha-Duong</surname><given-names>Tâp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04w6kn183</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barthé</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0003-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moine</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsapis</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischmeister</surname><given-names>Rodolphe</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha-Duong</surname><given-names>Tâp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE14-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moine</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsapis</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischmeister</surname><given-names>Rodolphe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-23-CE14-0027-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iturrioz</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha-Duong</surname><given-names>Tâp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00h5ca650</institution-id><institution>Fondation Lefoulon-Delalande</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madders</surname><given-names>George WP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A size exclusion strategy using PEGylation of isoprenaline allowed to demonstrate that cardiac β-adrenergic receptors located in the outer surface membrane control mainly cAMP/PKA in the cytosol while those located in the T-tubule membrane control cAMP/PKA in the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) is a key player in the regulation of cardiac function during sympathetic nerve stimulation. The classical pathway for β-AR receptor signaling is activation of adenylyl cyclases (AC) via G<sub>αs</sub>, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels ([cAMP]<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>). Three types of β-ARs are expressed in the heart, respectively, β<sub>1</sub>-, β<sub>2</sub>-, and β<sub>3</sub>-ARs. β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs are both positively coupled to the AC/cAMP cascade and involved in cardiac performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xiang, 2011</xref>) while β<sub>3</sub>-ARs may act via either cAMP or cGMP depending on the cell type (atrial vs. ventricular myocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schobesberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skeberdis et al., 2008</xref>). The primary target of cAMP is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that in turn phosphorylates several key proteins involved in the excitation–contraction (EC) coupling, such as the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2), phospholamban, and troponin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bers, 2002</xref>). The phosphorylation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 or its regulatory protein Rad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leroy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) leads to enhanced LTCC current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub>) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via the ryanodine type 2 receptor (RyR2), contributing to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eisner et al., 2017</xref>). Phosphorylation of phospholamban increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the SR, which accelerates Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decay and, together with troponin I phosphorylation, speeds up relaxation. Whereas short-term stimulation of β-AR/cAMP is beneficial for the heart, chronic activation of this pathway results in altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis, leading to ventricular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osadchii, 2007</xref>) and cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boluyt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morisco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engelhardt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karam et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The cell membrane of cardiomyocytes is characterized by invaginations of the surface membrane, occurring primarily perpendicular to myocyte longitudinal edges, at intervals of ~1.8–2 µm, that form a complex interconnected tubular network penetrating deep into the cell interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hong and Shaw, 2017</xref>). This network is called the transverse (T-) tubules (TT) system, although the invaginations may often bifurcate in the axial direction or form branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hong and Shaw, 2017</xref>). These tubular structures are found mostly in adult ventricular myocytes, where they represent about 30% of the total cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>), and occur near the sarcomeric z-discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caldwell et al., 2014</xref>), forming functional junctions with the SR called dyads. They are critical for EC coupling by concentrating LTCCs and positioning them at close proximity of RyR2 clusters at the junction of SR to form Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sipido and Cheng, 2013</xref>). During an action potential, TTs propagate the cell-membrane depolarization inside the cell, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to trigger successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, thus promoting synchronicity as well as ensuring efficiency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Their enrichment with ion channels and the presence of signaling pathways components such as β-ARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nikolaev et al., 2010</xref>) and ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Timofeyev et al., 2013</xref>) make these structures essential for cardiomyocyte function and regulation.</p><p>Biochemical assays following membrane fractionation have provided indirect evidence that membrane proteins may have different properties whether they are located in TTM or outer surface membrane (OSM). Other indirect evidence came from experiments in cardiomyocytes in which the TTM was uncoupled from OSM (detubulation) using a hyperosmotic shock with molar concentrations of formamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moench et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cros and Brette, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fowler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brette et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Despa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brette et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawai et al., 1999</xref>). However, none of these approaches allowed us to investigate in an intact cardiomyocyte whether the function of a given membrane receptor differs if the receptor is located in OSM or TTM. To do so requires being able to separately activate or inhibit the receptor in OSM or TTM, which has not been feasible so far. Here, we tackled this challenge by developing a size exclusion strategy using the PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG)ylation technology. By covalently linking isoprenaline (Iso) to a PEG chain, we increased the size of the β-AR agonist to prevent it from accessing the TT network. Our working hypothesis is that PEGylated isoprenaline (PEG-Iso) activates only β-ARs present in OSM while free Iso activates β-ARs present in both OSM and TTM. We thus characterized the pharmacological properties of PEG-Iso and compared its functional effects in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) with those of Iso.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PEGylation constrains molecules outside the TT network</title><p>The rationale for using ligand PEGylation as a tool to impede ligand diffusion into T-tubules came from the observation that fluorescent PEG<sub>5000</sub> molecules were unable to access TTs. A typical representative experiment (out of 15) using confocal microscopy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. When ARVMs were exposed during 15 min to 100 µM of PEG<sub>5000</sub> molecules functionalized with Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC), no fluorescence was seen throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). On the contrary, when the cells were exposed for 15 min to 100 µM fluorescein, fluorescence was seen with clear staining of the TTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). We suspected that the lack of access to PEG-FITC in the TTs was due to steric hindrance from the presence of glycocalyx matrix. To test this hypothesis, ARVMs were first exposed during 1 hr to a solution containing 0.25 U/ml neuraminidase, an enzyme that degrades sialic acid in the glycocalyx matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parfenov et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, this allowed PEG-FITC to enter the TTs as evidenced by the striated profile now observed. Summary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) reflects these observations where fluorescence intensity is reduced from clearly stained TTs in FITC to almost 0 fluorescence in PEG-FITC. Degradation of the glycocalyx by neuraminidase restores fluorescence intensity to the same level as that seen in free FITC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of PEG-FITC in freshly isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.</title><p>Typical confocal images (<bold>A, C, E</bold>) and plot profiles representing the fluorescence intensity measured across the cell (<bold>B, D, F</bold>) of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) incubated during 15 min with either 100 µM PEG<sub>5000</sub>-FITC (<bold>A, B</bold>), 100 µM free fluorescein (<bold>C, D</bold>), or 100 µM PEG<sub>5000</sub>-FITC after a 1-hr treatment with 0.25 U/ml neuraminidase (+nmd) (<bold>E, F</bold>).

We thus synthesized PEGylated isoprenaline (PEG-Iso) by covalently linking isoprenaline to PEG<sub>5000</sub> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our rationale was that since PEG-Iso does not access TTs, it will not reach β-ARs located in the TTM. But the question remained whether PEG-Iso would be able to bind to β-ARs located in the OSM. To address this question, we performed radioligand binding studies in purified membranes from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing either human β<sub>1</sub>- or β<sub>2</sub>-ARs.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, PEG-Iso binds to both β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs, but with an affinity that is ~2 orders of magnitude lower than Iso. Functional experiments using homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) technology on HEK 293 cells that stably expressed either the β<sub>1</sub>- or β<sub>2</sub>-ARs showed that the EC<sub>50</sub> for cAMP stimulation induced by Iso was 7.4 ± 3.6 pM vs. 39.4 ± 24.2 nM (<italic>n</italic> = 4) for PEG-Iso in β<sub>1</sub>-AR expressing cells and 3.4 ± 7.7 pM vs. 20.2 ± 69.8 nM (<italic>n</italic> = 4) for PEG-Iso in β<sub>2</sub>-AR expressing cells. Thus, the ability of PEG-Iso to activate β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs was reduced by the same order of magnitude for both receptors, which should not bias the following cellular experiments.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Binding properties of Iso and PEG-Iso on β-ARs.</title><p>β<sub>1</sub>- or β-AR Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) membrane preparations (2.5 μg/triplicate) were incubated for 2 hr with 0.25 nM [<sup>125</sup>Iodo]cyanopindolol and increasing concentrations of unlabeled Iso or PEG-Iso.

To test this, we used molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of Iso moiety in PEG-Iso compared to free Iso. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that free Iso SASA remains steady over the whole studied time range (black line). In contrast, the Iso moiety in PEG-Iso (blue line) has an SASA that largely fluctuates and on multiple instances reaches values close to zero, indicating its frequent shielding by the PEG chain. We calculated that only 1.2% of PEG-Iso conformations have an Iso SASA larger than 90% of the free Iso average value. This means that over a time lapse of 100 s, the Iso moiety is only unwrapped from the PEG chain and able to bind to a receptor for ≈1 s of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison of the effects of PEG-Iso and Iso on cytosolic cAMP in ARVMs</title><p>The next series of experiments was designed to test whether PEG-Iso was able to produce a functional β-AR response in ARVMs. First, cytosolic cAMP ([cAMP]<sub>i</sub>) was monitored in isolated ARVMs expressing the FRET-based sensor Epac-S<sup>H187</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>).

The former was anticipated based on the lower binding affinity of PEG-Iso to β-ARs shown above. The latter can be explained by the fact that PEG-Iso only activates β-ARs in OSM while Iso activates β-ARs in both OSM and TTM, thus producing a larger [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> elevation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of Iso and PEG-Iso on cytosolic cAMP in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.</title><p>Freshly isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) were infected with an adenovirus encoding the Epac-S<sup>H187</sup> FRET-based cytosolic cAMP sensor for 48 hr at 37°C at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 pfu/cell.

However, the above experiments do not exclude possible differences in the compartmentalization of intracellular cAMP cascade when cAMP is synthesized upon OSM or TTM β-AR stimulation. To obtain further insight, we compared the effect of PEG-Iso and Iso on PKA activity in the bulk cytoplasm and in the nucleus. For that, we used genetically encoded A-kinase activity FRET-based reporters (AKAR3) targeted to these compartments by the addition of a nuclear export sequence (NES), and a nuclear localizing sequence (NLS), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Zhang, 2006</xref>). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedioune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haj Slimane et al., 2014</xref>), adenoviral transfer allowed robust and compartment-specific expression of these biosensors after 24 hr in ARVMs. In the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, four increasing concentrations of Iso (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 nM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, C</xref>) and PEG-Iso (10, 30, 100 nM and 1 µM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, D</xref>) were successively applied to ARVMs infected with an AKAR3-NES probe, and cytosolic PKA activation was measured. Both compounds produced a clear concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic PKA activity, with a similar efficacy (maximal cytosolic PKA response of 59.7 ± 1.9% for Iso compared to 55.1 ± 3.9% for PEG-Iso; p = 0.33) but a ~100-fold lower potency for the effect of PEG-Iso as compared to Iso. However, when both nuclear cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and nuclear PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) activity was measured, clear differences between the effects of Iso and PEG-Iso were observed: While PEG-Iso and Iso still produced a concentration-dependent increase in nuclear cAMP/PKA activity, the largest response to Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C</xref>) was ≈2-fold greater compared to the largest response to PEG-Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>; p = 0.002 (cAMP) and p = 0.033 (PKA), respectively).

The density of these membrane proteins is usually found to be higher in the TTM than in the external membrane. Hence, the TT network plays a determinant role in rapid activation and synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, cellular signaling and, consequently, cardiac contraction in both human and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soeller and Cannell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hatano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Any given membrane protein is likely to serve different functions and be regulated in a different manner whether it is located in TTM or in OSM. Attempts to address this important question have so far been based on the elimination of the TT network (detubulation) using a hyperosmotic shock with molar concentrations of formamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brette et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moench et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cros and Brette, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fowler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brette et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Despa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brette et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawai et al., 1999</xref>). This technique, first used in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Argiro, 1981</xref>), was introduced in the cardiac field by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawai et al., 1999</xref> and provided an excellent experimental tool for numerous T-tubular studies. However, the potential role of shock-induced detubulation in physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant conditions is essentially unknown. The method is very harsh on the cells with fewer than 10% of the cells surviving the procedure, which raises issues about whether the ‘survivors’ are truly representative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, osmotic shock produces a sealing of the TTs which remain present as vesicles inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moench et al., 2013</xref>) and may still respond to hormonal or pharmacological challenges and signaling cascades even if they are electrically disconnected from the surface membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moench and Lopatin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scardigli et al., 2024</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p><p>To overcome these limitations, we introduce here a completely different approach based on size exclusion. We proposed to enlarge the size of a ligand molecule by attaching it to a 5-kDa chain of PEG so that it does not access TTM but remains active on OSM. PEG is a hydrophilic, flexible, and rather inert polymer. The covalent linking of one or several PEG chains to a therapeutic molecule, called PEGylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Veronese and Harris, 2002</xref>), is commonly used in several products on the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pasut and Veronese, 2012</xref>). PEGylated molecules exhibit improved biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, better stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity, and longer plasma half-life due to both reduced renal filtration and proteolysis, when compared to non-PEGylated analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abuchowski et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Chess, 2003</xref>). In our study, we diverted the same technology toward an entirely different objective: Instead of using PEGylated molecules to improve drug formulation, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy, we propose to use PEGylated drugs as <italic>key holders</italic> to prevent drug (<italic>key</italic>) access in the TT network and thus limit its access to the outer surface of the cell. We provide a proof of concept that this approach works using PEG<sub>5000</sub> functionalized with non-permeant FITC (PEG-FITC): When ARVMs were exposed to PEG-FITC, fluorescence was only seen on the periphery of the cell, while when the non-PEGylated free diffusible dye was used, fluorescence was seen in the TT compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, large molecular weight PEGs are prevented from diffusing within TTs, whereas small molecular weight fluorophores can easily enter.</p><p>This finding was surprising, though, since longitudinal TT diameter from healthy control ARVMs varies from 50 to 350 nm (~200 nm on average; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soeller and Cannell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), which is significantly larger than the size of a PEG<sub>5000</sub> molecule, which is ≈5 nm. However, a number of recent studies have shown that solute movement in the TT network is strongly restricted even though the diameter of TTs is far larger than the molecular dimensions of typical solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Entcheva, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scardigli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uchida and Lopatin, 2018</xref>). Impediment of solute movement in the TT network was proposed to be caused by the presence of the glycocalyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Langer et al., 1982</xref>) at the cell surface, reducing the effective diameter of a TT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parfenov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kong et al., 2018</xref>). This was supported by two findings. First, that pre-treatment of isolated ARVMs with neuraminidase, an enzyme which cleaves sialic acid from oligosaccharide chains in the glycoprotein matrix on the external cell surface, allowed PEG-FITC to enter the TT compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, when ARVMs pre-treated with neuraminidase were stimulated with PEG-Iso, the FRET-derived responses were much larger than in the non-treated cells, indicative of increased access to the β-ARs in the TTM, similar to free Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). The cytosolic cAMP response increased by ≈100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A</xref>), while nuclear cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3C</xref>) and nuclear PKA responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3E, G</xref>) were ≈50% greater. Controls using Iso confirmed this to be an effect of the glycocalyx being degraded rather than a direct effect of neuraminidase on the β-ARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3B, D, F</xref>). Thus, when the protocol used for cell isolation is sufficiently gentle to preserve the integrity of the extracellular matrix in the TT, which must be the case in our experimental conditions, it is possible to prevent a ligand from accessing the TTM if the size of the ligand molecule is sufficiently enlarged. PEG molecules of 5000 Da MW appear to provide a good compromise between solubility issues and size exclusion capability.</p><p>Several studies have shown localization of β-ARs particularly β<sub>2</sub>-ARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wright et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wright et al., 2018</xref>) in caveolae. Our hypothesis is that, unlike what is occurring within TT, caveolae are not filled with a dense extracellular matrix, possibly because of a better access to enzymatic digestion during cell isolation. Future experiments will test this hypothesis by disrupting caveolae with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Calaghan and White, 2006</xref>) to see how this affects the response to PEG-Iso.</p><p>PEG-Iso was thus synthesized by linking Iso to PEG<sub>5000</sub> molecules. Characterization of its binding properties showed that PEG-Iso binds to β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs but with ~2 orders of magnitude lower affinity than Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since PEG was grafted on the lateral amino group of Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a position shown to maintain its affinity for β-ARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruffolo et al., 1995</xref>) and away from the active pharmacophore for β-AR binding, it was unlikely that the chemical modification per se was the reason for the decreased affinity. We confirmed that this was the case by detubulating cells with 300 μM imipramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>). Without the TT network, only the OSM β-ARs were available for stimulation. Under these conditions, affinity-adjusted Iso and PEG-Iso had identical effects on cytosolic and nuclear cAMP/PKA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also addressed the possibility that PEG could change the membrane permeability of Iso and differentially stimulate intracellular β-ARs, the existence of which has been proposed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that irrespective of whether we used a membrane-permeable (propranolol) or membrane-impermeable (sotalol) β-AR antagonist, the cAMP stimulatory effects of Iso could be fully inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5</xref>), and so under our conditions, the stimulatory effects of Iso are confined to the cell membrane. Therefore, the only difference between Iso and PEG-Iso is the ability to bind the β-ARs and not an effect of PEG itself.</p><p>We thus explored a possible involvement of the PEG conformation in this phenomenon using molecular dynamics simulations. Because of its hydrophilicity and flexibility, PEG is very dynamic in solution and constantly changes conformation. Consequently, the Iso moiety in PEG-Iso is rarely fully accessible to solvent and spends most of the time with the PEG chain wrapped around it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the calculations, only ~1% of PEG-Iso conformations are able to bind β-ARs as compared to 100% for free Iso, which is in the order of magnitude of the measured difference in their respective binding affinity on β-ARs.</p><p>When applied on ARVMs, PEG-Iso produced stimulatory effects on [cAMP]<sub>i</sub>, PKA activity, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub>, sarcomere shortening, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which all had the hallmarks of a β-AR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Because of the reduced binding affinity toward β-ARs, PEG-Iso produced its effect at ~2 orders of magnitude larger concentrations than Iso. But there were two other striking differences between the effects of PEG-Iso and Iso which strongly suggest that the two ligands did not act on the exact same populations of receptors.</p><p>First, PEG-Iso produced a stimulation of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> with a much lower efficacy than Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The simplest explanation for this result is that PEG-Iso activates only β-ARs located in the OSM, while Iso activates β-ARs located in both OSM and TTM. Since both populations of β-ARs are likely coupled to ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Timofeyev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 1997</xref>), one would expect an activation of OSM β-ARs with PEG-Iso to lead to a smaller maximal increase in [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> than an activation of all β-ARs with Iso. This diminution is in line with decreased cAMP production sites by detubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>). Cyclic AMP must emanate mainly from sarcolemmal β<sub>1</sub>-ARs, which produce highly diffusible signals throughout the cell in contrast to β<sub>2</sub>-ARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nikolaev et al., 2006</xref>). However, there are conflicting results regarding the distribution of β-ARs on the cardiac cell membrane. Immunohistochemical data have suggested that β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs are present in OSM and TTM in mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). Using radioligand binding, β<sub>1</sub>-AR density was found to be almost twofold more concentrated in OSM than TTM, whereas β<sub>2</sub>-AR density was evenly distributed across the entire cell surface in dog heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2005</xref>). Using nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques in healthy ARVMs, Nikolaev et al. found that β<sub>1</sub>-ARs are distributed across the entire cell surface while β<sub>2</sub>-ARs are localized exclusively in TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nikolaev et al., 2010</xref>). While the distribution of β<sub>1</sub>-ARs across the entire cell surface was confirmed in ARVMs in another study using formamide detubulation, β<sub>2</sub>-ARs were found to be only present in OSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cros and Brette, 2013</xref>). Additional experiments using PEGylated selective β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-AR agonists and antagonists are needed to solve this issue and to precisely characterize the role of each β-AR subtype in the different membrane compartments.</p><p>Second, PEG-Iso produced a much lower stimulation of nuclear PKA activity than Iso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) even though both ligands were equally efficient in stimulating cytosolic PKA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Also, when cytosolic and nuclear PKA activity measured during PEG-Iso or Iso stimulation were plotted as a function of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> measured under the same conditions, PEG-Iso was found to be more efficient than Iso to increase PKA activity in the cytosol, while on the contrary, Iso is more efficient than PEG-Iso to increase PKA activity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). A likely interpretation of these results is that β-ARs located in TTM (or a β-AR subtype more concentrated in TTM) are more efficiently coupled to nuclear PKA than those located in OSM, while β-ARs located in OSM (or a β-AR subtype more concentrated in OSM) are more efficiently coupled to cytosolic PKA. In a recent study, we showed that β<sub>2</sub>-ARs, unlike β<sub>1</sub>-ARs, are inefficient in activating nuclear PKA activity in ARVMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedioune et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, if the ratio of β<sub>2</sub>/β<sub>1</sub> receptors is larger in OSM than in TTM, as discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cros and Brette, 2013</xref>), then this would explain the lower efficacy of PEG-Iso to activate nuclear PKA activity as compared to Iso. Recent studies have shown that perinuclear PKA has the ability to activate without detachment of the catalytic subunits, and thus to phosphorylate its targets in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). According to these studies, only supra-physiological concentrations of cAMP could lead to dissociation of the catalytic subunits and their translocation into the nucleus. Perinuclear PKA is anchored to the nuclear membrane via its interaction with mAKAP and its dynamics are finely regulated by AC5 and PDE4D3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diviani et al., 2011</xref>), AC5 being concentrated in TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Timofeyev et al., 2013</xref>) and PDE4D3 being linked to mAKAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dodge-Kafka et al., 2005</xref>). The location of AC5 may therefore be crucial for nuclear signaling and explain why β-ARs present in TTM are necessary for activation of nuclear PKA. One major limitation of our data is that there is a reduction in TTs over the ≈36-hr infection period needed for robust FRET sensor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s6">Figure 9—figure supplement 6</xref>). Therefore, the differences between OSM and TTM may be even greater than we have observed with respect to nuclear PKA activation.</p><p>Another important finding from this study concerns the contribution of OSM β-ARs to the regulation of EC coupling. Activation of β-ARs only in OSM with PEG-Iso produced a similar increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> amplitude, sarcomere shortening, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as Iso, when both ligands were used at concentrations producing an equivalent elevation of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub>. Since OSM contributes to ~60% of total cell membrane in ARVMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>), either β-ARs and ACs are more concentrated in OSM than TTM, or they are in large excess over what is needed to activate PKA phosphorylation of proteins involved in EC coupling. It would also suggest that small GTPase Rab proteins mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 trafficking to the TTM that occur in response to β-AR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Del Villar, 2021</xref>) are sufficiently activated by OSM cAMP alone for a similar increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> amplitude to have been observed. Also, cAMP produced at OSM must diffuse rapidly in the cytosol in order to activate PKA phosphorylation of substrates located deep inside the cell, such as LTCCs in TTM. A recent study showed that under basal conditions, cAMP is bound to proteins and its diffusion in the cytosol is slow; but when cAMP increases in the cytosol, for example as a result of β-AR stimulation, the cAMP-binding sites become saturated and cAMP diffuses freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bock et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While this study provides new insight on the differential function of OSM vs. TTM β-ARs in healthy cardiomyocytes raise obvious questions on how their role is altered in cardiac pathology. A reduction in the density and a disorganization of the TT network is frequently observed in pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lawless et al., 2019</xref>), with a substantial impact on both EC coupling and contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sipido and Cheng, 2013</xref>). A previous study showed a redistribution of β<sub>2</sub>-ARs from TTM to OSM in failing ARVMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nikolaev et al., 2010</xref>). As β-ARs are not simply bystanders but also participate in the remodeling during pathological hypertrophy and failure, it is important to know how the OSM <italic>vs</italic>. TTM subpopulations of β-AR subtypes contribute to this process. The PEGylation technology should enable elucidation of the changes that occur in OSM <italic>vs</italic>. TTM distribution of β-ARs in ventricular cells isolated from failing hearts, and to determine how this impacts on cellular function. In conclusion, this study provides a novel approach to distinguish the function of a membrane protein depending on its location on the cell membrane. Whereas we focused here on the function of β-ARs, the size exclusion strategy provided by ligand PEGylation can be extended to other ligands, such as selective agonists or antagonists of β-AR subtypes or other G-protein-coupled receptors, dihydropyridine agonists or antagonists of LTCCs. More generally, it should pave the road to exploring and comparing the function of any membrane receptor, channel, transporter, or enzyme in TTM and OSM compartments in intact cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal care and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines and conform to the European Community guiding principles in the Care and Use of Animals (Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament), the local Ethics Committee (CREEA Ile-de France Sud) guidelines, and the French decree no. 2013-118 of February 1, 2013 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (JORF no. 0032, February 7, 2013, p2199, text no. 24).

After 1 hr, the medium was replaced by 300 µl of FBS-free MEM. To perform FRET imaging, the medium was replaced by 300 μl of FCS-free MEM or transduced with an adenovirus encoding either an Epac-S<sup>H187</sup> FRET-based sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>), or an AKAR3 FRET-based sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Zhang, 2006</xref>) addressed to the cytosol or the nucleus, at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 pfu/cell. Cells were cultivated for 36 hr prior to the experiments. Patch-clamp and IonOptix experiments were performed on cells 24 hr after dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rats were plated on 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes. Two hours after plating, the control cells were stained with commercial fluorescent PEG<sub>5000</sub> functionalized with FITC (Nanocs) or free Fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich). Other cells were treated with neuraminidase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at 37°C at a concentration of 0.25 U/ml, after which they were washed and re-incubated in physiological buffer solution. Cells were then stained with PEG-FITC. All molecules were dissolved in Ringer containing (in mM): NaCl 121.6, KCl 5.4, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 4, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.8, <sc>D</sc>-glucose 5, sodium pyruvate 5, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.4. The acquisitions were made with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope using a white light laser and an X40 oil immersion objective. The cells were excited at 495 nm and fluorescence was recovered at wavelengths &gt;510 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence intensity quantification</title><p>FITC or PEG-FITC that enters the T-tubules (TT) should flag the TTs, similar to Di4Anepps. Thus, we used the same established method used to measure the density of TT in cells. The center fluorescence image from each cell was selected for a thresholding analysis using an ImageJ plugin described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heinzel et al., 2002</xref>) and TT quantification was performed using the ImageJ free software. On each image, a brightness/contrast correction was applied to correct acquisition settings differences. Images were filtered with a despeckle filter and a median filter. The image was then binarized using an auto local threshold (Autothreshold plug-in). The threshold method and parameters were visually adjusted to ensure the coherence of the binarized image with the original one. A region of interest was defined inside the cell excluding the plasma membrane, and then a percent area was calculated. This value corresponds to the ratio of the number of white pixels over the size of the region multiplied by 100 and thus constitutes an index of the TT density where the fluorophore is visible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Detubulation</title><p>The TT network was chemically removed from a subset of control cells by a process termed detubulation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourcier et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, cells were exposed to 300 μM imipramine for 15 min at room temperature, after which they were washed with physiological Ringer’s solution and used for FRET. Detubulation was performed ≈1 hr before use in functional experiments. Detubulation was confirmed through confocal microscopy with 4 μM Di4Anepps. Cells were excited at 495 nm and fluorescence was recovered at wavelengths &gt;510 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Molecular dynamics simulations of free Iso and PEG-Iso were carried out to predict their conformations in aqueous solution and to assess the solvent accessibility of Iso moiety once grafted to the PEG. A 3000-Da PEG molecule was used in these simulations. The 2D chemical structure of each of the two molecules was first converted into a three-dimensional structure using ChemAxon’s MarvinSketch chemical editing software. The topology and GAFF force field parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2004</xref> used in this study were then automatically generated using the ACPYPE program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sousa da Silva and Vranken, 2012</xref>). The initial three-dimensional structure was then placed in the center of a 13.4-nm side cubic simulation. These dimensions allow the solute not to interact with its virtually created images due to the periodic boundary conditions used to simulate an infinitely duplicated mesh. The box was then filled with water (model TIP3P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) and 150 mM NaCl. The system was then subjected to two short simulations (1 ns each) to equilibrate first the temperature around 300 K and then the pressure around 1 bar. The Nosé–Hoover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoover, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nosé, 1984</xref>) (coupling time <italic>τT</italic> = 0.5 ps) and Parrinello–Rahman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) (<italic>τP</italic> = 2.5 ps) algorithms were used for maintaining constant temperature and pressure, respectively. Finally, each of the two molecules was subjected to a production run of 150 ns. All simulations were performed using the GROMACS software version 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). To analyze the trajectories, we used the GROMACS internal <italic>gmx sasa</italic> tool to calculate the SASA for Iso moiety in both free Iso or PEG-Iso molecules. To compare the solvent accessibility of the Iso moiety in free Iso and PEG-Iso, the percentage of PEG-Iso conformations with an SASA<sub>PEG-Iso</sub> ≥ 0.9 SASA<sub>free-Iso</sub> was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Binding experiments</title><p>Binding assays were carried out in a ﬁnal volume of 100 μl, containing a membrane suspension of CHO cells overexpressing human β<sub>1</sub>- or β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, 145 pM of the radioligand [<sup>125</sup>Iodo]cyanopindolol and non-radioactive ligands at concentrations ranging from 100 pM to 1 mM. Incubation was carried out for 2 hr at room temperature and terminated by addition of 4 ml PBS. Then, rapid filtration was performed through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters previously soaked in PBS containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine using a compact cell harvester (Millipore 1225 Sampling Vacuum Manifold). The binding reaction was transferred to the filters and washed three times with Wash Buffer. Filter-bound radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. All determinations were performed in triplicate at least.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>HTRF quantification of cAMP production</title><p>cAMP was quantified using the HTRF cAMP Gs dynamic detection kit (Revvity, Codolet, France) based on HTRF technology. The stimulation was done in the stimulation buffer (stimulation buffer 1X (Revvity) containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine, IBMX). Briefly, HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human β<sub>1</sub>- or β<sub>2</sub>-ARs were resuspended in stimulation buffer and dispensed into 384-well plates (1000 cells per well (5 µl)) and stimulated with increasing concentrations (0.1 pM to 100 µM) of Iso diluted in stimulation buffer (5 µl/well) for 30 min at 20°C. Cells were then lysed, and cAMP levels were determined following manufacturer instructions. HTRF signal was read with the microplate reader Envision Excite (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>FRET imaging</title><p>FRET experiments were performed at room temperature 36 hr after cell plating.

Images were captured every 5 s using the 40x oil immersion objective of a Nikon TE 300 inverted microscope connected to a software-controlled (Metafluor, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) cooled charge coupled camera (Sensicam PE, PCO, Kelheim, Germany). Cells were excited for 150–300 ms by a Xenon lamp (100 W, Nikon, Champigny-sur-Marne, France) using a 440/20BP filter and a 455LP dichroic mirror. Dual emission imaging was performed using an Optosplit II emission splitter (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK) equipped with a 495LP dichroic mirror and BP filters 470/30 (CFP) and 535/30 (YFP), respectively. Spectral bleed-through into the YFP channel was subtracted using the formula: YFP<sub>corr</sub> = YFP − 0.6 × CFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Electrophysiological experiments</title><p>The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to record <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub>.

The cells were depolarized every 8 s from –50 to 0 mV for 400 ms. The liquid junction potential was adjusted to zero current between pipette and bath solution before the cells were attached to obtain a tight gigaseal (&gt;1 GΩ). The use of –50 mV as holding potential allowed the inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium currents. Currents were not compensated for capacitance and leak currents. The amplitude of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> was measured as the difference between the peak inward current and the current at the end of the depolarization pulses. The cells were voltage-clamped with a patch-clamp amplifier (either RK-400 (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) or Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Inc, Union City, CA, USA)). Currents were analog filtered at 5 kHz and digitally sampled at 10 kHz using a 16-bit analog to digital converter (DT321; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA, USA or a Digidata1440A, Axon Instruments) connected to a PC (Dell, Austin, TX, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and sarcomere shortening</title><p>All experiments were performed at room temperature. Isolated ARVMs were loaded with 1 µM Fura-2 AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Pluronic acid (0.012%, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min in a Ringer solution containing (in mM): KCl 5.4, NaCl 121.6, sodium pyruvate 5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 4.013, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.8, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, glucose 5, HEPES 10, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Sarcomere shortening and Fura-2 ratio (measured at 512 nm upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm) were simultaneously recorded in Ringer solution, using a double excitation spectrofluorimeter coupled with a video detection system (IonOptix, Milton, MA, USA). Myocytes were electrically stimulated, with biphasic field pulses (5 V, 4 ms) at a frequency of 1 Hz. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude was measured by dividing the twitch amplitude (difference between the end-diastolic and the peak systolic ratios) by the end-diastolic ratio, thus corresponding to the percentage of variation in the Fura-2 ratio. Similarly, sarcomere shortening was assessed by its percentage variation, which was obtained by dividing the twitch amplitude (difference between the end-diastolic and the peak systolic sarcomere length) by the end-diastolic sarcomere length. Relaxation kinetics were estimated by a non-linear fit of the decaying part of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and sarcomere shortening traces with the following equation: <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = A·exp(−(<italic>t</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>)/<italic>τ</italic>) + <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> is zero time, <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub> the asymptote of the exponential, <italic>A</italic> the relative amplitude of the exponential, and <italic>τ</italic> the time constant of relaxation. The maximum first derivative of transients during the deflection allowed determination of the rising velocities of the signals.

Functional experiments were performed using HEK-293 cells that stably express β<sub>1</sub> or β<sub>2</sub>-ARs. Dose response curves to Iso and PEG-Iso showed that the relative differences between the drugs were of the same order of magnitude for β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs.

Firstly, we have used detubulation as a negative control. I.e. when T-tubules are removed the nuclear PKA response is the same for Iso as PEG-Iso at affinity adjusted concentrations (Figure 9 —figure supplement 4). Secondly, we have used neuraminidase as a positive control to demonstrate that when the glyocalyx is cleaved the nuclear cAMP/PKA response to PEG-ISO is increased through FRET experiments (Figure 9 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical analyses should be done comparing Iso vs PEG-Iso conditions rather than just different concentrations of the same drug.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point. But this cannot be easily done since the range of concentrations of Iso and PEG-Iso to produce a response on cytosolic and nuclear cAMP and PKA, or on I<sub>Ca,L</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and contractility, differ by ~2 log units. So we have used a two-fold approach.</p><p>1. We have compared the effects of concentrations that differ by 100x magnitude (see lines 170-172, 212-213 and 217-219).</p><p>2. We have also sought a representation that would allow us to compare the effects of Iso and PEG-Iso independently of the concentrations used for each ligand. This is what led us to design Figure 9 —figure supplement 2 which compares the pattern of effects of Iso and PEG-Iso on cytosolic cAMP and PKA (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2A) or cytosolic cAMP and nuclear PKA (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2B). These two plots show clear differences between the effects of the two ligands. As written on Line 224-228, “It shows that for any given measured increase in [cAMP]<sub>i</sub>, PEG-Iso is more efficient than Iso to increase PKA activity in the cytosol (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2A), while on the contrary Iso is more efficient than PEG-Iso to increase PKA activity in the nucleus (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2B).” This, we believe, strongly supports the main conclusion of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) Is the differential expression of key cAMP/PKA signaling molecules (ACs, PKA, AKAPs, PDEs) critical in determining the response to ISO and PEG-ISO? If so, what are the mechanisms?</p></disp-quote><p>PEGylation of Iso changes the pool of β-ARs that are activated. I.e. all the β-ARs (TT + OSM) for free Iso and only those on the OSM for PEG-Iso. Whilst the downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathways may differ for the β-ARs depending on location, there is no reason to believe that this is due to the PEGylation of Iso itself compared to free Iso. Rather a β-AR in the same location should have the same response to Iso and PEG-Iso (at adjusted concentrations), thus activating the same pathways/signaling molecules. Observed differences are due to the spatial differences of the β-ARs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The work from the Dixon lab on CaV1.2 channel trafficking must be discussed and perhaps incorporated into the study. Could kinetic and amplitude differences in CaV1.2 channel insertion into the surface sarcolemma and TT membrane explain some of the findings of this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Lines 377-380. This has been incorporated in so much as the same change was seen from total β-AR stimulation to those in only the OSM. To truly elucidate changes in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 trafficking and differential kinetics based upon location using our approach it would be necessary to block the different Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 populations, e.g. using PEG-Nicardipine. This is beyond the scope of our study but raises the potential applications that this technology has.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Perhaps mathematical modeling of cAMP/PKA dynamics would provide mechanistic insights.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 1. Our main mechanistic insight is the differential regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear cAMP/PKA dependent on spatial β-AR activation. A further study is required to fully elucidate the role of different PDEs etc. in regulating these pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are there any physiological conditions in which surface and TT β-adrenergic receptors are differentially activated? Does the loss of TT during heart failure raise the signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>A very interesting point. Differences in spatial expression of β-ARs are thought to occur alongside the loss of T-tubules in heart failure. Whilst here our focus has been on the proof of principle of spatial restriction, we would very much hope that future studies could apply this technology in pathologies such as heart failure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) More robust evidence for lack of T-tubule penetration by PEGylated ligands with additional confocal images comparing groups and average data from multiple cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to ‘essential revision #1’. Figure 1G now provides summary data, quantifying fluorescence intensity for cells stained with FITC and PEG-FITC either in control (-) conditions or after treatment with neuraminidase. Statistical comparison between groups by one-way ANOVA supports the representative data and clearly demonstrates the inability of PEGylated ligands to enter the T-tubules, unless the glycocalyx has been cleaved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Demonstrate persistence of T-tubules in cultured ARVM infected with adenovirally delivered FRET-sensors.</p></disp-quote><p>It is necessary to wait ≈36 hours for the adenovirus to infect and stably express the compartmentalized cAMP or PKA sensors. We have now quantified the T-tubule network over this experimental time frame in Figure 9 —figure supplement 6 and show that whilst the T-tubule density is indeed decreased by our maximal time point of 48 hours there is in fact still a robust T-tubule network within the cell. This decrease in T-tubules actually suggests that if it were possible to perform FRET immediately on freshly isolated ARVMs we would see a much larger discrepancy between Iso and PEG-Iso where differences were observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some progress on defining βAR subtype-specific responses.
