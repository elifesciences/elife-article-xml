TB is not traditionally associated with biofilms, but <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilms are linked with drug and immune tolerance and there is increasing recognition of their contribution to the recalcitrance of TB infections. Here, we used <italic>M. tb</italic> experimental evolution to investigate this complex phenotype and identify candidate loci controlling biofilm formation. We identified novel candidate loci, adding to our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilm development. Under selective pressure to grow as a biofilm, regulatory mutations rapidly swept to fixation and were associated with changes in multiple traits, including extracellular matrix production, cell size, and growth rate. Genetic and phenotypic paths to enhanced biofilm growth varied according to the genetic background of the parent strain, suggesting that epistatic interactions are important in <italic>M. tb</italic> adaptation to changing environments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many environments, bacteria live together in structures called biofilms. Cells in biofilms coordinate with each other to protect the group and allow it to survive difficult conditions. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, forms biofilms when it infects the human body. Biofilms make the infection a lot more difficult to treat, which may be one of the reasons why tuberculosis is the deadliest bacterial infection in the world.</p><p>Bacteria evolve rapidly over the course of a single infection, but bacteria forming biofilms evolve differently to bacteria living alone. This evolution happens through mutations to the bacterial DNA, which can be small (a single base in a DNA sequence changes to a different base) or larger changes (such as the deletion or insertion of several bases).</p><p>Smith, Youngblom et al. studied the evolution of tuberculosis growing in biofilms in the lab. As the bacteria evolved, they tended to form thicker biofilms, an effect linked to 14 mutations involving single base DNA changes and four larger ones. Most of the changes were in regulatory regions of DNA, which control whether genes are ‘read’ by cells to produce proteins. These regions often change more though evolution than regions coding for proteins, because they have a coordinated effect on a group of related genes rather than randomly altering individual genes. Smith, Youngblom et al. also showed that biofilms made from different strains of tuberculosis evolved in different ways.</p><p>Smith Youngblom et al.’s findings provide more information regarding how bacteria adapt to living in biofilms, which may reveal new ways to control them. This could have applications in water treatment, food production and healthcare.

New strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and control of TB are urgently needed. From an evolutionary perspective, <italic>M. tb</italic> stands out among bacterial pathogens for its strict association with human hosts, limited genetic diversity, and clonal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Eldholm and Balloux, 2016</xref>). We might expect these features to constrain adaptation of <italic>M. tb</italic>, yet TB remains a challenging infection to treat due to the bacterium’s ability to persist in the face of antibiotic and immune pressure and to acquire novel drug resistances. In order to better treat and control TB, we need to understand the sources of <italic>M. tb</italic>’s robustness and to identify its vulnerabilities. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for illuminating these strengths and vulnerabilities and has led to important insights into the fundamental processes guiding microbial adaptation.</p><p>Biofilms are increasingly recognized as a relevant growth form for bacteria in their natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costerton et al., 1999</xref>). TB is not traditionally thought of as a biofilm infection. However, <italic>M. tb</italic> cells spontaneously aggregate and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) when grown in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubos and Davis, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bacon et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting they are naturally inclined to grow as biofilms. Autopsy studies have long identified <italic>M. tb</italic> aggregates in human tissues during TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Canetti, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nyka, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nyka, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nyka, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nyka and O’Neill, 1970</xref>). More recent research has demonstrated specific biomarkers of <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilms in human autopsy specimens and animal models of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilms during TB infection is of major practical significance as growth within a biofilm allows <italic>M. tb</italic> cells to survive otherwise lethal concentrations of antibiotics and to evade immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ojha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Trivedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>). Identifying the mechanisms of biofilm development by <italic>M. tb</italic> can thus aid the development of new, more effective therapies for TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Richards et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The genetic determinants of <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilm formation have been investigated with candidate gene approaches and phenotypic characterization of knockout, knockdown, and overexpression mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ojha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sambandan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rastogi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Richards et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hegde, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bharti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we use a complementary approach based on serial passaging of <italic>M. tb</italic> clinical isolates under selective pressure to grow as a biofilm. This approach has the advantage of maintaining the integrity of complex networks of genes and their regulators while enabling discovery of subtle genetic changes with an impact on biofilm phenotype. It is also unbiased with respect to the choice of candidate loci. During experimental evolution of six closely related <italic>M. tb</italic> isolates passaged over months to years we found: (1) rapid adaptation in response to selection imposed in our system, with development of more robust biofilm growth in all strains, (2) changes in a range of <italic>M. tb</italic> phenotypes in association with few, presumably pleiotropic mutations, (3) predominant impacts on gene dosage among mutations that emerged during the experiment, (4) implication of <italic>M. tb</italic> loci not previously known to be involved in biofilm development, and (5) apparent effects of strain genetic background in shaping the adaptive path to the phenotype under selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample</title><p>Pellicles are a specific type of biofilm in which bacteria form aggregates at air–liquid interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kobayashi, 2007</xref>); <italic>M. tb</italic> has been shown to form pellicle biofilms in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kerns et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, the strain selection encompassed a variety of biofilm phenotypes such that we could identify impacts of ancestral phenotype on bacterial adaptation in our passaging system. The strains were grown as pellicles following a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kulka et al., 2012</xref>). We passaged these six populations in pellicle form every 5–7 weeks as described in the Methods section.

During the initial few passages, phenotypes changed for all strains and then stabilized between passages 2 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We performed extended passaging for four strains, which were carried out to passage 16 or 20; we did not observe any further phenotypic changes during this extended passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Over the course of the experiment, all populations evolved more robust biofilms characterized by an increase in surface coverage and thicker, reticulating growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). MT72 was an exception, as it developed a typical confluent biofilm after two passages, but then evolved discontinuous, thick growth covering only a small fraction of the surface.

These few mutations appeared to have pleiotropic effects, as we observed changes in phenotypes other than the one under selection. ‘Off target’ phenotypes, such as planktonic growth rate and cell length, varied among strains. Experimentally evolved populations generally manifest first-pass, large-effect mutations during initial adaptation; our results suggest that these mutations in <italic>M. tb</italic> are broad in their scope and variable in their effects. The latter phenomenon may be due to a large genetic target for biofilm growth, the impacts of hitchhiking mutations, and/or genetic background of the strains.</p><p>Candidate SNPs and deletions mediating pellicle adaptation were either exceedingly rare or absent in our search of a database of almost 40,000 <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> genomes. This suggests that the loci hit in our experiment are under strong purifying selection in <italic>M. tb</italic>’s natural environment: that is, the mutations we observed are associated with substantial fitness costs to the bacterium during human infection. This is not to suggest that biofilm growth is irrelevant to natural infection; as discussed above, <italic>M. tb</italic> biofilms and biofilm biomarkers have been identified in clinical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Canetti, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nyka, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nyka, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nyka, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nyka and O’Neill, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>). Rather, we hypothesize that the mutations we observed are selected against because they interfere with regulatory pathways that normally constrain biofilm growth to specific environmental conditions. Regulatory constraints would limit potential drawbacks of biofilm formation, such as the metabolic costs of matrix production and immunostimulation. Another, not mutually exclusive, explanation is that fitness costs associated with mutations observed here are due to effects on off-target traits such as planktonic growth rate, cell size changes, and/or phenotypes unmeasured here. Experiments such as this one can illuminate impermissible paths in <italic>M. tb</italic> adaptation and reveal specific vulnerabilities with the potential to be exploited in TB therapeutics.</p><p>Two strains in our study evolved a large (~120 kb) duplication in the same genomic region, which fixed by passage 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The duplication persisted without evidence of decay in extended passaging in our study (up to passage 20 in MT31). Duplications in this region of the genome have been identified previously in isolates from lineages 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Domenech et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>). Duplications at this site are likely facilitated by flanking <italic>IS6110</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) which can induce unequal homologous recombination. Prior research has shown that the duplication confers a fitness disadvantage in vivo (as measured in a mouse model) and can be selected during axenic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we find this lab adaptation to be associated with enhanced pellicle formation. Interestingly, while the duplication was associated with increases in planktonic growth rate, we did not identify it in planktonically passaged populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Domenech et al., 2014</xref> found previously that emergence of a similar duplication was variable among strains and culture conditions. Together, these data suggest that while the duplication is observed commonly in the lab, it is selected on specific genetic backgrounds and in response to specific environmental conditions. Large-scale genome rearrangements including duplications have previously been identified as a rough adaptive ‘first draft’ followed by further refinement during experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang, 2003</xref>). The duplication was the only mutation that fixed in MT55, which exhibited a dramatic increase in pellicle weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and increased production of ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) following passaging, suggesting that it is indeed this seemingly multipurpose mutation that is responsible for pellicle adaptation. The apparent impacts of the duplication were not limited to pellicle growth, as MT55 also exhibited an increase in cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and a faster rate of growth during planktonic culture, as did its sister strain MT31 also encoding the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of ECM and other aspects of biofilm growth are tightly regulated during natural infection, and that first pass mutations outside of this environment result in de-repression of biofilm production. Our findings further suggest that biofilm formation is co-regulated with a range of phenotypes, consistent with prior research on biofilms, persistence and drug tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Richards et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epistasis</title><p>The 120 kb duplication occurred on two strains from the same sub-lineage (MT31 and MT49 from L4.9) and did not occur in any other genetic background. A similar phenomenon emerged in association with sub-lineage L4.4.1.1, where both strains underwent mutation at a TFBS upstream of <italic>lpdA</italic>, with attendant impacts on gene expression. While our strains are all very closely related, there are still distinct genetic variants for each sub-lineage that may affect the evolutionary trajectory and lead to convergent adaptation of strains within them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We observed similar patterns in the planktonically passaged populations, for example in repeated mutations occurring in an apparently sub-lineage (<italic>tuf</italic>, L4.1.1.2) or strain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Repeated mutation at these loci provides strong support for their involvement in the trait under selection. In addition, the association of candidate adaptive mutations with specific sub-lineages suggests that <italic>M. tb</italic> strains’ genetic backgrounds played a role in shaping the adaptive path to enhanced biofilm growth.</p><p>Epistasis, which refers to the phenotypic impact of interactions among mutations at distinct loci, has been observed previously during experimental evolution of microbes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>). Sign epistasis is a form of epistasis in which a mutation is advantageous on one genetic background and deleterious on another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinreich et al., 2005</xref>). The presence of sign epistasis can hinder access to a fitness optimum, and thus it represents a constraint on adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weinreich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Poelwijk et al., 2007</xref>). Our identification of mutations only in association with specific sub-lineages is consistent with sign epistasis, as is the observation of parallel adaptation in this small sample of strains: it suggests, for example, that mutations upstream of <italic>lpdA</italic> may be deleterious on some genetic backgrounds, and/or that alternatives are deleterious on the L.4.1.1.1 background. A careful review of the existing literature reveals additional evidence of sign epistasis in <italic>M. tb</italic>. For example, we and others have found evidence suggesting that <italic>M. tb</italic> lineage affects the mutational path to drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mortimer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Farhat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Castro et al., 2020</xref>). Even more striking, Manson et al. identified a stereotypic order of resistance mutation acquisition in a large survey of drug-resistant <italic>M. tb</italic> isolates, a finding that was subsequently replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ektefaie et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the acquisition of an initial resistance mutation alters the fitness associated with subsequent mutations, as has been observed in other settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). More direct evidence for sign epistasis comes from mutagenesis experiments, in which the lethality of gene knockouts has been shown to vary according to <italic>M. tb</italic> strain genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maksymiuk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Upregulation of <italic>lpdA</italic> during biofilm growth</title><p>As noted above, we identified convergent adaptation in the region upstream of <italic>lpdA</italic> (<italic>Rv3303c</italic>) on L.4.1.1.1 backgrounds. <italic>lpdA</italic> is annotated as a NAD(P)H quinone reductase, which is known to be expressed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deb et al., 2002</xref>) and to contribute to virulence in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhtar et al., 2006</xref>). It has not previously been linked with biofilm formation. The mechanism of its contribution to virulence in vivo is thought to be by protection against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhtar et al., 2006</xref>). The strains in our study evolved variants 5 bp apart, both of which lie within the TFBS for <italic>Rv1719</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Additionally, we found expression of this gene to be higher during biofilm growth when compared with planktonic growth. Further support for a link between increased expression of <italic>lpdA</italic> and enhanced pellicle growth comes from our data showing an increase in pellicle wet weight following introduction of a second copy of the gene via an integrative plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

This supports the hypothesis that biofilms are important at a specific phase of TB infection, and that enhanced biofilm growth can also occur in vivo through increased expression of <italic>lpdA</italic> and genes co-regulated with it. Taken together, these observations suggest that variants at the TFBS upstream of <italic>lpdA</italic> can be transiently selected during infection but are otherwise deleterious, possibly due to fitness costs associated with biofilm growth that is timed inappropriately.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The regulatory system as a target of selection in <italic>M. tb</italic></title><p>The L4.9 duplication and SNPs upstream of <italic>lpdA</italic> presumably act via regulation/gene dosage.

We did not observe any mutations at loci known to encode methyltransferase genes, but it is possible that adaptation to pellicle growth was accompanied by epigenomic changes, or that epigenomic changes occurring by an unknown mechanism contributed to the phenotypic changes we observed. Such epigenomic changes would have to be relatively stable, as the phenotypic changes we observed persisted following growth under standard planktonic conditions.</p><p>Broadly speaking, our results show that selection in our system appears to have targeted genes that regulate many other genes (hubs, e.g. <italic>phoP</italic>), and genes under regulation by many genes (e.g. <italic>acg</italic>), whose expression is likely responsive to a broad range of conditions. This reflects general features of <italic>M. tb’s</italic> regulatory network, which exhibits a high degree of connectivity between regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Galagan et al., 2013</xref>) as well as a hierarchical structure in which master regulators can rapidly calibrate global patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Parvati Sai Arun et al., 2018</xref>).

The study involves phenotypic and genotypic analyses of six clinical isolates of Mtb upon multiple passages through biofilm growth. The study finds progressive emergence of mutations that eventually get fixed in the subsequent passages. Concomitant with the appearance of these mutations, the strains generally acquired greater propensity to form biofilms, implying that the mutations are likely to confer growth advantage during biofilm development. Moreover, the loci acquiring mutations appear to be distinct for each lineage, but somewhat overlap across different strains within a lineage. The authors identify mutations in two specific loci – lpdA and a 120Kb gene cluster with 172 genes – that appear to be convergent. By further showing that LpdA expression is upregulated in biofilms and that identified mutations increase its expression, the authors suggest an important role for this gene in biofilm formation. In addition, the authors identified mutations associated with the expression of multiple transcription regulators, some of which (e.g. RegX3) have been previously implicated in biofilms. Overall, this is an exciting study that offers new insight into genome optimization necessary for Mtb adaptation to biofilm growth. However, the paper in its current form is incomplete and additional experiments and analyses are necessary for clarity. Specifically, the manuscript needs revision in the following areas:</p><p>– A clear rationale for strain selection should be provided.</p><p>– Inclusion of additional controls will help interpret the mutations as evolution under selection pressure.</p><p>– Epistatic interactions among genes should be further analyzed in the context of pre-existing genetic variations among the strains. This will likely provide a more specific nature of allele combinations promoting Mtb growth in biofilms.</p><p>The crucial gaps listed below should be addressed.</p><p>1. Basis of selecting the six strains: The authors should include a clear rationale for selecting these specific six strains. It seems all the six strains have some defect in biofilm formation to start with, raising a question about evolution in the clinical strains that do form biofilms in the first passage. Doesn't this approach raise bias in the study?</p><p>2. How does experimental evolution differ from isolation of suppressor mutation of a biofilm defective mutant? This distinction should be discussed.</p><p>3. Some key controls in the experiments are missing. A necessary control would be the genomic analysis of the strains in planktonic culture passaged for similar period (at least 4 passages when the mutations in many strains are fixed). How will the trajectory of evolution appear in the absence of the selection pressure? Another important control could be a standard laboratory strain that is able to form biofilm (e.g. H37Rv). Inclusion of both these controls will offer insight into evolution without any selection pressure (the lack of pressure in H37Rv biofilms could be inferred from the fact that the mutations in the strain necessary for biofilm formation are already fixed). These controls therefore could render an important dataset for analyzing evolution under selection pressure of biofilm growth.</p><p>4. Epistasis: The lineage-specific convergence of mutations is remarkable and in my opinion the highlight of this study. However, this observation also begs the question as to what allelic combinations are necessary for genome optimization for Mtb growth in biofilms. While this has been touched very briefly in the paper, perhaps a careful sequences analysis of all six genomes, and pairing the pre-existing sequence variations with the evolving mutations could render some new insight.</p><p>5. Biofilm vs pathogenesis: In line 281-288, the authors report the rare nature of the evolved mutations in biofilms, with an implication that the loci are under &quot;strong purifying selection&quot; in the natural habitat of Mtb. Do the authors mean to suggest that the natural habitat of Mtb (host tissues) is not conducive for biofilm formation? If so, then this would apparently contradict the fact that mutations leading to higher expression of LpdA, a virulence factor, also promote biofilm formation. In fact, published literature also report multiple genes involved in virulence are required for biofilm formation, including those regulated by RegX3. Moreover, biofilm-like aggregates of Mtb have been reported in vivo by many studies, as cited in this paper. I suggest authors should clarify this point further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Rapid adaptation of a complex trait during experimental evolution of Mycobacterium&quot; by Smith et al. describes the use of experimental evolution for identifying genes/loci involved in controlling biofilm formation. The authors exposed six related strains from three subclades to the experimental evolution through successive growth as pellicle biofilms. After exposure to experimental pressure, the genomes were sequenced to map the loci associated with the biofilm formation/regulation. The authors then characterized several features such as pellicle architecture, cell length, wet weight of biofilm, growth rate, etc., and correlated them with the passage. The authors also utilized DNA sequencing for identifying genetic changes associated with experimental pressure. A handful of genetic loci were identified through this approach that could be related to biofilm formation and its regulation.</p><p>The primary strength of the manuscript is the finding that bacterial cells become geared up for forming thick biofilms with high amounts of EPS upon experimental evolution. This is anecdotal to the observation that lab strain of Mtb H37Rv leads to productive infection upon passaging in animals. This capacity is lost on subsequent culturing in vitro. However, authors have ignored that such phenotypes/morphotypes are reversible and generally regulated at the epigenetic level rather than at the genetic levels that lead to inheritance and permanency of the phenotype. Nevertheless, the authors have identified a few genetic loci that may be associated with stringent biofilm morphotypes. Given that it was claimed that these loci are involved in biofilm formation and or its regulation, experiments wherein the introduction of an allele leads to increased biofilm formation are needed to justify the claim. Without such experiments, these claims are not justified.</p><p>Besides, the comments in public review, I have the following specific comments for the authors.</p><p>– Data presented in figure 4 A, B, and C will improve by inducing data on H37Rv passages as well. It seems that the same growth curve of H37Rv for the three experiments is used in these panels. This should be clarified in the figure legends.</p><p>– Discussion may be shortened to improve the readability of the manuscript. At the same time, I would suggest briefly discussing the role of epigenetic factors in the context of the current study.</p><p>– I also feel that changes in the cell length and relative fitness for planktonic growth are not clearly correlated, i.e., some strains become larger, while others were smaller. Thus, authors may improve the readability of the manuscript by emphasizing more on the consistent morphotypes such as the increase in ECM and wet weight of pellicle formed by the passaged cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78454.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and we had a joint consultation.</p><p>The reviewers are clearly explained their concerns so I will not reiterate them all here except saying that the are 5 key points that deserve your attention and should be addressed.</p><p>1.

Doesn't this approach raise bias in the study?</p></disp-quote><p>Strains were chosen from our collection of ~500 clinical isolates based on genetic background and biofilm phenotype. We chose isolates that are relatively closely related but that exhibited different biofilm phenotypes prior to passaging in vitro. In this way, we could assess the impact of both genetic and phenotypic backgrounds on subsequent adaptation. We used a nested design with regards to phylogenetic structure of the study sample, with pairs of strains from each clade and the inclusion of two closely related clades (L4.4.1.1 and L4.1.1.2) and a third slightly more distantly related clade (L4.9). Prior to this study, it was known that distantly related strains exhibited different biofilm phenotypes (Pang et al. 2012); we add to the literature here an observation that subtle differences in genetic background can affect not only biofilm phenotype but also adaptation to a new environment.</p><p>In our large collection of clinical isolates, we have observed a continuum of biofilm phenotypes including isolates that do not form a visible biofilm. None of these isolates can be considered defective in the sense that they were all successful in establishing infection, and our observations indicate that biofilm production is non-binary, with biofilm growth exhibiting a spectrum of phenotypes. Our rationale for selecting the strains included in this experiment was to choose a sample with a range of starting biofilm phenotypes, with some forming robust biofilms (ie MT345) and others forming no visible biofilm (ie MT72) at baseline. We find that regardless of starting phenotype, all strains evolved more robust biofilms, and even that strains with different ancestral phenotypes evolved similar mutations (MT31 and MT55 duplication). This has been clarified in the “Sample” section of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How does experimental evolution differ from isolation of suppressor mutation of a biofilm defective mutant? This distinction should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not consider any of our strains defective – these strains all successfully established culture-positive infections and were directly isolated from patients. As noted above, they exhibited a range of biofilm phenotypes prior to the imposition of selection during passaging. The goal of our study was to direct further evolution of these strains to form more robust biofilms to identify genes and pathways involved in biofilm formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3a. Some key controls in the experiments are missing. A necessary control would be the genomic analysis of the strains in planktonic culture passaged for similar period (at least 4 passages when the mutations in many strains are fixed). How will the trajectory of evolution appear in the absence of the selection pressure?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added genomic data from passaging our strains as planktonic cultures:</p><p>three independently evolving replicates for each strain, four passages for each replicate. We would like to note that passaging as a planktonic culture is not an absence of selective pressure, but rather a different pressure than we induced during pellicle passage. That said, with these new data we are able to assess whether the mutations we identified as associated with more robust biofilm growth are general lab adaptations – i.e., mutations that arose after both planktonic and pellicle passage indicating a fitness advantage common to both environments. Our results show that the mutations in Table 1 are specific to enhanced growth in the pellicle environment. We did identify distinct mutations associated with planktonic passaging, and some similar observations to the pellicle passaging such as an effect of genetic background (epistasis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important control could be a standard laboratory strain that is able to form biofilm (e.g. H37Rv). Inclusion of both these controls will offer insight into evolution without any selection pressure (the lack of pressure in H37Rv biofilms could be inferred from the fact that the mutations in the strain necessary for biofilm formation are already fixed). These controls therefore could render an important dataset for analyzing evolution under selection pressure of biofilm growth.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in point #1, some of our ancestral strains made robust biofilms at baseline – specifically MT345 (Figure 3). Therefore, we have already included this control in our experimental design. Interestingly, we found that even though M345 formed a thick biofilm at baseline, it underwent one of the most dramatic changes in response to selection pressure in our experiment. This suggests that pellicle growth can be enhanced even among strains that are well adapted to this form of growth.</p><p>Part of our rationale for choosing clinical isolates for this study was to avoid the use of strains that have been heavily manipulated in the lab. H37Rv is well adapted to the lab environment, specifically to planktonic growth (see Figure 4) as it was not deliberately passaged as a pellicle. We do not believe H37Rv is likely to stop evolving in response to selection for pellicle growth (or other phenotypes). Indeed, while H37Rv strains form robust pellicles, BCG strains generally form heavier pellicles reflecting their years of deliberate passaging as a pellicle. This indicates that there is likely a large adaptive space left for H37Rv pellicle growth, as we observed with clinical isolates.</p><p>We also note that unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), it is not possible to manipulate bacterial strains in the lab without imposing a selection pressure. The selection pressures vary according to the specific type of manipulation, but bacterial strains will continue to evolve and adapt: this is reflected, for example, in the observation that H37Rv strains from different laboratories are genetically distinct and that virulence factors important for infection (eg. PDIM) can be lost even after minimal in vitro manipulation of bacterial strains (Domenech and Reed 2009; Ioerger et al. 2010). As discussed in the manuscript, experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that early adaptation is characterized initially by broad phenotypic leaps, but incremental changes can continue to occur over extended passaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Our working hypothesis, based on the existing literature and observations from this study, is that <italic>M. tb</italic> forms biofilms during natural infection but that this trait is tightly regulated and thus biofilm growth occurs only in response to specific stimuli. We hypothesize that the mutations observed in this experiment are not observed in nature because they result in global de-repression of biofilm formation, which could be detrimental during natural infection for many potential reasons such as the energetic costs of matrix production and their immunostimulatory properties. We have also noted overlaps between genes involved in biofilm formation and other aspects of virulence and did not mean to imply that these traits were segregated. We have edited the Discussion to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Rapid adaptation of a complex trait during experimental evolution of Mycobacterium&quot; by Smith et al. describes the use of experimental evolution for identifying genes/loci involved in controlling biofilm formation.

Phenotypic assays (wet weights, Figure 3 and growth curves, Figure 4) were performed following a cycle of planktonic growth, rather than carrying the pellicle passaging forward into these assays. At the conclusion of the experiment, the strains were frozen and subsequently revived in a single planktonic culture prior to performing the phenotypic assays.</p><p>We did not observe any mutations at methyltransferase alleles but do not discount the possibility that the mutations we did observe had an effect on methylation or other epigenetic changes by unknown mechanisms. This has been clarified in the results. Although we considered further ‘back-passaging’ as a planktonic culture, this would exert distinct selection pressures, as shown by our planktonically passaged populations, that would interfere with the observations specific to pellicle conditions.
