In the central auditory system, neurons modulate their responses to sounds based on statistical context. These response modulations can be understood through a hierarchical predictive coding lens: responses to repeated stimuli are progressively decreased, in a process known as repetition suppression, whereas unexpected stimuli produce a prediction error signal. Prediction error incrementally increases along the auditory hierarchy from the inferior colliculus (IC) to the auditory cortex (AC), suggesting that these regions may engage in hierarchical predictive coding. A potential substrate for top-down predictive cues is the massive set of descending projections from the AC to subcortical structures, although the role of this system in predictive processing has never been directly assessed. We tested the effect of optogenetic inactivation of the auditory cortico-collicular feedback in awake mice on responses of IC neurons to stimuli designed to test prediction error and repetition suppression. Inactivation of the cortico-collicular pathway led to a decrease in prediction error in IC. Repetition suppression was unaffected by cortico-collicular inactivation, suggesting that this metric may reflect fatigue of bottom-up sensory inputs rather than predictive processing. We also discovered populations of IC units that exhibit repetition enhancement, a sequential increase in firing with stimulus repetition. Cortico-collicular inactivation led to a decrease in repetition enhancement in the central nucleus of IC, suggesting that it is a top-down phenomenon. Negative prediction error, a stronger response to a tone in a predictable rather than unpredictable sequence, was suppressed in shell IC units during cortico-collicular inactivation. These changes in predictive coding metrics arose from bidirectional modulations in the response to the standard and deviant contexts, such that the units in IC responded more similarly to each context in the absence of cortical input. We also investigated how these metrics compare between the anesthetized and awake states by recording from the same units under both conditions. We found that metrics of predictive coding and deviance detection differ depending on the anesthetic state of the animal, with negative prediction error emerging in the central IC and repetition enhancement and prediction error being more prevalent in the absence of anesthesia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the AC provides cues about the statistical context of sound to subcortical brain regions via direct feedback, regulating processing of both prediction and repetition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>inferior colliculus</kwd><kwd>feedback</kwd><kwd>predictive coding</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>auditory neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32MH120890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lesicko</surname><given-names>Alexandria MH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geffen</surname><given-names>Maria N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC014479</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geffen</surname><given-names>Maria N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS113241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geffen</surname><given-names>Maria N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DC016524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angeloni</surname><given-names>Christopher F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A specific neuronal pathway within the auditory system represents information about the statistical prediction and error for incoming sounds, thereby contributing to efficient representation of complex sounds and sound streams in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory systems differentially encode environmental stimuli depending on the context in which they are encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Franceschi and Barkat, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaramillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takesian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhai et al., 2020</xref>). The same physical stimulus can elicit distinct neuronal responses depending on whether it is predictable or unexpected in a given sensory stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weissbart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yaron et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons in select regions of the central auditory system are sensitive to statistical context, responding more strongly to a tone when it is presented rarely (a âdeviantâ) than when it is commonplace (a âstandardâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>). This phenomenon, known as stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), is prevalent in the auditory cortex (AC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Natan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>). Weaker SSA is present in regions peripheral to the AC, including the auditory midbrain, or inferior colliculus (IC), and the auditory thalamus, or medial geniculate body (MGB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duque and Malmierca, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malmierca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>). Subdivisions in IC and MGB that receive descending projections from AC exhibit relatively higher SSA levels than their lemniscal counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duque et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that SSA may be generated de novo in AC and subsequently broadcast to subcortical structures via corticofugal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelken and Ulanovsky, 2007</xref>). Silencing of AC through cooling, however, has been shown to modulate, but not abolish, SSA in IC and MGB of anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Malmierca, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antunes and Malmierca, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have implemented additional control tone sequences to further decompose the traditional SSA index into two distinct underlying processes: repetition suppression and prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harms et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruhnau et al., 2012</xref>). Repetition suppression is characterized by a decrease in firing rate to each subsequent presentation of a standard tone, whereas prediction error signals an enhanced response to a deviant tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auksztulewicz and Friston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). Hierarchical predictive coding posits that prediction errors signal the mismatch between predictions, formed based on prior experience with repeated presentations of the standard, and actual sensory input in the presence of a deviant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). These predictions are generated at higher levels of the sensory hierarchy and broadcast to lower stations to minimize processing of redundant input and maximize coding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). Prediction error has been proposed to underlie true deviance detection, while repetition suppression is thought to potentially reflect synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>). Prediction error increases along the auditory hierarchy and is more prevalent in regions of IC and MGB that receive cortical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that these subcortical regions may engage in hierarchical predictive coding, with AC potentially providing predictive cues to IC and MGB. However, how feedback projections from AC shape predictive processing in subcortical targets has never been directly assessed. In fact, virtually all models of hierarchical predictive coding to date have focused on intracortical connections, with the massive system of descending corticofugal projections remaining unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asilador and Llano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated how inputs from AC to IC, the first station in the auditory system in which prediction error is found, shape metrics associated with predictive coding and deviance detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). To test this, we optogenetically inactivated cortico-collicular feedback while recording neuronal responses in IC and found that prediction error, negative prediction error, and repetition enhancement in IC are altered in the absence of cortical input. Our results suggest that the cortico-collicular pathway sends cues from AC to IC regarding the statistical context of auditory stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We used a Cre/FLEX viral injection strategy to selectively express the inhibitory opsin, ArchT, in cortico-collicular neurons of four mice by injecting a retroAAV-Cre-GFP construct into IC and an AAV9-FLEX-ArchT-tdTomato construct into AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left).

Auditory stimuli consisted of oddball sequences of two repeated pure tones, presented at a 90:10 standard-to-deviant ratio and half-octave frequency separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The difference in firing rate to the standard and deviant was quantified with an index of neuronal mismatch (iMM), which is equivalent to the SSA index used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A cascade stimulus consisting of 10 evenly spaced tones, including the tone pair from the oddball sequence, was presented to further decompose the neuronal mismatch between the responses to the standard and deviant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This stimulus is unique in that each tone occurs with the same likelihood as the deviant tone in the oddball stimulus (10%), but it contains no true statistical deviants: each tone has the same likelihood of presentation, and the tone sequence overall follows a regular and predictable pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the response to a given tone when it is embedded in the cascade can be compared to the response when it is a deviant in order to isolate prediction error effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, top). A neuron exhibits prediction error if it fires more strongly to a tone when it is a deviant than when it is presented in the cascade sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top). Conversely, if a neuron responds more strongly to a tone presented in the cascade sequence than when it is a deviant, the neuron encodes negative prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom). This phenomenon is quantified using an index of prediction error (iPE), with positive indices indicating prediction error and negative indices representing negative prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The cascade sequence is also free from repetition effects since adjacent tone presentations never include a tone of the same frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, the response to a given tone embedded in the cascade sequence can be compared to the response generated when that tone is a standard. The difference in response indicates either repetition suppression (stronger response to the tone in the cascade) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top) or repetition enhancement (stronger response to the tone as a standard) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom). These contrasting processes are quantified by the index of repetition suppression (iRS), with a positive index indicating repetition suppression and a negative index representing repetition enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cre/FLEX viral injection strategy enables selective inactivation of cortico-collicular neurons</title><p>Examination of fixed tissue from injected mice revealed that expression of the retroAAV-Cre-GFP construct was restricted to IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, top left). Somatic expression of GFP (indicating the presence of Cre) was restricted to layer 5 and deep layer 6 of AC, which contain cortico-collicular cell bodies, and was broadly distributed throughout the rostro-caudal extent of AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bajo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schofield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yudintsev et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of tdTomato was found in the soma and processes of neurons in layers 5 and 6, with additional apical dendritic labeling observed in the upper cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, right). The laminar expression of tdTomato is consistent with previous studies and suggests that AAV9-FLEX-ArchT-tdTomato expression is Cre-dependent and not due to nonspecific labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackwell et al., 2020</xref>). Axons and terminals labeled with tdTomato were distributed in IC in a manner matching the known projection pattern of this pathway, with dense, âpatchyâ labeling in shell regions of IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, bottom left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lesicko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SaldaÃ±a et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torii et al., 2013</xref>).

We quantitatively parsed our recording sites by exploiting known differences in the sharpness of tuning and direction of frequency gradients between shell and central regions: shell IC neurons tend to have broader frequency tuning (low sparseness) than central IC neurons, and the central IC is characterized by a highly stereotyped tonotopic gradient with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitkin et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malmierca et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stiebler and Ehret, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Syka et al., 2000</xref>).

Given that neuronal responses to sound depend on the state of anesthesia of the subject, it is possible that there are differences in predictive coding metrics between the awake and anesthetized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fontanini and Katz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaese and Ostwald, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schumacher et al., 2011</xref>). While previous studies have characterized how anesthesia affects SSA, it remains unknown whether its component repetition and prediction metrics differ with anesthetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duque and Malmierca, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we first characterized how anesthesia affects these predictive coding metrics in a subset of animals. We first performed awake recordings and then repeated our experimental procedures, leaving the animal head-fixed and the probe in place, after anesthetizing the mouse with isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This protocol allowed us to compare how metrics of predictive coding differ between the awake and anesthetized preparations in the same population of units.</p><p>In the central IC, the mean iMM in the anesthetized condition was positive, indicative of prevalent adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The iMM values under anesthesia were significantly higher than those obtained while the animal was awake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=8.8e-05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To better understand what prediction or repetition effects underlie iMM in each condition, the iMM for both distributions was further decomposed into an iPE and iRS. In the anesthetized condition, the mean iPE value of 0.077 indicated the presence of modest prediction error, while a mean iPE of â0.13 indicated that negative prediction error is significantly more prevalent in the awake condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.017, Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test). Under both anesthetized and awake conditions, prominent repetition suppression was observed in the central IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the central IC, the mean iMM was significantly more positive in shell regions during anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=3.5e-08, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). A greater proportion of units in the awake condition had a negative iMM compared with the anesthetized distribution, indicating that facilitation (a greater response to the standard than the deviant context) is more common in the awake than the anesthetized condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The iPE values in shell IC suggest that prediction error is significantly higher in the awake compared to the anesthetized condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=2.6e-05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Although the distribution for the iRS under anesthesia had a positive mean of 0.25, indicating prevalent repetition suppression, the awake distribution exhibited a significant leftward shift by comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, the mean iRS for the awake condition was negative (mean = â0.056), indicating that repetition <italic>enhancement</italic>, rather than suppression, is present in the awake shell IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=2.5e-16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

Combined, these results suggest that removing cortical feedback reduced prediction error but not repetition suppression in adapting units.</p><p>Prior studies of deviance detection in IC have focused exclusively on adapting units. However, given the relative prevalence of facilitating units discovered in the awake versus anesthetized IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we further investigated this population of units to determine whether facilitation reflects prediction or repetition effects. In the central nucleus, cortico-collicular inactivation led to a significant decrease in facilitation in facilitating units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0036, Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test). At baseline, the iMM for facilitating units represents a combination of negative prediction error and repetition enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, middle and bottom). During inactivation, negative prediction error remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, middle), while repetition enhancement was nearly abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0026, Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test).

In this case, however, the change in iMM was driven by the near abolishment of negative prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, middle; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.037, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), while repetition enhancement was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, bottom).</p><p>These data suggest that adaptation and facilitation in the awake IC are composed of distinct underlying processes: adapting populations in both central and shell regions of IC exhibit prediction error and repetition suppression, while facilitating populations are characterized by negative prediction error and repetition enhancement. In adapting units in both central and shell regions, cortico-collicular inactivation significantly decreases prediction error. Facilitating units in the central IC display decreased repetition enhancement with cortico-collicular inactivation, while those in shell regions exhibit decreased negative prediction error. To ensure that the laser-induced changes described above were opsin-mediated, we performed control experiments in two mice with identical manipulations to the experimental group, but in the absence of ArchT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). At baseline, the control group exhibited a similar distribution of iMM values to the experimental group in both the central and shell regions of IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Similar proportions of adapting/facilitating/nonadapting units were also found in the control (central: 23% adapting, 5% facilitating, 71% nonadapting; shell: 29% adapting, 18% facilitating, 53% nonadapting) and experimental groups (central: 24% adapting, 6% facilitating, 70% nonadapting; shell: 29% adapting, 9% facilitating, 62% nonadapting).

sequence is free of repetition effects between adjacent tone pairs, it does exhibit global repetition across the entire tone sequence. To assess whether global stimulus regularity affects the response to the cascade context, we used a shuffled version of the cascade sequence, known as the âmany standardsâ sequence, as an additional control stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The many standards sequence contains the same 10 tones as the cascade but presented in random order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). This reduces the potential for adaptation across adjacent frequency channels and also eliminates the global predictability of the stimulus, both of which could lead to suppression of responses to tones in the cascade context and potentially affect the calculations of iMM, iPE, and iRS. We compared the responses of adapting and facilitating units in both central and shell regions of IC to tones in the cascade versus the many standards context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). We found no significant differences in firing rates to the cascade versus the many standards contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the global structure of the cascade sequence does not significantly affect how units in IC respond to this stimulus, as has been shown in other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casado-RomÃ¡n et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parras et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>iMM distribution does not differ between single- and multiunit types</title><p>The analysis of changes in predictive coding metrics is performed on pooled single- and multiunit responses of IC units. To determine whether the expression of neuronal mismatch differs between these unit types, we plotted the iMM for laser OFF and ON conditions for each of the subgroups in the central and shell regions of the IC separated by single- (displayed in teal) and multiunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We observed no differences in the distributions of these unit types in central or shell IC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; central OFF: p=0.88, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; central ON: p=0.93, Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test; shell OFF: p=0.19, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; shell ON: p=0.21, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). We therefore combined data from both single- and multiunits for the analyses of predictive coding metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Nonadapting units also display top-down repetition enhancement</title><p>The majority of units in both central and shell IC do not exhibit either adaptation or facilitation but respond similarly to tones when they are presented as a standard or deviant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, since both negative and positive metrics are included in the calculation of iMM, it is still possible that these units exhibit predictive processing that may not be reflected in the overall iMM value. We further characterized these nonadapting units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and tested how they are affected by cortico-collicular inactivation. Nonadapting units in the central nucleus exhibited a significant increase in iMM during inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=2.7e-06, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), whereas those in the shell IC were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top). The change in iMM for nonadapting units in the central nucleus was driven by a significant increase in iRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom middle; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0011, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). To determine whether this reflected a change in repetition suppression or enhancement, we further segregated central nonadapting units according to whether their baseline iRS values were negative or positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom). Only those units with negative baseline iRS values (i.e., those units showing repetition enhancement) were significantly affected by cortico-collicular inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.00012, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In control experiments without ArchT, no significant changes were observed in nonadapting units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). These results indicate that, similar to central facilitating units, central nonadapting units display repetition enhancement, and that input from the cortex is critical for expression of this phenomenon.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Nonadapting units also display top-down repetition enhancement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of adapting types (adapting, facilitating, and nonadapting) for units in central (left) and shell (right) regions of the inferior colliculus (IC).

Similarly, the shift in prediction metrics observed with inactivation could be due to altered responses to either the cascade or deviant contexts. We next determined whether the laser-induced changes in the iMM, iPE, and iRS for adapting units reflect changes in the firing rates to the standard, deviant, or cascade contexts. We found that adapting units in the central nucleus increased responses to the standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0092, one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test) and decreased responses to the deviant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0054, one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test) during inactivation. These results explain the decrease in iMM for this population during the laser stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top): the firing rate to the cascade stimulus did not change during cortico-collicular inactivation, which means that the decrease in firing rate to the deviant alone underlies the decrease in prediction error observed for this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, middle). Adapting units in the shell exhibited the same pattern of bidirectional changes to the standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.035, one-sample Wilcoxon test) and deviant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; p=0.0057, one-sample Wilcoxon test), similarly accounting for their decrease in iMM and prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), with no change in response to the cascade condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Adapting and facilitating units were bidirectionally modulated by cortico-collicular inactivation, with adapting units becoming less adapting and facilitating units becoming less facilitating on laser trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The decrease in adaptation for adapting units was driven by a decrease in prediction error for units in both central and shell regions of IC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, pink arrows). For facilitating and nonadapting units in the central nucleus, inactivation-driven changes were caused by a decrease in repetition enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, gold dashed arrows). The decrease in facilitation in the shell IC, however, was caused by the abolishment of negative prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, pink dashed arrows).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Corticofugal regulation of predictive coding.</title><p>Laser inactivation led to the abolishment of repetition enhancement in central facilitating units and the abolishment of negative prediction error in shell facilitating units.

Overall, these bidirectional changes indicate that, without input from AC, IC responds more similarly to tones in the standard and deviant contexts. These findings demonstrate that AC provides critical contextual cues about the statistics of the auditory environment to targets in IC under normal conditions. We further discuss these results in the context of a hierarchical predictive coding framework below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>iMM in the awake versus anesthetized IC</title><p>Our results include the first investigation of how the repetition and prediction processes that underlie deviance detection in the awake IC compare to the anesthetized condition. Our data suggest that while iMM values are higher under anesthesia, they almost entirely reflect repetition suppression, with only a small contribution of prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the central IC, modest prediction error is present under anesthesia, but negative prediction error becomes dominant when the animal is awake. In the shell IC, the same units exhibit drastically different iPE and iRS values for the awake versus the anesthetized condition. Prediction error is substantially higher in the awake IC, and repetition enhancement, rather than repetition suppression, is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>). These findings suggest that the iMM values in the awake and anesthetized brain reflect different underlying processes, and that anesthesia induces bidirectional changes in metrics of repetition and prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Facilitating units in IC</title><p>We also provide here the first analysis of facilitating units in IC. Previous studies that have investigated iMM have focused selectively on the positive side of the iMM distribution since these units display adaptation. However, facilitation seems to be enriched in the awake IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>) and reflects other potentially interesting parameters, such as repetition enhancement (represented as a higher response to the standard than the cascade sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and negative prediction error (represented as a higher response to the cascade than the deviant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Repetition enhancement and repetition suppression in IC</title><p>Because previous studies that have applied a predictive coding framework to decompose neuronal mismatch have focused exclusively on adapting neurons, the repetition enhancement found here in facilitating units has not been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is well-documented in fMRI literature that repetition enhancement is a common phenomenon in humans, existing either alongside or in place of repetition suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Gardelle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MÃ¼ller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Segaert et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, repetition enhancement has been proposed to reflect novel network formation and consolidation of novel sensory representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Segaert et al., 2013</xref>). Once new representations have been formed, repetition suppression is hypothesized to take over, reflecting the minimization in prediction errors that occurs when new representations give rise to accurate predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auksztulewicz and Friston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Gardelle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). Though the repetition enhancement described in human studies differs drastically on spatial and temporal scales from the phenomenon described here, we find that it similarly involves a sequential enhancement in the response to subsequent presentations of the standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Repetition enhancement has also been observed in the MGB in response to temporally degraded stimuli that are hypothesized to engage top-down resources to compensate for bottom-up acoustic information loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kommajosyula et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, this enhancement is reversed when cortico-thalamic pathways are blocked, further suggesting that repetition enhancement in the auditory system reflects a top-down phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kommajosyula et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While repetition suppression can be understood from a predictive coding framework, it can also be viewed from the perspective of neuronal fatigue, whereby the incremental decrease in firing rate to a repeated standard tone is simply explained by synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escera and Malmierca, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we did not find any effect on repetition suppression during cortico-collicular inactivation, suggesting that it may reflect fatigue of bottom-up sensory inputs rather than an active predictive process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, gold arrows). While these data do not provide definitive proof of either perspective, they do suggest that the processes that underlie repetition suppression in IC do not involve top-down cortical signals. This notion is supported by the fact that repetition suppression was much more prevalent when animals were under anesthesia, a state in which the auditory responsiveness in the cortex is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brugge and Merzenich, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuki et al., 1959</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Prediction error in IC</title><p>In both central and shell populations that exhibited prediction error at baseline, cortico-collicular inactivation led to a decrease, or complete abolishment, of prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). According to models of hierarchical predictive coding, higher-order stations generate predictions that they broadcast to lower centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). These predictions are compared with representations of the actual sensory input, and if there is a mismatch, a prediction error is generated and forwarded up the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). Under this framework, the inactivation of top-down inputs would interfere with communication of predictions, leading to dysfunction in the prediction error response, as seen in our data. Another possibility is that prediction errors are directly backpropagated from AC to IC. While this contradicts canonical predictive coding models, evidence for prediction error has been found in deep layers of the cortex in which feedback neurons reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asilador and Llano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rummell et al., 2016</xref>). Though the precise mechanism underlying the generation of prediction error in IC remains unclear, our data show that feedback from AC plays a critical role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Negative prediction error in IC</title><p>In addition to units with prediction error, we found that units in IC that responded more strongly to the cascade than the deviant context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). A stronger response to a tone in the cascade sequence compared to the context in which it is a deviant could simply reflect a relative lack of cross-frequency adaptation; the oddball stimulus consists of repeated tone presentations of two neighboring frequencies, making it more likely to generate cross-frequency effects than the cascade stimulus, which cycles through repetitions of 10 evenly spaced frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies that have investigated the effective bandwidth for cross-frequency adaptation, however, have found that it occurs between channels with a frequency separation of a third of an octave or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>). The stimuli used in this study had a half-octave frequency separation, indicating that cross-frequency effects should be minimized. Therefore, it is unlikely that the negative prediction error responses observed in this study simply reflect cross-frequency adaptation to the oddball stimulus.</p><p>A stronger response to a tone when it is embedded in a completely predictable sequence, such as the cascade sequence, than when it is a deviant could also signify that a neuron encodes predictions, rather than prediction errors. In hierarchical predictive coding, both predictions and prediction errors are generated at every level of the hierarchy, with prediction errors being forwarded to ascending sensory centers and predictions being backpropagated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</xref>). In the shell IC, the region that receives the vast majority of descending cortical input, evidence for negative prediction error was abolished during cortico-collicular inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), consistent with the notion that feedback from the cortex may carry predictions to IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bajo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SaldaÃ±a et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stebbings et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, negative prediction error in the central nucleus remained unperturbed during inactivation of cortical feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Given that only a small fraction of cortico-collicular fibers terminate in the central nucleus, it is likely that it receives predictions from another source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bajo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SaldaÃ±a et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stebbings et al., 2014</xref>). An intriguing potential candidate for this source of predictions could be the shell IC, given the extensive network of intracollicular connections in IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesicko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">SaldaÃ±a and MerchÃ¡n, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">SaldaÃ±a and MerchÃ¡n, 2005</xref>). Future studies will be required to determine whether the negative prediction error metric described here captures the type of top-down predictions described in canonical predictive coding models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>One limitation of this study is that laser inactivation achieved only partial and not complete inactivation of the cortico-collicular pathway. Given that light itself can have a modulatory or toxic effect on neurons, these types of optogenetic experiments require a careful titration between using enough power to substantially affect the population of interest without causing nonspecific light or heat-based perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyssowski and Gray, 2019</xref>). Though other techniques, such as chemogenetic approaches or cooling, provide more complete inactivation, they do not allow for rapid and reversible inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">English and Roth, 2015</xref>). With our laser power parameters, we found a mean 60% reduction in firing in putative cortico-collicular neurons at baseline and a 45% reduction during presentation of pure tone stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This reduction produced clear effects on repetition and prediction processing in IC, in several cases with the severe reduction or complete abolishment of certain metrics of deviance detection, such as prediction error and repetition enhancement in the central nucleus and negative prediction error in the shell IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The interpretation of these results should bear in mind that they reflect only partial and not complete inactivation.</p><p>The analyses in this study were performed on pooled single- and multiunit data. Although we observed no differences in the iMM distribution between single- and multiunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), the results of this study should be interpreted with this limitation in mind, namely, photosuppression-induced changes in these units may not reflect changes in single neurons.</p><p>Whereas this study focuses on changes specific to the cortico-collicular pathway, it should be noted that cortico-collicular neurons are known to branch to additional subcortical targets besides the IC, including the MGB, caudal regions of the dorsal striatum, and the lateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asokan et al., 2018</xref>). The fact that our photo-suppression experiments produce short-latency effects in the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>) indicates that the observed changes are likely due to direct, monosynaptic AC to IC pathways, and that multisynaptic effects from other collateral sites are unlikely. Nevertheless, the potential contribution from these additional downstream targets cannot be definitely ruled out and should be factored into the interpretation of the results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings indicate that deviance detection and predictive coding in IC involve additional complexity than has been previously described. We provide here the first description of facilitating units in IC, as well as evidence for the existence of repetition enhancement and negative prediction error in these units. We show that AC regulates these metrics and is also involved in the generation of prediction error in IC. Repetition suppression is unaffected by inactivation of cortical input to IC, providing evidence that this process may reflect bottom-up fatigue rather than top-down predictive processing. These results demonstrate the role of AC in providing contextual cues about the auditory stream to targets in IC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cdh23</italic> mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cdh23tm2.1Kjn</italic>/J;RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:018399">IMSR_JAX:018399</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-CAG-FLEX-ArchT-tdTomato</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_28305">Addgene_28305</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RetroAAV2 hSyn Cre-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">In-house</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vector generated and maintained in the di Biasi lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kilosort2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Marius Pachitariu</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort">https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_016422">SCR_016422</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/">https://www.mathworks.com/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NIH</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We performed experiments in six adult <italic>Cdh23</italic> mice (<italic>Cdh23tm2.1Kjn</italic>/J, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:018399">IMSR_JAX:018399</ext-link>; four males and two females, age 3â8 months).

We lowered a 32-channel silicon probe (Neuronexus) vertically into IC during presentation of broadband noise clicks and monitored sound responses online to confirm localization within IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a subset of animals (seven recording sites in two mice), the probe was first coated in a lipophilic dye (DiD or DiA; Invitrogen) to aid in post hoc reconstruction of recording sites. In each animal, two recordings were performed per IC (four total recording sessions bilaterally). We attempted to target both shell and central IC regions in each animal, and our post hoc analysis of recording sites (see details in âAnalysisâ section) revealed that all but one animal was recorded from in both regions. Recordings that did not show significant sound responsiveness were removed from the analysis. Following completion of all IC recording sessions, we recorded the activity of neurons in AC using the same procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We performed a square craniotomy (2 mm Ã 2 mm) over AC and oriented the probe vertically to the cortical surface (35Â° angle of the stereotaxic arm). Electrophysiological data were filtered between 600 and 6000 Hz to isolate spike responses and then digitized at 32 kHz and stored for offline analysis (Neuralynx). For a subset of recordings, the experimental procedures were repeated while recording from the same units after the animal had been anesthetized with isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We performed spike sorting using Kilosort2 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort">https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_016422">SCR_016422</ext-link>, version 2). Both single and multiunits were included for all analyses (experimental IC: 50 single units, 354 multiunits; control IC: 17 single units; 111 multiunits; anesthetized: 10 single units, 129 multiunits; AC: 95 single units, 300 multiunits; putative cortico-collicular: 9 single units; 11 multiunits).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Laser inactivation</title><p>We inactivated cortico-collicular neurons using a 532 nm DPSS laser (GL532T3-300, Slocs lasers, 3 mW power at cannula tip or OptoEngine, MGL-III-532, 15 mW power at cannula tip) connected via optical fibers to the implanted cannulas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C and D</xref>). Data collected using either laser was pooled together as no significant differences were observed in the strength of inactivation in AC during silence (p=0.054, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or the presentation of pure tone stimuli (p=0.072, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) between the two lasers. Square laser pulses were timed to coincide with tone onset and lasted for 100 ms. Evidence of inactivation in putative cortico-collicular units (infragranular AC units with a minimum 30% reduction in both baseline and sound-evoked neuronal activity) was confirmed for all animals included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stimuli</title><p>We generated an initial frequency response function from a sequence of 50 pure tones, 1â70 kHz, repeated 20 times at 70 dB SPL in pseudo-random order. This response function was generated online to select suitable frequencies for the oddball stimuli, that is, frequencies that would fall into the average response area for units in a given recording. Each tone was 50 ms duration (1 ms cosine squared ramps) with an inter-stimulus interval of 200 ms and presentation rate of 4 Hz. A similar tuning curve stimulus, with eight amplitude levels (35â70 dB, 5 dB increments) and five repetitions, was used to further characterize the tuning properties of each unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E, F</xref>).</p><p>Oddball tone pairs were chosen to fit within the average response area for units from a given recording. Given the prevalence of inhibited regions in the tuning curves, and the fact that this often led to differences in the response profile of the unit to each frequency in the oddball tone pair, the responses to each frequency were analyzed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2G</xref>). Oddball stimuli consisted of a frozen sequence of two pure tones (with the same tone parameters as those used in the initial frequency response functions) with a 90:10 standard-to-deviant ratio and half-octave frequency separation. The number of standards interleaved between two deviants was counterbalanced and varied between 3 and 17 standards. The stimuli were divided into blocks (with the end of a block defined by the presentation of a deviant), and tone type and laser pairings were alternated on subsequent blocks. For example, on the first block the laser stimulus was paired with the deviant, on the second block it was paired with the last standard, and the corresponding tones in the third block served as baseline controls, with no laser stimulus. The number of preceding standards in the blocks was balanced for all three laser conditions (deviant, last standard, and baseline). Each block type (laser + standard, laser + deviant, no laser) was presented 45 times, and the total number of tones in each sequence was 1250. Two oddball sequences were created, both with the same frozen pattern, but with the frequencies of the standard and the deviant switched.</p><p>Cascade sequences consisted of either an ascending or descending set of 10 evenly log-spaced (half-octave separation) pure tones (same tone parameters as described above) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The two tones used in the oddball sequences were always included as adjacent tones in the cascade sequences, though their position within the cascade was varied. To generate the many standards control sequence, we shuffled the cascade sequences using an algorithm that does not allow for repetition of tones of the same frequency on subsequent presentations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis</title><p>To distinguish between shell and central IC recording locations, we plotted the best frequency for each unit from a given recording against its depth and fit the data with a robust linear regression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, we computed the mean sparseness for all units from a given recording site to quantify the sharpness of tuning. The R<sup>2</sup> metric from the linear fit and the mean sparseness from each recording were used to perform k-means clustering with two groups. Each recording was assigned to a location (either central or shell) according to the k-means output, with central sites typically having high sparseness and high R<sup>2</sup> values and shell sites having low sparseness and low R<sup>2</sup> metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Sound response profiles were categorized quantitatively from analysis of the combined responses to the standard and deviant tones using MATLABâs âfindpeaksâ function with a minimum peak height set to the mean of the baseline period (50 ms before tone onset) Â± 3 SDs. Units that did not display maxima or minima during the tone duration period (0â50 ms) or in the 50 ms after (the âoffset windowâ) were labeled as sound unresponsive and were removed from the analysis. Units that showed only a single minimum (âinhibitedâ units) or only a response in the offset window were similarly removed from the analysis. Units that showed at least one maxima during the tone duration period were included in the analysis and further categorized as either onset (single maxima in the first 10 ms after tone onset), sustained (single maximum after the first 10 ms after tone onset), E-I or I-E (units that displayed both a maximum and minimum during the tone duration period), biphasic (units that displayed two maxima during the tone duration period), or mixed (units with greater than two maxima and/or minima during the tone response period). It was common for units to display a response both during the tone duration window and the offset window, and in these cases a combined response profile was assigned (e.g., onset/offset, sustained/inhibited offset). Units with only inhibited or offset responses were removed from the dataset.</p><p>Significant adaptation or facilitation for each unit was assessed with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the trial-by-trial firing rates to the standard and deviant on the 45 baseline trials. The iMM, identical to the traditional SSA index, was further deconstructed into an iPE and an iRS such that iMM = iPE + iRS. The raw firing rates to the standard, cascade, and deviant conditions were normalized by dividing by the Euclidean norm, N = <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula> .

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Cortico-fugal regulation of predictive coding&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer Groh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, after discussion among the reviewers, the most important consensus concerns that emerged were (a) whether the findings are novel in comparison to similar existing studies, including those that involved cooling in auditory cortex and the impact of such cooling on the IC, and (b) the suggestion that some of the reported effects could be due to regression to the mean. This is a potentially addressable problem via the suggestion of Reviewer 2 point 2b. Finally (c) it was noted that the central/shell distinction is critical to the novelty of the findings. Histological confirmation of the assignment of sites to these subdivisions would strengthen the paper. While there were some differences of opinion regarding the clarity of the manuscript, we hope you find even the more critical comments useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study Lesicko and colleagues have studied the effect of AC inactivation using the optogenetic technique to analyze neuronal mismatch in the interior colliculus of the awake mouse.</p><p>The study is interesting and is potentially beneficial for the people working on predictive coding. However, the manuscript is long and could be substantially trimmed and focused to make it more useful. While I was originally excited about the manuscript, my enthusiasm decreased after I read it. I had to read several times to make sense and get a general idea of results and still I am not totally convinced about the data and the presentation. In its present form I cannot recommend acceptance as in my humbly view this manuscript needs to be substantially revised.</p><p>As opposed to what the authors claims, and after close inspection of previous studies by ParrasÂ´ and by their team, it seems to me much of the basic/general results are similar to Parras and colleagues or even Duque and Malmierca. These authors also studied SSA and iMM in awake mouse. The main results are similar. Low levels of iMM and iPE in the IC. This is a major issue for me. Given the low levels of SSA/iMM, I wonder how authors consider if a neuron shows significant iMMâ¦(bootstrapping??) as AC may have mostly subtle changes on the IC responses.</p><p>Another major issue is that authors claim that have recorded separately neurons from the central nucleus and the shell. However, they donÂ´t show any histological probe of the electrode recording. The central nucleus in mouse is very small and although it shows a distinct tonotopic organization and response are areas are usually V shaped, these responses can also occur in the shell. So, my concern is that most of the neurons may be actually recorded in the shell. I would like to draw the attention to the authors that previous studies on subcortical SSA/iMM have demonstrated the lack of adapting responses in the central nucleus. Of course, all previous studies may have missed this, but I dare to suggest that much of the authors central nucleus data may actually be from the shell. In any case, this needs to be unambiguously demonstrated here with some histological data; it is not adequate to rely solely on the frequency response areas, Even if this is shown, I would like to see a convincing conceptual framework to understand it.</p><p>Also, the conclusion that the cascade and many-standard controls yield similar results has also been reported in Parras and Casado-Roman recently.</p><p>The most original part of this study is the in-depth analysis of the repetition enhancement responses, but I also would like to draw the authorsÂ´ attention to the previous study by Parras where they also reported negative iPE (cf. Figures3 rat and Figure 7 awake mouse). This is mentioned on page 29, lines 694-696, but it should be more clearly stated in abstract etc. so that previous studies get a fairer recognition. Also, Duque and Malmierca already have reported that SSA (which reflects iMM) is lower in awake than in anesthetized mouse. This is mostly due to the high rate of spontaneous activity, which is not mentioned in this study.</p><p>The most interesting part of the paper is the section related to the effect of cortical deactivation. However, as the authors themselves note, the technique has some limitations. I would like a more detailed discussion on how such limitations may have affected the results and hence the conclusions. Another important issue not addressed is where in AC the injections were made (A1, AAF, A2, etc ???) and how large the injection sites are. These technicalities may have affected the results and should also be considered and different fields may have different projections to IC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Lesicko et al. studied the role of corticofugal feedback in predictive coding in the auditory system, building on previous studies of stimulus-specific adaption. With a focus on the IC, the authors measured contextual effects on tone responses with and without Arch-mediated inactivation of AC neurons that project to the IC. Using a tone cascade stimulus as a baseline, they divided SSA effects into adaptation to a regular, repeating stimulus (repetition suppression) and enhanced responses to an oddball stimulus (prediction error). This work nicely replicates some previous findings, including the relatively low rates of SSA in IC, especially central areas, the decrease in SSA magnitude for awake versus anesthetized animals, and the decrease in SSA magnitude following inactivation of auditory cortex. By breaking SSA effects into its components, they are able to argue that feedback from AC primarily signals prediction error (rather than suppression). In addition, they identify a group of neurons that shows an opposite pattern to standard SSA, with enhanced responses to repetition and decreased responses to oddball stimuli.</p><p>Several new observations help refine understanding of the role of cortical feedback in sound processing. Perhaps most substantial is the observation of enhanced repetition responses in the auditory midbrain. While these results may be important, there are some methodological/analytical concerns that should be addressed, especially given that the pattern of repetition enhancement has not been reported previously.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. The novelty of the current result could be spelled out more clearly. The authors cite previous work from the Malmierca group reporting diminished SSA in awake animals and when cortex was silenced, but don't provide a more detailed comparison. Is the novelty of the current study that the cortical effect was linked specifically to prediction error? But why then is the major effect of Arch on non-adapting cells to increase repetition suppression? While there are some overarching themes, the results currently seem a bit scattered and would be strengthened if linked more directly to the previous work.</p><p>2. The report of facilitating neurons is quite interesting, but some important details are not clear.</p><p>a. (L. 213-214) It took some close reading, but it appears that neurons with suppressive responses were not analyzed for SSA effects. How were neurons with suppressive responses defined? If a neuron showed a transient response followed by suppression (eg, left panel of Figure 3D), did that count as suppressive? It appears in this example, that a tone actually evokes a sustained response that is suppressive, relative to the spontaneous rate. If repetition suppression is computed from raw firing rate, a decrease in suppression in this case could actually appear as an enhancement. The example in Figure 5F, of course, provides a clear demonstration of facilitation, but it is important to know what the typical response profile is for the adapting versus suppressive neurons and if they are qualitatively different. Perhaps the average PSTH responses could be compared?</p><p>b. (L. 386-391) How are neurons defined as adapting vs. facilitating? Based only on non-laser trials? One worries that some of the reported effects may reflect a regression to the mean. That is, if there was experimental noise that made responses slightly adapting or facilitating in the laser-off conditions, then the absence of adaptation or facilitation in the laser-on condition may be that the noise was absent. A potentially less biased approach would be to define adapting versus facilitating neurons based on responses averaged across both laser-on and -off trials. Given that the adaptation effects are relatively infrequent and small, this additional control seems important.</p><p>L. 47-48. &quot;suppression â¦ suppression&quot; Not a concern really, but a request. The language is technically correct, but the word suppression refers both to a neural computation (suppression of error signals) and optogenetic manipulation (Arch-mediated suppression).

The authors deploy a paradigm that permits dissociating two different forms of context-dependence, the predictability of a sound and the overall statistics of the sounds, and they use optogenetic methods to investigate the contributions of auditory cortex to how IC neurons alter their responses in these two different types of contexts â this is the particularly novel finding in the paper as the basics of IC neuron response characteristics as a function of context had been previously explored. The manuscript also provides a direct comparison of awake vs anesthetized mouse results, which is a very nice addition and service to the literature as it helps the community incorporate both awake and anesthetized results together and understand their similarities and differences.

Prediction error signals, reflecting a mismatch between expected and actual sensory inputs, have been described across sensory modalities and the contributions of bottom-up and top-down processing are still unknown. This work reveals the contributions of descending cortico-collicular inputs to predictive coding of neurons within the inferior colliculus.</p><p>In the present manuscript, Lesicko and colleagues studied the contributions of cortico-collicular neurons to the components underlying stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) of neurons within the inferior colliculus (IC). This is a subject of interest for the broad sensory neuroscience field, as SSA has been described across modalities and the contributions of bottom-up and top-down processing are still unknown. Overall, the experimental design and results are convincing, straight-forward and well presented. Although some of these results simply corroborate previous findings, this study does provide the following conceptual advances from prior work:</p><p>1. The contribution of the decomposed processes underlying SSA in subdivisions of the inferior colliculus (IC) has been studied previously in awake mice (Parras et al. 2017) and cortical manipulations have demonstrated the influence of cortical feedback on SSA (Anderson and Malmierca 2013). However, this work combined these approaches to evaluate the contribution of cortico-collicular projections to the distinct SSA processes (repetition suppression and prediction error) in the IC of awake mice.</p><p>2. By recording from the same units in the IC of mice in awake and anesthetized states, the authors provide evidence for changes in the repetition and prediction processes underlying SSA across behavioral states. This result is significant, as much of the previous work has been performed in anesthetized rodents.</p><p>3. The authors focused on previously ignored facilitating and non-adapting neurons. They discover populations of IC neurons that show repetition enhancement and negative prediction error, which were suppressed during cortico-collicular inactivation. This novel finding has important implications for top-down cortical regulation of predictive coding in IC.</p><p>Together, the results from this study will contribute to our understanding of predictive coding in the central auditory system. The strength of this study is the rigorous experiments and comprehensive analysis: the authors examined SSA in neurons from distinct IC subdivisions in both awake and anesthetized mice, assessed the specific effects of corticocollicular projections and analyzed previously-ignored facilitation. Addressing the following concerns will greatly increase the significance of the findings:</p><p>1. The authors pool together data from single and multi-unit recordings. Although the inclusion of multi-units might not necessarily affect the described results, this limitation should be clearly stated in the &quot;technical considerations&quot; section of the discussion. For instance, the inclusion of multi-unit recordings may underlie the finding of &quot;mixed&quot; firing types in the IC, as shown in Figure 1-S2C. Importantly, the figure comparing responses between single- and multi-unit responses (provided in the response to the reviewers) should be included as a supplementary figure. Moreover, the author's interpretation of Figure 6 is that 'individual neurons exhibit distinct combinations of iPE and iRS'. Unless these data are only representing single units (which would not be consistent with the total number of single-unit recordings shown in the plot given to the reviewers), Figure 6 (panels A,B) fails to demonstrate that single neurons are exhibiting distinct iPE and iRS. This limitation should be clear in the Results section and included in the 'Technical Considerations' section of the Discussion.</p><p>2. The data shown in Figure 1-S2 are not convincing that the recordings were obtained from either the central or shell IC. The authors should provide more histological evidence if the data are available. For example, the panel showing the recording site within the central IC (Figure 1-S2D) also shows some DiA signal in the shell. The authors claim to have performed histological reconstruction by DiD/A probe coating in a subset of animals (lines 708-709). The authors should state how many recording sites used in the study were evaluated histologically, and include all data in a supplemental figure. In addition to the histology, the authors also use the response properties of the IC neurons to distinguish between central and shell recordings. This is a nice complementary method. However, while there are sites clearly distinguished as central or shell recordings based on sparseness and correlations between BF and depth, some sites are borderline (Figure 1-S2C). For example, several sites with high mean sparseness (characteristic of central IC) are categorized as shell recordings based on low correlations between BF vs depth. Could these sites instead be recordings in central IC with an electrode penetration angle slightly off the tonotopic axis? The differences between central and shell IC neurons in predictive coding, effects of anesthesia, and effects of cortico-collicular silencing are interesting findings. If the authors could provide additional data to give us more confidence in their ability to distinguish these sites, these results would be more compelling.</p><p>3. Figure 1-S1C shows an off/rebound response for cortico-collicular neurons when the laser is turned off. The iMM (index of neuronal mismatch) is calculated by comparing the firing in response to a standard and a deviant tone that occurs 200ms after the standard. Thus, rebound activation of the cortico-collicular neurons after the last standard stimulus may alter the response to the subsequent deviant stimulus, impacting iMM. This potential confound should be discussed within the 'technical limitations' section of the Discussion.</p><p>4. Figure 1-S1A. Although the study emphasizes the specific manipulation of the cortico-collicular projections, it should be noted that auditory corticofugal neurons that innervate the IC have other widespread targets including the medial geniculate body, striatum and lateral amygdala (Asokan et al., 2018, Nature Communications). Did the authors also see expression of axons in widespread brain regions with their viral strategy? If so, this could be shown in this panel or a supplemental figure. The involvement of these other regions in the inactivation studies should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73289.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

This is a major issue for me.â</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively studied Parras et al., 2017 and Duque and Malmierca, 2015 as they provide much of the groundwork and inspiration for the present study (Duque and Malmierca, 2015; Parras et al., 2017). We have emphasized in the abstract and discussion several novel findings. Specifically:</p><p>â Like Parras et al., 2017, we decomposed stimulus specific adaptation into two distinct processes: prediction error and repetition suppression. A novel contribution is that we specifically determined how corticofugal inputs affect prediction error and other metrics of deviance detection in the inferior colliculus.</p><p>â While we identify âlow levels of iMM and iPE in the ICâ, it is not the main result of the study. Our main findings are that top-down inputs from the auditory cortex regulate prediction error, as well as other metrics such as repetition enhancement, in the IC, and that the cortex routes contextual information subcortically.</p><p>â As mentioned by reviewer #2, Anderson et al. 2013 previously investigated how cortico-collicular inputs affect SSA in the inferior colliculus through cortical deactivation in anesthetized rats (Anderson and Malmierca, 2013). In the present study we also deactivate cortico-collicular inputs and measure SSA. However, we furthermore determine how the index of prediction error, and the index of repetition suppression are affected by deactivation, not just SSA as a whole. This distinction is critical, as these two metrics reflect different underlying processes, whereas previously reported results could have captured changes in either and/or both. It is also worth noting that these findings are derived from awake animals, while the previous study used anesthetized animals. Our study presents novel data that show that the prediction and repetition processes that are reflected in the SSA index differ substantially between the awake and anesthetized condition, with prediction error and repetition enhancement being much more prevalent in the absence of anesthesia. It is likely that previously reported findings reflect different underlying processes than those studied here in the awake animal, further emphasizing the novelty of the current study.</p><p>â Duque and Malmierca, 2015 reported whether and how anesthesia and spontaneous activity affect SSA in the inferior colliculus. The authors conclude that SSA is âsimilar, but not identical, in the awake and anesthetized preparationsâ and show that the differences are âmostly due to the higher spontaneous activity observed in the awake animals.â We also compare how anesthesia affects SSA, but we (1) record from the same units while the animal is awake and under anesthesia to directly compare the two conditions and (2) further assess how the index of prediction error and the index of repetition suppression are affected. We find that SSA in awake animals reflects entirely different underlying processes than those in anesthetized animals. Specifically, prediction error and repetition enhancement are significantly more prevalent in shell IC units when animals are awake, while low levels of prediction error and high repetition suppression dominate under anesthesia. In the central nucleus, negative prediction error becomes dominate when the animal is awake. Given that much of the prior research on SSA in the auditory midbrain has been conducted in anesthetized animals, we believe this is a finding of major significance for the field and suggests that the state of anesthesia must be taken into consideration when interpreting SSA studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. âGiven the low levels of SSA/iMM, I wonder how authors consider if a neuron shows significant iMMâ¦(bootstrapping??) as AC may have mostly subtle changes on the IC responsesâ.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this analysis. This information is provided in lines 791-792 of the present manuscript: âSignificant adaptation or facilitation for each neuron was assessed with a Wilcoxon rank sum test between the trial-by-trial firing rates to the standard and deviant on the 45 baseline trials.â</p><p>We want to emphasize that the fact that there are relatively low levels of SSA/iMM (in comparison to the cortex) is not a major point or conclusion of the present study; rather, we are interested in how inputs from the cortex affect the indices of neuronal mismatch, prediction error, and repetition suppression in IC units. A âlow levelâ of SSA/iMM does not necessarily mean that a unit is absent of prediction error, etc. For example, we find that a high level of prediction error and a negative index of repetition suppression (indicating repetition enhancement) can result in a SSA index/iMM close to zero (see Figure 2E-G; Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. âAnother major issue is that authors claim that have recorded separately from the central nucleus and the shell. However, they donât show any histological probe of the electrode recording.â</p></disp-quote><p>We have added histological data to the manuscript from a recording that was categorized as a central nucleus site and a recording that was categorized as a shell site (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2D) using the analytic methods detailed in lines 768-775 of the present manuscript. In both instances the recording electrode was submerged in a lipophilic dye prior to tissue insertion to mark the recording location. An atlas image overlay was used to define the locations of the central (denote as âCICâ here) and shell (denoted as âECICâ and âDCICâ here) regions of the IC (Paxinos and Franklin, 2019). Notably, our histological data provide the same categorization of electrode sites as the analytical methods used in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. âThe central nucleus in mouse is very small and although it shows a distinct tonotopic organization and response are areas are usually V shaped, these responses can also occur in the shell. So, my concern is that most of the neurons may be actually recorded in the shell.â</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, responses in the shell can be V-shaped and regionally tonotopic (Barnstedt et al., 2015; Wong and Borst, 2019). However, the shell does not exhibit the same stereotyped tonotopic gradient with depth that is highly characteristic of the central nucleus of the IC (see Figure 3B) (Aitkin et al., 1975; Malmierca et al., 2008; Stiebler and Ehret, 1985; Syka et al., 2000). Our method for parsing the recording sites considers the patterns in best frequency and sparsity in all units across the entire depth of the electrode â whereas it is possible to encounter some V-shaped responses or local regions of tonotopy in the shell, it is unlikely that these characteristics will produce the same highly linear fits and consistent high sparsity (reflecting V-shaped tuning) that we find with our central nucleus recordings. Because histological assessment alone can render inconclusive subdivision assignments, specifically in instances when the recording location is near a boundary between subdivisions, these methods allow for an unbiased analysis of site location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. âI would like to draw the attention to the authors that previous studies on subcortical SSA/iMM have demonstrated the lack of adapting responses in the central nucleus. Of course, all previous studies may have missed this, but I dare to suggest that much of the authors central nucleus data may actually be from the shell.â</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important concern, and we compared our results more directly to those reported in the literature. We found comparable mean baseline SSA/iMM values for the adapting units in the central nucleus (mean = 0.26, Figure 4A and Table 1) to those in the literature for awake mouse (mean = 0.24, Parras et al., 2017 Table 2). We also find that there are fewer adapting units in the central nucleus compared to the shell (Figure 3B,), and those adapting units have lower SSA/iMM indices than their counterparts in the shell (Figure 3B), also in line with previous studies (Duque et al., 2012; Parras et al., 2017). Furthermore, if most of the recordings categorized as central were actually recorded in the shell, we would likely see similar trends in predictive coding metrics from both regions. In fact, we find that both the baseline values and the laser-induced changes in these regions are distinct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. âIn any case, this needs to be unambiguously demonstrated here with some histological data; it is not adequate to rely solely on the frequency response areas, even if this is shown, I would like to see a convincing conceptual framework to understand it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have added histological data as detailed in response to comment 4. We exploit known differences in the tonotopic organization across the depth of the tissue between shell and central regions to further parse the recording sites. This pattern of increasing best frequency with depth has been very well categorized (see response to point #5) and has been similarly employed by other researchers to categorize IC recordings sites, as mentioned by reviewer #3 (Bulkin and Groh, 2011; Ress and Chandrasekaran, 2013). We have edited the manuscript to include these references and expand the conceptual framework that justifies the use of these analytical techniques for sorting recording sites in lines 202-222 of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. âAlso the conclusion that the cascade and many-standard controls yield similar results has also been reported in Parras and Casado-Roman recently.â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this study to our attention and have cited it in lines 375-376 of the edited manuscript (Casado-RomÃ¡n et al., 2020). The fact that the cascade and many-standards sequences yield similar results is not a major conclusion of this study (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2), but rather an important control to validate the use of the cascade sequence in further decomposing the iMM into an index of prediction error and an index of repetition suppression. We find it reassuring that Parras and Casado-Roman have also found little difference between the use of these two control sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. âThe most original part of this study is the in-depth analysis of the repetition enhancement responses, but I also would like to draw the authorsâ attention to the previous study by Parras where they also reported negative iPE (cf. Figures3 rat and Figure 7 awake mouse). This is mentioned on page 29, lines 694-696, but it should be more clearly stated in abstract etc. so that previous studies get a fairer recognition.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. Repetition enhancement reflects a higher response to the standard context than to the cascade context, resulting in a negative iRS value. This is different than the negative iPE value mentioned in the Parras et al. study, which we have termed ânegative prediction errorâ in the present manuscript. We are aware that Parras et al. also found units with negative iPE and have contrasted their interpretation of these results with our own in the Discussion (lines 608-638). Whereas Parras et al. do find units with negative iRS indices, they do not show that negative iRS reflects repetition enhancement (Figure 6C,D), which we report for the first time here. Further, one of our main results is that repetition enhancement decreases during cortical suppression, suggesting that it is a top-down phenomenon, which is a novel finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. âAlso, Duque and Malmierca already have reported that SSA (which reflects iMM) is lower in awake than in anesthetized mouse. This is mostly due to the high rate of spontaneous activity, which is not mentioned in this study.â</p></disp-quote><p>This is an insightful comment. We also find that SSA index/iMM is lower in awake vs. anesthetized animals (Figure 2). However, this is not a major conclusion of the present study. Rather, we sought to determine what underlying repetition/prediction processes the SSA index/iMM reflects in the awake vs. anesthetized condition, as these processes have drastically different functional implications for predictive processing. We show that prediction error and repetition enhancement are significantly more prevalent in the awake animal in shell IC units, and that negative prediction error dominates the awake central nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. âThe most interesting part of the paper is the section related to the effect of cortical deactivation. However, as the authors themselves note, the technique has some limitations. I would like a more detailed discussion on how such limitations may have affected the results and hence the conclusions.â</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs recognition of the merits of the study. We discuss in the manuscript that the main drawback of using laser photosuppression to mediate cortico-collicular deactivation is that it does not achieve full inactivation (lines 641-654). Indeed, this is a concern to us, but we believe the inactivation is robust. We found a mean 60% reduction in firing in putative cortico-collicular neurons at baseline and a 45% reduction during presentation of pure tone stimuli with our laser parameters and observed clear effects on repetition and prediction processing in IC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. âAnother important issue not addressed is where in AC the injections were made (A1, AAF, A2, etc ???) and how large the injection sites are.

Please see responses to reviewer 1 comments 2, 8, 9 and 10.</p><p>We also provide below a summary of the major findings from the present study:</p><p>â We show for the first time that cortical input is critical for generating prediction error in IC units, suggesting that the cortex regulates predictive coding subcortically. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of predictive coding in a cortico-subcortical network, as virtually all prior studies have focused on cortico-cortical interactions.</p><p>â We show for the first time that repetition suppression is unaffected by cortical inactivation, suggesting that this process may reflect fatigue of bottom-up sensory inputs rather than deviance detection.</p><p>â We also show for the first time that a subset of IC neurons exhibit repetition enhancement. Further, we show that repetition enhancement is abolished in the absence of cortical input for central IC units, suggesting that it is a top-down phenomenon.</p><p>â We show that cortico-collicular inactivation leads to bidirectional changes in the response to the standard vs. deviant tone contexts, such that IC cells respond more similarly to both contexts in the absence of cortical input. These findings suggest that under normal conditions the cortex routes contextual information to the IC.</p><p>â We provide the first direct comparison of SSA (i.e., in the same units) in awake vs. anesthetized conditions. We show that SSA reflects drastically different repetition and prediction processes in awake vs. anesthetized animals: in the central IC, negative prediction error rather than prediction error dominates when the animal is awake, and in the shell IC, prediction error and repetition enhancement are significantly more prominent. These findings have important implications for the field, as the vast majority of previous SSA studies have been conducted in anesthetized animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. âThe authors cite previous work from the Malmierca group reporting diminished SSA in awake animals and when cortex was silenced, but donât provide a more detailed comparison.â</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to points 2, 8, 9 and 10 of reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. âIs the novelty of the current study that the cortical effect was linked specifically to prediction error? But why then is the major effect of Arch on non-adapting cells to increase repetition suppression? While there are some overarching themes, the results currently seem a bit scattered and would be strengthened if linked to the previous work.â</p></disp-quote><p>One main finding is that cortico-collicular deactivation decreases prediction error in IC units. However, we also show that the cortex plays a role in repetition processing; specifically, we find that repetition enhancement is abolished in facilitating units in the central IC, suggesting that it may be a top-down phenomenon (Figure 3G). As the reviewer mentions, we additionally find an effect on repetition processing in central non-adapting cells with cortical deactivation, leading to an enhanced index of repetition suppression. This change also reflects a decrease in repetition enhancement. We have added data to better illustrate this finding (Figure 4C, bottom) showing that when the iRS is further parsed for non-adapting units, it is those with negative indices (i.e. those that show repetition enhancement) that show a significant laser effect. We believe that this finding further solidifies the notion that repetition enhancement is a top-down phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. âHow were the neurons with suppressive responses defined? If a neuron showed a transient response followed by suppression (eg, left panel of Figure 3D), did that count as suppressive? It appears in this example, that a tone actually evokes a sustained response that is suppressive, relative to the spontaneous rate. If repetition suppression is computed from raw firing rate, a decrease in suppression in this case could actually appear as an enhancement.â</p></disp-quote><p>âSuppressed unitsâ, henceforth referred to as âinhibitedâ units were defined quantitatively from analysis of the combined responses to the standard and deviant tones using MATLABâs âfindpeaksâ function with a minimum peak height set to the mean of the baseline period (50 ms before tone onset) +/- 3 standard deviations. In brief, units that displayed a single minimum peak in the PSTH during the 0-50 ms tone duration were termed either âinhibitedâ units or âinhibited onsetâ units (if the peak of the minimum occurred in the first 10 ms after tone onset). These units were removed from the analysis. Units that showed a combination of a minimum and maximum during tone duration were labeled as either E-I or I-E (excited-inhibited or inhibited-excited) units, depending on whether the minimum or maximum occurred first. These units were included in the analysis such that their excitatory sound responses could be analyzed (see lines 776-789 for further details of categorizing sound response profiles).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. âThe example in Figure 5F, of course, provides a clear demonstration of facilitation, but it is important to know what the typical response profile is for the adapting versus suppressive neurons and if they are qualitatively different. Perhaps the average PSTH responses could be compared?â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have replaced the single examples with the average PSTH responses for adapting and facilitating units in the revision. The average PSTH for both adapting and facilitating units show excitatory, rather than inhibited responses (Figure 3C,F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. âHow are the neurons defined as adapting vs. facilitating? Based only on non-laser trials? One worried that some of the reported effects may reflect a regression to the mean. That is, if there was experimental noise that made responses slightly adapting or facilitating in the laser-off conditions, then the absence of adaptation or facilitation in the laser-on condition may be that the noise was absent. A potentially less biased approach would be to define adapting versus facilitating neurons based on responses averaged across both laser-on and -off trials. Given that adaptation effects are relatively infrequent and small, this additional control seems important.â</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the methods to state: âSignificant adaptation or facilitation for each neuron was assessed with a Wilcoxon rank sum test between the trial-by-trial firing rates to the standard and deviant on the 45 baseline trials.â (lines 791-792).</p><p>We agree that it is critical to rule out that the observed effects are simply due to regression to the mean. We took multiple steps at the study design stage to control for regression to the mean, namely using multiple baseline measurements and including a control group to provide an estimate of the change caused by regression to the mean, both standard practices that âcan be combined to give even greater protection against regression to the meanâ (Barnett et al., 2005). Units were defined as adapting/facilitating/non-adapting based on a statistical comparison of the trial-by-trial responses to the standard and deviant on 45 separate baseline trials. Although it is possible to have experimental noise on a given baseline trial that is not present in a laser trial, the use of multiple baseline trials protects against the possibility that a spurious extreme value will affect the overall categorization of the units as adapting/facilitating/non-adapting. We also included a control group that underwent identical manipulations to our experimental group except ArchT was not present in the viral construct that was injected in the auditory cortex (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1). For this group, we observed no significant differences in iMM, iPE, or iRS for any of the adapting, facilitating, or non-adapting cells in both the central and shell regions. Given that this control group provides an estimate of the change caused by regression to the mean, we conclude that the significant effects in the experimental group were not caused by this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. L. 47-48. &quot;suppression â¦ suppression&quot; Not a concern really, but a request. The language is technically correct, but the word suppression refers both to a neural computation (suppression of error signals) and optogenetic manipulation (Arch-mediated suppression).

Figure 3âfigure supplement 3 includes plots of the index of neuronal mismatch in laser off and on conditions for each of the subgroups in the central and shell regions of the IC separated by single (displayed in teal) and multi units (similar to Figure 3D,E,G,H, top panel and Figure 4C,E, top panel).

The many standards condition, similar to the deviant condition, is completely unpredictable. However, this sequence does not contain the establishment or violation of a prediction, as is seen in the oddball sequence. It is possible that cells with negative prediction error are suppressed by prediction violation, which would explain their higher firing rates to the cascade than the deviant and equal responses to the cascade and many standards sequences.</p><p>All other reviewer suggestions have been addressed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1. &quot;additional response profiles were assigned for each tone in the oddball pair based on the number, timing, duration, and direction of peaks in the peristimulus time histogram.

If this is a quantitative judgment, what were the criteria used? If qualitative, I'd suggest rephrasing to say that neurons were excluded by visual inspection of the PSTH to ensure that only neurons with excitatory peaks within a reasonable onset latency were included, and give parameters for what was considered a reasonable onset latency and duration.â</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response #4 to reviewer #2, the categorization of sound responses (i.e., âresponse profilesâ) was done quantitatively.

Units that showed only a single minimum (âinhibitedâ units) or only a response in the offset window were similarly removed from the analysis. Units that showed at least one maxima during the tone duration period were included in the analysis and further categorized as either onset (single maxima in the first 10 ms after tone onset), sustained (single maximum after the first 10 ms after tone onset), E-I or I-E (units that displayed both a maximum and minimum during the tone duration period), biphasic (units that displayed two maxima during the tone duration period), or mixed (units with greater than 2 peaks during the tone response period). It was common for units to display a response both during the tone duration window and the offset window, and in these cases a combined response profile was assigned (e.g., onset/offset, sustained/inhibited-offset).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. âAnesthetized vs. awake comparison â this is an important part of the study and Iâd suggest mentioning it in the abstract (anything not mentioned in the abstract might as well not have happenedâ¦.).â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission and have edited lines 53-57 of the abstract to reflect the anesthetized vs. awake findings: âWe also investigated how these metrics compare between the anesthetized and awake states by recording from the same neurons under both conditions.

It would be more convincing if the authors could categorize units based on responses averaged across laser-off and -on conditions. If this is not feasible, then the authors should address the following:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We used well-established methods for estimating regression to the mean including using multiple baseline measurements and a control group, as we have done here. Notably, we do not observe any significant changes in the control group for any of the predictive coding metrics between laseroff and laser-on trials, suggesting that regression to the mean does not drive the effects in our experimental group. Categorizing the units on responses averaged across laser-off and laser-off conditions, as reviewer suggests, would not adequately parse out an effect due to regression to the mean from a true photo-suppression effect. In the instance that a real photo-suppression effect is present in the data, categorizing units in this way would lead to the biased selection of only those units that maintain similar responses to the standard and deviant on both laser-on and -off trials, i.e., those units that do not show photo-suppression effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Are the experimental groups in Figure 3S1B the same as in Figure 3B? Perhaps some details are missing or there is a labeling issue with the x axis? The distributions in 3S1B appear narrower than in 3B. A narrower distribution might indicate less noise, which would reduce the possibility of regression to the mean. Please clarify if in fact the experimental data should be the same and or if differences in the width of the iMM distributions might impact the validity of the control. Are the fractions of adapting/facilitating/non-adapting neurons similar for the control and experimental groups?</p></disp-quote><p>The data from the experimental groups in Figure 3S1B and Figure 3B are the same. These plots depict the SSA index for laser-off trials, computed from the mean firing rates over 45 trials in response to a tone in either the standard or the deviant context. Whereas indeed, a narrower distribution of trial-by-trial firing rates for an individual unit could signify less noise in the responses, therefore reducing the possibility of regression to the mean, we do not believe the same interpretation applies for these plots, as they do not depict measures across multiple trials (i.e., test/re-test data). A narrower distribution in this case would indicate that the population shows less extreme adaptation/facilitation and that units respond more similarly to tones regardless of statistical context. However, this is not what we observe here. Rather, we find that the width of the distributions is relatively matched between the control and experimental groups in Figure 3S1B, which suggests that the range of SSA indices in the control sample is similar to the experimental group, thus enhancing the validity of the control.</p><p>We also find similar proportions of adapting/facilitating/non-adapting neurons in the control groups (central: 23% adapting, 5% facilitating, 71% non-adapting; shell: 29% adapting, 18% facilitating, 53% non-adapting) compared to the experimental groups (see Figure 4A; central: 24% adapting, 6% facilitating, 70% non-adapting; shell: 29% adapting, 9% facilitating, 62% non-adapting), and have added these comparisons to the edited manuscript (lines 332-336).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

One solution would be to run the same analysis on control data in each case. This option does seem cumbersome, and authors might have a better idea for how to address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The data were analyzed, as depicted in Figure 4C, in order to determine whether changes in repetition suppression (iRS &gt; 0) or repetition enhancement (iRS &lt; 0) drive the statistically significant change in the overall iRS metric in central non-adapting units (see Figure 4C, third row). We have run this comparison in the control data as well and did not observe a laser effect for the overall iRS metric (Figure 4C) , repetition suppression (p=0.16, paired t-test) or enhancement (p=0.099, paired t-test).

We have edited this sentence and further discussed these limitations in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data shown in Figure 1-S2 are not convincing that the recordings were obtained from either the central or shell IC. The authors should provide more histological evidence if the data are available. For example, the panel showing the recording site within the central IC (Figure 1-S2D) also shows some DiA signal in the shell. The authors claim to have performed histological reconstruction by DiD/A probe coating in a subset of animals (lines 708-709). The authors should state how many recording sites used in the study were evaluated histologically, and include all data in a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the shell IC surrounds the central IC dorsally, our electrode insertion sites (orthogonal to the dorsal surface of the IC) will always pass through the shell IC, even if the recording site is in the central IC. The source of dye in the shell IC in Figure 1-S2D is likely due to this initial insertion. The fact that histological assessment can render inconclusive subdivision assignments motivated us to pursue further categorization of the electrode sites based on the response properties of IC neurons, a method that has been established previously. We have added further details regarding the number of recording sites used for histological comparison in line 730.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the histology, the authors also use the response properties of the IC neurons to distinguish between central and shell recordings. This is a nice complementary method. However, while there are sites clearly distinguished as central or shell recordings based on sparseness and correlations between BF and depth, some sites are borderline (Figure 1-S2C). For example, several sites with high mean sparseness (characteristic of central IC) are categorized as shell recordings based on low correlations between BF vs depth. Could these sites instead be recordings in central IC with an electrode penetration angle slightly off the tonotopic axis? The differences between central and shell IC neurons in predictive coding, effects of anesthesia, and effects of cortico-collicular silencing are interesting findings. If the authors could provide additional data to give us more confidence in their ability to distinguish these sites, these results would be more compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that our electrodes are inserted orthogonal to the dorsal surface of the IC and that the tonotopic gradient in the central nucleus runs dorso-lateral to ventro-medial, a slightly off angle penetration would likely still capture the increasing BF with depth relationship in this nucleus. It is not surprising to have some shell sites with higher sparseness values, as this metric can be affected by multiple tuning characteristics, such as inhibited regions of the tuning curve. Despite these few borderline cases, the BF vs. depth correlation and sparseness metrics show clear trends for parsing each IC sub-region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1-S1C shows an off/rebound response for cortico-collicular neurons when the laser is turned off. The iMM (index of neuronal mismatch) is calculated by comparing the firing in response to a standard and a deviant tone that occurs 200ms after the standard. Thus, rebound activation of the cortico-collicular neurons after the last standard stimulus may alter the response to the subsequent deviant stimulus, impacting iMM. This potential confound should be discussed within the 'technical limitations' section of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to avoid potential laser rebound effects, the iMM was not computed by comparing immediately subsequent standard and deviant tones on laser trials. Rather, for a given last standard and subsequent deviant pair, only one of the tones was paired with the laser, and the pairing was switched on the next last standard/deviant presentation. This âblockâ approach to stimulus presentation and calculation of the iMM is described in lines 775782 of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1-S1A. Although the study emphasizes the specific manipulation of the cortico-collicular projections, it should be noted that auditory corticofugal neurons that innervate the IC have other widespread targets including the medial geniculate body, striatum and lateral amygdala (Asokan et al., 2018, Nature Communications). Did the authors also see expression of axons in widespread brain regions with their viral strategy? If so, this could be shown in this panel or a supplemental figure. The involvement of these other regions in the inactivation studies should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with Asokan et al. 2018, our viral strategy does label cortico-collicular collaterals in the medial geniculate body (see Blackwell et al. 2020) and additional downstream targets. The laser-induced changes seen in the present study are likely specific to the cortico-collicular pathway because they produce short-latency effects in the IC (Figure 3C, 3F), making muti-synaptic effects from other collateral sites unlikely. We have discussed this potential limitation in the Discussion in lines 667-674.</p></body></sub-article></article>
