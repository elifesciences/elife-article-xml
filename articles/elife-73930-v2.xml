processes remain unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial effect of auditory TMR on motor performance. At the neural level, TMR enhanced slow wave (SW) characteristics. Additionally, greater TMR-related phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.5–2 Hz) and sigma (12–16 Hz) oscillations after the SW peak was related to higher TMR effect on performance. Importantly, sounds that were not associated to learning strengthened SW-sigma coupling at the SW trough. Moreover, the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by the unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our data suggest that, depending on their precise temporal coordination during post learning sleep, slow and sigma oscillations play a crucial role in either memory reinstatement or protection against irrelevant information; two processes that critically contribute to motor memory consolidation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>targeted memory reactivation</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>spindles</kwd><kwd>sigma oscillations</kwd><kwd>slow oscillations</kwd><kwd>memory consolidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0D7918N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolas</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Bradley R</given-names></name><name><surname>Levesque</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Lazzouni</surname><given-names>Latifa</given-names></name><name><surname>Swinnen</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Doyon</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrier</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Albouy</surname><given-names>Genevieve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec -

After initial acquisition, a motor memory undergoes consolidation, which is the offline (i.e. without further practice) process by which the acquired memory trace becomes stable and long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maquet, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robertson et al., 2004</xref>). Sleep, and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albouy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albouy et al., 2013</xref>), is thought to offer a privileged window for the consolidation process to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King et al., 2017</xref>). The specific electrophysiological events characterizing NREM sleep, such as slow waves (SW - high amplitude waves in the 0.5–2 Hz frequency band) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>), thalamo-cortical spindles (short burst of oscillatory activity in the 12–16 Hz sigma band) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barakat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>) and hippocampal ripples (80–100 Hz oscillations in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axmacher et al., 2008</xref>), as well as their precise synchrony, have been described to support neuroplasticity processes underlying consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muehlroth et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence in both the declarative and motor memory domains that consolidation processes can be augmented by experimental interventions such as targeted memory reactivation (TMR) applied during post-learning sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rudoy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schönauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). In TMR protocols, sensory stimuli (e.g. sounds) that are associated to the learned material during the learning episode are presented offline, during the consolidation interval, in order to reactivate the encoded memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>). This memory reinstatement is thought to be supported by a TMR-mediated reinforcement of the endogenous brain reactivation patterns that occur spontaneously during the consolidation process. Such reactivations are thought to support the transfer of memory traces to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Born and Wilhelm, 2012</xref>). While the beneficial effect of TMR on motor performance has been highlighted in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 2012</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schönauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>), the neurophysiological processes supporting these effects have been scarcely studied. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to elucidate the neurophysiological processes supporting memory reactivation during sleep which underlie TMR-induced enhancement in motor memory consolidation.</p><p>We designed a within-participant experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) pre-registered in the Open Science Framework (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/y48wq">https://osf.io/y48wq</ext-link>). Young healthy participants were trained on a Serial Reaction Time task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissen and Bullemer, 1987</xref> ) during which they learned two different motor sequences, each associated to a particular sound. Participants were then offered a 90-min nap that was monitored with polysomnography. During NREM 2–3 sleep stages, the sound associated to one of the two trained sequences (‘Associated’ sound to the ‘Reactivated’ sequence) as well as a control sound (‘Unassociated’) that was not associated to the learned material were played. The sound associated to the other learned sequence was not presented during the nap, thus serving as a no-reactivation control condition (‘Non-reactivated’). The time course of the TMR-induced consolidation process was assessed with retests after the nap episode as well as after a night of sleep spent at home. At the behavioral level, results demonstrated the expected TMR benefit. At the brain level, they indicate a TMR-mediated enhancement of SWs and SW-sigma coupling after the peak of the SW such that the higher the coupling, the greater the effect of TMR on motor performance. Intriguingly, unassociated sounds also strengthened SW-sigma coupling but at a different phase of the SW (trough) and the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by the unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our findings suggest that sigma oscillations may play a dual role in the consolidation process depending on both the nature of the information to be processed and the phase of the slow oscillation in which they occur. We propose that sigma oscillations protect or reinstate motor memory depending on their temporal coordination with slow oscillations during post-learning sleep.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental protocol.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) General design. Following a habituation nap that was completed approximately one week prior to the experiment, participants underwent a pre-nap motor task session, a 90 minute nap episode monitored with polysomnography during which targeted memory reactivation (TMR) was applied and a post-nap retest session. Participants returned to the lab the following morning to complete an overnight retest (post-night). During the motor task, two movement sequences were learned simultaneously and were cued by two different auditory tones. For each movement sequence, the respective auditory tone was presented prior to each sequence execution (i.e. one tone per sequence). One of these specific sounds was replayed during the subsequent sleep episode (<bold>Reactivated</bold>) and the other one was not (<bold>Non-reactivated</bold>). During the NREM 2–3 stages of the post-learning nap, two different sounds were presented. One was the sound associated (<bold>Associated</bold>) to one of the previously learned sequences, that is to the reactivated sequence, and one was novel, that is not associated to any learned material (<bold>Unassociated</bold>). (<bold>b</bold>) Stimulation protocol. Stimuli were presented during three-minute stimulation intervals of each cue type alternating with a silent 1 minute period (rest intervals). The inter-stimulus interval (<bold>ISI</bold>) was of 5 sec. The stimulation was manually stopped when the experimenter detected REM sleep, NREM1 or wakefulness.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73930-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The analyses presented in the current paper that were not pre-registered are referred to as <italic>exploratory</italic>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral data</title><p>As per our pre-registration, behavioral analyses focused on performance speed (i.e. response time (RT) on correct key presses) on the motor sequence learning task measured at three time points: pre-nap, post-nap, and post-night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Results of the analyses on performance accuracy are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Analyses of the pre-nap training data indicated that participants learned the two sequence conditions (reactivated and non-reactivated sequences) to a similar extent during initial learning (16 blocks of training; main effect of Block: F(15, 345)=34.82; p-value = 2.04e-26; η²=0.6; main effect of Condition: F(1, 23)=0.16; p-value = 0.69; Block by Condition interaction: F(15, 345)=1.09; p-value = 0.37; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). After initial training, participants were offered a short break (~5 min) and were then tested again on the learned motor sequences. This short pre-nap test session was designed to offer a fatigue-free measure of the end-of-training, asymptotic performance to be used as baseline for the computation of subsequent offline changes in performance (see description below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan and Rickard, 2015</xref>). Before computing offline changes in performance, we first assessed whether participants reached stable and similar performance levels between conditions during the pre-nap test session. Results showed that while performance reached similar levels between conditions (4 blocks; main effect of Condition: F(1,23) = 3.39e-5; p-value = 0.99; Block by Condition interaction: F(3,69) = 1.21; p-value = 0.31), asymptotic performance levels were not reached as shown by a significant Block effect (F(3,69) = 6.67; p-value = 0.001; η²=0.22). To meet the performance plateau pre-requisite to compute offline changes in performance, the first block of the pre-nap test session driving this effect was removed from further analyses.

Our results demonstrate a TMR-induced behavioral advantage such that offline changes in performance were larger on the reactivated as compared to the non-reactivated sequence. These behavioral results are in line with earlier motor learning studies showing improvement in performance after auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schönauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>) or olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laventure et al., 2016</xref>) TMR during sleep. As opposed to earlier TMR research though, the current results suggest that TMR-induced consolidation is not a protracted process that needs additional time and/or sleep to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>), as a behavioral advantage could already be observed immediately after the TMR episode. Also, in contrast to earlier work showing that TMR effects can be transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>), the current data indicate that the effect of TMR on motor performance was sustained overnight. It remains unclear whether these discrepancies are related to the nature of the task (e.g. declarative vs. motor), the sensory stimulus used for reactivation (words vs. sound) or the duration of the reactivation / sleeping episode (nap vs. night). Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the TMR episode during a nap immediately following learning set the reactivated memory trace on a distinct yet parallel trajectory as compared to the non-reactivated memory trace.</p><p>TMR effects were also observed at the brain level such that electrophysiological responses differed according to whether they were evoked by associated or unassociated cues. Specifically, the amplitude of the negative component of the auditory ERP was higher for the sounds associated to the motor memory task as compared to the unassociated sounds. These results are in line with findings from earlier associative learning studies performed during wakefulness showing that auditory cues evoke larger responses after conditioning (i.e. after they are associated to another stimulus) and that ERP amplitude is restored to pre-association levels after extinction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christoffersen and Schachtman, 2016</xref> for a review). The current findings also extend prior observation of a modulation of auditory-TMR-evoked responses during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rudoy et al., 2009</xref>). This earlier study showed that auditory cues presented during post-learning sleep evoked larger ERPs when they were associated to items better remembered at subsequent recall as compared to cues associated to less remembered items. Our findings not only concur with this post-hoc analysis, but also provide the first direct evidence of an ERP modulation based on the memory content of the cue during post-learning sleep. This difference in brain potentials during sleep might be seen as the neural signature of the plasticity processes that occurred during learning. Not exclusive to the previous speculation, such effects might also be attributed to the (re)processing of the memory trace during post-learning sleep. Importantly, one could argue that the difference in ERP amplitude observed in the present study might be due to familiarity effects, as the unassociated sound might have been perceived as novel as compared to the associated sound. We argue that this is unlikely as new or rare auditory stimuli usually present larger negative amplitudes as compared to old or frequent sounds during both sleep and wakefulness (e.g. FN 400 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rugg and Curran, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paller et al., 2012</xref>]) for old/new paradigms during wake and mismatch negativity components for oddball paradigms during both wake and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Näätänen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruby et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, we propose that the auditory evoked brain responses observed in the current study reflect the (re)processing of the motor memory trace that was encoded during initial learning. It is worth noting that the negative peak of the potential evoked by the unassociated cues was not only lower (i.e. less negative) than for the associated cues but was also sometimes even absent on some channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations are partly in line with earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>) but contradict other findings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weigenand et al., 2016</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiner and Rasch, 2015</xref> observed significant negative responses evoked by control sounds or by sounds that were associated to later forgotten items. These discrepancies remain unclear but might in part be explained by methodological differences that are known to influence the amplitude of ERPs (e.g. sleep cycle stimulated, electrode(s) examined, number of stimulation repetitions provided).</p><p>In addition to the modulation of auditory-evoked responses described above, the properties of the detected (spontaneous) SWs were influenced by sound presentation and sound condition. Specifically, SW density was higher during sound presentation as compared to rest and the density and amplitude of the SWs were greater during intervals of associated – as compared to unassociated – cue stimulation. The effect of sound presentation on SW characteristics is in line with previous work showing sound-related entrainment of SW trains and increase in SW amplitude during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ngo et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>). More importantly, in line with the ERP results, our data show that the memory content of the cue modulated SW physiology above and beyond the mere effect of sound presentation. This is the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, of a modulation of SW physiology based on the relevance of the sensory cues presented during sleep. We speculate that the processing of the memory content associated to the cue resulted in enhanced SW activity. Specifically, the greater amplitude of the SWs during associated sound intervals might reflect neural synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esser et al., 2007</xref>) known to promote sleep-dependent plasticity processes for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Born and Wilhelm, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2013b</xref>). We thus propose that the TMR-effect observed in this study might therefore be mediated by SWs likely in relation with spindle activity.</p><p>While the characteristics of spontaneous spindles (amplitude and frequency) were only modulated by sound <italic>presentation</italic> and not sound <italic>condition</italic>, the properties of sigma oscillations (i.e. its amplitude and its coupling with the SO phase) were differently affected by the cue type and related to the TMR-induced behavioral advantage. The observation of a modulation of spindle characteristics irrespective of the sound condition suggests that spindle activity (in term of events) during reactivation is not related to motor memory processing per se. This stands in contrast with earlier reports of spindle-mediated effect of TMR on the consolidation of both declarative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>) and motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laventure et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousins et al., 2016</xref>) memory tasks. It is worth noting, however, that this earlier work did not compare different stimulus conditions as in the present study. Nonetheless, this previous research demonstrated that reactivation was related to an increase in spindle features (amplitude and frequency) that were linked to the TMR-induced motor performance advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laventure et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, it is worth explicitly stating that our results do not rule out the involvement of spindle <italic>activity</italic> in TMR-related motor memory consolidation processes. Recent evidence has brought forward the idea that spindle event detection in general is less sensitive than the study of the sigma rhythm as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dimitrov et al., 2021</xref>). In line with these observations, our results show that sigma oscillation properties – as opposed to spindle events – were modulated by the sound condition and that such modulation was related to the TMR-induced behavioral advantage. Specifically, higher coupling between sigma oscillation amplitude and the SO phase, for associated as compared to unassociated sounds, on the descending phase following the peak of the SW was correlated with the TMR index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the strength of the coupling between the SO phase and the amplitude of the sigma oscillations nested within the peak of the SW is directly related to a TMR-related behavioral advantage. Earlier studies comparing different age groups provided convincing, yet indirect, evidence that the precise temporal coordination of SO and sleep spindles represents a critical mechanism for sleep-dependent memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muehlroth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref>). The timing reported in this earlier work is consistent with the current data showing increased SW-sigma coupling on the descending phase following the peak of the SW. Our results are also in line with previous frameworks proposing that sigma oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>) / spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2019</xref>) offer a privileged time window for relevant memories to be reinstated during sleep. Together with evidence that TMR boosted SW features, the current data suggest that both SWs and sigma oscillations play a critical role in the reactivation of motor memories.</p><p>In addition to the modulation of neurophysiological responses described above and triggered by the <italic>associated</italic> sounds, we report an intriguing pattern of brain results for the <italic>unassociated</italic> sounds. Specifically, the coupling between sigma amplitude and the SO phase was strengthened for unassociated sounds just <italic>before the onset of the SW negative peak</italic>. Furthermore, we observed that the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the auditory evoked potential for unassociated (as compared to associated) sounds was related to higher TMR-induced performance enhancement. It is tempting to speculate that sigma oscillations might prevent the processing of unassociated/irrelevant sounds during post-learning sleep which might in turn be reflected by a decrease in the amplitude of the slow electrophysiological responses (i.e. smaller ERP and SWs) during non-associated sound intervals. We argue that sigma oscillations might play the role of a gatekeeper for the consolidation process and protect the motor memory trace against potential interfering effects induced by the unassociated sounds which might in turn potentiate the effect of TMR at the behavioral level. In order to further examine this possibility, we performed additional exploratory analyses testing for potential relationships between the SW-sigma coupling observed during unassociated stimulation intervals and slow electrophysiological responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Results showed a negative correlation between SW-sigma coupling and SW features such that higher coupling was related to lower SW amplitude and density during unassociated stimulation intervals. These results provide further support for the protective effect of sigma oscillations (nested in the trough of slow oscillations) against potential interfering effects induced by the unassociated sounds. These assumptions are also in line with a growing body of literature pointing towards a sensory gating role of spindle activity / sigma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dang-Vu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>) that might be critical to facilitate the memory consolidation process during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schreiner and Staudigl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, it has been proposed that a function of the thalamus is to suppress distraction and gate information processing via alpha/beta oscillations during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>) and sigma oscillations during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Further support for the gating hypothesis comes from observations of both increased arousal threshold as well as decreased amplitude of auditory ERP when sounds are presented simultaneously to a spindle event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamadori, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cote et al., 2000</xref>). Along the same lines, previous studies using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings showed that the BOLD responses in relation to sound processing are inconsistent or even absent when sounds occur during sleep spindles or before the negative peak of the SW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dang-Vu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schabus et al., 2012</xref>). The present data therefore suggest that the precise SO-sigma coordination does not only play a role in the reinstatement of relevant memories, but is also critical to prevent the processing of irrelevant information during post-learning sleep. These observations are remarkably in line with recent theoretical views putting forward the concept that temporally precise SO-spindle coupling might not convey only memory-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helfrich et al., 2021</xref>). It is argued that while synchronized states might trigger memory reactivation, the underlying neural activity might offer limited opportunities for information processing. Our data concur with this theory as they suggest that SO-sigma coupling, depending on its temporal characteristics, either prevents the processing of irrelevant information or supports memory reactivation during post-learning sleep.</p><p>In conclusion, our results depict a complex organization of the different physiological processes supporting motor memory consolidation during post-learning sleep. While associated sounds appeared to boost SW features and SO-sigma coupling at the peak of the SW, unassociated sounds predominantly modulated the properties of the sigma oscillations at the trough of the slow oscillation. Our findings suggest a dual role of sigma oscillations whereby, depending on their temporal coordination with SWs, they either protect memories against irrelevant material processing or promote the reactivation of relevant motor memories; two processes that critically contribute to the motor memory consolidation process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was pre-registered in the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/">https://osf.io/</ext-link>).

Participants were first invited, in the early afternoon, for a habituation nap during which they completed a 90-min nap monitored with polysomnography (PSG, see below for details). Approximately 1 week later, participants returned to complete the experimental protocol. Each participant followed a constant sleep/wake schedule (according to their own rhythm +/-1 hr) for the 3 days before the experiment. Compliance was assessed with sleep diaries and wrist actigraphy (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, Pensacola, FL). Sleep quality and quantity for the night preceding the experimental visit was assessed with the St. Mary’s sleep questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellis et al., 1981</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for results about sleep data before the experimental session). During the first experimental day, participants were trained on two motor sequences simultaneously (pre-nap session: between 12 pm-1:30 pm). During learning, each of these two sequences was associated to a particular sound. Only one of these two sounds was presented during the subsequent nap episode, corresponding to the <italic>associated</italic> sound linked to the <italic>reactivated</italic> sequence. At the behavioral level, the control condition consisted of the <italic>non-reactivated</italic> sequence (i.e. a sequence that was associated to a sound during learning but the sound was not presented during the subsequent nap interval). For electrophysiological analyses, a new, <italic>unassociated</italic>, sound (i.e. a sound to which participants were not exposed during the learning episode) was presented during the post-learning sleep, serving as a control condition. The nap occurred between 1:30 pm and 3 pm and was monitored with PSG. Sleep data were monitored online by an experimenter in order to send auditory stimulations during NREM2-3 stages. Performance on the reactivated and non-reactivated sequences was tested 30 min after the end of the nap to allow sleep inertia to dissipate (post-nap session: 2 pm-5:30 pm) and on day 2 after a night of sleep (not monitored with PSG) spent at home (post-night session: 8:30 am-11:30 am). At the beginning of each behavioral session, vigilance was measured objectively and subjectively using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dinges and Powell, 1985</xref>) and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoddes et al., 1972</xref>), respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Finally, general motor execution was tested at the beginning of the pre-nap session and at the end of the post-night session.</p><p>This design allowed to assess the specific impact of TMR on consolidation at the behavioral level, with the comparison between the changes in performance of the reactivated and non-reactivated sequences assessed during the post-nap and post-night sessions; and at the electrophysiological level, with the comparison between the neurophysiological responses to the reactivated associated sound vs. the unassociated sound that did not carry mnemonic information.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stimuli and tasks</title><p>All tasks were performed on a laptop computer (Dell Latitude 5,490 run under Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise) and were implemented in Matlab (Math Works Inc, Natick, MA, USA) Psychophysics Toolbox version 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleiner, 2007</xref>). Participants sat comfortably in front of the computer screen with the keyboard on their knees. This configuration allowed the participants to focus their gaze on the screen and not to look at their hands/movements. Distance between participants and the screen was approximately 70 cm but was self-selected by the participants based on comfort. The sound presentation was conducted using ER3C air tube insert earphones (Etymotic Research).</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Acoustic stimulation</title><p>Three different 100 ms sounds were randomly assigned to the three conditions (reactivated/associated, not-reactivated, and unassociated), for each participant. The three synthesized sounds consisted of a tonal harmonic complex created by summing a sinusoidal wave with a fundamental frequency of 543 Hz and 11 harmonics with linearly decreasing amplitude (i.e. the amplitude of successive harmonics is multiplied by values spaced evenly between 1 and 0.1); white noise band-passed between 100 and 1000 Hz and a tonal harmonic complex created with a fundamental frequency of 1480 Hz and 11 harmonics with linearly increasing amplitude (i.e. the amplitude of successive harmonics is multiplied by values spaced evenly between 0.1 and 1). A 10 ms linear ramp was applied to the onset and offset of the sound files so as to avoid earphone clicks. At the start of the experiment, auditory detection thresholds were determined by the participants themselves using a transformed 1-down 1-up procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levitt, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leek, 2001</xref>) separately for each of the three sounds. Subsequently, the sound pressure level was set to 1000% of the individual auditory threshold during the tasks and 140% for auditory stimulation during sleep, thus limiting the risk of awakening during the nap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sterpenich et al., 2014</xref>). Before the start of the nap episode, participants were instructed that they may or may not receive auditory stimulations during the nap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Motor task</title><p>A bimanual serial reaction time task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nissen and Bullemer, 1987</xref>) (SRTT) was used to probe motor learning and memory consolidation processes. During this task, eight squares were horizontally presented on the screen meridian, each corresponding to one of the eight keys on the specialized keyboard and to one of the 8 fingers (no thumbs). The color of the outline of the squares alternated between red and green, indicating rest and practice blocks, respectively. During the practice blocks, participants had to press as quickly as possible the key corresponding to the location of a green filled square that appeared on the screen. After a response, the next square changed to green with a response-to-stimulus interval of 0 ms. After 64 presses, the practice block automatically turned into a rest block and the outline of the squares changed from green to red. The rest interval was 15 s.</p><p>The order in which the squares were filled green (and thus the order of the key presses) either followed a sequential or pseudo-random pattern. In the sequential SRTT, that is assessing motor sequence learning, participants were trained simultaneously on two different eight-element sequences (sequence A: 1 6 3 5 4 8 2 7; sequence B: 7 2 6 4 5 1 8 3, in which 1 through 8 are the left pinky to the right pinky fingers respectively). Participants were explicitly told that the stimuli (and thus the finger presses) would follow two different repeating patterns composed of eight elements each, but were not told any further information. During each practice block, four repetitions of a specific sequence (e.g. sequence A) were performed, each separated by a 1 sec-interval. Then, after a 2 sec-interval, the four repetitions of the other sequence started (e.g. sequence B). The order of the two sequences was randomized within each block of practice. Each motor sequence was associated to a different tone that consisted of a single 100 ms auditory cue (see above). The auditory cue was presented before the beginning of each sequence repetition, that is before the first key press of the sequence that was to be performed. Accordingly, one single tone was associated to an eight-element sequence of finger movements. Participants were instructed to learn the sequence-sound association during task practice. The associations between sound-sequence (sounds 1, 2 and 3; sequence A, sequence B, and control sound presented during nap) and sequence-condition (sequences A and B; conditions reactivated and not-reactivated) were randomized, thus creating 12 different possible combinations of randomized variables. Each participant was pseudo-randomly assigned to one of these combinations, such that there were two participants per combination. For the random SRTT, the order of the eight keys was shuffled for each eight-element repetition and thus the number of each key press was constant across all random and sequential blocks. For both variants of the task, the participants were instructed to focus on both speed and accuracy.</p><p>For the pre-nap session, participants first completed 4 blocks of the random SRTT to assess general motor execution. Participants subsequently completed the sequential SRTT, which consisted of 16 blocks of training followed by 4 blocks of post-training test taking place after a 5 min break. This allowed the assessment of end of training performance after the further dissipation of physical and mental fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan and Rickard, 2015</xref>). For the post-nap session, only 4 blocks of the sequential SRTT were completed to avoid extensive task practice before the final overnight retest. For the post-night session, 16 blocks of the sequential SRTT were performed, followed by 4 blocks of the random SRTT.</p><p>Between the training and test runs as well as after the post-night session, participants completed a generation task that aimed at testing explicit knowledge of the sequences as well as the strength of the association between the sequences and their corresponding auditory cues. During the generation task, participants were presented with the auditory cues specific to the learned sequences and were instructed to self-generate the corresponding motor sequences. Participants completed 4 consecutive attempts for each cue / sequence pair. The order of the pairs was randomized. Accuracy was emphasized during this task. A trial was classified as ‘correct’ if the key pressed by the participant was in the correct ordinal position with respect to the sequence acoustically cued. The percentage of correct ordinal positions was computed per sequence and per attempt. The generation accuracy per sequence was computed by averaging across attempts for each time point separately (pre-nap and post-night sessions). We tested whether generation accuracy of the reactivated sequence during the pre-nap generation task was correlated (Pearson’s correlation) to the TMR index. Results showed that there was no significant correlation between generation accuracy and the TMR index (<italic>r</italic>=0.25, t=1.22, df = 22, p-value = 0.24).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Polysomnography and targeted memory reactivation protocol</title><p>Both habituation and experimental naps were monitored with a digital sleep recorder (V-Amp, Brain Products, Gilching, Germany; bandwidth: DC to Nyquist frequency) and were digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz (except for one participant (500 Hz) due to experimental error). Standard electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made from Fz, C3, Cz, C4, Pz, Oz, A1, and A2 according to the international 10–20 system (note that Fz, Pz and Oz were omitted during the habituation nap). A2 was used as the recording reference and A1 as a supplemental individual EEG channel. An electrode placed on the middle of the forehead was used as the recording ground. Bipolar vertical and horizontal eye movements (electrooculogram: EOG) were recorded from electrodes placed above and below the right eye and on the outer canthus of both eyes, respectively. Bipolar submental electromyogram (EMG) recordings were made from the chin. Electrical noise was filtered using a 50  Hz notch. Impedance was kept below 5 kΩ for all electrodes. During the experimental nap, PSG recordings were monitored by a researcher in order to detect NREM2-3 sleep based on the most recent sleep scoring guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berry, 2018</xref>). To do so, PSG recordings were displayed online using 30-second-long epochs with EEG and EOG data filtered from 0.5 to 30 Hz and EMG data filtered between 20 and 200 Hz. When NREM2-3 sleep stages were reached, auditory cues were sent. The auditory stimulation was presented in a blocked design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Namely, each type of auditory cue (associated or unassociated) was sent during 3-min-long stimulation intervals with an inter-stimulus interval of 5 s. The stimulation was stopped manually when the experimenter detected REM sleep, NREM1 or wakefulness. Intervals of stimulation for each sound were separated by a 1 min silent period (rest intervals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were performed with the open-source software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RStudio Team, 2020</xref>) and considered significant for p&lt;0.05. When necessary, corrections for multiple comparisons was conducted with the False Discovery Rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) (FDR) procedure within each family of hypothesis tests (see details for each analysis below). Greenhouse-Geisser corrections was applied in the event of the violation of sphericity. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used when the Shapiro-Wilk test indicated non-normal distribution<sup>#</sup> (see point #6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). F, t and V (or W) statistics and corrected p-values were therefore reported for ANOVAs, Student and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Effect sizes are reported for significant comparisons using <italic>Cohen’s d</italic> for Student t-tests, <italic>r</italic> for Wilcoxon signed-rank test and <italic>η²</italic> for rmANOVAs using G*power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faul et al., 2007</xref>). For correlation analyses, Spearman<sup>#</sup> test (see point #6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was used and S as well as corrected p-values were reported. Nonparametric CBP tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) implemented in fieldtrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) were used for high dimensional time and time-frequency data analyses (e.g. ERP, TF, and PAC analyses). CBP tests are composed of two subsequent tests. The first calculates paired t-tests (for contrast analyses) between conditions for each time points (or time-frequency points), which are then thresholded at a chosen p-value which sets the conservativeness of the test (reported as ‘cluster threshold’). Significant clusters are defined as showing a continuum of significant time (or time-frequency) points. Subsequently, the procedure is repeated 500 times on shuffled data in which the condition assignment within each individual is permuted randomly. On each permutation, the maximum t-value is retained, yielding a distribution of 500 t-values (for contrast analyses). Finally, this distribution is used as a reference to determine whether the statistical value (t in case of contrast analyses) of each cluster, as calculated on the real assignment of the conditions, is likely to come from the same probability distribution (p-value &gt;0.05) or rather differs significantly from this random perturbation probability distribution (p-value &lt;0.05). For CBP contrast analyses, <italic>Cohen’s d</italic> is reported while rho is reported for CBP correlations.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Behavior</title><sec id="s4-5-1-1"><title>Preprocessing</title><p><italic>Motor performance</italic> on both the random and sequential SRTT was measured in terms of speed (correct response time (RT) in ms) and accuracy (% correct responses) for each block of practice. Note that RTs from individual correct trials were excluded from the analyses if they were greater than 3 standard deviations above or below the participant’s mean correct response time for that block (1.73% in total). Consistent with our pre-registration, our primary analyses were performed on speed.</p><p>The <italic>offline changes in performance</italic> on the sequential SRTT were computed as the relative change in speed between the pre-nap session (namely the 3 last blocks of practice<sup>#</sup>, see results and point #2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for details) and the post-nap session (4 blocks of practice) and the post-night session (4 first blocks of practice) separately for the reactivated and the non-reactivated sequences. A positive offline change in performance therefore reflects an increase of absolute performance from the pre-nap test to the post-nap or post-night tests. Additionally, we computed a <italic>TMR index,</italic> to be used in brain-behavior correlation analyses, which consisted of the difference in offline changes in performance - averaged across time points - between the reactivated and non-reactivated sequences. A positive TMR index reflects higher offline changes in performance for the reactivated as compared to the non-reactivated sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-1-2"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We first assessed whether performance (speed and accuracy) significantly differs between conditions during initial training. To do so, two two-way rmANOVAs with Condition (reactivated vs. non-reactivated) and Block (1st rmANOVA on the 16 blocks of the pre-nap training and 2nd rmANOVA on the 4 blocks of the pre-nap test) as within-subject factors were performed on the sequential SSRT performance. Similar analyses testing for baseline differences between sequences A and B irrespective of the reactivation condition were performed. The results of these control analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. We then tested whether offline changes in performance on the sequential SRTT differed between reactivation conditions after a nap and night of sleep. This was done with a rmANOVA with Time-point (post-nap vs. post-night) and Condition (reactivated vs. non-reactivated) as within-subject factors on the offline changes in performance. Finally, to highlight that improvement in movement speed was specific to the learned sequences as opposed to general improvement of motor execution, we computed the <italic>overall performance change</italic> for both the sequential SRTT (first 4 blocks of pre-nap raining vs. 4 last blocks of post-night training collapsed across reactivated and non-reactivated sequences) and the pseudo-random version of the SRTT (4 blocks pre-nap session vs. 4 blocks post-night session). Two-tailed paired Student t-test revealed that overall performance changes in performance were significantly higher for the sequential SRTT as compared to the random SRTT (t=21.69, df = 23, p-value &lt;2.2e-16; Cohen’s d=4.43). Thus, the RT decrease reported on the sequential SRTT in the result section reflect motor sequence learning rather than a mere improvement in motor execution.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electroencephalography</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Offline sleep scoring</title><p>A certified sleep technologist blind to the stimulation periods completed the sleep stage scoring offline according to criteria defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iber and Iber, 2007</xref> using the software SleepWorks (version 9.1.0 Build 3042, Natus Medical Incorporated, Ontario, Canada).

Auditory-evoked responses were obtained by segmenting the data into epochs time-locked to auditory cue onset (from –1 to 3 s relative to auditory cue onset after correction for onset-trigger lags) separately for the associated and unassociated auditory cues and averaged across all trials<sup>#</sup> (see point #3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) in each condition separately. During cleaning, 1.03% [95% CI: 0.49–1.58] of the trials with stimuli sent during NREM2-3 stages were discarded. The remaining number of artifact-free trials was not significantly different between the two stimulation conditions (associated vs. unassociated, t=–0.5888, df = 23, p-value = 0.5617).</p><p>For <italic>event-related potentials (ERPs) analyses</italic>, individual ERPs computed on each channel were baseline corrected by subtracting mean amplitude from –0.3 to –0.1 s relative to cue onset. As our low-density EEG montage did not allow to perform fine topographical analyses, ERP data were averaged across all 6 EEG channels (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> where channel level data are presented) data. In a first step, we used CBP approaches on ERP data computed across conditions to identify specific time windows during which significant brain activity was evoked by the auditory stimulation (i.e. where ERPs were significantly greater than zero). Results showed that across condition ERP was significantly different from zero between 0.44 and 0.63 sec at the trough (alpha threshold = 0.025, cluster p-value = 0.044; Cohen’s d=–0.56; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Concerning the SW detection, the algorithm used is a custom adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Massimini et al., 2004</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrier et al., 2011</xref>. Specifically, data were filtered between 0.3 and 2 Hz with a FIR filter using a 0.2 Hz transition resulting in a –6 dB points at 0.2 and 2.1 Hz. Then all the negative peaks with an amplitude between –40 and –200 μV and the positive peaks with an amplitude comprised between 10–150 μV are detected in the filtered signal. After sorting identified negative peaks with subsequent positive peaks, a set of logical thresholds are applied to identify the true slow waves: (1) duration of the negative peak between 0.3 and 1.5 sec; (2) duration of the positive peak between 0.1 and 1 sec; (3) amplitude of the negative peak between 40 and 300 µV; (4) amplitude of the positive peak between 10 and 200 µV and (5) PTP amplitude between 75 and 500 µV. Concerning spindle detection, the algorithm is inspired from the A7 algorithm described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacourse et al., 2019</xref>. Specifically, the relative power in the spindle frequency band (12–16 Hz) with respect to the total power in the broad-band frequency (1–30  Hz) is estimated based on Short-Time Fourier Transforms with 2-s windows and a 200ms overlap. Next, the algorithm uses a 300ms window with a step size of 100 ms to compute the moving root mean squared (RMS) of the filtered EEG data in the sigma band. A moving correlation between the broadband signal (1–30  Hz) and the EEG signal filtered in the spindle band is then computed. Sleep spindles are detected when the three following thresholds are reached simultaneously:(1) the relative power in the sigma band (with respect to total power) is above 0.2 (2) the moving RMS crosses the RMS<sub>mean</sub> +1.5 RMS<sub>SD</sub> threshold and (3) the moving correlation described is above 0.65. Additionally, detected spindles shorter than 0.5  s or longer than 2  s were discarded. Spindles occurring in different channels within 500ms of each other were assumed to reflect the same spindle. In these cases, the spindles are merged together.</p><p>SWs and spindles were detected in the stimulation intervals of both associated and unassociated sounds. One participant did not show any SW during the unassociated cue stimulation intervals and the minimal required number of SWs was not reached to perform the PAC in another participant. The two participants were thus excluded from the analyses on detected SWs. No spindles were detected during the associated cue stimulation intervals for another participant who was therefore excluded from the spindle analyses. With respect to the detected SWs, we extracted for each participant, each condition and channel, the mean PTP amplitude (µV) of SWs<sup>#</sup> (see point #3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) as well as their density (number of SWs per total time in minutes spent in stimulation or rest intervals). These characteristics were then averaged across channels. Concerning the spindles, we extracted for each participant, condition and channel, spindle density (i.e. the number of spindles per total time in minutes spent in stimulation or rest intervals). Spindle amplitude (computed as the PTP amplitude (µV) in the sigma-filtered data) and frequency were also extracted for exploratory analyses. These different dependent variables were then averaged across channels and were compared using a one-tailed paired Student t-test (SW PTP and spindle Frequency) or Wilcoxon signed-rank (SW density, spindle density and amplitude) test<sup>#</sup> (see point #6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) with the hypothesis that the associated, as compared to unassociated, stimulation intervals would exhibit higher values.</p><p>Furthermore, we performed exploratory analyses including the SWs and the spindles detected during rest intervals (i.e. NREM 2–3 epochs without auditory stimulation). In the case of SWs, we compared these values with those obtained for the associated stimulation intervals and the unassociated stimulation intervals using two two-tailed Student t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (rest vs. associated stimulation intervals and rest vs. unassociated stimulation intervals). In the case of spindles, as spindle characteristics did not differ between stimulation conditions (see results), they were collapsed across stimulation conditions and compared to rest intervals using two-tailed Student t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the FDR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Phase-amplitude coupling</title><p>In order to perform coupling analyses, preprocessed cleaned data were first down-sampled to 500 Hz. Based on the low spatial resolution of our montage that did not allow fine topographical analyses and in order to increase the signal to noise ratio to enhance the quality of the phase estimation that is particularly sensitive to noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2013</xref>), we opted to average the data across channels (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> for channel level data). Coupling analyses were then performed using the Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling (ERPAC) method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voytek et al., 2013</xref> and implemented in the TensorPac to support multi-dimensional arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Combrisson et al., 2020</xref>). This method allows to compute the ERPAC at each time point of the analysis window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) and is therefore optimal to preserve the time dimension. Specifically, the instantaneous phases of the slow oscillation (0.5–2 Hz) and the envelopes of amplitudes of the signal between 7 and 30 Hz<sup>#</sup> (see point # 4 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were first calculated by Hilbert transform around the trials of interest (i.e. from –0.5 to 2.5 s around the auditory cue onset and from –1 to 2 s around the negative peak of the SWs). For each time point in the analysis window (i.e. every 2 ms), the circular-linear correlation of phase and amplitude values were computed across trials. This analysis therefore tested whether trial-by-trial differences in <italic>slow oscillation</italic> phase explained a significant amount of the inter-trial variability in signal amplitude in the analyzed time window. The PAC factor output therefore represents the corresponding correlation coefficient. ERPAC was computed separately for the two sound conditions and compared using CBP test. Additionally, we performed exploratory analyses in which ERPAC (computed relative to the negative peak of the SWs as described above) was extracted from rest intervals. We compared rest ERPAC to ERPAC derived from both the associated and unassociated stimulation intervals using CBP procedures and corrected for two comparisons using the FDR. The preferred phase (PP), which reflects whether the amplitude of the signal in a given frequency band is modulated by the phase of the signal in another band, was also computed using tensorPac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Combrisson et al., 2020</xref>) open-source Python toolbox. Based on our a priori hypotheses, these analyses focused on the amplitude of the signal in the sigma band and the phase of the SO. The amplitude was binned according to phase slices. The preferred phase is given by the phase bin at which the amplitude is maximum. The PP statistical analyses were performed using the CircStat toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berens, 2009</xref>) implementing Rayleigh test for non-uniformity and Watson-Williams multi-sample test for equal means<sup>#</sup> (see point #5 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Similar as above, PP was also extracted from rest intervals for exploratory analyses in which rest PP was compared to the PP derived from the two different stimulation intervals using Watson test for circular data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlational analyses</title><p>Following our pre-registration, we performed correlation analyses between the TMR index and the following EEG-derived data: (1) The difference between the densities of SWs detected during the associated and unassociated cue stimulation intervals using one-sided Spearman<sup>#</sup> correlations (point #6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>); (2) The difference between the densities of spindles detected during the associated and unassociated cue stimulation intervals using one-sided Spearman<sup>#</sup> correlations ; (3) The relative change between the amplitude of the negative peak of the ERP<sup>#</sup> (point #3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3-3</xref>) following the associated and unassociated auditory cues using one-sided Spearman<sup>#</sup> correlations ; (4) The difference in auditory-locked sigma band power (0–2.5 sec relative to cue onset and from 12 to 16 Hz) between the associated and unassociated auditory cues using CBP tests<sup>#</sup> (point #7 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>); and (5) The difference between SO phase and sigma oscillation amplitude (12–16 Hz) coupling strength during the associated and unassociated stimulation intervals in relation to the cue onset and to the SW event using CBP approaches<sup>#</sup> (point #6 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For all one-sided tests, we predicted that the TMR index would be positively correlated with the EEG-derived metrics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Project administration, Software, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Software, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Young healthy volunteers were recruited by local advertisements to participate in the present study.

motor memory consolidation. TMR has mainly been used to strengthen declarative memories, and, on a neurophysiological level, TMR has been shown to strengthen oscillatory cross-frequency coupling. Here the authors extend previous findings into the motor domain and reveal that TMR strengthens motor memories and again, cross-frequency coupling of cardinal sleep oscillations, namely slow waves and spindles. Collectively, their findings provide additional evidence for the idea that the temporal precision of cross-frequency network coordination is critical for timed information transfer from short-term to long-term mnemonic storage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73930.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Helfrich</surname><given-names>Randolph F</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03a1kwz48</institution-id><institution>University of Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ngo</surname><given-names>Hong-Viet</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00t3r8h32</institution-id><institution>University of Luebeck</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.02.458683">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.02.458683v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hong-Viet Ngo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviews highlight that (i) the study is well designed and with preregistration it has the necessary rigor, and (ii) that TMR in the context of motor memory consolidation constitutes an important finding for the field.</p><p>All three reviews agree that the methods lack detail and need to be improved and substantially expanded. The one key finding that needs to be better demonstrated is whether there is actually any meaningful coupling in this data set. As outlined below, all three reviews identified several issues with the employed methods. In general, visualizations could be improved to illustrate the findings that were described in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– First of all, it was not possible to download the pre-registration on OSF mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>– Figure 2: It is unclear whether the gains are indeed significantly different from zero in all conditions. In my understanding, this would be a prerequisite to talk about gains in the first place (This is especially important with regard to the conclusion: 'In conclusion, our behavioral results indicate a TMR-induced enhancement in performance that did not differ across nap and night intervals.'). In addition, the graphic is hard to read with regard to the within-person nature of the task, as between-person indicators of errors are shown (IQR). Would it be possible to change the figure in a way that (a) a single person data is shown and (b) the dots are connected in a way that they reflect the within-person change in gains from nap to over-night (separately for the two conditions)?</p><p>– ERP analyses: The authors report that they first tested the averaged ERP across all trials against zero with a cluster-based permutation approach. However, in the methods section, when describing the cluster-based permutation approach, they only refer to paired t-tests. But testing against zero basically refers to a one-sample t-test against zero. How exactly was the cluster-based permutation approach implemented in this case?</p><p>In addition, it is not obvious why there was a need to follow this two-step approach in the first place. Would it not be possible to directly test for the condition-effect (unassociated vs. associated cues) directly with the cluster-based permutation framework?</p><p>By and large, the latter approach would also allow testing for topographic differences, the authors just mention with respect to a figure in the supplemental materials.</p><p>– Table 2 does not specify the unit of the depicted values.</p><p>– Figure 5 implies a mean amplitude for spindle events of around ~ 60 µV. This would be fairly large and in the range of typical slow-wave amplitudes.</p><p>– From the description of the PAC analyses on page 21, it is unclear how exactly the procedure was implemented. Specifically, it is described that, “all 6 EEG channels were averaged together”. If this was done prior to PAC analyses, one would run the danger that the original phase-relationships get distorted via the averaging.</p><p>Also, it is unclear whether analyses were performed on averages or on single trial data.</p><p>In my opinion, the preferred analysis pipeline would start with calculating PAC on the level of single trials and single channels. Averaging should then be performed for whole PAC matrices first across trials, within channels and only in the end across channels.</p><p>– Concerning the PAC analyses, it remains unclear whether there is a reliable SO-SP coupling in the first place. The comparison of PAC values across conditions is not very telling as long as there is no significant coupling to begin with. Again, here the authors would first need to test whether there is PAC significantly higher than chance / zero, before comparing conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) Calculation of offline gains.</p><p>Post-nap as well as post-night offline gains in performance were calculated as a relative change to pre-nap performance. I’m wondering whether it would make sense to calculate the post-night offline gains relative to the post-nap performance (and not the pre-nap performance). Therefore, a direct comparison between post-nap and post-night offline gains is possible (does the night after TMR results in a significantly higher gain than a nap+TMR?).</p><p>(2) Mismatch in data points?</p><p>In the method section it says (page 18): “For the post-nap session, only 4 blocks of the sequential SRTT…” In Figure 2a the post-nap test shows data points of 5 blocks. Where does the 5th data point”come from?</p><p>(3) Figure 2b.</p><p>Showing the main effect of conditions like that is misleading. The reader could interpret it as the difference between non-reactivated and reactivated conditions being significant only for the post-nap offline gains.</p><p>(4) Showing single subject data and the individual change between conditions.</p><p>– Figure 4 c and d. This is just a suggestion but I think showing individual data points (and the single subject change across the three conditions) would improve understanding the highly significant effects. For example, in Figure 4d the density of SWs for the associated and unassociated condition almost looks the same. However, as this statistical comparison is a within comparison (and relies on the change within a participant) showing the single subject change in addition to the averages per condition increases the readability of the statistical finding.</p><p>– Figure 2b. Seeing data points and density plots would be helpful especially given the probably skewed distribution for the post-nap offline gains (for the non-reactivated sequence).</p><p>– same applies to Figure 5.</p><p>(5) Heading titles.</p><p>I’m not entirely sure whether this is in the realm of the journal, but the Results section might benefit from headings shortly summarising the paragraph (e.g. on page 3. Instead of 2.1. behavioural data you could say something like 2.1. TMR enhanced behavioural performance)</p><p>(6) Figure 3.</p><p>Using the same colour scheme as in Figure 2 but for different conditions (violet for non-reactivated in Figure 2 and unassociated in Figure 3) is misleading.</p><p>(7) Table 1.</p><p>To increase the reading flow of the paper and solely focus on the main findings, the authors might want to put table 1 into the supplement. Table 1 contains relevant information to underpin that participants slept and that cues were mainly delivered in NREM sleep but it is not fundamental for the general research question.</p><p>(8) No negative peak for unassociated sounds.</p><p>It is very interesting that the unassociated sounds did not elicit any negative peak. Even though the authors mention this (for me) surprising result in the discussion, I am missing referencing the literature demonstrating an evoked response even to sounds which were not associated with any memory content before (e.g. Cairney et al. (2018), Weigenand(2017)) or which were associated with later forgotten memories (Schreiner et al. (2015)).

To argue the averaging in the Results section, they cite Cairney et al. (2018) but I think this is not a convincing justification as Cairney et al. (2018) focused on multivariate analyses where all channels are included in the analyses. However, this is not the case in this study.</p><p>Further, the TFRs were averaged across channels as well as the data for the phase amplitude coupling. It has been shown that the phase of SOs in which spindles are coupled to differ across the scalp (e.g. Klinzing et al. (2016)).</p><p>I'm wondering to what extent the channel average conceals for example a SW-spindle coupling during rest which is not visible in Figure 6a but can be expected. The results might be more robust if the analyses were focused on the central region (which can be argued as the task is a motor learning task)?</p><p>Klinzing, J.G., Mölle, M., Weber, F., Supp, G., Hipp, J.F., Engel, A.K. and Born, J.

I assume they band passed filtered the signal in the specific frequency range (0.5 – 2 Hz for SWs and 12-16Hz for spindles)?

Did the authors consider using the mean vector length as a measure for the coupling strength?</p><p>(16) No PAC between SWs and spindles in rest condition.</p><p>I'm surprised that there seems to be no coupling between the SO phase and the sigma frequencies in the rest condition.</p><p>(17) Figure 6.</p><p>The color scheme is misleading as in both figures (6a and 6b) the same color scheme is used (ranging from blue to yellow) but the numeric range is different (Figure 6a starts at 0 and is just positively scaled and Figure 6b ranges from -0.025 to 0.05).

It would be good to define in the result section whether a p-value was corrected or not.</p><p>(22) Figure 7.

Similar to Figure 7, please plot the correlation values as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Abstract: The sentence beginning with &quot;Importantly, sounds that were not associated…&quot; is a bit complicated. Perhaps this can be rephrased?</p><p>– Behavioral results (page 3): Lower reaction times at the SRTT obviously reflect better performance. Hence, to me, it was puzzling at first to see that the interpretation of offline gains is flipped. It might help to add one short sentence to clarify this.</p><p>– TFR and PAC results (page 5, line 19 and page 8, line 12). Why were the TFR and PAC analysis performed on different lower limits (5 vs. 7 Hz).</p><p>– Page 6, line 20: To some spindle &quot;features&quot; and &quot;characteristics&quot; could mean the same. I would suggest to be more specific and phrase it as &quot;spindle occurrence&quot; or similar.</p><p>– Figure 3A and 4A/B: Is it possible to move the x-axis of Figure 3A to the bottom and add more labels to the ticks? Otherwise, it is difficult to interpret the timing. The same could be applied to Figure 4A. Moreover, the y-labels for Figure 4B could move a bit to the left.</p><p>– Color bars: If the color range for the TFR and PAC maps include negative values, I would like to suggest using a symmetric color bar. It would help the reader visualize where Zero lies.</p><p>– Figure 7A: The overlay of significant correlation cluster onto the power difference between associated – unassociated is very confusing. Why didn't the authors directly plot the correlation values? Combining this with a reporting of the TFR plots (see above) would give a much better overview of the important patterns.</p><p>– Phase-amplitude coupling (page 21): I do not understand how the PAC is computed. It is clear that the 0.5 to 2 Hz signal serves as the phase-reference and is related to power from 7 to 30 Hz in steps of 0.5 Hz. In my view, for each trial the phase of the peak in the related powerband is determined. Circular statistics can then determine if there is a non-uniform coupling and, if so, to which phase it corresponds. However, here the authors state that every 2 ms the strength of coupling is calculated. This means that at every time bin, frequency bin and trial, yields a pair of slow-wave phase and power value. How is the PAC derived from this data? More importantly, SO frequency may differ between subjects and trials, thus I cannot quite grasp how this can be generalized across subjects with a timewise x-axis. I hope the authors understand my confusion and I would appreciate it if they could elaborate on this analysis. Please note also, that a PAC analysis strongly depends on the present power, thus the comparison of the cue-locked conditions might be a confounded difference in slow wave power.</p><p>– I found it very interesting that a TMR benefit was found immediately after the nap, which was even improved further after an overnight. This contradicts recent evidence on episodic memory only showing a benefit after the additional overnight (Cairney et al., 2018). Furthermore, while this study uses an unfamiliar sound as a control condition, nap studies are ideal to implement a wake control group. It might be worthwhile to discuss or present as food for thought how the reported results related to episodic memory or what different studies design might bring as insights.</p><p>– In line with my last comment, it is interesting that the authors interpret their findings as opposing facilitating and protective mechanisms mediated by slow waves and sleep spindles, but what are the practical implications? On the one hand, stronger responses upon control cues are beneficial. On the other hand, the slow wave-spindle coupling plays an important role as well, however, in this case for real cues. Does this mean that TMR studies missed out on incorporating a control cue or is it enough to only cue with unfamiliar sounds to protect memories? Is something reactivated during control sounds? Given that control sounds don't really evoke a slow oscillatory response (whereas SW-locked analysis are performed across the while cueing interval) implies that control cue-related mechanisms might emerge after or between cueing.</p><p>A potential approach to understand all this is multivariate analysis see Cairney et al. 2018; Schreiner et al. 2020 or new preprints from the Lewis lab=. Thus, it might be worthwhile again to discuss the distinct functions of control and real cues with regard to memory reactivation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sigma Oscillations Protect or Reinstate Motor Memory Depending on their Temporal Coordination with Slow Waves&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved and there are solely two methodological remaining issues that need to be addressed, as raised by Reviewer 2 and outlined below regarding the analysis of cross-frequency coupling in the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thanks a lot for a very thorough revision.</p><p>The majority of my points have been addressed. However, there are still two of my comments (and the authors' responses) I have questions about:</p><p>Comment #4</p><p>Thanks for clarifying the phase-amplitude coupling analysis. However, it deviates from the pre-registration, doesn't it? In the pre-registration, the authors describe the coupling analysis as a phase-phase coupling analysis:</p><p>&quot;SO-spindle coupling: Finally, we aim to determine preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling for both evoked and spontaneous oscillations. We will extract the instantaneous phase of both the SO-filtered signal and of the envelope power in the spindle frequency band. Then we will calculate the circular distance between the phase time series. The preferred phase result from the mean of the circular angle values and will be computed across all trials of each condition separately. &quot;</p><p>I did not find any justification of that deviation in supplementary file 3. Why did the authors change their analysis approach? Do the results differ?</p><p>Comment # 20</p><p>Thanks a lot to the authors for all their effort to address my concern. However, I still have some concerns when comparing the main with the control analysis:</p><p>The authors used the procedure by Mikutta et al. (2019) to show that there is SW-sigma oscillation coupling in all three conditions (associated, unassociated, rest). The control analysis is completely valid and compelling to demonstrate SW-sigma oscillation coupling during the rest condition. However, when comparing the main analysis with the control analysis there seems to be some differences:</p><p>First, there is no difference in the preferred phase angle of the SW-filtered signal when the sigma oscillations peak. Wouldn't you expect a mean phase difference between the associated and unassociated condition given that the coupling is stronger around the SW trough in the unassociated condition (similarly to Figure 6 in the main text)?</p><p>Second, I would like to see the presence of SW-sigma oscillation coupling with their actual dependent variable (PAC factor) as this is the variable the authors based their findings on. They stated that a statistical comparison to 0 is not a suitable approach as the ERPAC ranges between 0 and 1. Consequently, significant differences between the data and 0 are very likely.</p><p>An alternative way to create control data (where you don't expect any coupling) is to use events without any SW/cue. For example, you can run the SW detection on your data. For each detected SW you can choose a control event which is a SW free event temporally close to the detected SW (e.g., within 30s pre or post). Based on these SW free events the same analysis as in Figure 6 can be run and statistical comparisons can be made. For a comparable approach see (Ngo et al., 2020).</p><p>References</p><p>Ngo, H. V.

Accordingly, the methods section was significantly expanded, in particular the description of the algorithms employed in the detection of sleep events (see comment #16 of reviewer #2) and the methods related to the phase amplitude coupling analyses (see comment #6 of reviewer #1, comment #19 of reviewer #2 and comment #11 of reviewer #3).</p><p>We are also grateful to have the opportunity to clarify some of our methodological choices. All three reviewers requested more justification to be provided with respect to the averaging that was performed across EEG electrodes. This choice was made based on the low-density nature of our montage (6 channels), preventing us from performing meaningful topographical analyses. Averaging across channels instead improved signal-to-noise ratio. Accordingly, the channel level was not considered a factor of interest in the present study. Nevertheless, in order to address the reviewers’ comments (i.e., comments #3 and #6 of reviewer #1 as well as comments #3 and #12 of reviewer #2), we now provide channel level results in the supplemental material of the revised manuscript. Briefly, channel level data for ERP, TF and PAC analyses are consistent – but overall noisier – than averaged data reported in the main text.</p><p>In order to address the coupling point raised by two reviewers (comment #7 of reviewer #1 and comments #2 and #20 of reviewer #2), we now report additional analyses investigating coupling at rest and within each stimulation condition. Results show that there is indeed reliable coupling between slow oscillation phase and sigma band amplitude at rest and during auditory stimulation.</p><p>Last, with respect to the visualization of the data, all the figures of the manuscript have been thoroughly revised based on the very constructive comments and helpful suggestions of the reviewers.</p><p>We believe that the additional analyses requested by the reviewers as well as the recommended figure changes have greatly improved both the quality and the readability of the manuscript.

Accordingly, we replaced all instances of “gain” by “change” in performance in the revised manuscript in order to alleviate the confusion. Note that the amplitude of offline changes in performance (i.e., whether or not the values are significantly different from zero) is heavily influenced by computational and/or methodological choices (e.g. number of blocks selected, presence/absence of immediate post-training test dissipating fatigue (Rickard et al., 2008) (Rickard and Pan, 2017)). Accordingly, it is recommended to <italic>not</italic> report comparisons to a test value of zero, but rather to compare offline changes between conditions and/or groups (King et al., 2017). In the context of the current study, behavioral results show that offline changes in performance were significantly greater for the reactivated – as compared to the non-reactivated – sequence, which suggests that TMR enhanced performance.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of adding individual data points to Figure 2b, and we changed it accordingly.

We indeed performed a one-sample t-test against zero. This information was clarified in the revised manuscript (see below and p. 20, l. 29 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>It is indeed possible to test for condition effect using CBP. Yet, we elected to first identify temporal windows in which significant brain activity was evoked by the auditory stimulus (see comment #7 of this reviewer below in the context of the PAC analyses) before comparing conditions. It was indeed hypothesized that the different conditions would specifically alter the amplitude of brain responses during a significant ERP modulation (i.e., in a time-window where signal changes were above noise) which is why we adopted this two-step approach.</p><p>With respect to the comment on topography, it is also indeed possible to consider the channel level in the CBP analyses. We elected to not do so based on the low resolution of our montage (6 channels) and therefore averaged responses across channels. The approach we employed and as described above allowed us to reduce the dimensionality of the data (in both the temporal and spatial dimensions). Nevertheless, in order to address the reviewer’s comment, we performed the suggested analyses and directly compared the conditions per channel using CBP on the entire time-window. As expected, this more conservative approach showed no differences between conditions. However, and as shown in the Supplemental Figure S2 where ERPs are depicted per condition on each individual channel, the condition effect was more pronounced on central electrodes located above the motor cortex. CBP analyses testing for condition effects and performed on these central channels (i.e., averaged across Cz, C3, and C4, as per the suggestion of reviewer #2 in comment #13) revealed a significant cluster (p = 0.049) between 0.39 and 0.62 sec post-cue (i.e. in the same time window highlighted by our two-step approach).</p><p>We acknowledge that this two-step approach requires further justification in the revised manuscript.

This would be fairly large and in the range of typical slow-wave amplitudes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that spindle amplitudes reported in the present paper are higher than what is usually observed in the literature. This discrepancy with previous reports is due to the (default) methods implemented in YASA to compute peak-to-peak spindle amplitude. Specifically, while the majority of the available detection algorithms compute spindle amplitude on filtered EEG data (Lacourse et al., 2019, Purcell et al., 2017), YASA extracts spindle peak-to-peak amplitude from the raw EEG signal by default. We agree with the reviewer that this might be confusing for the reader. Consequently, we now compute spindle amplitude on the filtered EEG data as in previous research. The mean amplitude reported in the revised version of the manuscript is now around 35 microvolts which is in line with previous work. Note that the main effect of sound on spindle amplitude reported in the initial manuscript is no longer significant with the new amplitude metrics (p = 0.065). The corresponding results have been updated in the revised manuscript (see Results section p. 6 l. 11 and Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– From the description of the PAC analyses on page 21, it is unclear how exactly the procedure was implemented.

This section was significantly expanded in the revised manuscript (see p. 21, l. 47). Averaging across EEG channels was indeed performed at the raw signal level, i.e. prior to performing the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis. To explain this methodological choice, we would first like to clarify the PAC method that was employed in the present research. Coupling analyses were performed using the Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling (ERPAC) method initially proposed by Voytek et al. (2013) – and later largely adopted in the field (e.g. Samaha et al., 2015, Arnal et al., 2015, Ladenbauer et al., 2017) – that is implemented in the TensorPac to support multi-dimensional arrays (Combrisson et al., 2020). Unlike blocked PAC that measures PAC across time cycle (e.g. with mean vector length algorithm computed on each and every trial), ERPAC is calculated at each time point (Lachaux et al., 1999) in order to preserve the time dimension. It determines the amount of trial-by-trial variance in the higher frequency sigma band amplitude that can be explained by trial-by-trial variations in slow oscillation phase and calculates the correlation between sigma amplitude and slow oscillation (or the regression between them) at each time point. This method allows to unravel PAC dynamic in response to a stimulus.</p><p>We decided to average the raw signal across channels prior to PAC analyses to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) as the quality of the phase estimation is particularly sensitive to noise (Gross et al., 2013). The reviewer is correct that, traditionally, averaging is performed across trials (such as for ERP and time-frequency power estimation after convolution). However, as mentioned above, such averaging strategy is not possible due to the nature of the ERPAC method used. Altogether, in order to increase SNR and based on the fact that (1) our montage did not allow fine topographical analyses and (2) averaging in the spatial domain is rather standard when computing global field power (Murray et al. 2008) that is also used for PAC estimation (Busch and Vanrullen, 2010), we opted to average raw signal at the channel level.</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to address the reviewer’s comment on channel level data (as well as similar comments raised in comment #13 of reviewer #2 who was also interested in seeing PAC results at the channel level), we now also report channel level data – as well as corresponding cluster-based permutation tests – for each PAC analyses reported in the main text (see Supplemental Figure S6 for PAC between conditions and Supplemental Figure S8 for PAC/TMR index correlation analyses in the revised submission). Briefly, channel level data revealed that, as expected, central – and to a lesser extent frontal – electrodes mainly contributed to the pattern of results highlighted on averaged maps reported in the main text.</p><p>We have also changed the main manuscript in order to clarify this pipeline:</p><p>p. 21, l. 47: “In order to perform coupling analyses, preprocessed cleaned data were first down-sampled to 500 Hz. Based on the low spatial resolution of our montage that did not allow fine topographical analyses and in order to increase the signal to noise ratio to enhance the quality of the phase estimation that is particularly sensitive to noise (73), we opted to average the data across channels (but see Supplemental Figures S6 and S8 for channel level data). Coupling analyses were then performed using the Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling (ERPAC) method proposed by Voytek et al. (2013) and implemented in the TensorPac to support multi-dimensional arrays (71). This method allows to compute the ERPAC at each time point of the analysis window (72) and is therefore optimal to preserve the time dimension. Specifically, the instantaneous phases of the slow oscillation (0.5-2 Hz) and the envelopes of amplitudes of the signal between 7-30 Hz# (see Supplemental Table S3.4) were first calculated by Hilbert transform around the trials of interest (i.e, from -0.5 to 2.5 sec around the auditory cue onset and from -1 to 2 sec around the negative peak of the SWs). For each time point in the analysis window (i.e., every 2ms), the circular-linear correlation of phase and amplitude values were computed across trials. This analysis therefore tested whether trial-by-trial differences in slow oscillation phase explained a significant amount of the inter-trial variability in signal amplitude in the analyzed time window. The PAC factor output therefore represents the corresponding correlation coefficient. ERPAC was computed separately for the two sound conditions and compared using CBP test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Concerning the PAC analyses, it remains unclear whether there is a reliable SO-SP coupling in the first place. The comparison of PAC values across conditions is not very telling as long as there is no significant coupling to begin with. Again, here the authors would first need to test whether there is PAC significantly higher than chance / zero, before comparing conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. However, the precise analysis outlined by the reviewer would not be overly meaningful with the ERPAC method employed in this study. Notably, as ERPAC values range from 0 to 1, an ERPAC significantly different from zero is essentially a certainty. We therefore opted to follow the procedure used in Mikutta et al. (2019) in order test for the presence of coupling during rest and stimulation intervals. Specifically, we tested whether the amplitude of the sigma oscillations peaked at a preferred phase of the slow oscillation across trials within each stimulation condition and at rest. These analyses were performed for both cued- and SW-locked analyses (in 2.5 sec and 3 sec analysis time-windows, respectively, consistent with the analyses reported in the main text). Specifically, we tested whether the preferred phases were uniformly distributed using Rayleigh test for non-uniformity of circular data (Berens, 2009); with a non-uniform distribution of the preferred phase being an indicator of coupling. Results show that the cue-locked preferred phases across trials were not uniformly distributed in both sound conditions (associated: Rayleigh z = 10.6, p-value = 7.7e-6 (7.7e-6 FDR-corrected); unassociated cues: Rayleigh z = 15.8, p-value = 4e-9 (8.1e-9 FDR-corrected)). SW-locked analyses revealed that the phase at which the amplitude was the highest was also not distributed uniformly during associated (Rayleigh z = 9.7, p-value = 2e-5 (6e-5 FDR-corrected)), unassociated (Rayleigh z = 4.8, p-value = 0.007, (6.9e-3 FDR-corrected)) and rest (Rayleigh z = 5.7, p-value = 0.003 (3.8-3 FDR-corrected)) intervals. Altogether, these results indicate significant SW-sigma coupling within each stimulation condition and at rest. These results are now presented in the Supplemental Figure (S5) and changes have been made in the methods (p. 22, l. 22) and results (p. 8, l. 10, l. 16, and l. 29) sections accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) Calculation of offline gains.</p><p>Post-nap as well as post-night offline gains in performance were calculated as a relative change to pre-nap performance.

These results are in line with channel ERP data presented in the supplement of Cairney et al. 2018 (Figure S1), whereby the amplitude of the negative peak fluctuated across channels (see low amplitude of negative peaks for object cues on the left electrodes in particular). However, there are indeed discrepancies between our ERP data and those presented in Weigenand et al., and Schreiner et al. These discrepancies might be explained by various factors such as (i) the sleep stage that was stimulated (e.g., NREM3 in Weigenand et al.); a sleep stage in which N1 amplitudes are usually greater than during NREM2 (Atienza et al., 2001), (ii) the electrode(s) from which ERPs were extracted (e.g., E117 in Schreiner et al.; an electrode that was not included in our montage), (iii) the number of sound repetitions (e.g., 17 repetitions per condition in Schreiner et al., around 195 repetitions per condition in our study). These methodological differences prevent us from making direct comparisons between studies.

The first one concerns the event-related potential (ERP) and the time-frequency power modulation. We first computed the ERP (or the convolution) at the channel level and then averaged across channels. Data were averaged across channels as the low-density nature of our montage (6 channels) prevented us from performing meaningful topographical analyses. Averaging across channels instead improved signal-to-noise ratio. The second averaging pipeline concerns the event-related phase-amplitude coupling (ERPAC) and computes the across-channel average before the ERPAC computation. We invite the reviewer to consult our response to comment #6 of reviewer #1 for further information and justification about this averaging method. Briefly, this choice was made in order to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR) as the quality of the phase estimation is particularly sensitive to noise (Gross et al., 2013). Justification for these averaging choices is now provided in the main text (p. 20, l. 25 and p. 21, l. 47).</p><p>In addition to these justifications and in order to address the reviewer’s comment on channel level data (as well as similar comments raised by reviewer #1 who was also interested in seeing PAC results at the channel level), we now also report channel level data – as well as corresponding cluster-based permutation tests – for each analysis reported in the main text (i.e., ERPs are shown in Supplemental Figure S2 and S4, correlation between targeted memory reactivation index and power modulation is depicted in Supplemental Figure S7, PAC difference at the negative peak of the SW is in Supplemental Figure S6 and PAC/TMR index correlation in Figure S8).

As hypothesized by the reviewer, channel level data indeed revealed that central electrodes mainly contributed to the pattern of results highlighted with averaged maps and reported in the main text.</p><p>Note that we removed the citation of Cairney et al. to justify averaging across channels as channel averaging was indeed only done for a subset of the analyses in this paper</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) 2.2.1.

The information provided below has been added to the revised version of the Materials and methods (p. 21, l. 3 and l. 11).</p><p>Concerning spindle detection, the algorithm implemented in YASA (Vallat and Walker, 2021) is largely inspired from the A7 algorithm described in Lacourse et al. (2019). Specifically, the relative power in the spindle frequency band (12-16Hz) with respect to the total power in the broad-band frequency (1–30 Hz) is estimated based on Short-Time Fourier Transforms with 2 s windows and a 200 ms overlap. Next, the algorithm uses a 300 ms window with a step size of 100 ms to compute the moving root mean squared (RMS) of the filtered EEG data in the sigma band. A moving correlation between the broadband signal (1–30 Hz) and the EEG signal filtered in the spindle band is then computed. Sleep spindles are detected when the three following thresholds are reached simultaneously: (1) the relative power in the sigma band (with respect to total power) is above 0.2, (2) the moving RMS crosses the RMS<sub>mean</sub> + 1.5 RMS<sub>SD</sub> threshold and (3) the moving correlation described is above 0.65. Additionally, detected spindles shorter than 0.5 s or longer than 2 s were discarded. Spindles occurring on different channels within 500 ms of each other were assumed to reflect the same spindle and were therefore merged together.</p><p>Concerning slow-waves (SWs) detection, the algorithm used in YASA is a custom adaptation of the algorithms used in Massimini et al. (2004) and Carrier et al., (2011). Specifically, data are filtered between 0.3 to 2 Hz with a FIR filter with a 0.2 Hz transition resulting in a -6 dB points at 0.2 and 2.1 Hz. Then all the negative peaks with an amplitude between -40 to -200 μV and the positive peaks with an amplitude comprised between 10 to 150 μV are detected in the filtered signal. After sorting identified negative peaks with subsequent positive peaks, a set of logical thresholds are applied to identify the true slow-waves: (1) duration of the negative deflection of the SW between 0.3 to 1.5 sec; (2) duration of the positive deflection of the SW between 0.1 to 1 sec; (3) absolute amplitude of the negative trough of the SW between 40 μV to 300 μV, (4) absolute positive peak amplitude of the SW between 10 μV to 200 μV and (5) peak-to-peak amplitude of the SW between 75 μV to 500 μV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Page 6, first paragraph: &quot;[…] more importantly, that the associated sounds resulted in an increase in SW amplitude, density and slope as compared to the unassociated sounds.&quot; Did the authors compare the slope?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.

Briefly, coupling analyses were performed using the Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling (ERPAC) method proposed by Voytek et al. (2013) and implemented in the TensorPac to support multi-dimensional arrays (Combrisson et al., 2020). Unlike blocked PAC that measures PAC across time cycle (e.g. with mean vector length algorithm), ERPAC is calculated across trials separately at each time point (Lachaux et al., 1999) in order to preserve the time dimension. Specifically, the instantaneous phases and envelopes of amplitudes from our two components (slow and sigma oscillations, respectively) were first calculated by Hilbert transform. For each trial time point, we computed the circular-linear correlation of phase and amplitude values across trials. This analysis therefore tested whether trial-by-trial differences in <italic>slow oscillation</italic> phase explained a significant amount of the inter-trial variability in <italic>sigma</italic> amplitude in the analyzed time window.

Note that similar results were observed for associated and rest intervals. Importantly, ERPAC analyses presented in the main text indicate that PAC was significantly stronger around the negative peak of the slow oscillation during unassociated as compared to associated stimulation and rest intervals (see Figure 6b-c in the main text). We speculate that sigma oscillations nested in the trough of the SW during unassociated intervals might prevent the processing of unassociated/irrelevant sounds during post-learning sleep which might in turn be reflected by a decrease in the amplitude of the slow electrophysiological responses (i.e., smaller ERP and SWs) during non-associated sound intervals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) 2.3.

It is clear that the 0.5 to 2 Hz signal serves as the phase-reference and is related to power from 7 to 30 Hz in steps of 0.5 Hz. In my view, for each trial the phase of the peak in the related powerband is determined. Circular statistics can then determine if there is a non-uniform coupling and, if so, to which phase it corresponds. However, here the authors state that every 2 ms the strength of coupling is calculated. This means that at every time bin, frequency bin and trial, yields a pair of slow-wave phase and power value. How is the PAC derived from this data? More importantly, SO frequency may differ between subjects and trials, thus I cannot quite grasp how this can be generalized across subjects with a timewise x-axis. I hope the authors understand my confusion and I would appreciate it if they could elaborate on this analysis. Please note also, that a PAC analysis strongly depends on the present power, thus the comparison of the cue-locked conditions might be a confounded difference in slow wave power.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the methodology describing the PAC analyses was not detailed enough in the initial manuscript and have added all relevant information and references on p. 21 (l. 47) of the revised manuscript. Briefly, coupling analyses were performed using the Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling (ERPAC) method proposed by Voytek et al. (2013) and implemented in the TensorPac to support multi-dimensional arrays (Combrisson et al., 2020). Unlike traditional blocked PAC that measures PAC across time cycle (e.g. with mean vector length algorithm), ERPAC is calculated across trials separately at each time point (Lachaux et al., 1999) in order to preserve the time dimension. Specifically, the instantaneous phases and envelopes of amplitudes from our two components (slow and sigma oscillations, respectively) were first calculated by Hilbert transform. For each trial time point, we computed the circular-linear correlation of phase and amplitude values across trials. This analysis therefore tested whether trial-by-trial differences in <italic>slow oscillation</italic> phase explained a significant amount of the inter-trial variability in <italic>sigma</italic> amplitude in the analyzed time window. Concerning the note of the reviewer on the influence of power on PAC output, we do agree that PAC analyses are sensitive to various factors such as noise and global power. Therefore, the recommendations when performing PAC analysis is to use experimental contrasts in order to subtract out any global power effects (Schoffelen and Gross, 2009). With respect to the potential influence of condition-specific modulation of power, as we did not observe any effect of condition on power (see time-frequency analyses reported in the main text), we believe that it is unlikely that power differences would have confounded the PAC results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I found it very interesting that a TMR benefit was found immediately after the nap, which was even improved further after an overnight. This contradicts recent evidence on episodic memory only showing a benefit after the additional overnight (Cairney et al., 2018). Furthermore, while this study uses an unfamiliar sound as a control condition, nap studies are ideal to implement a wake control group. It might be worthwhile to discuss or present as food for thought how the reported results related to episodic memory or what different studies design might bring as insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this point is a valuable addition to the discussion. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript as follow:</p><p>p. 12, l. 6: “In the present study, we examined the impact of auditory TMR on motor memory consolidation as well as the neurophysiological processes supporting reactivation during sleep. Our results demonstrate a TMR-induced behavioral advantage such that offline changes in performance were larger on the reactivated as compared to the non-reactivated sequence. These behavioral results are in line with earlier motor learning studies showing improvement in performance after auditory (13, 16, 12) or olfactory (17) TMR during sleep. As opposed to earlier TMR research though, the current results suggest that TMR-induced consolidation is not a protracted process that needs additional time and/or sleep to develop (24), as a behavioral advantage could already be observed immediately after the TMR episode. Also, in contrast to earlier work showing that TMR effects can be transient (12), the current data indicate that the effect of TMR on motor performance was sustained overnight. It remains unclear whether these discrepancies are related to the nature of the task (e.g., declarative vs. motor), the sensory stimulus used for reactivation (words vs. sound) or the duration of the reactivation / sleeping episode (nap vs. night). Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the TMR episode during a nap immediately following learning set the reactivated memory trace on a distinct yet parallel trajectory as compared to the non-reactivated memory trace.”</p><p>With respect to the point of the reviewer on a wake control condition, we agree that nap designs are ideally suited to offer such controls. However, we opted to not include such control group in our experiment but to instead include all within-subject control conditions that allowed us to address the two main goals of the present research which were (1) highlighting a behavioral benefit for sequences reactivated during sleep as compared to sequences not reactivated during sleep and (2) investigating the neurophysiological correlates of such TMR-induced benefit. We acknowledge that comparing the neurophysiological processes underlying reactivation during sleep vs. wakefulness is of high interest but this was beyond the scope of the present research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In line with my last comment, it is interesting that the authors interpret their findings as opposing facilitating and protective mechanisms mediated by slow waves and sleep spindles, but what are the practical implications? On the one hand, stronger responses upon control cues are beneficial. On the other hand, the slow wave-spindle coupling plays an important role as well, however, in this case for real cues. Does this mean that TMR studies missed out on incorporating a control cue or is it enough to only cue with unfamiliar sounds to protect memories? Is something reactivated during control sounds? Given that control sounds don't really evoke a slow oscillatory response (whereas SW-locked analysis are performed across the while cueing interval) implies that control cue-related mechanisms might emerge after or between cueing.</p><p>A potential approach to understand all this is multivariate analysis see Cairney et al. 2018; Schreiner et al. 2020 or new preprints from the Lewis lab=. Thus, it might be worthwhile again to discuss the distinct functions of control and real cues with regard to memory reactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting discussion. It appears that the addition of a control sound in our research indeed allowed to highlight these (unexpected) protective processes. Our results indeed suggest that when a control, unknown cue is presented to the sleeping brain, it might trigger protective mechanisms to prevent these “irrelevant” sensory stimuli to be processed and therefore disturb the ongoing consolidation of previously encoded and reactivated memories. Specifically, we speculated that SW-sigma coupling during exposure to unassociated sounds might prevent sound processing which would in turn be reflected by a decrease in the amplitude of the slow electrophysiological responses (i.e., smaller ERP and SWs) during non-associated sound intervals. In order to further examine this possibility and better substantiate this hypothesis, we performed additional exploratory analyses testing for potential relationships between the PAC observed on unassociated conditions and slow electrophysiological responses (i.e., ERP and SWs). To do so, we extracted the PAC value during unassociated stimulation intervals in the time-frequency window where PAC was significantly greater for unassociated as compared to associated and rest conditions (i.e. from -0.5 to 0.5 sec and from 14 to 18 Hz, see Figure 6 in the main text). While the PAC during unassociated intervals did not correlate with the amplitude of the unassociated ERPs, it correlated negatively with the properties of the SWs detected during unassociated intervals. Specifically, the higher the PAC, the lower SW density (t = -2.9, df = 20, p-value = 0.004) and the lower the peak-to-peak SW amplitude (S = 2460, p-value = 0.037) during unassociated intervals (see Supplemental Figure S9 in the revised manuscript). These results provide further support for the protective mechanism discussed above. These correlations are now reported in the supplemental information and mentioned in the revised discussion to further discuss the distinct functions of control and memory cues with regard to memory reactivation.</p><p>p. 13, l. 46: “We argue that sigma oscillations might play the role of a gatekeeper for the consolidation process and protect the motor memory trace against potential interfering effects induced by the unassociated sounds which might in turn potentiate the effect of TMR at the behavioral level. In order to further examine this possibility, we performed additional exploratory analyses testing for potential relationships between the SW-sigma coupling observed during unassociated stimulation intervals and slow electrophysiological responses (see Supplemental Figure S9). Results showed a negative correlation between SW-sigma coupling and SW features such that higher coupling was related to lower SW amplitude and density during unassociated stimulation intervals. These results provide further support for the protective effect of sigma oscillations (nested in the trough of slow oscillations) against potential interfering effects induced by the unassociated sounds. These assumptions are also in line with a growing body of literature pointing towards a sensory gating role of spindle activity / sigma oscillations (40, 41) that might be critical to facilitate the memory consolidation process during sleep (42, 39).”</p><p>Last, we performed additional exploratory analyses in order to test the interesting hypothesis proposed by the reviewer that control cue-related mechanisms might emerge after or between cueing. To do so, we performed a cluster-based permutation test comparing associated and unassociated cue-locked evoked potentials and oscillations on a broader time window (from -1 to 4 sec relative to cue onset) to cover the entire period in-between cues (inter-stimulus interval of 5 sec.). These analyses did not highlight any significant differences between conditions (ERP: all cluster p-values &gt; 0.2; oscillatory analysis: all cluster p-values &gt; 0.39).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved and there are solely two methodological remaining issues that need to be addressed, as raised by Reviewer 2 and outlined below regarding the analysis of cross-frequency coupling in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the editor for their time and for their comment on the revised manuscript.

Do the results differ?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this issue to our attention which appears to be due to a lack of clarity in the pre-registration. Preferred phase analyses are indeed phase-amplitude and not phase-phase coupling analyses (Canolty et al. (2006); Dupré la Tour et al. (2017); Penny et al. (2008)). We acknowledge that the description of these analyses was confusing in the pre-registration. We indeed extracted the instantaneous phase of the SO-filtered signal and the envelope power in the spindle frequency band. We then computed the preferred phase as the SO phase where sigma amplitude is maximum and represented the mean of the circular angle across trials for each condition in the density plots presented in Figure S5. We hope that this additional information has clarified the analyses conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment # 20</p><p>Thanks a lot to the authors for all their effort to address my concern. However, I still have some concerns when comparing the main with the control analysis:</p><p>The authors used the procedure by Mikutta et al. (2019) to show that there is SW-sigma oscillation coupling in all three conditions (associated, unassociated, rest). The control analysis is completely valid and compelling to demonstrate SW-sigma oscillation coupling during the rest condition. However, when comparing the main analysis with the control analysis there seems to be some differences:</p><p>First, there is no difference in the preferred phase angle of the SW-filtered signal when the sigma oscillations peak. Wouldn't you expect a mean phase difference between the associated and unassociated condition given that the coupling is stronger around the SW trough in the unassociated condition (similarly to Figure 6 in the main text)?</p><p>Second, I would like to see the presence of SW-sigma oscillation coupling with their actual dependent variable (PAC factor) as this is the variable the authors based their findings on. They stated that a statistical comparison to 0 is not a suitable approach as the ERPAC ranges between 0 and 1. Consequently, significant differences between the data and 0 are very likely.</p><p>An alternative way to create control data (where you don't expect any coupling) is to use events without any SW/cue. For example, you can run the SW detection on your data. For each detected SW you can choose a control event which is a SW free event temporally close to the detected SW (e.g., within 30s pre or post). Based on these SW free events the same analysis as in Figure 6 can be run and statistical comparisons can be made. For a comparable approach see (Ngo et al., 2020).</p><p>References</p><p>Ngo, H. V.

Preferred phase measures are independent of ERPAC magnitude. Preferred phase analyses show that sigma power peaked consistently across trials at a similar phase of the SO (descending phase) in both conditions. However, these analyses do not inform on whether – at each time point of the analyzed epoch – inter-trial SO phase variability is correlated to inter-trial sigma amplitude variability. In other words, sigma amplitude might be maximum at a specific phase of the slow oscillation in both conditions (as shown with the preferred phase analyses) but the relationship between the amplitude and the phase of the signal at this particular time point might be different between conditions (as measured with ERPAC). Altogether, the results show that while the SO phase at which sigma peaks was similar between conditions, the across-trial relationship between SO phase and sigma amplitude was stronger in the unassociated as compared to the associated condition in this particular time/SO phase window.</p><p>Regarding the additional ERPAC control analyses mentioned by the reviewer, we predict that ERPAC will be significantly different from zero in any within condition analyses for the reason mentioned in the first revision (ERPAC values ranging from 0 to 1). As ERPAC is not suited to test against zero, we therefore opted to use preferred phase (PP) analyses to test for coupling within conditions. Additionally, we expect the SW-free approach suggested by the reviewer will yield significant coupling (even with PP approaches) in analyses windows that are <italic>not</italic> centered on the negative peak of the SO peak as there is general strong coupling between the phase of the 0.5-2 Hz signal (irrespective of whether a SO is formally detected or not) and sigma amplitude during sleep. We performed the suggested SW-free analyses with both ERPAC and PP approaches to support the above-statement. Namely, for each detected SW in the rest condition, we extracted a random time sample from a time window lasting 1 minute around the negative peak of the SW. The random point was not selected if it was part of another SW and we also pseudo-randomly selected the time point in order to obtain a uniform distribution in terms of slow oscillation phase. We first computed the preferred phase of the slow wave at which the sigma oscillations peak and we tested whether the preferred phases were uniformly distributed using Rayleigh test for non-uniformity of circular data (Berens, 2009). In line with our expectations and with the SW-locked analyses, SW-free-locked analyses revealed that the SO phase at which the sigma amplitude was the highest was not distributed uniformly during rest (Rayleigh z = 8.2, p-value = 1.4e-4). SW-free-locked and SW-locked preferred phases did not differ (F(1,43) = 1.4, p-value = 0.24). These results suggest that the coupling between the phase of the SO and the amplitude of the sigma power is not limited to the epochs where SO are detected. Last and as expected from ERPAC testing against zero, both the SW-locked and the SW-free-locked ERPAC analyses show that ERPAC was significantly different from zero at rest.</p><p>Another way to create control events is to fill the original trials with random noise (see Combrisson et al., (2020)). Specifically, we created, for each individual, the same number of SW-locked trials as in the original analysis but filled with random noise uniformly distributed between the minimum and the maximum in the signal of each particular participant. Similar as above, we tested the distribution of the resulting preferred phase and ERPAC against zero. As expected, the random noise preferred phase results revealed that the SO phase at which the sigma amplitude was the highest was distributed uniformly (Rayleigh z = 1.6, p-value = 0.21) which indicates the absence of coupling of random noise data. As expected from ERPAC testing against zero, random noise ERPAC was still significantly different from zero.</p><p>We hope this additional information better justifies the use of the preferred phase as a control analysis to test for coupling (or its absence) within each condition and at rest as compared to ERPAC testing against zero.</p></body></sub-article></article>
