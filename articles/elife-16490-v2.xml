Photo-transduction in cone segments (CS) are crucial for cone function and therefore high acuity and daytime vision. In geographic atrophy (GA), a late form of age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), an extending atrophic zone (AZ) forms, characterized by the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE, a monolayer of cells with important functions in photoreceptor homeostasis) and degeneration of the photoreceptor cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sarks, 1976</xref>). The initial lesion in GA often develops parafoveally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sarks et al., 1988</xref>) and slowly expands through the central retina and fovea, which leads to a severe drop in visual acuity. In the AZ, despite the absence of the RPE, residual cones survive, but they lack the cone segments (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>). Similar findings are observed in disciform subretinal scars, the end-stage of exudative AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curcio, 2001</xref>). Surprisingly, in a transitional zone (TZ), just peripheral to the RPE-loss in the scar and AZ, the number of rods drops dramatically compared to the retina more distant from the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curcio, 2001</xref>). In contrast, the number of cones changes little in the TZ, but they lack their CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curcio, 2001</xref>). One could assume that the CS loss in the TZ of AMD patients is due to RPE dysfunction, but CS loss is also observed in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients with rod-gene mutations and unremarkable RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mitamura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mononuclear phagocytes (MP) comprise a family of cells that include classical monocytes (Mo), macrophages (Mϕ), and microglial cells (MC) among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chow et al., 2011</xref>). We and others have shown that subretinal MPs accumulate in the AZ and on the apical side of the RPE of the TZ in patients with GA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Combadière et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that numerous blood-derived MPs (CCR2-positive) invariably participate in the infiltration of both, the AZ and TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, the recruitment of blood-derived monocytes contributes importantly to autoimmune, photo-oxidative, and genetic photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rutar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kohno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cruz-Guilloty, 2013</xref>) and we demonstrated that bone-marrow derived murine monocytes induce rod apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>), which is in part mediated by IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, subretinal MPs also accumulate in RP secondarily to primary rod cell death, and have been suggested to induce the unexplained CS degeneration in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We here confirm that the TZ is infiltrated by CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs and that rod photoreceptors and cone segments are lost in the TZ despite the presence of underlying RPE. Using co-cultures of human CD14<sup>+</sup>Mos and mouse bone-marrow derived Mos with retinal explants in vitro and inflammation-prone <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> </italic>mice in vivo, we show that MP derived IL-1β induces CS degeneration additionally to previously reported rod apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that the presence of CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs in the subretinal space, not only observed in the TZ but also in patients with RP, participates in CS degeneration as they produce similar changes in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cone and rod loss in relation to GA lesions</title><p>Bird and colleagues recently analyzed the loss of outer nuclear layer (ONL) nuclei and cone outer segments in GA using histology and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>). They reported that rod loss and cone outer segment degeneration occur peripheral to the margin of the RPE defect, in the transitional zone (TZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>). In this report, we analyzed the rod and cone populations in and around 10 atrophic zones (AZ) of 9 GA donor patients and in 6 control, non GA donor eyes using immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin sections with specific primary antibodies for rhodopsin, L/M-cone opsin, and cone arrestin, which allows identifying rod or cone photoreceptors even if they lost their outer segments. In the central region of control eyes, cone arrestin (green staining) -rhodopsin (red staining) double labeling visualized a 4 to 6 nuclei thick ONL, with cone segments (CS) and dendrites clearly demarcated by the cone arrestin immunological staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Hoechst blue staining of nuclei, RPE autofluorescence orange). The rod outer segments (OS) are strongly immunologically positive for rhodopsin staining, while the rod cell bodies stained more faintly, but enough to identify rod cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> inset). The retina distant (&gt;1000 μm) from the RPE lesion in sections from donor eyes with GA was very similar to the control eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), featuring clearly marked cone arrestin<sup>+</sup> CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> inset). In the TZ, close to the margin of the lesion but where RPE was still present, the ONL was irregular, thinned (around 2 nuclei of ONL), and cone and rod morphology was severely altered with the outer segments missing and the inner segments difficult to distinguish from the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The thinning and loss of segments was invariably found to extend peripherally to the margin of the RPE loss, into the TZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the autofluorescent RPE is visible in the left part of the micrograph, the arrow depicts the margin of the RPE with the atrophic zone to the right). The TZ, characterized by a thinned ONL in the presence of underlying RPE, was of variable length (200–800 μm) in our samples similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>). Within the AZ residual cone arrestin<sup>+</sup> cones, but also rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> rods were observed in all but one analyzed samples, but their distribution was irregular and all photoreceptors lacked their OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). L/M-cone opsin immunohistochemistry, which recognizes the opsins of the most abundant red and green cones, confirmed the CS loss in the TZ and AZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> insets). Next, we quantified cone arrestin<sup>+</sup>cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in the central retina of control eyes and eyes with GA lesions. The cone density at a greater than 1000 μm distance from the RPE-denuded AZ, was similar between control and GA eyes. In the atrophic zone the number of cone somata was significantly reduced to around half the numbers of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and was not significantly different in the TZ (0–200 μm from the AZ, which is the TZ length invariably found in all donor eyes). Rod cell counts, on the other hand, revealed a slight decrease distant from the lesions, but a severe 90% reduction in the TZ compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, in all but one atrophic zone we also detected rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> residual rods.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16490.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rhodopsin, cone arrestin, and L/M cone opsin staining on central sections from control and geographic atrophy patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Representative micrographs of immunohistochemical detection of rhodopsin (red), cone arrestin (green, <sc><bold>A</bold></sc>–<bold>D</bold> and left insets of <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>), or L/M cone opsin (green, right insets of <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) and Hoechst nuclear stain (blue, RPE autofluorescence visible in orange) on central sections of control donors (<bold>A</bold>) and donors with geographic atrophy (GA, panel <bold>B</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) at a distance greater than 1000 μm from the atrophic zone (AZ) (<bold>B</bold>), at the boundary of the AZ and transitional zone (TZ, panel <bold>C</bold>; white arrow indicates the margin of the autofluorescent RPE), and within the AZ (<bold>D</bold>).

Circulating classical Mos also express high levels of CD14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>), which is additionally expressed by other members of the MP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>) and is therefore not discriminative for infiltrating Mos versus resident MPs (unlike CCR2). We analyzed the presence of subretinal CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs and cone segment morphology on central RPE/choroid and retinal flat-mounts from 4 age-matched control donor eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) and 5 donor eyes with central GA lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>), with particular attention to the TZ. Flat-mount immunohistochemistry facilitates the appreciation of cone outer segments and the detection of the smaller, dispersed MPs that are more difficult to detect on sections. We used CD14 immunohistochemistry to visualize MPs, peanut agglutinin (PNA) that stains inner and outer CS (but not cone cell bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanks and Johnson, 1984</xref>), and cone arrestin that stains cones irrespective of the presence of CS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Central (1.5 cm around the fovea/center) retina/RPE/choroid complexes were dissected from the donor eyes and sectioned by radial incisions into 8 triangular pieces that each contain a parafoveal part in the case of control eyes and a central AZ, TZ, and non-atrophic more peripheral part for GA donor eyes. In GA tissues, the retinas of the AZ were carefully peeled from the RPE/choroid, as they adhere to Bruchs membrane in the area of RPE defects. This is not the case in the TZ, where the retina detaches easily from the underlying RPE, comparable to control retinas.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16490.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CD14, peanut agglutinin and cone arrestin staining on central flatmount preparations from control and geographic atrophy patients.</title><p>Representative micrographs of immunohistochemical detection (confocal Z stack projections) of CD14 (white), cone arrestin (red), peanut agglutinin (PNA,green), and Hoechst nuclear stain (blue, RPE autofluorescence visible in orange) of RPE/choroid- (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) and retinal- flatmounts (<bold>B</bold>–<bold>D</bold> and <bold>F</bold>–<bold>H</bold>) of a control donor (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) and a donor with geographic atrophy (GA, panel <bold>E</bold>–<bold>H</bold>).

To analyze an eventual effect of human MPs on photoreceptors, we first co-cultured 100 000 human blood-derived CD14<sup>+</sup>Mos (hMo) adhering to polycarbonate filters floating on DMEM with C57BL/6 mouse retinal explants for 18 hr (with the photoreceptors facing the adherent Mos). Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining of the retinal explants cultured without Mos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), or with Mos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei in the photoreceptor cell layer of retinal explants were more numerous in the presence of Mos. Double-immunological labeling for rhodopsin and TUNEL on sections prepared from the retinal explants revealed that the TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei of the ONL were positive for rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> inset) and not located at proximity to the inner segments, where cone nuclei are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Apoptosis was only observed in a minority of rods in these short-term co-cultures and rhodopsin<sup>+</sup>rod segments were unremarkable in the culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Quantification of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> nuclei/mm on 8 explants per group revealed a significant increase in TUNEL<sup>+</sup> photoreceptors in co-culture with hMos compared to retinal explants cultured without hMos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) similar to co-cultures using Cx3cr1-deficient BMMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>). Next, we analyzed the cone population of PNA (green fluorescence) cone arrestin (red fluorescence) double-labeled mouse retinal explants after 18 hr of mono-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), or co-culture with hMos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Quantification of cone arrestin<sup>+</sup>PNA<sup>+</sup> cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) revealed no influence of the presence of hMos on the number of cones after 18 hr of culture.

We have previously shown that Cx3cr1-deficient mouse BMM induce rod apoptosis in the Mo/retinal explant co-cultures via IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). We showed that Cx3cr1-deficient BMMs constitutively secrete adenosine triphosphate (ATP), express increased surface P2RX7 receptor and secrete mature IL-1β after transcriptional stimulation without a second exogenous stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), that is classically required for inflammasome activation and IL-1β maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). Similarly, human blood monocytes constitutively release endogenous ATP, which leads to mature IL-1β after transcriptional induction without a second exogenous stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Netea et al., 2009</xref>). RT-PCRs of mRNA prepared from freshly isolated hMo, hMo cultured alone or with a retinal explant for 18 hr (both on polycarbonate filters) revealed that IL-1β mRNA, but not IL18 mRNA, was significantly induced in hMos in the co-culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), contrary to IL-6 and TNFα that were not induced (data not shown). PNA-staining of retinal explants cultured for 18 hr in the absence of Mos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) but with recombinant IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), showed that IL-1β was sufficient to severely reduce PNA<sup>+</sup>CS. Quantification of PNA<sup>+</sup>CS confirmed the significant, IL-1β-induced volume loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In these experiments IL-1β was used at a concentration of 50 ng/ml (in the range of concentration classically used in vitro) but the local IL-1β concentration that cones are exposed to in the co-culture is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1β is expected to form around the IL-1β producing Mos. To directly evaluate the effect of locally produced IL-1β we studied the effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) on the co-cultures.

As previously reported, this TZ, characterized by a thinned outer nuclear layer despite the presence of the RPE, was of variable length but found in all specimens. We also confirm a surprisingly important number of residual cones that lack their CS in the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curcio, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, rhodopsin immunohistochemistry also identified some residual, segment-lacking rhodopsin<sup>+</sup> rods within the RPE lesion.</p><p>Other investigators and we have previously shown that AZs of patients with GA contain numerous subretinal MPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Combadière et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Penfold et al., 2001</xref>). We also demonstrated that IBA1<sup>+</sup>MPs, but also blood-derived CCR2<sup>+</sup>MPs, invade the subretinal space of the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>). In the current study, we used immunohistochemistry on flat-mount preparations with an antibody recognizing a co-receptor of the toll like receptor 2 and 4, CD14, to visualize the infiltration of CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs (blood- or tissue-derived MPs) beyond the AZ in the TZ. Co-staining for PNA and cone arrestin confirmed the presence of residual cones in the AZ and the severe CS degeneration in the TZ of retinal flat-mounts and illustrates the close physical association of CS degeneration with CD14<sup>+</sup>MPs.</p><p>It is not clear why CS degenerate in the TZ, where the RPE is present. The degeneration might be a result of dysfunctional RPE prior to its degeneration, suggested by the observation of hyperfluorescence of the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sparrow et al., 2010</xref>). However, to date, we do not know if the hyperfluorescence is due to an increase of fluorescent bisretinoids in the RPE (which could be a sign of RPE dysfunction), or to the superposition of several RPE cells or RPE-debris containing subretinal MPs in the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gocho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zanzottera et al., 2015</xref>). The observation that CS degeneration is also observed in RP patients with rod-gene mutations and unremarkable RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mitamura et al., 2013</xref>) further argues that an RPE-independent factor might participate in the degeneration.</p><p>Intriguingly, CS degeneration in RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>), and as we show here in the TZ of patients with GA , is associated with the accumulation of subretinal MPs. We have previously shown that mouse MPs induce partial rod cell apoptosis in vivo and that wildtype mouse Mos and Cx3cr1-deficient Mos and MCs (characterized by excessive IL-1β secretion) induce rod apoptosis in retinal explant co-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sennlaub et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). The influence of subretinal MPs on cones is unknown. Using Mo/retinal explant co-cultures, we here show that human blood-derived CD14<sup>+</sup>Mo induce some degree of rod apoptosis in retinal explants similar to mouse Cx3cr1-deficient mouse BMMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, cone death was not observed, but all cones showed signs of severe CS degeneration. We show that IL-1β was robustly transcribed in co-cultured Mos, that recombinant IL-1β replicated CS degeneration, and that IL-1β-inhibition reversed the Mo-induced CS degeneration.</p><p>The co-culture in vitro system, characterized by an excess of Mos, the lack of underlying RPE, mild rod apoptosis and quite severe CS degeneration occurring in hours rather than days and weeks, can however only be a rough approximation of the in vivo situation. The pattern of continuous rod (but not cone) apoptosis and CS degeneration over longer time periods would result in severe rod cell loss (as they don’t regenerate), little cone loss but CS degeneration intriguingly similar to what is observed in the TZ of patients with GA.</p><p>To test whether IL-1β-induced CS degeneration takes place in subretinal inflammation in vivo in the presence of the RPE, we analyzed cone morphology in inflammation-prone <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> </italic>mice. When subretinal MP accumulation was induced using a light-challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), we observed CS degeneration, similar to the results we obtained with Mos in vitro Furthermore, inhibition of IL-1β, induced in these experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), prevented the CS degeneration in vivo, in accordance with the observation that IL-1β potently induced CS degeneration in vitro.</p><p>Our study clearly demonstrates the association of subretinal MPs with CS degeneration in human samples and that MPs can induce a similar phenotype in vitro and in vivo, which strongly suggest that subretinal MPs participate in the degenerative changes in GA. Further studies of IL-1β expression in human GA samples are needed to implicate this specific cytokine in the degenerative process in the human disease. However, IL-1β has been shown to be strongly expressed in subretinal MPs of choroidal neovascular membranes in wet AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oh et al., 1999</xref>) and CS degeneration is also observed adjacent to the fibrovascular membranes in disciform subretinal scars of wet AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curcio, 2001</xref>). These observations suggest that an IL-1β-dependent mechanism might exist in the human pathology.</p><p>Little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CS loss in GA. The observation that the degenerative changes appear peripheral to the RPE lesion and that similar changes are observed in RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>) and RP models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>), suggest that other factors than RPE loss play a significant role. We clearly demonstrate that subretinal MPs, observed in both RP and the TZ, induce severe IL-1β-dependent CS degeneration in the presence of morphologically normal RPE in vivo. Gupta et al. proposed several years ago that the subretinal inflammation secondary to rod degeneration in RP could be the 'missing link' to explain secondary CS and cone degeneration observed in RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2003</xref>). CS maintenance in RP has recently been shown to depend on cone glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>) that is stimulated by insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>) and rod-derived cone viability factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, inhibit insulin-dependent glucose uptake and are increasingly recognized to play an important role in insulin-resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shoelson, 2006</xref>). IL-1β-induced cone insulin resistance, decreased glucose uptake and subsequent cone starvation might explain the CS loss in RP and AMD.</p><p>Taken together, these results strongly suggest that infiltrating MPs observed in the TZ of patients with GA and in RP patients contribute importantly in the CS degeneration as they produce similar changes in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting subretinal MP accumulation, or as we show IL-1β inhibition, might help preserve CS and high acuity daytime vision in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Donor eyes and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Donor eyes with a known history of AMD and controls were collected through the Minnesota Lions Eye Bank: 9 control maculae from 9 patients (5 men and 4 women; mean age 85 years ± 2.4 SEM) and 15 GA donor maculae from 12 patients (5 men and 7 women; mean age 82.9 years ± 2.2 SEM).

The manuscript has been reviewed by three expert reviewers, and their assessments together with my own, forms the basis of this letter. I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are various specific comments in them that will not be repeated in the summary here.</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. Overall, the experiments appear to be carefully executed. However, there is a general consensus that the data should be more cautiously interpreted and that various experiments that could strengthen (or weaken) a number of the conclusions are feasible.</p><p>We would like to encourage you to resubmit a revised manuscript that addresses the specific issues raised in the reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper focuses on the role of IL-1β secreted by infiltrating mononuclear cells in cone &quot;segment&quot; loss within the atrophy transition zone (TZ) from patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. Immunolabeling of post mortem eyes shows loss of cone segments in the TZ and association with subretinal D14+monocyte infiltration. Using human blood-derived CD14+monocytes in vitro and inflammation-prone <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic>mice in vivo, evidence is presented that monocyte derived IL-1β causes cone segment degeneration. Inhibiting subretinal monocyte accumulation or Il-1β might protect the cone segments and help preserve or restore high acuity vision in AMD.</p><p>The paper is conceptually and translationally important, but would benefit from addressing several limitations.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, cone arrestin is used to visualize cone &quot;segments.&quot; Yet, arrestin translocation with light exposure and redistribution after retinal detachment suggests that arrestin-poor segments might still be present. It would be helpful to also show a phase-contrast image.</p><p>2) The rationale for use of both arrestin (to label cone segments and PNA to label cone segment sheaths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and beyond should be stated explicitly. The use of PNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could also help with the issues raised in point #1.</p><p>3) Does cone &quot;segments&quot; refer to outer segments, inner segments, or both?</p><p>4) The authors &quot;carefully dissected&quot; Bruch's membrane from the photoreceptors in samples from geographic atrophy eyes prior to immunostaining/imaging retinal flat mounts. Was this dissection limited to the atrophic zone and not the nearby transition zone (within 1-200 microns of the atrophic zone)? Such dissection has the potential to strip outer segments from the imaged tissue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper by Sennlaub and colleagues builds on their earlier work showing that blood derived mononuclear cells contribute to the pathology of age related macular degeneration (AMD) and perhaps also to the death of cone photoreceptors in retinitis pigmentosa (RP). This work is of great clinical significance since AMD is the leading cause of blindness in older adults, at least in the developed world, and RP is the leading inherited form of blindness. What is new in this paper is the demonstration that the loss of cone photoreceptor inner and outer segments in the transition zone coincides with the infiltration of CD14+ monocytes in donor eyes from patients with advanced dry AMD. Looking for a mechanism, they turned to retinal explants from Cx3cr1 mutant mice and showed that CD14+ monocytes led to rod cell death (TUNEL positive nuclei) and degradation of cone outer and inner segments. They went on to show that this damage may be caused by the release of IL-1beta from the monocytes.</p><p>The histology in the paper is excellent and their efforts to present the data in a quantitative fashion were also good.</p><p>The authors should address a few issues, however:</p><p>1) It seemed a bit odd to use human monocytes on the mouse explants. In previous work focused on the impact on rod cells, they used mouse monocytic cells. Why not use mouse on mouse for this study? In their earlier work did they observe an impact on cone outer or inner segments?</p><p>2) They used 50 ng/ml of recombinant IL-1beta to damage cone photoreceptors in explants, but they never reported the level of this cytokine produced by the monocytes in their co-culture conditions. They should do this and use an equivalent amount of the recombinant protein.</p><p>3) How does the cone density and the ratio of cones to rods differ between the mouse explants and the atrophic and transitional zones studied in human samples?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>Their statistical analysis was appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Eandi et al. propose that subretinal monocytic phagocytes (MPs) that accumulate in the junctional zone of geographic atrophy secrete IL1b which causes cone segment loss. This group, which has been a leader in forwarding the role of subretinal MPs in AMD, previously showed that MPs contribute to rod loss, and that a subset of MPs are blood derived Monocytes. The concept is intriguing, and if correct, would shed new insights into vision loss in GA due to cone segment loss. A number of methodologic and conceptual concerns are raised by this reviewer.</p><p>The main novel information is that IL1b injures cone segments in the JZ of GA. In its present form, this reviewer does not think that the authors have provided enough data to support this conclusion. To more convincingly prove this point, the authors should provide data identifying the topographical location of IL1b in their human GA samples. The IL1b assessment would be significantly strengthened with a more in depth analysis (see below).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the variable distance of the TZ could bias the morphometric semi-quantification since there is likely a gradient of morphometric severity closer to the AZ. The analysis would be strengthened by standardizing a specific distance from the AZ where measurments are made.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, some methodological concerns are raised: 1) a larger area of the flatmount should be shown since flatmounts can have very heterogeneous distribution of changes; 2) semi-quantification of the number of MPs would greatly enhance the findings for controls, &gt;1000um, TZ, and AZ areas that would support the conclusions; 3) the choice of CD14 labeling makes the interpretation of MPs challenging because the RPE expresses CD14 (Elner et al. Exp Eye Res, 2003). How do the authors know that the labeling is solely attributed to MPs? Confirming with another monocyte marker appears necessary. 4) How do the authors separate MCs from subretinal MPs, especially since activated MCs are more truncated? This is an important conclusion of the manuscript, and thus, has not been proven. 5) In the images, there does not appear to be much difference in the number of MPs in the TZ from AZ. 6) in 2C and 2D, why is there such a paucity of arrestin stained cone cells in the controls?</p><p>While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates that MPs can induce rod apoptosis and cone changes, using 100,000 human macrophages does not seem physiologically relevant. What happens when fewer cells are used, perhaps in the range of what is seen in GA? Why do the authors use human MPs? Wouldn't this be expected to elicit a reaction due to different species? What happens when mouse MPs are used? Why don't the authors use double labeling of PNA and arrestin throughout the figures?</p><p>Quantifying IL-1b mRNA is not sufficient for determining its ultimate impact since it is regulated not only transcriptionally, as the authors have demonstrated, but also post-translationally by the inflammasome. Thus, the authors should provide evidence that the MPs secrete mature IL1b protein. To understand the full impact of IL-1b, further analysis is necessary: 1) It is the ratio of IL-1b/IL18 that is highly relevant because acutely, as in these experiments, IL18 can neutralize some of the pro-inflammatory effects of IL1b. Thus, the authors should demonstrate that IL18 does not change. 2) a dose response effect of IL1b would be interesting to determine any threshold effect, especially since 50 ng/ml is strikingly supraphysiologic. What happens if the IL1b is in a more physiologic range? While not absolutely necessary, providing evidence of inflammasome activation would be a very nice compliment that would drive home this point.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> provides evidence that IL1b is involved in PNA positive shortening through IL1R antagonist treatment. It is important to describe how the area studied was determined since, as mentioned above, there can be tremendous heterogeneity on flatmounts. The authors should provide quantitative data showing no change in the number of monocytes with IL1b inhibition. In their prior work, they showed this effect in their chronic model, and here they only show their acute light tox model. This is a short-coming since they are attempting to extrapolate these data to a chronic disease.</p><p>While the authors mention the possibility of an RPE contribution, they do not provide any studies to support this notion. Thus, in the Discussion, they should more fully acknowledge that they can't rule out RPE cell dysfunction, especially since the RPE is clearly dysmorphic in their JZ GA samples, as a source of rod and cone loss and damage (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16490.009</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper is conceptually and translationally important, but would benefit from addressing several limitations.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, cone arrestin is used to visualize cone &quot;segments.&quot; Yet, arrestin translocation with light exposure and redistribution after retinal detachment suggests that arrestin-poor segments might still be present.

The use of PNA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could also help with the issues raised in point #1.</italic></p><p>We introduced a sentence in the Results section that explains the meaning of the different antibodies, which also relates to the point 3 raised by the reviewer: “We used CD14 immunohistochemistry to visualize MPs, peanut agglutinin (PNA) that stains inner and outer cone segments (but not cone cell bodies), and cone arrestin that stains cones irrespective of the presence of CS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Does cone &quot;segments&quot; refer to outer segments, inner segments, or both?</italic></p><p>PNA, cone opsins, or cone arrestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) all mark both, the inner and outer cone segments. The differentiation of the two in healthy retina can be made morphologically as the inner and outer segment are separated by the cilium (Blanks and Johnson, 1984). In the AZ and TZ of GA patients, where the cellular architecture is disturbed it is often not possible to distinguish a remaining inner segment from the rest of the cone cell body. It is therefore difficult to say to what extend the inner segments remain, which is why we generally referred to cone segments. In the revised version we changed the corresponding paragraph to make this difficulty more clear:</p><p>“In the TZ, close to the margin of the lesion but where RPE was still present, the ONL was irregular, thinned (around 2 nuclei of ONL), and cone and rod morphology was severely altered with the outer segments missing and the inner segments difficult to distinguish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) The authors &quot;carefully dissected&quot; Bruch's membrane from the photoreceptors in samples from geographic atrophy eyes prior to immunostaining/imaging retinal flat mounts. Was this dissection limited to the atrophic zone and not the nearby transition zone (within 1-200 microns of the atrophic zone)? Such dissection has the potential to strip outer segments from the imaged tissue.</italic></p><p>In GA tissues, the retinas of the AZ adhere to Bruchs membrane in the area of RPE defects and needed to be carefully peeled for separation. This is not the case for the TZ, where the retina detaches easily from the underlying RPE, comparable to control retinas. We agree with the reviewer that dissecting the tissues always holds a risk of altering the morphology. However, the loss of CS is also observed in the paraffin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and has previously been described in histology and electron microscopy, which strongly suggests that CS loss is not an artifact (Bird et al., 2014). We changed the text in the wording in the Materials and methods section to make this more clear:</p><p>“In GA tissues, the retinas of the AZ were carefully peeled from the RPE/choroid, as they adhere to Bruchs membrane in the area of RPE defects. This is not the case for the TZ, where the retina detaches easily from the underlying RPE, comparable to control retinas.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It seemed a bit odd to use human monocytes on the mouse explants. In previous work focused on the impact on rod cells, they used mouse monocytic cells. Why not use mouse on mouse for this study?</italic> </p><p>We thought it would be particularly interesting to use human Mo but we agree with the reviewer that interspecies incompatibilities could lead to artifacts, even though a xenograft rejection type of mechanism requires antibodies (hyperacute reaction) and/or NKs, T-lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system (chronic rejection), not present in our 18h co-culture system.</p><p>To evaluate eventual interspecies incompatibilities we performed two sets of experiments: 1.) we quantified cone segments in cocultures of Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>BMMs with mouse retinas and 2.) we cultivated human blood derived Mos with non-human primate (macaque) retinal explants.</p><p>These new results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>In their earlier work did they observe an impact on cone outer or inner segments?</italic> </p><p>Maybe surprisingly, we did very little PNA stains in Cx3cr1-deficient animals.

As we did not notice any differences in cone numbers; we hastily concluded that there was no effect on cones at the time.</p><p><italic>2) They used 50 ng/ml of recombinant IL-1beta to damage cone photoreceptors in explants, but they never reported the level of this cytokine produced by the monocytes in their co-culture conditions. They should do this and use an equivalent amount of the recombinant protein.</italic> </p><p>In these experiment we used IL-1β at a concentration of 50ng/ml, which is in the range of concentration classically used in vitro. The local IL-1β concentration that cones are exposed to in Mo/retina co-cultures is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1β is expected to form around the IL-1β producing Mos. This is the reason why we directly evaluated the effect of locally produced IL-1β using IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) on the co-cultures.</p><p>We introduced two explanatory sentences in the corresponding Results section to better explain this point: “In these experiment IL-1β was used at a concentration of 50ng/ml (in the range of concentration classically used in vitro) but the local IL-1β concentration that cones are exposed to in the co-culture is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1β is expected to form around the IL-1β producing Mos.

It is characterized by an excess of Mos, the lack of underlying RPE, mild rod apoptosis and quite severe CS degeneration occurring in hours rather than days and weeks. However, the pattern of continuous rod (but not cone) apoptosis and CS degeneration over longer time periods would likely result in severe rod cell loss (as they don’t regenerate), little cone loss but CS degeneration intriguingly similar to what is observed in the TZ of GA patients. To make this differences and similarities more clear to the reader, we introduced an additional paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“The co-culture in vitro system, characterized by an excess of Mos, the lack of underlying RPE, mild rod apoptosis and quite severe CS degeneration occurring in hours rather than days and weeks, can however only be a rough approximation of the in vivo situation. However, the pattern of continuous rod (but not cone) apoptosis and CS degeneration over longer time periods would result in severe rod cell loss (as they don’t regenerate), little cone loss but CS degeneration intriguingly similar to what is observed in the TZ of GA patients.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Eandi et al. propose that subretinal monocytic phagocytes (MPs) that accumulate in the junctional zone of geographic atrophy secrete IL1b which causes cone segment loss. This group, which has been a leader in forwarding the role of subretinal MPs in AMD, previously showed that MPs contribute to rod loss, and that a subset of MPs are blood derived Monocytes. The concept is intriguing, and if correct, would shed new insights into vision loss in GA due to cone segment loss. A number of methodologic and conceptual concerns are raised by this reviewer.</italic> </p><p><italic>The main novel information is that IL1b injures cone segments in the JZ of GA. In its present form, this reviewer does not think that the authors have provided enough data to support this conclusion. To more convincingly prove this point, the authors should provide data identifying the topographical location of IL1b in their human GA samples. The IL1b assessment would be significantly strengthened with a more in depth analysis (see below).</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data shows an association of subretinal MPs with CS degeneration in the TZ of AMD and that MPs can induce a similar phenotype in vitro and in vivo, which strongly suggest that subretinal MPs participate in the degenerative changes in GA, but not necessarily that this effect is mediated by IL-1β in GA. Our attempts to detect IL-1β in our human tissue samples, including tonsillitis preparations that served as positive controls, have so far failed to establish a reproducible protocol to study its expression in GA. However, IL-1β has been shown to be strongly expressed in subretinal MPs of choroidal neovascular membranes in wet AMD (Oh et al., 1999) and CS degeneration is also observed adjacent to the fibrovascular membranes in disciform subretinal scars of wet AMD(Curcio et al., 2001). These observations might suggest that an IL-1β-dependent mechanism might exist in the human pathology. We introduced a paragraph in the Discussion to make this point very clear to the reader:</p><p>“Our study clearly demonstrates the association of subretinal MPs with CS degeneration in human samples and that MPs can induce a similar phenotype in vitro and in vivo, which strongly suggest that subretinal MPs participate in the degenerative changes in GA. Further studies of IL-1β expression in human GA samples are needed to implicate this specific cytokine in the degenerative process in the human disease. However, IL-1β has been shown to be strongly expressed in subretinal MPs of choroidal neovascular membranes in wet AMD and CS degeneration is also observed adjacent to the fibrovascular membranes in disciform subretinal scars of wet AMD. These observations might suggest that an IL-1β-dependent mechanism might exist in the human pathology.”</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the variable distance of the TZ could bias the morphometric semi-quantification since there is likely a gradient of morphometric severity closer to the AZ. The analysis would be strengthened by standardizing a specific distance from the AZ where measurments are made.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the TZ is of variable length (200-800μm) in the human sections. This has been previously reported (Bird et al., 2014). In our quantification we actually did exactly what the reviewer is suggesting. We counted photoreceptors in the AZ, in the 200μm of the TZ adjacent to the AZ as all TZs were at least 200μm wide on the sections, and at &gt;1000μm of the AZ, as none of the TZs in our samples exceeded 800μm. This is described in the corresponding Results section:</p><p>“The TZ, characterized by a thinned ONL in the presence of underlying RPE, was of variable length (200-800μm) in our samples similar to previous reports. […]The cone density at a greater than 1000μm distance from the RPE-denuded AZ, was similar between control and GA eyes. In the atrophic zone the number of cone somata was significantly reduced to around half the numbers of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 E</xref>) and was not significantly different in the TZ (0-200μm from the AZ, which is the TZ length invariably found in all donor eyes).”</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, some methodological concerns are raised: 1) a larger area of the flatmount should be shown since flatmounts can have very heterogeneous distribution of changes; 2) semi-quantification of the number of MPs would greatly enhance the findings for controls, &gt;1000um, TZ, and AZ areas that would support the conclusions;</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and mention in the manuscript that the TZ is of variable size (see above). We have previously quantified the number of subretinal IBA1<sup>+</sup> and CCR2<sup>+</sup>MPs on the paraffin sections of the AZ of the GA samples and controls and illustrated their presence in the TZ on paraffin sections (Sennlaub et al., 2013) and flatmounts (IBA1 stain) (Levy et al., 2015)and this is cited in the manuscript. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we describe an association of subretinal MPs with morphological changes in the TZ. We believe that our previous reports of MPs in the TZ, the morphological description of photoreceptor changes in the paraffin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the flatmount immunohistochemistry of both, MPs and photoreceptor changes, clearly demonstrate that subretinal MPs are associated with photoreceptor morphological changes in the TZ.</p><p>Showing larger areas of the flatmounts in the figures is problematic as one cannot discern the CD14+cells or CS anymore. We therefore tried to find a compromise by showing a larger area for the RPE flatmounts to illustrate the infiltration of the TZ by MPs and closer views of the subretinal aspects of the retinal flatmounts to illustrate the morphological changes in photoreceptors and their close relation to subretinal MPs.</p><p><italic>3) the choice of CD14 labeling makes the interpretation of MPs challenging because the RPE expresses CD14 (Elner et al. Exp Eye Res, 2003). How do the authors know that the labeling is solely attributed to MPs? Confirming with another monocyte marker appears necessary.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the RPE also expresses CD14. However the expression level in RPE is greatly inferior compared to Mos (which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Elner et al. (2003) and which our RT-PCR of mRNA from circulating and cultured human monocytes and post-mortem human RPE samples confirm). This difference likely explains why the RPE did not appear CD14-positive in our experimental conditions. We added higher magnification of orthogonal and perpendicular 3D reconstruction pictures of confocal Z-stack micrographs to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> that illustrates the morphology and positioning of the subretinal CD14+cell on the apical side of the RPE that does not appear CD14-positive in our flatmount immunohistochemistry. Additionally, we provide CD14/IBA-1 double labeling on retinal flatmounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), to demonstrate that CD14+ cells are also positive for other MP-markers. The description of these additional results were added to the corresponding Results section.</p><p><italic>4) How do the authors separate MCs from subretinal MPs, especially since activated MCs are more truncated? This is an important conclusion of the manuscript, and thus, has not been proven.</italic> </p><p>We have previously reported that the population of subretinal MPs is in part derived from infiltrating CCR2<sup>+</sup>blood monocytes (Sennlaub et al., 2013) and likely in part from resident MPs. We do not claim that CD14 specifically recognizes infiltrating MPs, evidenced by our results of CD14+MCs in the control retina (2B). We carefully rephrased any sentence that might have given the wrong impression that this was our intent throughout the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) In the images, there does not appear to be much difference in the number of MPs in the TZ from AZ.</italic> </p><p>In the flatmount preparations, some of subretinal MP population will stick to the RPE flatmount, while others stick to the retinal side, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This might depend on individual sample constitution, fixation and other incontrollable factors. We have previously quantified the numbers of MPs in the AZ (Sennlaub et al., 2013) and they seem to be generally more numereous in the AZ than in the TZ. In this manuscript we describe an association of subretinal MPs with morphological changes in the TZ. We believe that our previous reports of MPs in the TZ, the morphological description of photoreceptor changes in the paraffin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the flatmount immunohistochemistry of both, MPs and photoreceptor changes, clearly demonstrate that subretinal MPs are associated with photoreceptor morphological changes in the TZ.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16490.007</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Additional examples of CD14-stained RPE flatmounts</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16490.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16490.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16490-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) in 2C and 2D, why is there such a paucity of arrestin stained cone cells in the controls?</italic> </p><p>All PNA<sup>+</sup>CS also stain positive for cone arrestin.

Please note and we rephrased this in the new manuscript that the co-culture is an in vitro model. We are fully aware that the co-culture in vitro system, is characterized by an excess of Mos. This is the reason why we performed the in vivo experiments, to verify if these changes can be observed with naturally occurring subretinal inflammation and an underlying RPE cell layer.</p><p><italic>Why do the authors use human MPs?

Thus, the authors should provide evidence that the MPs secrete mature IL1b protein.</italic> </p><p>The IL-1beta (IL-1β) gene is transcribed after an inflammatory stimulus (such as toll like receptor {TLR2/4} stimulation) and synthetized as the IL-1β precursor. Activation by a second stimulus, such as the P2RX7 receptor by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can trigger the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and activate caspase-1 that cleaves IL-1β precursor and produces mature, secretable IL-1β (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). Human blood monocytes, that we used in our experiments, constitutively release endogenous ATP, which activates caspase-1 and leads to mature IL-1β after transcriptional induction without a second exogenous stimulus (Netea et al., 2009). Similarly, we showed that mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs) from Cx3cr1-deficient mice, contrary to wildtype BMMs, also constitutively secrete ATP, express increased surface P2RX7 receptor and secrete mature IL-1β after transcriptional stimulation without a second stimulus (Hu et al., 2015). The local IL-1β concentration that cones are exposed to in Mo/retina co-cultures is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1β is expected to form around the IL-1β producing Mos. This is the reason why we directly evaluated the effect of locally produced IL-1β using IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) on the co-cultures.</p><p>In vivo, we previously demonstrated that IL-1β protein is increased after the 4 day acute light-challenge in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> </italic>mice.</p><p>We introduced two explanatory sentences in the corresponding Results section to better explain this point: “In these experiment IL-1β was used at a concentration of 50ng/ml (in the range of concentration classically used in vitro) but the local IL-1β concentration that cones are exposed to in the co-culture is difficult to estimate, as a gradient of IL-1β is expected to form around the IL-1β producing Mos. To directly evaluate the effect of locally produced IL-1β we evaluated the effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) on the co-cultures.”</p><p><italic>To understand the full impact of IL-1b, further analysis is necessary: 1) It is the ratio of IL-1b/IL18 that is highly relevant because acutely, as in these experiments, IL18 can neutralize some of the pro-inflammatory effects of IL1b. Thus, the authors should demonstrate that IL18 does not change.</italic> </p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that IL18 is not induced in hMo in the co-culture.</p><p><italic>2) a dose response effect of IL1b would be interesting to determine any threshold effect, especially since 50 ng/ml is strikingly supraphysiologic. What happens if the IL1b is in a more physiologic range? While not absolutely necessary, providing evidence of inflammasome activation would be a very nice compliment that would drive home this point.</italic></p><p>In this experiment we used IL-1β at a concentration of 50ng/ml, which is in the range of concentration classically used in vitro.

Similarly, we showed that mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs) from Cx3cr1-deficient mice, contrary to wildtype BMMs, also constitutively secrete ATP, express increased surface P2RX7 receptor and secrete mature IL-1β after transcriptional stimulation without a second stimulus (Hu et al., 2015).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> provides evidence that IL1b is involved in PNA positive shortening through IL1R antagonist treatment. It is important to describe how the area studied was determined since, as mentioned above, there can be tremendous heterogeneity on flatmounts.</italic> </p><p>We explain in the Materials and methods section how this quantifications are performed: “Cone outer segment (OS) volumes were quantified using Imaris software (Bitplane) on stacks of confocal images which contain the entire photoreceptor outer and inner segments, of PNA-stained retinal flatmounts. 4 randomly chosen stacks (technical replicates) were taken per experimental retina or retinal explant.”</p><p><italic>The authors should provide quantitative data showing no change in the number of monocytes with IL1b inhibition. In their prior work, they showed this effect in their chronic model, and here they only show their acute light tox model.

Thus, in the Discussion, they should more fully acknowledge that they can't rule out RPE cell dysfunction, especially since the RPE is clearly dysmorphic in their JZ GA samples, as a source of rod and cone loss and damage (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the photoreceptor degeneration in AMD is likely the result of several factors and acknowledge this in the manuscript: “It is not clear why CS degenerate in the TZ, where the RPE is present. The degeneration might be a result of dysfunctional RPE prior to its degeneration, suggested by the observation of hyperfluorescence of the TZ. […] The observation that CS degeneration is also observed in RP patients with rod-gene mutations and unremarkable RPE further argues that a RPE-independent factor might participate in the degeneration.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
