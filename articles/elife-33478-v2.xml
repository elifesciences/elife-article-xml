tuberculous meningitis (TBM) but not disability, which is associated with brain infarction. We hypothesised that aspirin prevents TBM-related brain infarction through its anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and pro-resolution properties. We conducted a randomised controlled trial in HIV-uninfected adults with TBM of daily aspirin 81 mg or 1000 mg, or placebo, added to the first 60 days of anti-tuberculosis drugs and dexamethasone (NCT02237365). The primary safety endpoint was gastro-intestinal or cerebral bleeding by 60 days; the primary efficacy endpoint was new brain infarction confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging or death by 60 days. Secondary endpoints included 8-month survival and neuro-disability; the number of grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse events; and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory lipid mediator profiles. 41 participants were randomised to placebo, 39 to aspirin 81 mg/day, and 40 to aspirin 1000 mg/day between October 2014 and May 2016. TBM was proven microbiologically in 92/120 (76.7%) and baseline brain imaging revealed â¥1 infarct in 40/114 (35.1%) participants. The primary safety outcome occurred in 5/36 (13.9%) given placebo, and in 8/35 (22.9%) and 8/40 (20.0%) given 81 mg and 1000 mg aspirin, respectively (p=0.59). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 11/38 (28.9%) given placebo, 8/36 (22.2%) given aspirin 81 mg, and 6/38 (15.8%) given 1000 mg aspirin (p=0.40). Planned subgroup analysis showed a significant interaction between aspirin treatment effect and diagnostic category (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> = 0.01) and suggested a potential reduction in new infarcts and deaths by day 60 in the aspirin treated participants with microbiologically confirmed TBM (11/32 (34.4%) events in placebo vs. 4/27 (14.8%) in aspirin 81 mg vs. 3/28 (10.7%) in aspirin 1000 mg; p=0.06). CSF analysis demonstrated aspirin dose-dependent inhibition of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> and upregulation of pro-resolving CSF protectins. The addition of aspirin to dexamethasone may improve outcomes from TBM and warrants investigation in a large phase 3 trial.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33478.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The deadliest form of tuberculosis is tuberculosis meningitis (TBM), which causes inflammation in the brain. Even with the best treatment available, about half of patients with TBM become disabled or die, often because they have a stroke. Strokes are caused by blood clots or other blockages in blood vessels in the brain. Aspirin is known to prevent blood clots and helps reduce inflammation. Some scientists wonder if it might help patients with TBM by preventing blockages in blood vessels.</p><p>Now, Nguyen et al. show that adding aspirin to existing TBM treatments may reduce strokes in some patients. In the experiments, 120 patients with TBM were randomly assigned to receive a low dose of aspirin (81 mg/day), a high dose of aspirin (1000mg/day), or an identical tablet that contained no medication. All the patients also took the anti-tuberculosis drugs and steroids usually used to treat the condition. Both doses of aspirin appeared to be safe. Patients who received aspirin were less likely to have a stroke or die in the first two months of treatment than patients who received the fake pill. But the difference was so small it could have been caused by chance.</p><p>In the 92 patients with clear evidence of tuberculosis bacteria in their brains, the benefit of aspirin was larger and unlikely to be due to chance. The benefit was greatest for those who received the higher dose of aspirin, only 10.7% of these patients died or had a stroke, compared with 14.8% of those who received a low dose of aspirin, or 34% of those who received the fake pill. Next, Nguyen et al. looked at brain fluid taken from the TBM patients before and after they received the aspirin or fake medication. The experiments showed that patients treated with high dose aspirin had much lower levels of a clot-promoting substance called thromboxane A2 and more anti-inflammatory molecules.</p><p>Larger studies are needed in children and adults to confirm that aspirin helps prevent strokes or death in patients with TBM. Studies are also needed on patients who have both TBM and HIV infections. But if more studies show aspirin is safe and effective, adding this medication to TBM treatment may be an inexpensive way to prevent death or disability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculous meningitis</kwd><kwd>aspirin</kwd><kwd>infarction</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>677542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalli</surname><given-names>Jesmond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>St Bartholomews Charity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MGU0343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalli</surname><given-names>Jesmond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110179/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thwaites</surname><given-names>Guy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106680/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thwaites</surname><given-names>Guy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adjunctive aspirin may reduce new brain infarcts and deaths in the first 60 days of treatment for HIV-uninfected adults with tuberculous meningitis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>New host-directed therapies are urgently required for all forms of tuberculosis, but especially for tuberculous meningitis (TBM), the most lethal form of the disease, which kills or disables around half of sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Thwaites, 2013</xref>). Therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes can be broadly divided into those directed against the bacteria and their enhanced killing, and those directed at the host and the control of the inflammatory response. To date, attempts to optimise bacteria-directed anti-tuberculosis regimens have not been shown to clearly benefit patients with TBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ruslami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heemskerk et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, host-directed therapy with adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids has been shown to reduce mortality from TBM, although without reduced disability amongst survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Prasad et al., 2016</xref>). There is, therefore, an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic strategies that may prevent the long-term neurological sequelae of TBM and complement the short-term survival benefits of dexamethasone.</p><p>Cerebral infarction is the commonest cause of irreversible neurological injury from TBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lammie et al., 2009</xref>). TBM-related infarcts are typically located in the territories of the proximal middle cerebral artery and the medial lenticulostriate and thalamoperforating vessels, where the basal meningeal inflammatory exudate is most intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lammie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hektoen, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Misra et al., 2011</xref>). Their pathogenesis remains controversial, in particular the role of vessel thrombosis. Some autopsy studies have either failed to find arterial thrombosis associated with infarcts, or found it to be uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doniach, 1949</xref>); whereas others have reported that thrombosis is common, especially when associated with tuberculous vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poltera, 1977</xref>). The limited available evidence suggests that TBM-related infarcts are caused by a combination of vasospasm, intimal proliferation, and thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lammie et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Aspirin acts by irreversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and the production of prostanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vane, 1971</xref>). Low dose aspirin (75â150 mg) prevents ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Richman and Owens, 2017</xref>) and higher dose aspirin (up to four grams daily) is used for the treatment of some inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatic fever) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cilliers et al., 2015</xref>). Its anti-inflammatory effects are thought to occur at dosesÂ &gt;600 mg daily, through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (e.g. PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2Î±</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub>) and the unstable prostanoid, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botting, 2010</xref>). Low dose aspirin causes less inhibition of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, but causes clinically significant inhibition of TXA<sub>2</sub> and platelet aggregation. Until recently, the inhibitory effect on platelets and thrombus formation was thought to explain aspirinâs well-documented reduction in the risk of death from stroke and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Raju et al., 2011</xref>). However, these effects may be augmented by aspirinâs ability to trigger the production of 15-epi-lipoxins, 17R-resolvins and protectins, molecules that alongside the recently discovered maresins actively promote the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spite and Serhan, 2010</xref>). The âpro-resolutionâ properties of aspirin are not shared with any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), or corticosteroids. It represents a potentially unique mode of action by which aspirin, alongside the prevention of thrombosis, might prevent infarctions and speed resolution of intra-cerebral inflammation and improve outcomes from TBM. Furthermore, there are intriguing data from murine models of tuberculosis which suggest aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may enhance <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vilaplana et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two previous trials of adjunctive aspirin for TBM have been reported. The first randomised 118 Indian adults with TBM to standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, with or without aspirin (150 mg daily) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Misra et al., 2010</xref>). By 3 months, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proven infarction occurred in 13 (43%) in the placebo arm and 8 (24%) in the aspirin group (p=0.18). Aspirin was associated with a reduction in mortality (43% versus 22%, p=0.02) without a significant increase in adverse events. The results are hard to interpret, however, because of the variable use of prednisolone between the treatment arms. Participants who received prednisolone and aspirin appeared to benefit the most. The second trial randomised 146 South African children with TBM to standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy plus placebo (nÂ =Â 50), low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) (nÂ =Â 47), or high-dose aspirin (100 mg/kg/day) (nÂ =Â 49) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schoeman et al., 2011</xref>). Aspirin had no significant impact on survival, motor or cognitive outcomes.</p><p>We hypothesised that aspirin prevents TBM-related brain infarction by its anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and pro-resolution effects. We chose to investigate two aspirin doses: a low dose (81 mg/day) with anti-thrombotic but minimal anti-inflammatory activity; and a higher dose (1000 mg/day) with both anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activity. Our primary objective was to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of 81 mg and 1000 mg aspirin when added to dexamethasone for the first 60 days of TBM treatment. Our secondary objective was to investigate the potential mechanisms of actions of the two aspirin doses by examining the profiles of lipid mediators, including the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and aspirin triggered pro-resolving mediators, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between October 2014 and May 2016, 192 patients were assessed for eligibility and 120 were randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>): 41 received placebo, 39 received aspirin 81 mg/day, and 40 received aspirin 1000 mg/day.

We conducted a phase two randomised controlled trial with the aim of showing the safety and potential efficacy of either low (81 mg/day) or higher (1000 mg/day) dose aspirin when added to anti-tuberculosis drugs and dexamethasone for the treatment of HIV-uninfected adults with TBM. We found that aspirin was not associated with a significant increase in grade 3 or four adverse events. In both the ITT and the per-protocol population, the observed risk of death or new brain infarction by day 60 was lower in the aspirin arms compared to placebo, although this was not statistically significant. Planned sub-group analyses, however, suggested that aspirin 1000 mg may benefit those with microbiologically confirmed TBM. This finding was supported by an analysis of CSF lipid mediators of inflammation, which demonstrated aspirin 1000 mg was associated with significant inhibition of pro-thrombotic TXA<sub>2</sub> and upregulation of pro-resolution protectins.</p><p>The important characteristics of the trial participants, which influences the generalisability of the findings, were that they were HIV-uninfected, had relatively mild disease (87.5% MRC grade I or II), a high proportion (35.1%) had brain infarcts evident at baseline, and most (76.7%) had a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis of TBM. The high proportion of microbiologically confirmed disease is especially relevant, as many centres report much lower proportions (typically 20â50%). The characteristics of populations of suspected but unconfirmed case of TBM may vary substantially between centres and influence treatment effects. In addition, all participants were treated with adjunctive dexamethasone, which is known to reduce deaths from TBM in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thwaites et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Combining dexamethasone with aspirin did not significantly increase gastro-intestinal bleeding of any severity, or any other category of grade 3 or four adverse event. There was a non-significant increase in non-severe (grade 1 or 2) gastro-intestinal bleeding events (mostly small volumes of digested blood aspirated from nasogastric tubes) in the aspirin-treated participants and in all these cases the study drug was stopped immediately. A larger trial is needed to determine whether aspirin truly increases these events and to assess their clinical significance. However, as the risk of severe gastric bleeding appears to be very low, the future management of minor bleeding events in aspirin-treated patients could be less conservative, especially as the per-protocol analysis suggested participants who receivedÂ &gt;30 days of aspirin may benefit more than those who stopped aspirin earlier.</p><p>Our findings are similar to the previous trial of aspirin (150 mg/day) for adults with TBM conducted in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Misra et al., 2010</xref>), which reported aspirin in combination with prednisolone was associated with a reduction in brain infarcts (22% versus 55% in controls; p=0.08) and death (13% verus 14% in controls; p=0.05). Treatment with aspirin without prednisolone was not associated with improved outcomes. In both the Indian trial and the trial conducted in South African children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schoeman et al., 2011</xref>), which included a high dose (100 mg/kg/day) arm, the use of aspirin was not associated with increased adverse events. In particular, aspirin did not appear to increase the risk of gastro-intestinal bleeding in either study. If these data are taken together with the results of the current study, they strongly suggest aspirin at doses ranging from 81 mg to 1000 mg per day can be safely added to anti-tuberculosis and corticosteroid therapy. Determining which dose is likely to be most effective is difficult, but our findings suggest that higher doses (1000 mg/day or equivalent in children) are likely to more effective.</p><p>The strength of our trial is that it addressed both the potential clinical role of aspirin and its mechanism of action by serial brain imaging and analysis of a panel of 71 lipid mediators, their precursors, pathway markers and further metabolites in the CSF. There are, however, some important limitations. First, assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint required participants to be well enough to have an MRI at baseline and day 60. Three screened patients were judged too unwell to have baseline imaging and enter the trial, and five participants were too unwell for imaging at day 60. Therefore, our findings may not be generalisable to those with very severe disease at baseline.</p><p>The trial was not powered to show an impact on longer term survival or neurodisability and therefore does not provide definitive, practice-changing evidence that adjunctive aspirin improves outcomes in all adults with TBM. However, the findings support the hypothesis that aspirin has effects on tuberculosis-associated neuro-inflammation that are independent of dexamethasone and may lead to additional improvements in clinical outcomes. The clinical findings need to be interpreted cautiously, but the planned sub-group analysis suggested a clinical benefit of aspirin in those with microbiologically confirmed disease, especially at 1000 mg. This potential clinical effect is supported by the CSF analysis, which showed dose-dependent inhibition of TXA<sub>2</sub> by aspirin, modest inhibition of prostaglandins, and the upregulation of potentially protective protectins. The serial brain images also support the assertion that aspirinâs benefit may be driven by the upregulation of these pro-resolving molecules: 60% of infarcts seen at baseline had resolved by day 60 in the aspirin 1000 mg group compared with 14.2% in the aspirin 81 mg group and 42.9% in the placebo group.</p><p>In summary, this phase two randomised placebo-controlled trial suggests that daily aspirin 81 mg or 1000 mg can be given safely with dexamethasone and anti-tuberculosis drugs for the treatment of HIV-uninfected adults with TBM. The trial also provides new data that indicate aspirin induces dose-dependent inhibition of TXA<sub>2</sub> and upregulation of protectins within the central nervous system that may reduce the incidence and promote the resolution of TBM-associated brain infarcts and inflammation and thereby improve outcome. These findings provide strong support for the conduct of a large phase 3 trial of adjunctive aspirin for TBM, but may also have relevance for the treatment of other forms of tuberculosis, adding to the growing evidence that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be useful novel adjunctive agents in tuberculosis treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kroesen et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a parallel group, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial in HIV-uninfected adults with TBM to assess the safety and efficacy of either 81 mg or 1000 mg aspirin daily for the first 60 days of treatment with standard anti-tuberculosis drugs and dexamethasone (full study protocol provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">supplementary file 7</xref>).

Participant numbers were stratified and assigned sequentially at randomisation, with each participant receiving a pre-prepared numbered identical package of blinded study drugs. Treatment allocation was concealed by each treatment pack containing two bottles of study treatment: one containing 81 mg tablets of identical aspirin or placebo, the second containing identical 500 mg tablets of aspirin or placebo. Trial participants and the entire clinical and study team were blind to the treatment allocation for the duration of the trial. For 60 days, participants took one 81 mg tablet/placebo and two 500 mg tablets/placebo (taken every 12 hr), according to their randomised allocated treatment. Participants unable to swallow were given crushed tablets (which did not reveal the allocation) via a nasogastric tube at the same doses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Procedures</title><p>Anti-tuberculosis treatment followed Vietnamâs tuberculosis treatment guidelines, consisting of oral isoniazid (5 mg/kg/day; maximum 300 mg/day), rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day), pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg/day; maximum 2 g/day) and ethambutol (20 mg/kg/day; maximum 1.2 g/day) and intramuscular streptomycin (20 mg/kg/day; maximum 1 g/day) for 3 months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid at the same doses for a further 6 months. All patients received adjunctive dexamethasone for the first 6 to 8 weeks of treatment as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thwaites et al., 2004</xref>) and oral ranitidine (300 mg at night). For patients infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resistant to isoniazid, the treatment was adjusted according to local guidelines and the susceptibility of the organism.</p><p>Lumbar puncture was performed before the start of treatment and on days 30 and 60 as per normal clinical care. All CSF specimens were stained and cultured by standard methods for pyogenic bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria and tested by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, USA). Isolates of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> were tested for susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin by mycobacterial growth indicator tube method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardito et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Brain MRI (1.5 tesla; 64 slices) with T1 volume pre and post contrast, T2, FLAIR, gradient echo and DWI sequences was acquiredÂ Â±5 days from randomisation and then at day 60 (Â±10 days) and day 240 (Â±30 days). All images were separately interpreted by two independent neuroradiologists (one consultant and one fellow) blind to the treatment allocation, who then determined a consensus opinion.</p><p>Clinical progress and neurological and drug-related adverse events were assessed daily until discharge from hospital. After discharge, monthly visits were scheduled for clinical evaluation and laboratory monitoring until 8 months, when a final clinical assessment was made. All participants were genotyped for leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), which has been shown to influence TBM pathophysiology and outcome, using previously described methods to investigate its influence on CSF inflammation and aspirin effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thuong et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of clinically significant upper gastro-intestinal bleeding and any cerebral bleeding confirmed by brain imaging by 60 days from randomisation.

These were kept at â20Â°C for 45 min to allow for protein precipitation and lipid mediators were extracted using C-18 based Solid Phase Extraction as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Methyl formate fractions were brought to dryness using a TurboVap LP (Biotage) and products suspended in water-methanol (80:20 vol:vol) for Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based profiling. A Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC and a Shimadzu SIL- 20AC autoinjector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), paired with a QTrap 5500 (ABSciex, Warrington, UK) were utilised and operated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colas et al., 2014</xref>). To monitor each lipid mediator and deuterium labelled internal standard, a Multiple Reaction Monitoring method was developed using parent ions and characteristic diagnostic ion fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). This was coupled to an Information Dependent Acquisition and an Enhanced Product Ion scan. Identification criteria included matching retention time to synthetic standards and at least six diagnostic ions in the MS-MS spectrum for each molecule. Calibration curves were obtained for each molecule using authentic compound mixtures and deuterium labelled lipid mediator at 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 pg.

Our objective was to provide estimates of safety and efficacy, alongside potential mechanisms of action, which would inform the design and execution of a larger phase III trial; we did not expect to show clinically definitive efficacy in this phase two trial. We assumed a risk of new MRI-proven brain infarction or death within 60 days of approximately 40% in the control arm. Based on the results of the trial performed by Misra et al, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Misra et al., 2010</xref>) we assumed that 81 mg aspirin daily may reduce this risk to 20% and the risk in the 1000 mg aspirin daily arm to between 20â40%. Given these estimates our three arm trial would have approximately 75% power to detect such an effect at the one-sided 10% significance level (i.e. to generate âmild evidenceâ) and approximately 50% power to detect it at the conventional one-sided 2.5% significance level.</p><p>Cerebral bleeding associated with TBM is extremely rare (estimated atÂ &lt;0.01% of all patients), but it is possible it may be more common in those treated with aspirin. It was therefore included in the primary assessment of safety. The proportion of HIV-uninfected patients with clinically significant gastro-intestinal bleeding from our most recent trial of hyper-intensive anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy in Vietnam was about 1% (3/278) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heemskerk et al., 2016</xref>). Assuming this same risk of bleeding in the aspirin arms, the probability that the <italic>upper</italic> limit of the 95% confidence interval remains below 12.9% is more than 92%. If the risk of bleeding is 10% in one of the aspirin arms, the probability that the <italic>lower</italic> limit of the 95% confidence interval remains above 2.5% is 78%.</p><p>Statistical analysis followed the protocol and a predefined statistical analysis plan. The main population for all analyses was the intention-to treat population (ITT), which included all randomized participants, analysed according to the randomized treatment arm. A per-protocol population was defined by excluding participants with a confirmed alternative diagnosis to TBM; those with confirmed MDR-TBM; and those who receivedÂ &lt;30 days of study drug for reasons other than death.</p><p>The risk of clinically significant upper-gastro-intestinal bleeding and image-proven cerebral bleeding by 60 days were summarized as numbers and proportion in each group together with two-sided 95% confidence intervals for risk differences between groups calculated by the Wilson score method. Comparison between the three arms was based on the chi-square test of independence. The primary efficacy endpoint of new MRI-proven brain infarction or death by 60 days was analysed in the same way. For the secondary endpoint, a linear-byâlinear trend test (also called CochranâArmitage test for trend) was performed to assess the association between disability score and the three arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agresti, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint were conducted using logistic regression in pre-defined subgroups according to TBM grade (I, II, or III); previous tuberculosis treatment; TBM diagnostic category (definite versus probable/possible); drug resistance (MDR-TB, rifampicin mono-resistance, isoniazid resistance (with or without streptomycin resistance), no or other resistance); and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) genotype (CC, CT, TT). We fitted a logistic regression model using Firthâs correction to the likelihood because there were subgroups without events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Firth, 1993</xref>). Heterogeneity of the treatment effect across sub-groups was tested via a likelihood ratio test for the interaction term between treatment and the grouping variable in a logistic regression model.</p><p>To assess differences of lipid mediators between the different treatment groups partial least squares discriminant analysis was conducted using SIMCA 13.0.3 software (Umetrics, San Jose, CA), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colas et al., 2014</xref>) where mediators displaying a Variable Importance in Projection scores greater than one were taken as displaying significant correlation with the treatment group. This parameter estimates the importance of a variable in the Partial Least Squares projections with scores greater than one indicating that a specific variable is important in a given model.</p><p>No imputation of missing data was performed and the threshold for assuming statistical significance was p&lt;0.05 for all analyses. For the analysis of gastro-intestinal/cerebral bleeding by day 60, patients lost to follow-up or dead before day 60 (without prior bleeding) were excluded from the analysis to avoid under estimating the true proportion of bleeding in the aspirin groups. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint excluded patients with missing baseline or follow-up MRI scans (except for prior death).

Your article has been reviewed by five peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Madhukar Pai, a Reviewing Editor, and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor.

Given the poor outcomes in this group additional interventions are urgently needed for TBM. This is a well conducted RCT presenting important information which may inform future phase 3 trials. The modest conclusion of the authors is warranted: that aspirin is likely to be safe, but a larger phase 3 trial should be conducted to fully assess efficacy. In summary, this paper provides helpful data is an important area and paves the way for (and arguably mandates) a larger efficacy trial.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) No CONSORT checklist has been provided, and, for instance, the Abstract does not follow the structure recommended by CONSORT. Kindly make sure the revision follows the CONSORT format and also provide the checklist.</p><p>2) One method issue I have is that the method of allocation concealment was not mentioned in the Materials and methods section. The second is that the sample size calculation was over ambitious and has led to a small sample size and the results of this trial are now affected significantly by Î² error. This affects both the safety outcome of bleeding (which was more in both aspirin arms) as well as efficacy that was better in the aspirin arms. This needs to be reflected in their Discussion. With the small sample and multiple subgroup comparisons the authors need to exercise caution in the interpretation of their results. Given these concerns I feel the final conclusions should reflect <italic>no</italic> difference in primary safety or efficacy outcomes with possibility of increased harms (bleeding) as well as benefit, which needs a larger trial.</p><p>3) The section on sample size calculation is a bit difficult to understand. I suggest that the authors reframe this section. Here is a template that they may use to help the audience understand the trial.</p><p>We calculated that with a sample size of at least ---- patients, the trial would have 80% power to detect a ----percentage-point lower risk of death among patients receiving aspirin treatment than among those receiving the standard treatment (---% vs. ---%, corresponding to a target hazard ratio of ---) at a two-sided 5% significance level.</p><p>4) The main limitation is that the trial is small and underpowered even for the primary outcomes. This is a shame, as the results are promising and a slightly larger study might have shown more convincing results. The section describing the sample size is hard to follow, and would benefit from text describing more clearly what differences the study was designed to show, and to expand more on the 'clinical and feasibility considerations' that limited the sample size. Given the small sample size, and the many hypothesis tests conducted, and the resulting multiplicity considerations, the authors need to be careful not to over-state the results. Language needs to be more consistent as to what is considered evidence of a difference and what is just an observed statistically non-significant difference. There are places in the text where a difference is declared even though the p-value is greater than the common (nominal) cut-off of 0.05, e.g. subsection âPrimary outcomesâ, third paragraph (p=0.18) and subsection âSecondary outcomes and adverse eventsâ, last paragraph (p=0.11). The sample size calculations talk about 'mild evidence' with a 10% one-sided significance level. If this is the threshold for evidence that the authors are using, this should be clearly stated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Although pre-planned, there were 5 different sub-group analyses, and the authors found one sub-group that showed a significant difference, albeit p=0.06. The authors should comment on the issues regarding multiplicity that arise and how this impacts on the interpretation of this results. There is a clear biological rationale for this particular sub-group so the results are compelling nevertheless.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33478.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) No CONSORT checklist has been provided, and, for instance, the Abstract does not follow the structure recommended by CONSORT.

This was a planned phase II trial which aimed to demonstrate the potential safety and efficacy of adjunctive aspirin at two different doses. As we indicate in the Introduction and the Materials and methods, there are almost no previous high-quality data upon which to construct a sample size. As acknowledged by the summary comments of the editors, and other reviewers, we have been appropriately cautious with our conclusion. We state in the Discussion that our data should not be viewed as definitive (from the perspective of clinical practice); rather that the results provide the necessary supportive data to conduct a larger phase III study. We believe our conclusions are appropriately measured. Indeed, our final sentence in the Discussion states, âThese findings provide strong support for the conduct of a large phase 3 trial of adjunctive aspirin for TBMâ¦â, which is as the reviewer suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The section on sample size calculation is a bit difficult to understand.

Given we conducted a 3-arm phase II trial that aimed to demonstrate both safety and potential efficacy, with little prior data on which to base the sample size calculation, such a simple description is not really possible. However, we completely accept that the current description is too long and hard to follow. Therefore, we have revised the sample size section completely (subsection âStatistical analysisâ) and aimed to provide a more easily comprehensible description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The main limitation is that the trial is small and underpowered even for the primary outcomes.

We powered the trial with very limited available data to indicate likely safety or effect size. Plausibly, both the incidence of serious gastro-intestinal bleeding and new brain infarction in those who received aspirin could have been respectively higher and lower than actually occurred. But the objective of the trial was to provide much better estimates of both outcomes (and by implication, safety and efficacy), together with an analysis aspirinâs possible biological mechanism, such that the results would provide strong support for a larger and accurately powered phase 3 trial. We believe we have achieved this objective.</p><p>As discussed above, we have clarified the section on sample size.</p><p>With respect to calling âstatistical significanceâ, we have made sure the text is clear that we use the nominal P&lt;0.05 as the definition of significance.

However, we make it clear that the sub-groups were pre-planned and were not the result of an undisclosed trawl through multiple exploratory analyses. In addition, as acknowledged by the reviewer, each of the planned sub-groups had clear biological/clinical rationale and are therefore both justifiable and (as the reviewer agrees) âcompellingâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
