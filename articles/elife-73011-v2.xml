establishing chronic infection (i.e., bradyzoites). Calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling tightly regulates the lytic cycle of tachyzoites by controlling microneme secretion and motility to drive egress and cell invasion. However, the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in bradyzoites remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are highly restricted in bradyzoites and that they fail to egress in response to agonists. Development of dual-reporter parasites revealed dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and minimal microneme secretion by bradyzoites induced in vitro or harvested from infected mice and tested ex vivo. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging demonstrated lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> basal levels, reduced magnitude, and slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites stimulated with agonists. Diminished responses in bradyzoites were associated with downregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases involved in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acidocalcisomes. Once liberated from cysts by trypsin digestion, bradyzoites incubated in glucose plus Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly restored their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP stores, leading to enhanced gliding. Collectively, our findings indicate that intracellular bradyzoites exhibit dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and lower energy levels that restrict egress, and yet upon release they rapidly respond to changes in the environment to regain motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tissue cyst</kwd><kwd>chronic infection</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>dormancy</kwd><kwd>reactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI034036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sibley</surname><given-names>L David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI128356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno</surname><given-names>Silvia NJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI143857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sibley</surname><given-names>L David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live-cell imaging and biochemical studies reveal that bradyzoites exhibit reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, dampened calcium responses, and reduced energy levels consistent with their quiescent sate, but that they rapidly respond to environmental conditions to emerge from dormancy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite, capable of infecting nearly all warm-blooded animals and frequently causing human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey, 2010</xref>). The ingestion of tissue cysts in undercooked meat or shed oocysts by infected cats are the major transmission routes of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Dubey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones and Dubey, 2010</xref>). Following oral ingestion of bradyzoites within tissue cysts, or sporozoites within oocysts, the parasite migrates across the intestinal epithelial barrier and disseminates throughout the body as the actively proliferating tachyzoite form that infects many cell types but primarily traffics in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drewry and Sibley, 2019</xref>). In response to immune pressure, the parasite differentiates to asynchronously growing bradyzoites within cysts that can persist as chronic infections in muscle and brain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayoral et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Tachyzoites are adapted for rapid proliferation and dissemination due to an active lytic cycle that is controlled at numerous stages by intracellular calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>). Artificially elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> using ionophores triggers secretion of microneme proteins, which are needed for substrate and cell attachment, and hence critical for both gliding motility and cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carruthers and Sibley, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carruthers et al., 1999c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wetzel et al., 2004</xref>). Increase of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from internal stores is sufficient to trigger microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovett et al., 2002</xref>), and necessary for host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vieira and Moreno, 2000</xref>), although these processes are also enhanced by the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pace et al., 2014</xref>). Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> also precede egress and drive secretion of perforin-like protein 1 (PLP1) from microneme to facilitate rupture of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) followed by egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). Calcium signaling is initiated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-generating guanylate cyclase (GC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Sibley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) that activates parasite plasma membrane-associated protein kinase G (PKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2017</xref>), stimulating the production of inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) by phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and leading to subsequent release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> also implicate PKG in directly controlling Ca<sup>2+</sup> through interaction with a multimembrane spanning protein that may function as a channel that mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>). In turn, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive proteins including Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases such as CDPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>) and CDPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>), C2 domain-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tagoe et al., 2021</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding orthologues of calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 2017</xref>), which are required for invasion and egress by tachyzoites. Following invasion, protein kinase A catalytic domain 1 (PKAc1) dampens cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by suppressing cGMP signaling and reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, the lytic life cycle of tachyzoites is orchestrated spatially and temporally by controlling levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cyclic nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> has evolved elaborate mechanism to control intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through the concerted action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, transporters, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps expressed at the PM and intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hortua Triana et al., 2018</xref>). Orthologues to voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and plasma membrane type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases (PMCAs) are predicted to be present in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and likely involved in regulating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagamune and Sibley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prole et al., 2011</xref>). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important storage site from which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released to stimulate motility and egress of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>). SERCA-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase is the known mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the ER, and its activity, which is inhibited by thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thastrup et al., 1990</xref>), leads to accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the ER activates microneme secretion and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagamune et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno and Zhong, 1996</xref>). TgA1 a plasma membrane type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase, transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the acidocalcisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2004</xref>), which likely provides a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink albeit one that may not be as readily mobilizable as the ER. In addition to internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, intracellular and extracellular <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites are capable of taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> from host cells and the extracellular environment, respectively, to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vella et al., 2021</xref>). A variety of fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators that have been developed to directly image Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in live cells include Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive dyes and genetically encoded indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vella et al., 2020</xref>). Indicators like Fluo-4/AM, and related derivatives, have been previously used to monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in extracellular parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagamune et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lovett and Sibley, 2003</xref>). Genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as GCaMP5, GCaMP6f, and GCaMP7 have also been used to visualize dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals of both intracellular and extracellular tachyzoites with high resolution and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges-Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to tachyzoites, little is known about the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in control of microneme secretion, gliding motility, and egress by bradyzoites. Although bradyzoites divide asynchronously, they undergo growth, expansion, and sequential rounds of tissue cyst formation and rupture that maintain chronic infection in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watts et al., 2015</xref>). Histological studies in animal models support a model of periodic cyst rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson et al., 1989</xref>), releasing bradyzoites that reinvade new host cells to generate secondary daughter cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frenkel and Escajadillo, 1987</xref>), or transition back to actively replicating tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofflin et al., 1987</xref>). Development of bradyzoites has been studied in vitro using systems that induce development due to stress induced by alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soete et al., 1993</xref>) or in cell lines where development occurs spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Swierzy and Lüder, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halonen et al., 1996</xref>). Although numerous studies have focused on the determinants that control stage conversion between tachyzoites and bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 2014</xref>), few studies focus on the signaling pathways that control the bradyzoite lytic cycle.</p><p>In the present study, we combined stage-specific bradyzoite fluorescent reporters with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging probes to explore Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, microneme secretion, motility, and egress by bradyzoites. Our findings indicate that bradyzoites exhibit dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, reduced microneme secretion, and minimal egress in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging demonstrated lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> basal levels and significantly lower stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ER and acidocalcisome in bradyzoites, associated with reduced expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases responsible for maintaining intracellular stores. Incubation of extracellular bradyzoites in Ca<sup>2+</sup> plus glucose leads to rapid recovery of both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP levels and restored motility. Collectively, our findings support a dampened lytic cycle in bradyzoites, arising from diminished Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and lowered energy stores, and that upon release they exhibit rapid metabolic responsiveness to environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling triggers inefficient egress by bradyzoites</title><p>To define egress by bradyzoites, we induced the differentiation of tachyzoites to bradyzoites by culture in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells at alkaline pH (8.2) for 7 days. We treated both tachyzoite cultures and in vitro-differentiated cysts with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 to trigger egress from parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) or bradyzoite cysts, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or time-lapse video microscopy. We observed that A23187 induced complete egress of tachyzoites from disrupted PVs while only a few bradyzoites were released from cysts that remained largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result was also confirmed by time-lapse video microscopy using the ME49 BAG1-mCherry strain either grown as tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>) or bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). We quantified the percentage of tachyzoites or bradyzoites that were released during egress in response to A23187 or the agonist zaprinast, which is a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor that activates PKG-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, leading to egress. In contrast to tachyzoites, we found significantly lower egress rate of bradyzoites in response to A23817 or zaprinast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To examine the behavior of released parasites, we determined the maximum egress distance that parasites moved away from the original vacuole or cyst following egress. Tachyzoites migrated much further than bradyzoites after induced egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Bradyzoites also moved more slowly than tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as shown by quantification of their trajectories from time-lapse video microscopy images. Taken together, these findings indicate that egress by bradyzoites in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore or zaprinast is incomplete and restricted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vitro-induced bradyzoites show limited egress in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Egress of tachyzoites and bradyzoites in response to A23187 (2 μM) for 15 min.

To examine the reason for inefficient egress by bradyzoites, we monitored microneme secretion by quantitative secretion analysis of MIC2 fused with <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (Gluc). The <italic>MIC2-Gluc</italic> reporter was randomly integrated into the genome of the BAG1-mCherry strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). IFA revealed that MIC2-Gluc was expressed and localized to the apical pole in tachyzoites and bradyzoites induced for 7 days at pH 8.2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also confirmed the expression of MIC2-GLuc and MIC2-associated protein M2AP, which forms a protein complex with MIC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huynh et al., 2003</xref>), by western blotting. Although both proteins were readily detectable, they were expressed at lower levels in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, IFA demonstrated that MIC2 and M2AP were co-localized to the apical region in bradyzoites, consistent with being located in micronemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, to enrich highly purified MIC2-GLuc reporter parasites, BAG1-mCherry MIC2-GLuc strain tachyzoites, and bradyzoites liberated from cysts produced by cultivation for 7 days at pH 8.2 in vitro, were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). FACS-sorted tachyzoites and bradyzoites were treated with zaprinast or ionomycin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore that induces release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeler et al., 1979</xref>). Bradyzoites secreted much less MIC2-Gluc protein compared to tachyzoites in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists, zaprinast and ionomycin, as shown by <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase assays performed on excretory-secretory antigen (ESA) fractions collected following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To further investigate the process of microneme secretion by bradyzoites, we randomly integrated an mCherry secretion reporter, based on the signal peptide sequence of ferredoxin-NADP(+)-reductase (FNR-mCherry), into the genome of BAG1-EGFP parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The FNR-mCherry reporter is an improved version of DsRed reporter that is secreted constitutively and released from the PV surrounding tachyzoites following the discharge of PLP1 in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). Then, we monitored the permeabilization of PV membrane surrounding either tachyzoite vacuoles or in vitro-differentiated bradyzoites after stimulation with A23187 based on the diffusion of FNR-mCherry using time-lapse fluorescence video microscopy. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>), we observed that A23187 stimulated fast leakage of FNR-mCherry from the PV surrounding tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top panel, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).

As a control to confirm that the FNR-mCherry was indeed secreted into the lumen of the cyst matrix, we treated cysts with trypsin to release bradyzoites. Once the cyst wall was digested, the FNR-mCherry dissipated rapidly, or was digested, confirming that it was present in the matrix of the cyst and not trapped in the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom panel, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). These data were also confirmed by plotting FNR-mCherry fluorescence intensity changes vs. time for tachyzoites vs. intact or trypsin-treated cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Using this system, both tachyzoites and bradyzoites express the same levels of GCaMP6f, while only bradyzoites express mCherry, allowing specific monitoring of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in both stages. To confirm the differentiation stage of bradyzoites expressing this dual reporter, we monitored BAG1 and SAG1 expression in bradyzoites induced for different times at alkaline pH by IFA. We observed a gradual increase in the percentage of BAG1-positive and SAG1-negative bradyzoites (mature bradyzoites) from 3 days to 7 days after induction. Based on this criterion, ~70% of parasites were mature bradyzoites in cysts that were induced for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and we chose this time point for further studies. Next, we compared the response of BAG1-mCherry GCaMP6f reporter parasites that were grown as tachyzoites to those induced to form bradyzoites by cultivation in HFF cells for 7 days at pH 8.2 in vitro after treatment with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187. Ionophore treatment induced rapid and high-level increases in GCaMP6f fluorescence in tachyzoites but delayed and much weaker responses in bradyzoites as monitored by time-lapse video microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). To rule out an effect of differences in expression level of GCaMP6f during differentiation, we measured fluorescence intensities of GCaMP6f and BAG1-mCherry in different parasites within the same cyst. We observed no correlation between the signals of BAG1-mCherry and the basal expression of GCaMP6f in the absence of ionophore stimulation, indicating that the low responses to ionophore were not due to expression differences in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). To determine the effect of bradyzoite development on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, we treated intracellular tachyzoites vs. bradyzoites induced by cultivation in HFF cells at pH 8.2 in vitro for 4–7 days and quantified time of each tachyzoite vacuole or bradyzoite cyst to reach Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak level after addition of A23187 ionophore by video microscopy. Increasing time of bradyzoites development was associated with progressively longer times to reach peak fluorescence of GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Time-lapse recording of GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity ratio changes (F/F<sub>0</sub>) showed delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and lower fold changes in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites in response to A23187 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Zaprinast also elicited slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases and lower fold changes in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites even in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To better characterize Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of bradyzoites, we performed live video imaging using spinning disc confocal microscopy to distinguish individual bradyzoites within in vitro-differentiated cysts and identify motile bradyzoites within cysts by comparing consecutive images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Motile bradyzoites were also observed to have higher GCaMP6f signals and these typically oscillated over time. In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists, intracellular bradyzoites showed reduced percentages of motility compared to tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Because both proteins are coexpressed from the same promoter, the mTagBFP2 serves as a control for expression level as mTagBFP2 is nonresponsive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cranfill et al., 2016</xref>). Live fluorescence microscopy showed simultaneous expression of GCaMP6f and mTagBFP2 in tachyzoites, and additionally mCherry in bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Equal expression of GCaMP6f (His tag) and mTagBFP2, as well as separation of tachyzoites and bradyzoite populations (detected with SAG1 and BAG1, respectively), was validated by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To compare Ca<sup>2+</sup> basal levels, we quantified the fluorescence intensity ratio F<sub>GCaMP6f</sub>/F<sub>mTagBFP2</sub> of intracellular and extracellular tachyzoites and bradyzoites in EC buffer with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We observed significant reductions in the fluorescence intensity ratio of both intracellular and extracellular bradyzoites relative to tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicative of lower resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in bradyzoites. We next compared Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of intracellular tachyzoites and bradyzoites in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists ionomycin, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and thapsigargin. Changes in the fluorescence of GCaMP6f were much slower and of lower amplitude in bradyzoites relative to tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Reduced responses were not simply a consequence of the cyst environment as similar dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and microneme secretion were observed in single, extracellular bradyzoites. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed lower resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and reduced ER and acidic-stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> in bradyzoites, which is likely a reflection of downregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPases involved in maintaining these stores replenished. Tissue cysts are characterized by a thick wall comprising proteins and carbohydrates that may collectively impede signals and/or restrict egress mechanically. However, when cysts were digested by trypsin to release bradyzoites, they exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gliding motility that was enhanced by incubation in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in combination with glucose, demonstrating that they express a conserved mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated motility, albeit dampened by reduced stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diminished energy levels. The dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling responses of bradyzoites reflect adaptations that are well suited to the long-term intracellular lifestyle of these chronic stages. Significantly, bradyzoites also retain the potential to become motile once provided with sources of energy and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, demonstrating remarkable physiological flexibility that favors transmission.</p><p>Egress is a crucial step in the lytic cycle of apicomplexan parasites, and this response requires the sequential steps of increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, secretion of micronemes, PV rupture, and activation of motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carruthers, 2019</xref>). Our studies demonstrate that bradyzoites show minimal egress from in vitro-differentiated cysts in response to agonists that normally trigger this response in tachyzoites (i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores and zaprinast). We also demonstrate that bradyzoites are refractory to stimulation of microneme secretion using either an intracellular reporter monitoring the release of PLP1 based on the dispersion of FNR-mCherry from the cyst matrix or a MIC2-GLuc reporter detecting secretion from extracellular bradyzoites. To explore the basis for these differences, we utilized a dual fluorescent reporter GCaMP6f BAG1-mCherry to monitor changes of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in bradyzoites. Calcium signaling was significantly dampened in bradyzoites as reflected in delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and lower magnitude of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also confirmed using bradyzoites naturally formed in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells and ex vivo cysts isolated from chronically infected mice, indicating that the dampened responses are not simply a consequence of alkaline pH stress during bradyzoites development in vitro. Additionally, we observed similar dampened responses from extracellular bradyzoites, indicating that decreased responses are not simply due to reduced permeability of intact cysts to agonists. To confirm these results, we also utilized Fluo-8/AM to monitor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores of bradyzoites and observed similar dampened responses. Finally, since Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fluorescence responses by GCaMP6f or Fluo-8 are only relative and subject to differences in protein or probe levels, we developed a ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter that contains GCaMP6f fused with self-cleavage tag P2A-linked mTagBFP2 under the control of the same promoter. Ratiometric measurements of the GCaMP6f signal compared to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> insensitive indicator mTagBFP2 determined that bradyzoites have lower resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and quantitatively decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses relative to tachyzoites in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists. Collectively, these findings conclusively show that bradyzoites have reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses whether developed in vitro or in vivo and using a variety of independent methods to assess both Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and physiological responses.</p><p>Based on the above findings, it seems likely that bradyzoites possess different mechanisms to control Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, including differences in expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps relative to tachyzoites. These differences would impact Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage pools, affecting cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and signaling. For example, our findings indicate that bradyzoites show reduced responses to ionomycin and thapsigargin, which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> primarily from the ER, and in response to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from acidocalcisomes and likely other acidic stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreno and Zhong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stasic et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these dampened responses, bradyzoites showed significantly reduced expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases TgSERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagamune et al., 2007</xref>) and TgA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2004</xref>), which are involved in transporting cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER and acidocalcisome, respectively. They also showed reduced expression of TgA2, the Ca<sup>2+/</sup>H<sup>+</sup> exchanger and the recently described TRPPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Márquez-Nogueras et al., 2021</xref>), which is a TRP channel key for cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the plasma and ER membranes. The reduced expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that allow influx into the cytosol and reduced expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps that fill intracellular stores would result in a general reduction of stored Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Additionally, it is possible that the reduced levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in bradyzoites reflect limitations on the availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the host cell since prior studies have shown that tachyzoites acquire their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from this source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vella et al., 2021</xref>). Reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> could impact mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> since it has been shown in mammalian cells that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be transferred directly (through membrane contact sites) from the ER to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cárdenas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gherardi et al., 2020</xref>), which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. One aspect that is not addressed by our studies is whether altered expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and pumps is responsible for reducing energy levels and hence driving quiescence, or whether the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathways are a consequence of initial changes in energy production. Further studies will be needed to decipher the contribution of these various mechanism to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and signaling in bradyzoites.</p><p>Bradyzoites are surrounded by a cyst wall that comprises an outer thin compact layer and an inner sponge-like layer that faces the cyst matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemgruber et al., 2011</xref>). The cyst wall is enriched in dense granule proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tu et al., 2019</xref>), stage-specific glycoproteins such as CST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tomita et al., 2013</xref>), and partially characterized carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>). This architecture may create a barrier to egress since bradyzoites were able to activate motility but not to efficiently emerge from intact cysts. We utilized trypsin to digest the cyst wall, mimicking the cyst rupture observed in chronically infected mice or following oral ingestion and exposure to pepsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey, 1998</xref>). Notably, proteolytic release did not result in immediate changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor motility in the parasite, suggesting that cyst wall degradation does not trigger a process akin to egress in tachyzoites. Rather, when artificially released in this manner, a subset of bradyzoites spontaneously underwent gliding motility associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that were similar to those previously described for tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lovett and Sibley, 2003</xref>). When incubated with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the percentage of motile bradyzoites increased dramatically, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry stimulates motility, similar to tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges-Pereira et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike a previous report showing that tachyzoites contain sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and energy levels to be independent of external carbon sources during the first hour after liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that bradyzoites require an external source of carbon to regain Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and ATP levels. Similar to previous findings that <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites can support motility either from glucose through glycolysis or from glutamine that feeds into the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blume et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>), we observed that either carbon source was capable of synergizing with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to restore bradyzoite motility, although inhibitor studies indicate that oxidative phosphorylation is required to restore optimal energy levels. Consistent with this prediction, we observed that bradyzoites have intrinsically low ATP/ADP ratios but that they recovered substantially when incubated extracellularly for 1 hr in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glucose. Collectively, these findings indicate that bradyzoites are characterized by both low Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and low ATP levels, but that they respond to changes in the extracellular environment to restore both energy levels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling systems needed for motility. During natural egress, it is also possible that bradyzoites rely on endogenous energy stores such as amylopectin, especially since Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and CDPK2 have been shown to influence the storage and utilization of this carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uboldi et al., 2015</xref>). Stimulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also important in breaking dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pang et al., 2007</xref>) and pollen germination in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steinhorst and Kudla, 2013</xref>), and initiation of the cell cycle in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humeau et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrating the important role played by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in reactivation.</p><p>Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage, dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and a lower energy state may reflect the long-term sessile nature of the intracellular cyst, which prolong chronic infection. The mechanisms inducing cyst wall turnover in vivo are unclear, although host cell macrophages may contribute to this process as they secrete chitinase that can lyse cysts in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nance et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, cyst wall turnover may be controlled by release of parasite hydrolases as suggested by the presence of GRA56, which is predicted to belong to the melibiase family of polysaccharide degrading enzymes, on the cyst wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nadipuram et al., 2020</xref>). Our in vitro studies suggest that once the cyst wall is ruptured bradyzoites respond to higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glucose in the extracellular environment to regain motility needed for subsequent cell invasion. Emergence of bradyzoites from tissue cysts that rupture in muscle or brain, or in tissue following oral ingestion, is likely to provide an environment to recharge bradyzoites. Consistent with this idea, previous in vitro studies have shown that similar motile bradyzoites released from ruptured cysts have the ability to reinvade new host cells, establishing new cysts without an intermediate growth stage as tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzierszinski et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, the rapid metabolic recovery of otherwise quiescent bradyzoites may be important for the maintenance of chronic infection within a single host and to assure robust cellular invasion upon transmission to the next host.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pBAG1:mCherry, SAG1:CAT, TUB1:GCaM6f (pNJ-26)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of BAG1-mCherry GCaMP6f reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pSAG1:CAS9-EGFP, U6:sgUPRT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene_54467</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Template for construction of pSAG1:CAS9-GFP, U6:sgDHFR 3’UTR</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pSAG1:CAS9-EGFP, U6:sgDHFR 3’UTR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of ratiometric reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">p2A-mTagBFP2, DHFR-TS:HXGPRT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of ratiometric reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pBAG1:EGFP, DHFFR-TS::HXGPRT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of BAG1-EGFP reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pBAG1:mCherry, DHFFR-TS::HXGPRT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of BAG1-mCherry reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pMIC2:GLuc-myc, DHFR-TS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2016</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of MIC2 secretion reporter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pTUB1:FNR-mCherry, CAT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vernon Carruthers Lab in University of Michigan</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pTUB1:YFP-mAID-3HA, DHFR-TS:HXGPRT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other, <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2017</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Template for construction of plasmids in this paper</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ME49 Δhxgprt::FLUC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other, <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tobin et al., 2012</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Parental stain for generation of reporters in this paper</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>T. gondii</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BAG1-mCherry GCaMP6f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genotypes are indicated as ME49 <italic>Δhxgprt::TUB1:FLUC;

The P2A-mTagBFP2 tagging plasmid was constructed by cloning a synthetic sequence containing a slit peptide (P2A) together with the blue fluorescent reporter mTagBFP2 (P2A-mTagBFP2) into the pTUB1:YFP-mAID-3HA, DHFR-TS:HXGPRT backbone by NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB, E5520S) after double enzymatic digestion of KpnI and NdeI. Following this step, the SAG1 3′UTR was amplified from pNJ-26 and cloned into the tagging plasmid to replace DHFR 3′UTR by Gibson assembly (NEB, E5520S). BAG1-mCherry GCaMP6f reporter tachyzoites were co-transfected with 10 μg of pSAG1::CAS9-U6::sgDHFR 3′UTR and 2 μg of PCR-amplified P2A-mTagBFP2-HXGPRT flanked with 40 bp homology regions, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 2017</xref>). Stable transfectants were selected with 25 μg/ml MPA and 50 μg/ml 6Xa. Single-cell clones containing targeted integrated transgenes were confirmed by diagnostic PCR and IFA staining.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Toxoplasma bradyzoites exhibit physiological plasticity of calcium and energy stores controlling motility and egress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Malcolm J McConville as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher J Tonkin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers noted the novelty of these findings and the insights they provide into the biology of <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoite stages. A number of issues were identified which may require additional experimental support and/or explicit discussion in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide further validation of the Mic2-Gluc assay for measuring microneme secretion in bradyzoites – in particular it would be important to show that bradyzoites express sufficient M2AP to allow use of Mic2-Gluc as a read-out for secretion or confirm using an alternative assay.</p><p>2. Provide indication of variability in measurements of calcium levels where currently only the mean of just three cells is provided (or repeat with increased number of cells). This is important in Figure 5 where basal calcium levels are being measured.</p><p>3. Ensure that several points regarding methodology raised by the reviewers are directly addressed in the text, including the use of different time points when measuring ATP levels and gliding motility in extracellular bradyzoites, and discussion of possible effect of bradyzoite isolation protocol on calcium signalling.</p><p>4. Include discussion on the role of calcium signalling in mobilization of amylopectin carbohydrate stores and activation of bradyzoites in vivo</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It remains unclear whether repression of calcium signalling in bradyzoites directs these stages into metabolic quiescence, or conversely, that entry into metabolic quiescence decreases the cellular energy balance with concomitant decrease in calcium uptake, depletion of intracellular stores and signalling. Can the authors draw out arguments for one side or the other?</p><p>As noted above, incubation of artificially released bradyzoites in calcium plus or minus a carbon source leads to increased motility and ATP levels. However, it is likely that activation of bradyzoites will occur earlier in vivo (e.g. prior to, or during the process of egress). During natural egress, bradyzoites will be more dependent on intracellular carbohydrate stores rather than exogenous sugars. Mobilization of internal stores is suggested by the finding that calcium alone is sufficient to activate motility in extracellular bradyzoites. Discussion of this possibility, including reference to previous work showing that calcium dependent kinases regulate amylopectin degradation is warranted.</p><p>Figure 8F. Can the authors provide information on the basal levels of ATP/ADP/AMP in tachyzoites suspended in the same EC buffer 10min/1hr, to allow comparison with bradyzoite data?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction uses language that is a bit too definitive in places. I suggest to tone down.</p><p>– I would not say that ER is the known storage site of ca<sup>2+</sup>, I'd say the evidence suggests it is likely, but it is far from being definitive.</p><p>– Line 346- I would not say 1hr is a rapid change, especially in context of persistence in the brain or transmission (see below)</p><p>There are some spelling/grammatical mistakes; for example, Line 80: Accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER cannot lead to Mn secretion – this must be a mistake.</p><p>I think the discussion is too long and goes over a lot of what is already presented in Results section. I recommend reducing this but instead discuss more about how these results impact our understanding of transmission and persistence of a latent infection. For example, how do the lower levels of ca<sup>2+</sup>, motility and microneme secretion impact cyst lysis and re-invasion? Are these parameters enough or is there a transition period where bradyzoites become more motile to? Likewise, for transmission, it seems unlikely that an extracellular bradyzoite could hang around in the gut for 1 hr, to bolster energy and ca<sup>2+</sup> needed to actively invade cells. Does this mean that high ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP (similar levels to tachyzoites) are not needed for transmission or do the authors think there is other possibilities? These considerations of the physiological relevance are important to discuss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73011.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide further validation of the Mic2-Gluc assay for measuring microneme secretion in bradyzoites – in particular it would be important to show that bradyzoites express sufficient M2AP to allow use of Mic2-Gluc as a read-out for secretion or confirm using an alternative assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed western blotting (Figure 2C) and IFA (Figure 2 supplement 1A) to confirm that bradyzoites express MIC2-Gluc and M2AP, albeit at lower levels compared with tachyzoites. Moreover, MIC2-GLuc and M2AP were properly co-localized to the apical end in bradyzoites, ruling out the possibility of mis-localization of the MIC2-GLuc reporter. Based on these results, we believe that MIC2-GLuc provides a reliable read-out for microneme secretion in in vitro differentiated bradyzoites. Additionally, the conclusion that MIC secretion is dampened in bradyzoites is also supported by the studies using the FNR-Cherry reporter in Figure 2E,F,G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide indication of variability in measurements of calcium levels where currently only the mean of just three cells is provided (or repeat with increased number of cells). This is important in Figure 5 where basal calcium levels are being measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified more cells in all figures related to fluorescence measurements. For measurements of single parasites in Figure 5B, 5D, 5E, 6F, 8A, 8B and Figure 7 supplement 1A, we have now quantified 10 parasites for each condition and plotted the data as means ±S.D. For in vitro induced cysts or ex vivo cysts in Figure 2G, 3D, 3E, 4C,4G, 6E, 7B and Figure 4 supplement 1A, we measured 5 cysts or vacuoles per condition. Because these samples contain many parasites within each vacuole or cyst, they represent a greater sample size. The data are also plotted a means ±S.D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Ensure that several points regarding methodology raised by the reviewers are directly addressed in the text, including the use of different time points when measuring ATP levels and gliding motility in extracellular bradyzoites, and discussion of possible effect of bradyzoite isolation protocol on calcium signalling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted several new experiments to more closely match the experimental conditions to: (1) rule out that the differences are due to different time points or treatments (Figures 8G, 8H, 8I), (2) define the extent of bradyzoite differentiation (Figure 3 supplement 1A, 1B), (3) demonstrate the treatment with trypsin does not affect intracellular calcium (Figure 7 supplement 1A), and (4) validate consistent expression levels of GCaMP6f in different stages (Figure 3 supplement 1C, 1D). We also repeated the gliding motility assays (Figure 8D and Figure 8F) using bradyzoites purified by the same methods used for ATP analysis to match these two experiments more closely. We found the same results in previous experiments that incubation with exogenous glucose and calcium leads to the recovery of gliding motility by bradyzoites.</p><p>4. Include discussion on the role of calcium signalling in mobilization of amylopectin carbohydrate stores and activation of bradyzoites in vivo</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have included it in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It remains unclear whether repression of calcium signalling in bradyzoites directs these stages into metabolic quiescence, or conversely, that entry into metabolic quiescence decreases the cellular energy balance with concomitant decrease in calcium uptake, depletion of intracellular stores and signalling. Can the authors draw out arguments for one side or the other?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, but the current data do not argue strongly for one possibility over the other. We have added this statement to the discussion to highlight this as an interesting area for further research: &quot;One aspect that is not addressed by our studies is whether altered expression of calcium channels and pumps is responsible for reducing energy levels and hence driving quiescence, or whether the altered calcium pathways are a consequence of initial changes in energy production.&quot; As noted above, incubation of artificially released bradyzoites in calcium plus or minus a carbon source leads to increased motility and ATP levels. However, it is likely that activation of bradyzoites will occur earlier in vivo (e.g. prior to, or during the process of egress). During natural egress, bradyzoites will be more dependent on intracellular carbohydrate stores rather than exogenous sugars. Mobilization of internal stores is suggested by the finding that calcium alone is sufficient to activate motility in extracellular bradyzoites. Discussion of this possibility, including reference to previous work showing that calcium dependent kinases regulate amylopectin degradation is warranted.</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have included it in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8F. Can the authors provide information on the basal levels of ATP/ADP/AMP in tachyzoites suspended in the same EC buffer 10min/1hr, to allow comparison with bradyzoite data?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We measured the ATP/ADP/AMP levels in tachyzoites treated with EC buffer for 10 min vs.1 hr and found that treatment did not significantly affect the ATP and ADP levels in tachyzoites but led to increase in AMP levels. These results indicate that extracellular tachyzoites do not depend on uptake of exogenous glucose for ATP production during the first hr they are extracellular, a result that is consistent with the conclusion in a previous publication (Lin SS, Blume M, von Ahsen N, Gross U, Bohne W. Extracellular <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tachyzoites do not require carbon source uptake for ATP maintenance, gliding motility and invasion in the first hour of their extracellular life.
