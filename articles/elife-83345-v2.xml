finger protein 467 (<italic>Zfp467</italic>) expression. In contrast, genetic loss of <italic>Zfp467</italic> increased <italic>Pth1r</italic> expression and shifts mesenchymal progenitor cell fate toward osteogenesis and higher bone mass. PTH1R and ZFP467 could constitute a feedback loop that facilitates PTH-induced osteogenesis and that conditional deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> in osteogenic precursors would lead to high bone mass in mice. <italic>Prrx1Cre; Zfp467<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> but not <italic>AdipoqCre; Zfp467<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice exhibit high bone mass and greater osteogenic differentiation similar to the <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. qPCR results revealed that PTH suppressed <italic>Zfp467</italic> expression primarily via the cyclic AMP/PKA pathway. Not surprisingly, PKA activation inhibited the expression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> and gene silencing of <italic>Pth1r</italic> caused an increase in <italic>Zfp467</italic> mRNA transcription. Dual fluorescence reporter assays and confocal immunofluorescence demonstrated that genetic deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> resulted in higher nuclear translocation of NFκB1 that binds to the P2 promoter of the <italic>Pth1r</italic> and increased its transcription. As expected, <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells had enhanced production of cyclic AMP and increased glycolysis in response to exogenous PTH. Additionally, the osteogenic response to PTH was also enhanced in <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> COBs, and the pro-osteogenic effect of <italic>Zfp467</italic> deletion was blocked by gene silencing of <italic>Pth1r</italic> or a PKA inhibitor. In conclusion, our findings suggest that loss or PTH1R-mediated repression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> results in a pathway that increases <italic>Pth1r</italic> transcription via NFκB1 and thus cellular responsiveness to PTH/PTHrP, ultimately leading to enhanced bone formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zinc finger protein 467</kwd><kwd>PTH receptor</kwd><kwd>PTH</kwd><kwd>PKA pathway</kwd><kwd>osteogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK112374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR073774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK092759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss or PTH1R-mediated repression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> results in a pathway that increases <italic>Pth1r</italic> transcription via NFκB1 and thus cellular responsiveness to PTH/PTHrP, ultimately leading to enhanced bone formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH 1–34), teriparatide, is anabolic for bone and is a well-established treatment for osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Estell and Rosen, 2021</xref>). Both PTH and PTHrP act through the PTH1R to drive bone formation, increase bone mass, and lower fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goltzman, 2018</xref>). It has been established that one mechanism for PTH-driven osteogenesis is through induction of cyclic AMP and the PKA pathway, although PKC can also be activated by ligand binding to the PTH1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wein and Kronenberg, 2018</xref>). Downstream targets from PTH1R activation include IGF-1, FGF-2, Rankl, Sclerostin, Wnt signaling, salt-inducible kinases, and the BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wein and Kronenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Pth1r</italic> is expressed in chondrocytes, and the entire osteoblast lineage from early osteogenic progenitors to osteoblasts during which it is upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goltzman, 2018</xref>). Osteocytes and lining cells also express <italic>Pth1r</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goltzman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wein and Kronenberg, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have noted that the PTH1R is also expressed in mature adipocytes and their immediate precursors, marrow adipocyte-like progenitors, or MALPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Intermittent PTH treatment increases bone formation both by enhancing the number of osteoblasts and their function, resulting in higher bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balani et al., 2017</xref>). Several reports have demonstrated that PTH-induced lineage allocation of skeletal stromal cells into osteoblasts is at the expense of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with human studies which confirmed that PTH treatment reduces bone marrow adiposity principally through a shift in lineage allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maridas et al., 2019</xref>). The transcriptional mechanisms whereby PTH drives a progenitor cell toward an osteoblast are multiple, complex, and redundant. Previous study reported that genetic deletion of the PTH1R in Prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in low bone mass and a marked increase in bone marrow adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study for the mechanisms that drive adipogenesis that identified <italic>Zfp467</italic> as a gene markedly upregulated in the absence of the PTH1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are one of the largest classes of transcription factors in eukaryotic genomes and <italic>Zfp521</italic> and <italic>Zfp423</italic> have been identified as critical determinants of both adipogenesis and osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganss and Jheon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kiviranta et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Zfp467</italic> has been reported to enhance both <italic>Sost</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> expression in marrow stromal cells, and is highly expressed in both adipocyte and osteoblast progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quach et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, an earlier study identified <italic>Zfp467</italic> as a transcriptional regulator of lineage allocation among mesenchymal progenitors cells in the marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">You et al., 2012</xref>). In accordance with that report, global genetic deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> resulted in high bone mass and a reduction in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) and peripheral adipose depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, the inverse relationship between PTH1R and <italic>Zfp467</italic> suggested an additional pathway by which PTH could impact lineage allocation. To determine the molecular mechanism of this interaction, <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> osteoblast progenitors were used for studying and a potential transcriptional modulator of the PTH1R, regulated by ZFP467, was identified. This report details both in vitro and in vivo studies, and points to a novel pathway that impacts skeletal formation through the PTH1R.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previous study showed that global deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> increased trabecular bone volume and cortical bone thickness, compared to wild-type mice at the age of 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le et al., 2021</xref>).

To assess whether the effect on bone mass seen in the <italic>Zfp467</italic> global knockout (KO) mice was cell-autonomous to mesenchymal cells, we generated mice with deletion of Zfp467 in the limb MSCs by crossing <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with the <italic>Prrx1Cre</italic> mice or <italic>AdipoqCre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Similar to the</italic> global Zfp467 null mice<italic>, Prrx1Cre Zfp467</italic> mice have increased trabecular bone mass</title><p>Body mass and body size were not significantly different between <italic>Prrx1Cre; Zfp467<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and control littermates in both males and females (data not shown).

A novel pathway was reported by which PTH can enhance its own anabolic actions in osteoblast progenitors by repressing Zfp467, a negative regulator of PTH1R expression. <italic>Zfp467</italic> was originally isolated from mouse hematogenic endothelial LO cells as an OSM-inducible mRNA, which encodes protein ZFP467 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakayama et al., 2002</xref>), also called EZI. Zinc finger motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganss and Jheon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leon and Roth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 1990</xref>). Based on the zinc finger domain, ZFPs are classified into C2H2, C3H, and C4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Varnum et al., 1991</xref>). ZFP467 belongs to C2H2 ZFP family whose zinc finger domain consists of two cysteine and two histidine residues. ZFP467 was initially found to cooperate with STAT3 and augment STAT3 activity by enhancing its nuclear translocation in a kidney cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakayama et al., 2002</xref>). ZFP467 is expressed ubiquitously and may be an important mediator of BMSC differentiation into the adipogenic or osteogenic lineages as well as functioning in other tissues in distinct ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">You et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">You et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of <italic>Pth1r</italic> in mesenchymal cells resulted in low bone mass, high marrow adiposity, and upregulation of <italic>Zfp467</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the absence of <italic>Zfp467</italic> resulted in a significant increase in Tb.BV/TV, accompanied by a marked reduction in peripheral and marrow adipose tissue and improved glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le et al., 2021</xref>). Most importantly for the current study, whole bone marrow gene expression by qRT-PCR revealed an ~40% increase in <italic>Pth1r</italic> expression and greater protein levels in the <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, PTH1R and ZFP467 could be involved in a feedback loop whereby the suppression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> mediated by PTH leads to an increase of PTH1R, and therefore an enhanced response to PTH treatment. However, due to the global nature of the Zfp467 deletion, a cell non-autonomous effect could not be excluded. In the present study therefore, we tested that hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro, and sought to determine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms involved in this novel regulatory pathway.</p><p>First, we were able to show that conditional deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> by Prrx1Cre led to an increase in osteogenesis and bone formation, a finding that mirrors our results with the global deletion of Zfp467, although, it should be noted that the increased trabecular bone in <italic>Prrx1Cre;Zfp467<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> was much more pronounced in male rather than female mice. On the other hand, using an AdipoqCre-driven system, no effect of conditional deletion in adipocytes on body composition, fat mass, bone mass, or total weight was observed. Taken together these data would suggest that <italic>Zfp467</italic> is an early mesenchymal transcriptional factor that regulates lineage allocation in early osteoblast but not adipocyte progenitors. Second, constitutive upregulation of <italic>Zfp467</italic> was observed when we genetically knocked down <italic>Pth1r</italic> in COBs and BMSCs. In addition, much like the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quach et al., 2011</xref><italic>,</italic> acute PTH treatment could significantly suppress gene expression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> in both COBs and BMSCs, and the suppression could be partly rescued by both a PKA pathway inhibitor and a PKC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quach et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, Forskolin, a PKA pathway activator, could also inhibit the expression of <italic>Zfp467</italic>, with a more sustained effect. These data indicated that PTH might suppress <italic>Zfp467</italic> expression via activation of the PTH1R through predominantly PKA pathways.</p><p>To test the validity of the hypothesis, how deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> affected the expression of the PTH1R was further investigated. The transcript of <italic>Pth1r</italic> that upregulated in <italic>Zfp467</italic> absent cells was further confirmed that via dual-fluorescence reporter assay that both P1 and P2 promoters of <italic>Pth1r</italic> were activated in <italic>Zfp467</italic> null cells; however, P2 was more activated than P1. Using three different transcription factor prediction databases including PROMO, JASPAR, and Animal TFDB, several candidate transcription factors that might be involved in the regulation of <italic>Pth1r</italic> in <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells via activation of the P2 promoter were observed. After overexpressing each candidate transcription factor, only NFκB1 could upregulate <italic>Pth1r</italic> via activation of the P2-2 Pth1r promoter. Further confocal immunofluorescence and nuclear protein detection indicated that the nuclear translocation of NFκB1 was much higher in <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Moreover, ChIP-qPCR results showed that NFκB1 could bind to the P2 promoter of the Pth1r. Taken together, these data suggested that the deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic> resulted in higher nuclear translocation of NFκB1 which bound to the P2 promoter of Pth1r and promoted its transcription.</p><p>NFκB1 is one of the DNA binding subunits of the NF-kappa-B (NFκB) protein complex. NFκB is a transcriptional regulator that is activated by various stimuli including cytokines, bacteria, and oxidation. The NFκB pathway is involved in several biological processes including inflammation, bone resorption, aging, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cartwright and Perkins, 2016</xref>). Activated NFκB1 translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of an array of genes. However, no previous studies that NFκB1 may regulate the gene expression of <italic>Pth1r</italic> or other osteogenic-related genes. Nevertheless, it was reported that time- and stage-specific inhibition of endogenous inhibitors of IκB kinase (IKK)–nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in differentiated osteoblasts substantially increases trabecular bone mass and bone mineral density without affecting osteoclast activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, activation of NF-κB may not only regulate osteoclast activation and bone resorption but also simultaneously be involved in osteoblast function, thus influencing bone formation and maintaining bone homeostasis. It is also conceivable that NFκB1 could associate with histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) or be regulated by a PKA catalytic subunit which is also downstream of PTH signaling in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that other proteins like RelB that might bind to p50 and enhance its effect on the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Pth1r</italic> play a critical role in PTH-mediated osteogenesis. In addition to RelB-p50 heterodimers, more proximal events in the non-canonical NFκB signaling cascade was detected and higher phosphorylation level of both IKKα and p100 were observed in <italic>Zfp467</italic> knock down cells, which suggested the non-canonical NFκB pathway was activated when lacking <italic>Zfp467</italic>, and was involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Pth1r.</italic></p><p>Osteoblasts require substrates for energy utilization during collagen synthesis and mineralization. Previous reports by Lee et al. and Guntur et al. demonstrated that glycolysis is a major source of ATP for differentiating osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maridas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Esen et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup>cells showed higher cAMP levels in response to PTH as well as higher glycolytic activity (i.e. ECAR). COBs from <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed greater differentiation in osteogenic media but less differentiation into adipocytes compared to controls. Higher rates of osteogenesis, enhanced <italic>Rankl</italic> and <italic>Igf1</italic> expression, increased glycolysis, and decreased adipogenesis are likely related to greater activation of the PTH1R, possibly due to its higher endogenous expression level. Consistently, after treating <italic>Zfp467</italic> global KO mice with PTH for 1 week and compared to control mice, PTH-treated <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed higher bone volume and lower SMI than PTH-treated <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice.</p><p>Since it was reported that the downstream effects of PTH could be partially blocked by PKA inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishizuya et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>Pth1r</italic> siRNA and PKA inhibitors were used to block the effect of PTH1R, which confirmed that PTH1R and its downstream pathways were involved in the deletion of <italic>Zfp467</italic>-induced osteogenic differentiation. ALP staining and qPCR results suggested that <italic>Pth1r</italic> siRNA and PKA inhibitor could nearly reverse the upregulated osteogenic differentiation in <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> COBs with or without PTH treatment.</p><p>Last but not least, RNA-seq was performed to identify potential downstream targets and pathways of <italic>Zfp467</italic> that might be involved in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation.

Another significantly upregulated gene, <italic>Ngfr</italic> in <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells was found to be required for skeletal cell migration and osteogenesis, especially during injury repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tomlinson et al., 2017</xref>). NGFR could also mediate AMP-induced modulation of ERK1/2 and AKT cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Piiper et al., 2002</xref>), which is consistent with our GSEA pathways enrichment. However, further investigation is required to clarify how ZFP467 regulates <italic>Wdfy1</italic>, <italic>Ngfr,</italic> and their downstream AKT or MAPK pathways.</p><p>Despite uncovering a novel regulatory circuit through NFκB1, there are some limitations to our study. First, it should be noted that <italic>Zfp467</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells have higher nuclear translocation of GATA1 and overexpression of GATA1 could promote <italic>Pth1r</italic> expression. However, overexpression of GATA1 failed to activate the P2-2 promoter of <italic>Pth1r</italic>. Hence, that GATA1 might be another of the regulating transcription factors between ZFP467 and Pth1r, but it likely regulates <italic>Pth1r</italic> expression via binding sites other than those present on P2-2.</p><p>Second, how Zfp467 binds with NFκB1-RelB heterodimers was not determined, and we have not identified the exact genomic sequence required for NFκB1-RelB heterodimer binding at the P2 promoter binding site. Further studies will be needed to address this important mechanistic question. Hence the precise mechanism of action of Zfp467 and the downstream consequences of NFκB1-RelB heterodimer binding on the presumed switch between adipocytes and osteoblasts is still not fully defined. Last, to our knowledge, there must be a break on the activation of a feed-forward PTH-PTH1R regulatory system, but it is not delineated whereby the fast forward system interacts with β-arrestin or any other mechanism that turns off signaling.</p><p>In summary, taken together, we demonstrated the importance of the zinc finger protein ZFP467 for lineage allocation in vitro and in vivo, as well as responsiveness to PTH in osteoblast progenitors. Our data also support a novel feed-forward regulatory loop whereby suppression of <italic>Zfp467</italic> mediated by PTH and its downstream PKA pathway leads to an increase of PTH1R via NFκB1, and subsequent enhanced responsiveness to PTH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In addition, our lines of evidence suggest that the NF-κB signaling pathway may be an important component of the osteoblastic response to cytokines, and possibly to factors elaborated by osteoclasts, enhancing coupling of resorption to formation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the anabolic effects of PTH on bone.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates osteogenesis and suppresses adipogenesis through Zfp467 in a feed-forward, PTH1R-cyclic AMP-dependent manner.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83345-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>PTH were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew B Greenblatt (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To study more in depth potential mechanisms downstream of Zfp467.</p><p>2) To provide more convincing evidence that the pathway as described in the study is relevant in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. How does Zfp467 regulate p50? This is an important step in the molecular pathway laid out in this manuscript that doesn't appear to be fully established. Given that post-translational regulation is essential for NF-κB activity, further exploration of whether or not more proximal events in the NF-κB signaling cascade are impacted in Zfp467-deficient cells, such as p105 phosphorylation and proteasomal processing to p50, is important to fully flesh out this aspect of the phenotype. Additionally, it is not totally clear from the provided immunoblots and immunofluorescence studies that p50 actually displays increased activation in Zfp467-deficient cells, as the difference is subtle. What NF-ΚB-activating stimulus is proposed to be upstream of the activation seen here or more generally for the Zfp467 regulatory network studied here? Conducting similar studies in the presence of explicit NF-κB stimulation may be helpful to clarify the p50 activation phenotype.</p><p>2. It is a little bit confusing to follow due to the absence of figure labels (see the comment below) but it seems like the data on Prx1-cre Zfp467 fl/fl mice is missing from Figure 1? What appears to be Figure 1 only has data on the adipoQ-cre cross, not Prx1-cre mice. For any areas where important uCT phenotypes are noted, providing 3D reconstructions (ideally of an entire metaphyseal/epiphyseal region) is recommended to help visually communicate any architectural differences.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have analyzed the effect of the zinc finger transcription factor, ZFP467, on PTH signaling in the osteoblast and vice-versa. They have established that in the absence of osteoblastic ZFP467, there is an increase in trabecular bone, osteoblast differentiation and PTH signaling and PTH1R. PTH, in turn, transiently decreases gene expression of Zfp467. They analyzed the promoters of the Pth1r gene and found a region upstream of the P2 promoter that seems to be most influenced by the absence of ZFP467. They concluded that p50 of the NFKB complex binds to this promoter and is more active in the absence of ZFP467. They have established a regulatory feedback mechanism of this transcription factor and PTH. However, they have not established the actual mechanism of action of the transcription factor nor which gene it acts on in the osteoblast. There are a number of omissions in the manuscript that would improve it, as well as other experiments that should be conducted to make it more compelling. At present, it is descriptive and does not address the central issue of how ZFP467 acts.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1. The overall manuscript has been prepared poorly. It required several emails to obtain the correct figures for Figure 1 and Figure 1-supplement 2. As well, there are a number of errors in the figure legends and Materials and methods. For instance, in Figure legends 1 and supplement 2, the legends state that there are representative uCT images (although the English here is poor), but these are not provided. There are abbreviations that are not defined, e.g., U and TSS in Figure 3 legend, NC in Figures 5, 6 and 9. In the Materials and methods, the DXA procedure &quot;of the head&quot; does not make sense. The PTH treatment is given as 48 h, when they have time courses of 10-60 min. The entire manuscript needs careful review by the senior authors.</p><p>2. The Prrx1Cre/Zfp467 mice do not completely recapitulate the global knockout. They have reduced cortical thickness in the females, and no significant change in the males, opposite to the global knockouts. They say the global knockouts had increased cortical thickness, but it also was not significant, and the sexes were not given in that paper. Thus, they need to modify the language in the present manuscript. They also need to modify the conclusion of this section to &quot;maybe attributable to changes in the MSC lineage&quot;.</p><p>3. The doses of PTH they have used with the cultured cells are very high, 5 x 10-8 M and 10-7 M. These doses often inhibit growth of osteoblastic cells. They never provide a dose response of PTH action, and there is no difference in effect between the two doses. In Figure 2., the decrease in Zfp467 mRNA expression is very transient, only observed at 10 min and returning to control by 30 min. They must provide protein levels of ZFP467 to establish that the gene expression is reflected in change in the protein, otherwise, it is not relevant.</p><p>4. In Figure 3, they should provide the relative levels of the three transcripts to each other, rather than using fold expression to the +/+ cells.

How does Zfp467 regulate p50? This is an important step in the molecular pathway laid out in this manuscript that doesn't appear to be fully established. Given that post-translational regulation is essential for NF-κB activity, further exploration of whether or not more proximal events in the NF-κB signaling cascade are impacted in Zfp467-deficient cells, such as p105 phosphorylation and proteasomal processing to p50, is important to fully flesh out this aspect of the phenotype. Additionally, it is not totally clear from the provided immunoblots and immunofluorescence studies that p50 actually displays increased activation in Zfp467-deficient cells, as the difference is subtle. What NF-ΚB-activating stimulus is proposed to be upstream of the activation seen here or more generally for the Zfp467 regulatory network studied here? Conducting similar studies in the presence of explicit NF-κB stimulation may be helpful to clarify the p50 activation phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We measured p50, p105 and p105 phosphorylation in Zfp467 siRNA treated MC3T3-E1 cells, and we did not find any difference between groups (Figure 6E). Therefore, Zfp467 may have no effect on p105 proteasomal processing and p50 production.</p><p>We agree that it is possible there is a signaling pathway between zfp467 and the NF-κB non-canonical network. So we detected the expression level of few classic non-canonical NFKB pathway stimuli and related receptors in Zfp467 siRNA treated cells and found that Rankl was significantly upregulated, which is also in consistent with our RNA-seq data (Figure 10A). Interestingly, when treating MC3T3-E1 cells with 10uM RANKL for 24 hours, transcription levels of Pth1r were significantly upregulated. (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We are planning to follow up on these observations regarding RANKL regulation of PTH1R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is a little bit confusing to follow due to the absence of figure labels (see the comment below) but it seems like the data on Prx1-cre Zfp467 fl/fl mice is missing from Figure 1? What appears to be Figure 1 only has data on the adipoQ-cre cross, not Prx1-cre mice. For any areas where important uCT phenotypes are noted, providing 3D reconstructions (ideally of an entire metaphyseal/epiphyseal region) is recommended to help visually communicate any architectural differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake in labeling so we re-updated Figure. 1 with histomorphometry data for Prx1-cre mice. We also now provide uCT images reconstructed 3D for the Prrx1CreZfp467 mice, both males and females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have analyzed the effect of the zinc finger transcription factor, ZFP467, on PTH signaling in the osteoblast and vice-versa. They have established that in the absence of osteoblastic ZFP467, there is an increase in trabecular bone, osteoblast differentiation and PTH signaling and PTH1R. PTH, in turn, transiently decreases gene expression of Zfp467. They analyzed the promoters of the Pth1r gene and found a region upstream of the P2 promoter that seems to be most influenced by the absence of ZFP467. They concluded that p50 of the NFKB complex binds to this promoter and is more active in the absence of ZFP467. They have established a regulatory feedback mechanism of this transcription factor and PTH. However, they have not established the actual mechanism of action of the transcription factor nor which gene it acts on in the osteoblast. There are a number of omissions in the manuscript that would improve it, as well as other experiments that should be conducted to make it more compelling. At present, it is descriptive and does not address the central issue of how ZFP467 acts.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1. The overall manuscript has been prepared poorly. It required several emails to obtain the correct figures for Figure 1 and Figure 1-supplement 2. As well, there are a number of errors in the figure legends and Materials and methods. For instance, in Figure legends 1 and supplement 2, the legends state that there are representative uCT images (although the English here is poor), but these are not provided. There are abbreviations that are not defined, e.g., U and TSS in Figure 3 legend, NC in Figures 5, 6 and 9. In the Materials and methods, the DXA procedure &quot;of the head&quot; does not make sense. The PTH treatment is given as 48 h, when they have time courses of 10-60 min. The entire manuscript needs careful review by the senior authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these mistakes; the uCT images for Figure 1 are provided now and the abbreviations are provided as required in the figure legend.</p><p>DXA methodology was corrected to “Whole body composition exclusive of the head was performed using the PIXImus densitometer (GE-Lunar, Fairfield, CT, USA).”</p><p>PTH treatment in the methods section was corrected to “During osteogenic differentiation, PTH was administered by adding to osteogenic media every 48 hours for each group. For the Elisa assay, PTH was administered by adding to culture media for 10-60min.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Prrx1Cre/Zfp467 mice do not completely recapitulate the global knockout. They have reduced cortical thickness in the females, and no significant change in the males, opposite to the global knockouts. They say the global knockouts had increased cortical thickness, but it also was not significant, and the sexes were not given in that paper. Thus, they need to modify the language in the present manuscript. They also need to modify the conclusion of this section to &quot;maybe attributable to changes in the MSC lineage&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Prx1Cre/Zfp467 did not completely recapitulate the global knockout. Although we observed reduced cortical thickness in females, the decreased thickness is subtle, but trabecular bone was much higher in Prx1Cre/Zfp467 mice (see Author response image 3). We agree that this terminology is confusing and likely outdated. We now refer to progenitor cells in the osteoblast lineage as skeletal stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The doses of PTH they have used with the cultured cells are very high, 5 x 10-8 M and 10-7 M. These doses often inhibit growth of osteoblastic cells. They never provide a dose response of PTH action, and there is no difference in effect between the two doses. In Figure 2., the decrease in Zfp467 mRNA expression is very transient, only observed at 10 min and returning to control by 30 min. They must provide protein levels of ZFP467 to establish that the gene expression is reflected in change in the protein, otherwise, it is not relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. 5 x 10-8 M and 10-7 M PTH were also used in our previous studies (David E. Maridas, FASEB J. 2019; Yi Fan, Cell Metab. 2017) on MSCs, and we observed decreased adipogenesis and higher ostoegenesis; in addition no significant growth inhibition was observed. As reported by T. John Martin (Front Endocrinol, 2021), initial signaling in the PTH target cells through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activation is extremely rapid (60 seconds). Quach et al. (J Biol Chem, 2011) also observed similar results that PTH suppressed zfp467 within 1 hour. Unfortunately, commercial ZFP467 antibody is not available, therefore it is not possible for us reflect the ZFP467 changes in protein level at this moment. We are trying to produce ZFP467 antibodies in rabbit for our future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3, they should provide the relative levels of the three transcripts to each other, rather than using fold expression to the +/+ cells.

Since too many groups are involved, it would be hard to present the comparison among groups using time-course lines. As PTH was shown to enhance aerobic glycolysis, higher aerobic glycolysis in zfp467-/- cells compared to +/+ cells could indirectly reflect that Zfp467 -/- may have higher PTH1R and stronger PTH action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

We added related absorbance quantification for ARS staining.
