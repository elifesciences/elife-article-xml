Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions, including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives the formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs, and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>liquid-liquid phase separation</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Integrin</kwd><kwd>p130Cas</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM047214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL135582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Focal adhesion derived p130Cas condensates regulate translation in an adhesion strength dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin-mediated adhesions are dynamic structures comprising the integrins themselves plus a complex array of intracellular cytoskeletal linkers, adapters, and signaling proteins through which cell adhesion regulates a vast range of cellular functions, including cell survival and growth, differentiation, motility, and gene expression. Under conditions of high adhesion and contractility, integrins drive the the assembly of large focal adhesions that anchor contractile actomyosin stress fibers, whereas, under conditions of lower adhesion or extracellular matrix stiffness, cells form smaller more dynamic adhesions. Large adhesions generally promote contractility and cellular quiescence, while small dynamic adhesions are associated with cell motility and growth.</p><p>LLPS has emerged over the past decade as a major principle of intracellular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). LLPS is driven by highly multivalent, weak interactions between proteins or proteins and RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). These domains, also termed ‘condensates,’ exhibit highly dynamic behaviors, including rapid exchange of components between the droplets and the bulk phase, fusion, and splitting. LLPS can organize biochemical reactions and regulate a wide array of cell functions including gene expression, organelle structure and function, protein synthesis, and mechanotransduction to name a few.</p><p>Integrin-mediated adhesions share multiple features with LLPS. They can assemble, grow, split, fuse, and disassemble in live cells, which often correlate with cell functions such as migration and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</xref>). Adhesion components exchange rapidly with the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stutchbury et al., 2017</xref>). These features prompted us to hypothesize that focal adhesions may contain phase-separated cytoplasmic proteins that mediate these behaviors. p130Cas (BCAR1) is an attractive candidate as it participates in multivalent interactions and contains extended disordered regions that often mediate condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Defilippi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>). We, therefore, began examining the behavior of GFP-tagged p130Cas in cells.</p><p>While these experiments were underway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Case et al., 2022</xref> reported that purified focal adhesion kinase (FAK) forms LLPS in vitro. They further reported that the addition of paxillin enhances FAK condensates; that phosphorylated 130cas, Nck, and N-Wasp also form condensates; and that FAK condensates and p130Cas-Nck-NWasp condensates synergistically recruit paxillin and kindlin-integrin complexes. Mutations in FAK and p130Cas that reduce LLPS also reduce adhesion formation in cells. Tensin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), LIMD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and βPIX and GIT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2020</xref> have also been reported to form condensates in vitro and in cells that localize to focal adhesions, the cytoplasm, and other compartments such as dendritic spines. Experiments using integrin cytoplasmic domains bound to supported lipid bilayers generated two-dimensional LLPS with focal adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2023</xref>). Mutations in LIMD1 and βPIX or GIT1 that interfere with domain formation perturbed focal adhesion functions including migration and durotaxis. These biochemical and cellular experiments thus established a strong connection between integrin-mediated adhesions and LLPS.</p><p>Our examination of p130Cas in cells unexpectedly revealed that this protein drove the formation of condensates that traffic in and out of focal adhesions, contain numerous proteins and RNAs involved in mRNA translation, and are distinct from known cytoplasmic structures. Functional analysis revealed that the formation of these condensates is regulated by cell adhesion and suppresses protein synthesis under conditions of high adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p130Cas phase separation</title><p>Examination of the p130Cas amino acid sequence revealed two intrinsically disordered regions of the type often associated with LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The substrate domain, which contains 15 tyrosines potentially phosphorylated by src family kinases, forms the largest unstructured region, while a segment of the C-terminal domain is also disordered. These features are highly conserved in mouse p130Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and comments in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> legend). This finding prompted us to express p130Cas N-terminally tagged with EGFP and visualize its dynamic behavior in mouse embryo fibroblasts recently plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Western blotting cell lysates for p130Cas and correcting for transfection efficiency showed that the transfected protein was ~4–5 x endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Live imaging revealed that, in addition to its localization to focal adhesions, small spots of p130Cas emerged from focal adhesions and moved into the cytoplasm and sometimes back to focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We observed disruption of droplets after the addition of hexanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J&amp;K</xref>) and enhanced droplet assembly after the addition of ammonium acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>), again, behaviors typical of phase separations. We conclude that p130Cas forms cytoplasmic condensates outside focal adhesions.</p><p>We next addressed the presence of other focal adhesion proteins in the p130Cas droplets. We stained EGFP-p130Cas-expressing cells for paxillin and FAK. Imaging at a focal plane through the nucleus and above the basal surface revealed strong co-localization of these proteins with p130Cas in cytoplasmic spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). To assess dynamic behavior, we expressed EGFP-p130Cas with either tagRFP-paxillin or mcherry-FAK. These tagged constructs also co-localized in both focal adhesions and cytoplasmic droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of ammonium acetate increased the colocalization of p130Cas with paxillin and FAK in cytoplasmic spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) and FAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>) co-emerged from focal adhesions along with p130Cas, indicating correlated dynamics. To test whether paxillin or FAK were required for the assembly of p130Cas droplets, we expressed EGFP-p130Cas in paxillin-null and in FAK-null MEFs. Cytoplasmic p130Cas droplets formed normally in both of these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), indicating that neither was required for p130Cas phase separation. By contrast, when tagged paxillin or FAK were expressed in p130Cas-null MEFs, cytoplasmic droplets were not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). These data argue that p130Cas is the main driver of phase separation outside focal adhesions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in p130Cas liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).</title><p>(<bold>A and C</bold>) EGFP-p130Cas (green) transfected cells immunostained for paxillin (red) (<bold>A</bold>) and FAK (<bold>C</bold>).

Cells expressing EGFP-p130Cas stained for pY-Cas using a specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yaginuma et al., 2020</xref>) revealed strong staining of condensates as well as focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–M</xref>). We noticed, however, that pY-Cas staining relative to total p130Cas intensity was drastically higher in focal adhesions compared to droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). This result suggests that p130Cas is much less phosphorylated in droplets than in focal adhesions. We, therefore, considered whether phosphorylation of substrate domain tyrosines was required for phase separation. We examined mutants, including mutation of the 15 substrate domain tyrosines to phenylalanine, deletion of the substrate domain, and deletion of the disordered segment in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). Mutation of substrate domain tyrosines modestly decreased, deletion of the substrate domain strongly decreased, and deletion of the C-terminal disordered sequence had no effect on droplet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P and Q</xref>). Thus, while the substrate domain is the main driver of phase separation, its tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to this effect to a lesser extent. The Y to F mutant substrate domain showed no change in intrinsic disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R</xref>), consistent with roles for both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent interactions.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Phase separation in vitro</title><p>We next considered whether p130Cas LLPS could be isolated and their composition determined. Due to the high protein exchange rates, the isolation of droplets from cells is impractical. We, therefore, attempted to induce phase separation in concentrated cell lysates prepared from suspended cells. We began by expressing EGFP or EGFP-p130Cas in HEK293T cells and isolating the transfected proteins on GFP-Trap beads. We then prepared lysate from cells expressing RFP-paxillin. Beads and lysates were mixed and left untreated, treated with ammonium acetate to induce phase separation, or with hexanediol to limit phase separation. Beads were then imaged without washing to avoid disassembly of condensed phases. We observed a low but detectable RFP-paxillin signal around EGFP-p130Cas beads under control conditions, a large increase after the addition of ammonium acetate and a decrease after the addition of hexanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Paxillin was rapidly lost upon washing, indicating rapid dissociation. No paxillin fluorescence was observed around EGFP-only beads under any of these conditions. These results suggest a specific assembly of condensed phases on the bead-bound p130Cas. To capture bound components, 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the bead suspensions under these conditions, which were then washed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Imaging showed paxillin intensity increased on EGFP-p130Cas beads after ammonium acetate treatment and no paxillin fluorescence was detected after hexanediol treatment, similar to the treatments in live cells. This protocol thus allows the capture of cytoplasmic components that specifically associated with p130Cas condensates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Isolation and characterization of p130Cas droplets.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Fluorescence image of GFP-trap magnetic beads incubated with cell lysate from HEK293tx cells transfected with either EGFP-p130Cas (<bold>A</bold>) or EGFP (<bold>B</bold>) and then mixed with lysate from tagRFP-paxillin transfected cells.

With this in mind, we examined the breast cancer cell line MCF7, which, like many cancer cell lines, expresses higher levels of p130Cas than mouse embryo fibroblasts. We plated MCF7 cells on coverslips coated with low, medium, or high fibronectin (FN). To identify cytoplasmic phase separations, we stained cells for paxillin, due to the higher quality of antibodies to this protein compared to p130Cas. Again, focusing on a plane above the basal surface, we observed more cytoplasmic droplets on higher FN, as well as the expected increase in focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Next, we measured rates of protein synthesis using the puromycin assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Puromycin interrupts translation by adding onto the growing peptide chain, thus, its incorporation is proportional to the number of mRNAs undergoing translation. Staining cells for puromycin and quantifying integrated signal per cell showed that translation decreased as a function of FN coating density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) cycloheximide treatment as a negative control for puromycin labeling. We then asked if this effect required p130Cas. MCF7 cells were transfected with siRNA against p130Cas (knockdown confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) plated on low, medium, and high FN and subject to the puromycin assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>). Knockdown of p130Cas completely abrogated inhibition of translation on high FN, indeed, after p130Cas knockdown, high FN modestly increased translation.

Recent work provides strong evidence for LLPS behaviors of the focal adhesion proteins FAK and p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Case et al., 2022</xref>). Purified FAK undergoes LLPS in vitro, mediated mainly by its disordered N-terminus. They also observed LLPS of purified p130Cas phosphorylated on its substrate domain tyrosines via SH2 and SH3 domain interactions with Nck and N-WASP. Additional studies showed LLPS of focal adhesion components with evidence for regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our current results show that focal adhesions also give rise to p130Cas-FAK-paxillin LLPS in the cytoplasm. These structures show typical LLPS behaviors including fusion and fission, and rapid exchange of subunits with the cytoplasm that slows as condensates mature. Phase separation was also modulated by reagents that alter polarity and affect LLPS in other systems. Cytoplasmic condensates contain little or no talin or vinculin but are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and mRNAs. However, p130Cas LLPS appears distinct from stress granules and P granules that contain RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Formation of condensates was strongly reduced by deletion of the p130Cas substrate domain, with a more modest reduction by mutation of the 15 substrate domain tyrosines, indicating that, within cells, p130Cas LLPS involves both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent interactions.</p><p>LLPS is difficult to isolate due to the fast dissociation of their constituents. We, therefore, developed a method to induce condensation around magnetic beads coated with GFP-p130Cas vs. GFP alone, which could then be reversibly fixed, isolated, and components analyzed. While this method is no doubt imperfect, we saw large differences between p130Cas and control beads, and several components seen in vitro were confirmed in cells. We also noted that in some p130Cas droplets, different proteins localized preferentially to the outer vs inner regions. This behavior is common among LLPS and likely reflects functional domains, though further work will be required to understand these aspects.</p><p>The presence of RNA binding proteins and mRNAs in p130Cas condensates led us to investigate a possible link to mRNA translation. We found that in MCF7 cells and HUVECs, which express abundant p130Cas, adhesion to high levels of FN reduced total translation as measured by the puromycin incorporation assay. However, the knockdown of p130Cas converted this reduction into an increase. These results indicate that p130Cas is required for translational inhibition by high adhesion, and that in its absence, an underlying stimulation is evident. This latter effect is consistent with conventional integrin signaling where cell adhesion increases protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pabla et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pola et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, inhibition of protein synthesis at high adhesion has not been reported. However, it is consistent with the correlation between very high adhesion and cellular quiescence in several systems, including vascular smooth muscle cells, senescent cells, and myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitrijevic-Bussod et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drobic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gadbois et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koyama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vivar et al., 2016</xref>). Excessive integrin-mediated adhesion can thus exert inhibitory effects on cells.</p><p>Lastly, a role for LLPS formation in the inhibition of translation was investigated through use of a Cry2-p130Cas fusion protein, whose irradiation triggers dimerization of the Cry2 moiety to increase valency and promote phase separation. Illumination of cells expressing Cry2-p130Cas triggered the formation of condensates and a decrease in translation, both of which reversed when illumination was terminated.</p><p>Together, these results identify a novel LLPS organelle that mediates a functional connection between integrin-mediated adhesion and regulation of protein synthesis. Major questions for future work include- elucidation of the composition and structure of these condensates in greater detail; determining the mechanisms that govern trafficking between the cytoplasm and focal adhesions; elucidating the molecular mechanisms of translational regulation; and determining the role these structures play in biology and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Cell lines- NIH3T3 (ATCC), CHO (ATCC), HeLa (ATCC), HEK293T (ATCC), HEK293T cell line stably expressing EGFP-Dcp1A (a gift from Prof. Sarah Slavoff, Department of Chemistry, Yale University) and MCF7 (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco).

Beads were divided equally into two Eppendorf tubes and the blocking buffer was removed. 400 µl clarified cell lysate containing EGFP-p130cas or EGFP were added to each tube containing beads along with 200 µl clarified cell lysate containing tagRFP-paxillin and slowly rotated for 2 hr at 4 °C.</p><p>100 µl bead suspension was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube for imaging, another 100 µl washed 3x with 1 ml lysis buffer for Western blotting, and the remaining 400 µl fixed using 5 mM reversible cross-linker DSP (dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate]) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 °C with slow rotation. After fixation, beads were washed four times using 1 ml lysis buffer with 1 µl RNAseout and 2 µl protease and phosphatase inhibitor. 200 µl bead samples were eluted in 1x Laemlli buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were loaded on a 4–20% SDS Tris-Glycine gradient gels (Bio-Rad). When samples entered the gel by ∼1 cm, the run was halted. The entered sample was excised out of the whole gel, put in an Eppendorf, and fixed using 45% methanol (Sigma Aldrich) and 10% Acetic Acid (Sigma Aldrich) in water. The gel plug was washed 3 x with ultra clean water (Sigma) before submitting to the Keck MS &amp; Proteomics Resource at Yale School of Medicine for LC MS/MS mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides with at least two counts and twofold enrichment relative to control beads were considered specific and was used for further gene ontology analysis.</p><p>To the other 200 µl bead sample, 700 µl Qiazol along with 7 µl β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) was added and kept at –80 °C. Sample was thawed on ice and RNA was isolated using miRNeasy Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and the sample was submitted to Yale Center for Genome Analysis (YCGA) for RNA sequencing.</p><p>100 µl bead sample was divided equally into four Eppendorf tubes. One sample was left untreated one treated with 100 mM ammonium acetate solution, one with 5% 1,6-Hexanediol, and one washed 3–4x with ice-cold lysis buffer. 1–2 µl of these samples were imaged under the microscope. Then, all these samples were fixed with 4% PFA, washed 3–4x with ice-cold PBS, and imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA sequence analysis</title><p>Bulk RNA-seq analysis was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosyakova et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, for each read, the first 6 and the last nucleotides were trimmed with a Phred score of &lt;20. If, after trimming, the read was shorter than 45  bp, the whole read was discarded. Trimmed reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg38) with HISAT2 v2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Alignments with quality scores below 20 were excluded from further analysis. Gene counts were produced with StringTie v1.3.3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>). Differential expression analysis was conducted and normalized counts were produced using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Love et al., 2014</xref>). P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini et al., 2001</xref>). We used miRDeep2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedländer et al., 2012</xref>) for the miRNA/smRNA-seq analysis. RNAs that were enriched by &gt; twofold with p-values &lt;0.05 were considered positives. Gene ontology analysis was carried out using the online web tool - Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Number of proteins versus the corresponding GO term is plotted with fold enrichment depicted by the size of the circle and -log10(P-value) by the color of the circle.</p><p>To determine the likelihood of mRNAs present in the p130cas droplet being differentially regulated in cells having the droplet, 46 mRNAs were randomly chosen from the pool of differentially regulated genes in HEK293T cells over-expressing mEGFP-p130Cas using the rand function in Microsoft Excel. This was iterated 10 times and between 0–3 genes of this randomly chosen genes overlapped with the 46 mRNAs determined to be present in the p130Cas droplet (&lt;5%).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Excel Sheet containing the list of proteins found in p130Cas droplets determined by mass spectrometry.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96157-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Excel Sheet containing the list of mRNAs found in p130Cas droplets determined by RNA sequencing.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96157-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Excel Sheet containing the list of differentially regulated mRNAs in HEK293T cells with p130Cas droplets induced by its overexpression as determined by RNA sequencing.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96157-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-96157-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided for Figure 1- figure supplement 1, Figure 7, Figure 7- figure supplement 1 and Figure 8-figure supplement 1.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Steven K Hanks (Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee) and Prof. Sarah Slavoff (Department of Chemistry, Yale University) for providing p130Cas Y15F plasmid and HEK293T cell line stably expressing EGFP-Dcp1A, respectively.

Specifically, the authors employed EGFP-tagged p130Cas constructs, endogenous p130Cas, and p130Cas knockouts and mutants in cell-based systems. These experiments in conjunction with various imaging techniques revealed that p130Cas drives assembly of LLPS condensates in a manner that is largely independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. This was followed by in vitro EGFP-tagged p130Cas-dependent induction of LLPS condensates and determination of their composition by mass spectrometry, which revealed enrichment of proteins involved in RNA metabolism in the condensates.

The second issue is the apparent lack of functional studies, and although the authors speculate that the described mechanism is likely to mediate the effects of focal adhesions on e.g., quiescence, experimental testing of this tenet was lacking.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96157.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Abhishek</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Houston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Keiichiro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yale University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New Haven</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yale University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New Haven</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>In this valuable study, Kumar et al., provide evidence suggesting that the p130Cas drives the formation of condensates that sprout from focal adhesions to cytoplasm and suppress translation.

It was also thought that this study incorporates an appropriate balance of imaging, cell and molecular biology, and biochemical techniques, whereby the methodology was found to be largely appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Two major weaknesses of the study were noted. The first issue is related to the experiments establishing the role of p130Cas-driven condensates in translational suppression, whereby it remained unclear whether these effects are affecting global mRNA translation or are specific to the mRNAs contained in the condensates. Moreover, some of the results in this section (e.g., experiments using cycloheximide) may be open to alternative interpretation. The second issue is the apparent lack of functional studies, and although the authors speculate that the described mechanism is likely to mediate the effects of focal adhesions on e.g., quiescence, experimental testing of this tenet was lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insights. Assessing translational inhibition for specific genes rather than global measurement of translation is an important direction for future work.</p><p>Regarding the cycloheximide experiments, we are unsure what the reviewer means. We used it as a control for puromycin labeling but this is a very standard approach. It seems more likely that the question concerns Fig 5G, where we used it to sequester mRNAs on ribosomes to deplete from other pools. In this case, p130cas condensates decrease after 2 minutes. The reviewer may be suggesting that this effect could be due to blocked translation per se and loss of short-lived proteins. We acknowledge that this is possible but given the very rapid effect (2 min), we think it unlikely.</p><p>Lastly, we agree with the reviewer that further functional studies in quiescence or senescence are warranted; however, these are extensive, open-ended studies and we will not be able to include them as part of the current paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
