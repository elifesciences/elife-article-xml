In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>PURA syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 650 patients worldwide, resulting in a range of symptoms including neurodevelopmental delays, intellectual disability, muscle weakness, seizures, and eating difficulties.</p><p>The condition is caused by a mutated gene that codes for a protein called PURA. PURA binds RNA – the molecule that carries genetic information so it can be translated into proteins – and has roles in regulating the production of new proteins. Contrary to other conditions that result from mutations in a single gene, PURA syndrome patients show ‘high penetrance’, meaning almost every reported mutation in the gene leads to symptoms.</p><p>Proske, Janowski et al. wanted to understand the molecular basis for this high penetrance. To find out more, the researchers first examined how patient mutations affected the location of the PURA in the cell, using human cells grown in the laboratory. Normally, PURA travels to P-bodies, which are groupings of RNA and proteins involved in regulating which genes get translated into proteins. The researchers found that in cells carrying PURA syndrome mutations, PURA failed to move adequately to P-bodies.</p><p>To find out how this ‘mislocalization’ might happen, Proske, Janowski et al. tested how different mutations affected the three-dimensional folding of PURA. These analyses showed that the mutations impair the protein’s folding and thereby disrupt PURA’s ability to bind RNA, which may explain why mutant PURA cannot localize correctly.</p><p>Proske, Janowski et al. describe the molecular abnormalities of PURA underlying this disorder and show how molecular analysis of patient mutations can reveal the mechanisms of a disease at the cell level. The results show that the impact of mutations on the structural integrity of the protein, which affects its ability to bind RNA, are likely key to the symptoms of the syndrome. Additionally, their approach used establishes a way to predict and test mutations that will cause PURA syndrome. This may help to develop diagnostic tools for this condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PURA</kwd><kwd>PURA syndrome</kwd><kwd>RNA binding</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>protein folding stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ni-1110/6-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niessing</surname><given-names>Dierk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural promiscuity in PURA protein, induced by patient mutations, impacts nucleic acid binding, unwinding, and subcellular localization, indicating why so many patients display the full disease spectrum of PURA syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of purine-rich element-binding (PUR) protein is highly conserved from plants to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molitor et al., 2021</xref>). Among the three vertebrate paralogs PURA, PURB, and PURG, the best-studied family member is PURA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergemann and Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 1995</xref>). It is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in several cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational gene regulation as well as mRNA transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chepenik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitsumori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tretiakova et al., 1999</xref>). Results from two independent knock-out mouse models demonstrated that PURA is important for postnatal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hokkanen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khalili et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, PURA has been implicated as a modulator of neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swinnen et al., 2020</xref>). PURA was reported to be present in the pathological RNA foci of both disorders and to protect against RNA toxicity upon ectopic overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swinnen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, PURA was shown to co-localize with an ALS-causing variant of the FUS protein in stress granules of ALS patients. Importantly, overexpression of PURA reduced the toxicity of mutant FUS by preventing its mis-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daigle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In 2014, two studies reported that a monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by sporadic mutations in the <italic>PURA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lalani et al., 2014</xref>). Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johannesen et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence.</p><p>Based on the crystal structures of PURA from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>dm</italic>PURA), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graebsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graebsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA. All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family, which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janowski and Niessing, 2020</xref>). Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α-(linker)-β-β-β-β-α topology, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). In a previous study, homology models based on the <italic>dm</italic>PURA crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graebsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>) were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>), no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome. With the exception of the unstructured N-terminal region and the very C-terminus, almost all mutations across the protein sequence appear to result in the full disease spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johannesen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome.</p><p>In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA’s subcellular localization, we observed impaired processing body (P-body) association but close-to normal localization to stress granules, indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA syndrome pathology. Two particularly interesting disease-causing variants, K97E and R140P, were further analyzed by structural means. The results indicated that the N-terminal PUR domain is unusually flexible in its fold and prone to misfolding upon mutation. In summary, we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of genetic variations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing genetic variations of uncertain significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of the mutations in <italic>hs</italic>PURA on stress-granule association</title><p>Several patient-related genetic variations are frame-shift events and thus predictably destroy the integrity of PURA.

To analyze whether the afore-mentioned patient-related genetic variations affect the localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to stress granules, the mutant and wild-type versions of full-length FLAG-tagged <italic>hs</italic>PURA were overexpressed in HeLa cells using a doxycycline-inducible expression cassette and cells were stressed for 1 hr with 500 µM sodium arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To find out whether stress-granule localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA depends on its nucleic acid-binding properties, we also utilized an RNA-binding-deficient version of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing 11 structure-guided point mutations (m11) as a control (for rationale and design of this mutant, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using an anti-FLAG tag antibody, we observed wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA to be distributed within the cytoplasm and accumulated in stress-granule structures, as seen by co-staining with the stress-granule marker G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the nucleic acid-binding-deficient mutant <italic>hs</italic>PURA m11 failed to co-localize to G3BP1-positive granules, indicating that RNA binding by <italic>hs</italic>PURA is necessary for its co-localization with stress granules. Furthermore, all three versions of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing patient-derived genetic variations localized to stress granules upon cellular stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In all three patient-related variants, no significant reduction of PURAs stress-granule association was seen when compared to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To assess the previously reported influence of <italic>hs</italic>PURA on stress-granule formation at endogenous PURA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daigle et al., 2016</xref>), we performed a small interfering (si) RNA mediated knockdown of <italic>hs</italic>PURA in HeLa cells and stained with the stress-granule marker G3BP1 and PURA. Efficient knockdown of endogenous PURA levels was validated with western blot experiments, showing a significant reduction of PURA protein upon knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected, endogenous <italic>hs</italic>PURA co-localized with G3BP1 upon stress treatment with 500 µM arsenite PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>) and thus behaved similar to overexpressed <italic>hs</italic>PURA. A PURA knockdown did not alter the total number of microscopically visible stress granules but resulted in a greater ratio of smaller stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Although this finding suggests that PURA is not essential for stress-granule formation, it should be noted that the knockdown did not completely eliminate PURA levels and hence a stronger effect on stress granules could occur in a complete knock-out of PURA. However, PURA syndrome patients bear a heterozygous mutation, suggesting that an incomplete knockdown likely resembles the pathogenic situation more closely than a full knock-out. Together these findings suggest that (1) reduced stress-granule association of functionally impaired <italic>hs</italic>PURA variants may not be a core feature of the PURA syndrome and (2) impaired stress-granule formation is not very likely to be directly responsible for the etiology of this disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to P-bodies is impaired by PURA syndrome-causing mutations</title><p>To assess the localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to cytoplasmic granules in unstressed conditions, we first recapitulated its recently reported localization to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molitor et al., 2023</xref>).

Furthermore, since F233del has been predicted to have impaired dimerization properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>), these findings suggest dimerization to be important for PURA’s P-body association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Processing-body association of <italic>hs</italic>PURA in HeLa cells is impaired by patient-derived mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) P-bodies were identified by immunostaining against DCP1A and against the N-terminal FLAG-tag of overexpressed <italic>hs</italic>PURA FL.

Since <italic>hs</italic>PURA was recently shown to be required for P-body formation in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molitor et al., 2023</xref>), PURA-dependent liquid-phase separation could potentially also directly contribute to the formation of these granules. Furthermore, a loss of such a function could potential contribute to the etiology of PURA syndrome. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a microscope-based approach to visualize the ability of RNA-bound <italic>hs</italic>PURA to phase separate in vitro. As a positive control for RNA-mediated liquid-phase separation, the protein FUS RGG3 was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofweber et al., 2018</xref>).

For <italic>dm</italic>PURA it had already been suggested that dsDNA strands are melted by intercalation of the β-ridge between both strands, followed by binding of both single strands to the cavities formed by the curved β-sheets on both sides of the β-ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Since we had already observed RNA binding by PUR repeats III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>), we examined its potential unwindase activity by utilizing a previously reported in vitro unwinding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darbinian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>) with dsDNA 5′-end labeled with a FAM fluorophore and 3′-end labeled with Dabcyl quencher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In this assay, double-stranded DNA results in low fluorescence signal due to the proximity of the quencher to the fluorophore. Upon strand separation their distance and fluorescence signal increase. We indeed observed strand separation in presence of the <italic>hs</italic>PURA III fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Of note, RNA binding as well as dsDNA strand separation by full-length <italic>hs</italic>PURA was much more efficient than by the PUR III domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>), indicating potential cooperativity of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains in unwinding double-stranded nucleic acids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PURA syndrome-causing genetic variations in the C-terminal PUR domain impair dimerization</title><p>Next, we used the <italic>hs</italic>PURA III structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) to perform an in silico analysis of the impact of patient-derived variants F233del and R245P on the structural integrity of the C-terminal PUR domain. While failure to obtain soluble recombinant PURA with F233del prevented a direct biophysical assessment of its dimerization state in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), this observation already indicated a misfolding of the C-terminal PUR domain upon mutation. Consistent with this observation is also the interpretation from homology modeling based on the previously published <italic>dm</italic>PURA III structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). There, the mutation was predicted to impair the structural integrity of the C-terminal <italic>hs</italic>PURA dimerization domain. F233 is part of the β-sheet and interacts with the α-helix of the other PUR repeat III within the PUR domain, contributing to dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Since in the PURA F233del variant, one residue is deleted, the orientation of all subsequent amino acids in the β-strand adopt the opposite orientation, likely resulting in a fold disruption of the β-sheet and possibly in impaired dimerization. In the case of the R245P variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), the exchange into proline also likely impairs β-strand folding by introducing a kink, which could also impact dimerization.</p><p>To provide direct proof for impaired dimerization upon the introduction of patient-derived F233del and R245P variants, we utilized the FRET-based NanoBRET assay in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). With this assay, we assessed the ability of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing the F233del and R245P patient variants to dimerize with wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA by measuring corresponding milli BRET Units (mBU). Of note, this combination of wild-type and mutated PURA protein is likely to recapitulate the heterozygous situation in patients. As a control for background signal, non-dimerizing <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II was measured (negative control). As a control for positive interaction, <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–III was used. While for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–III the signal intensities above the background level clearly indicated dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), protein fragments with either the F233del or the R245P variant showed strongly reduced signal intensities.

These differences were especially pronounced in PUR repeat II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>), where we observed a shift of register in the β-sheet by one amino acid in strand β5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and by two amino acids in strand β6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). More C-terminally, the loop linking β6 and β7 is shorter by two residues, thereby correcting again the sequence register within the next β-strands (β7 and β8).</p><p>Already the different molecules of wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II in the crystal unit cell revealed considerable conformational freedom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>), not only for narrow movements of the loops but also in the folding of the β-strands. For instance, in some of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of the wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II crystal, β4 and β8 strands formed bulges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). From all the areas of the structure, the β-ridge appears to be structurally the most divergent part. It is surprising that the K97E point mutation, which is located on the β4 strand of the β-ridge, induces the observed unusual change in the β-sheet arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>) without destroying the domain’s overall scaffold. Together these findings indicate great structural flexibility of the N-terminal PUR domain and promiscuity in folding, which results in misfolding upon mutation of a surface-exposed residue.</p><p>While CD measurements suggest a difference in folding between wild-type and K97E mutated PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II K97E indicates folding promiscuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), these data do not fully exclude unfolding of the domain in solution. To distinguish between a mutation-induced unfolding and an altered folded state, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with the <sup>15</sup>N-isotope-labeled samples of wild-type and K97E-variant <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II (E57–E212 fragments). First, <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-correlation spectra (HSQC) of both wild-type and K97E constructs showed a clear presence of the structured core, as evidenced by the well-dispersed resonances, with a significant number of residues adopting strand conformation (<sup>1</sup>H 8.5–9.5 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Next, we carefully compared the two HSQC spectra for individual resonances/residues. When the two spectra were overlaid, we observed that a significant number of resonances, especially in the region corresponding to the β-strand, were perturbed, which is clearly more extensive than just affecting the residues adjacent to the mutational site of residue 97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Finally, we performed the <sup>15</sup>N-heteronuclear NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) experiment on the K97E variant to measure the residue-level backbone dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The overlaid spectra of the absence (control) and presence (NOE) of <sup>1</sup>H-saturation show most resonances retaining their signal intensities (rigid, hetNOE ~0.8), while the resonances corresponding to the dynamic regions, likely N-/C-terminal and loop regions, with significantly reduced signal intensities or even negative (flexible). Importantly, all the resonances perturbed upon K97E mutation remained in the presence of <sup>1</sup>H-saturation, confirming that the structural rearrangement does not induce protein unfolding. Together, this shows that the K97E mutation does not induce global unfolding of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II, but rather triggers structural rearrangements mostly in the β-strand region.</p><p>To obtain a better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II we performed in silico molecular dynamics simulations. The <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II WT and K97E showed a similar overall profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>), where most of the flexibility or fluctuations are concentrated in the loops connecting strands β3 with β4 and β7 with β8. However, there are some statistically significant differences between the two proteins. The most significant differences concentrate on the two ends of the α1 helix, as well as the β5, β6, and β7 segments. In these regions, the K97E variant shows higher flexibility than the WT, with the N-terminal part of the α1 helix and the C-terminal end of β5 and β6 having the greatest gap between the two variants. The video for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II WT (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1"><xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref></xref>) and for <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II K97E (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) of the simulation confirms a large degree of fluctuation in this area, which can adopt many different conformations in both WT and the mutated variant. Finally, there is one region where the WT displays a higher flexibility than the K97E variant, the loop connecting β7 with β8 (residues 175–185), although only a few of those differences are significant. Of note, while these simulations are consistent with the increased flexibility of the K97E variant already suggested by the crystal structure, the time window of these simulations was too short to observe alterations between the two folding states as seen in this experimental structure.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-93561-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics simulations for the wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II (chain B).</title><p>Red color indicates the residues with significantly higher fluctuation described as p-value computed using the average position of the carbon alpha during the simulation as the reference point. 10 production runs were performed at the temperature of 310 K, resulting in 20 simulations of 100 ns each (1000 frames), or a total aggregate time of 1 µs for each protein.

The aim of this study was to understand how genetic variations causing this neurodevelopmental disorder affect the functional and structural integrity of the <italic>hs</italic>PURA protein. Toward this goal, we performed cellular, biophysical, and structural analysis with wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA as well as with versions of <italic>hs</italic>PURA bearing representative patient-derived variations.</p><p>To understand how genetic variations causing PUR syndrome affect the subcellular localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA, we performed immunofluorescence microscopic analyses in HeLa cells by overexpressing full-length <italic>hs</italic>PURA as well as disease-causing variants in each of the three PUR repeats, that is K97E, I206F, and F233del. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daigle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markmiller et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that <italic>hs</italic>PURA co-localizes to stress granules in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). As we did not observe significant changes in the association of patient-related variants of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to stress granules, it is suggested that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.</p><p>What is more, the knockdown of PURA resulted in reduced sizes of those stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that PURA indeed does have an influence on these granules. Future experiments will be necessary to unambiguously clarify the importance of PURA’s localization to stress granules for the etiology of PURA syndrome.</p><p>Very recently, <italic>hs</italic>PURA was reported to localize to P-bodies and that a PURA knockdown leads to a significant reduction in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molitor et al., 2023</xref>). While we recapitulated co-localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>hs</italic>PURA K97E and F233del variants failed to fully localize to P-bodies. Since the F233del mutation impairs the dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), this finding suggests the requirement of dimerization for efficient P-body association.</p><p>To address the question of what drives <italic>hs</italic>PURA accumulation in these phase-separated granules, we utilized a <italic>hs</italic>PURA version lacking RNA-binding activity (m11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This mutated protein failed to localize to stress granules or P-bodies, indicating that RNA binding is essential for both co-localization events. A potential RNA-dependent mechanism to recruit <italic>hs</italic>PURA into stress granules or P-bodies could be liquid-phase separation of <italic>hs</italic>PURA when bound to RNAs. In vitro experiments testing this potential property of <italic>hs</italic>PURA failed to yield phase-separated droplets. In summary, these findings indicate that RNA binding of <italic>hs</italic>PURA is important for its co-localization into stress granules and P-bodies, while we have no evidence that phase separation of <italic>hs</italic>PURA plays a role.</p><p>In a recent study, it was shown that a <italic>hs</italic>PURA knockdown in HeLa and in fibroblast cells resulted in down-regulation of the essential P-body proteins LSM14a and DDX6 and, most likely as a direct consequence, in strongly impaired P-body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molitor et al., 2023</xref>). In light of this report, our finding that patient-derived variants show impaired P-body association of <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) provide further evidence for a potential role of P-body localization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA for the etiology of PURA syndrome.</p><p>It has been reported that protein domains with PC4-like fold interact with RNA and DNA and are responsible for the separation of the double-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darbinian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janowski and Niessing, 2020</xref>). In this study, we show that both, the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA can separate double-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E, F</xref>) and to bind single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C, D</xref>). We also tested patient-derived variants of <italic>hs</italic>PURA to find out whether they exhibit impaired interaction with nucleic acids. For the K97E variant, we observed in EMSAs a reduced affinity to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Similar behavior of the K97E variant was observed in the strand-separation assay where it showed an almost complete loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). The latter is of interest since previous experiments had demonstrated that strand separation contributes to the neuroprotective activity of PURA in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXTAS disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore also probable that loss of strand-separation activity contributes to cellular abnormalities in <italic>hs</italic>PURA patie nts harboring the K97E mutation.</p><p>To establish a structural framework for these observations, we solved the crystal structures of <italic>hs</italic>PURA III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These human structures were overall very similar to previously published crystal structures from <italic>dm</italic>PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graebsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the crystal structures of <italic>hs</italic>PURA III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain (<italic>hs</italic>PUR III) that are caused by the patient-derived genetic variations F233del and R245P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Deletion of phenylalanine 233 within the β2-strand changes the orientation of all subsequent side chains within the β-sheet and likely destroys the interaction network required for the assembly of this secondary structure. A mutation of arginine 245 into proline likely disrupts β-strand folding by introducing a kink. Since repeat III mediates homodimer formation through swapping of its α-helices, the dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA is potentially affected by folding defects induced by either the F233del or the R245P mutation. Indeed, we could experimentally confirm by nanoBRET measurements in HEK293 cells that dimerization of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–III F233del and <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–III R245 is impaired when compared to wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PURA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Determination of the crystal structure of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II revealed larger flexible regions than the previously reported invertebrate structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graebsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graebsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2016</xref>), with considerable differences in the four molecules of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II in the asymmetric unit of the crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). These observations provide clear evidence that in particular strands β4 and β8 of the N-terminal PUR domain are dynamic and can adopt considerable local differences within the β-sheet. This flexibility already suggests structural promiscuity of PUR domains. It also indicates that they can at least partially compensate for structural perturbance by mutations, resulting in folded domains of genetically altered proteins. However, since these genetic variations were reported to cause PURA syndrome, such modest structural alterations must nevertheless result in functional impairment.</p><p>The interpretation of structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of PUR domains found experimental support from the crystal structure of its K97E variant, whose mutated residue has a solvent-exposed side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). The corresponding structure shows in the β5 strand a shift by one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and in the β6 strand by two amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) in one of the molecules of the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, these structural distortions did not result in major unfolding events of this PUR domain. Furthermore, NMR measurements with the <sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>1</sup>H-labeled N-terminal PUR domain yielded many spectral differences between the wild-type and K97E variants in particular within their β-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Despite these considerable structural changes, the NMR data also confirmed that the K97E-variant protein remains folded in solution and indicates that PUR domains may be able to partially compensate for mutations by folding promiscuity. These findings were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, indicating high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Instead of hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations, as reported for other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>), pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johannesen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). Also, in contrast to disorders such as the Rett syndrome, most of these variations cause the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our findings suggest that the flexibility and promiscuity of <italic>hs</italic>PURA domain folding render this protein particularly susceptible to mutations, even when amino-acid substitutions impose only moderate changes to the local charge and stereochemistry. This property of PUR domains might offer a structural explanation for why so many genetic variations across the sequence of <italic>hs</italic>PURA result in the full disease spectrum.</p><p>Not in all cases is the pathogenic effect of a given genetic alteration as clear as in the case of K97E. For instance, the replacement of arginine 140 by proline in <italic>hs</italic>PURA was initially reported to cause PURA syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Even though the corresponding patient did show symptoms, the severity and type of symptoms raised doubts about this initial diagnosis. In our assessment, neither the functional in vitro experiments nor the structural assessment of <italic>hs</italic>PURA I–II R140P yielded any significant differences from the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These experimental findings are consistent with R140P being rather a benign variant. Furthermore, after the initial description of R140P to be causative for PURA syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), subsequent genomic assessment of a relative of this patient uncovered that this person had the same genetic variation without any clear symptoms. Consequently, the R140P variant is now listed in the NCBI ClinVar database to be of ‘uncertain significance’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/192343/</ext-link>). Our data clearly suggest that this genetic variant is rather benign. In summary, an assessment of the different genetic variations in <italic>hs</italic>PURA indicates a clear correlation between defects observed in in vitro analyses and the reported pathogenicity in patients. Hence, in future such in vitro analyses may serve as a diagnostic tool to distinguish pathogenic from benign genetic variations.</p><p>Recently, two publications and one manuscript uploaded to a preprint server resorted to in silico predicted, AI-based structures to model the potential impact of PURA syndrome mutations on the structural integrity of <italic>hs</italic>PURA. Instead of assessing the physiologically correct dimer consisting of two PUR repeats, all three studies analyzed in silico-predicted <italic>hs</italic>PURA half-structure consisting of a single PUR repeat III with incomplete dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Rivera et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2023</xref>). Such half PURA structures are very unlikely to exist in solution and hence predictions based on them are of very limited value or worse, prone to yield wrong interpretations. We expect that our experimentally determined structures of the human N- and C-terminal PUR domains offer more physiological structural reference points for future assessments of novel <italic>hs</italic>PURA mutations and their potential pathogenicity in patients.</p><p>In summary, this study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of <italic>hs</italic>PURA were previously predicted to have folding defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reijnders et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, for all these cases expression tests with recombinant proteins resulted in insoluble samples, indicating that these variant proteins indeed have impaired folding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Whereas predictions of such misfolding events appear reliable, the examples of R140P (benign) and K97E (pathogenic) indicate that structural predictions of surface-exposed residues seem more complicated. In fact, the observed great promiscuity of folding of PUR domains indicates that also moderate surface mutations such as K97E can result in promiscuous folding and the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our study may serve as proof-of-principle that in vitro and structural studies are suitable tools to classify genetic variants in the <italic>hs</italic>PURA gene as potentially pathogenic or benign.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Establishment of stable cell lines</title><p>HeLa Kyoto cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; 4.5 g/l glucose, <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, phenol red; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

The authors combined structural biology, molecular dynamics simulation, and various cell biological assays to study the effects of disease-causing PURA mutations on protein structure and function. The corresponding data reveal a highly dynamic PURA structure and show that disease-related mutations in PURA cause complex defects in folding, DNA-unwinding activity, RNA binding, dimerization, and partitioning into processing bodies. These findings provide first insights into how very diverse PURA mutations can cause penetrant molecular, cellular, and clinical defects. This will be of substantial interest to cell biologists, neurogeneticists, and neurologists alike.</p><p>A particular strength of the present study is the structural characterization of human PURA, which is a challenging target for structural biology approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations are state-of-the-art, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of the differences between wild-type and mutant proteins. The functional consequences of PURA mutations at the cellular level are fascinating, particularly the differential compartmentalization of wild-type and mutant PURA variants into certain subcellular condensates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Review</bold></p><p>[...] A particular strength of the present study is the structural characterization of human PURA, which is a challenging target for structural biology approaches. The molecular dynamics simulations are state-of-the-art, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of the differences between wild-type and mutant proteins. The functional consequences of PURA mutations at the cellular level are fascinating, particularly the differential compartmentalization of wild-type and mutant PURA variants into certain subcellular condensates.</p><p>Weaknesses that warrant rectification relate to(i) The interpretation of statistically non-significant effects seen in the molecular dynamic simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed from the manuscript the sentence which indicated that we analyzed statistically non-significant effects. Therefore, the above statement has been resolved.</p><p>(ii) The statistical analysis of the differential compartmentalization of PURA variants into processing bodies vs. stress granules, and</p><p>We re-analyzed all cell-biological data and adjusted the statistical analysis of P-bodies and Stress-granule intensity analysis. The new, and improved statistics have replaced the original analyses in the corresponding figures (Figs. 1C and 2B).</p><p>(iii) Insufficient documentation of protein expression levels and knock-down efficiencies.</p><p>Quantification of protein expression levels by Western blotting is shown in Appendix Figure S1. Quantification of knock-down efficiencies by Western blot experiments (Appendix Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>Concerns and Suggested Changes</p><p>(a) I have only one concern about the computational part and that is about statements such as &quot;There are also large differences in the residue surrounding the mutation spot (residues 90 to 100), where the K97E mutant also shows much greater fluctuation. However, these differences are not significant due to the large standard deviations.&quot; If the differences are not statistically significant, then I would suggest either removing such a statement or increasing the statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s comment. We removed this sentence from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #2</bold></p><p>General Comments</p><p>This is a challenging structural target and the authors have made considerable efforts to determine the effect of several mutations on the structure and function. Many of the constructs, however, could not be expressed and/or purified in bacteria. However, it is not clear to what extent other expression systems (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic> or human) were considered and if this would have been beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use other expression systems because the wild-type protein is well-behaved when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In case a mutant variant cannot be expressed or does not behave well in <italic>E. coli</italic>, this constitutes a clear indication that the respective mutation impairs the protein’s integrity. Thus, by using *E. coli *as a reference system for all the variants of PURA protein, we could assess the influence of the mutations on the structural integrity and solubility. Only for the variants that did not show impairment in E. coli expression, we continued to assess in more detail why they are nevertheless functionally impaired and cause PURA Syndrome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns and Suggested Changes</p><p>(a) The schematic in Figure 3A would have been helpful for interpreting the mutations discussed in Figures 1 and 2. I would suggest moving it earlier in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the figure according to the Reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) I believe the RNA used for binding studies in Figures 3C and D was (CGG)8. Are the two &quot;free&quot; RNA bands a monomer and a dimer (duplex?)?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we do not know for certain, it is indeed likely that the two free RNA bands represent either different secondary structures of the free RNA or a duplex of two molecules. Of note, PURA binds to both “free” RNA bands, indicating that it either does not discriminate between them or melts double-stranded RNA in these EMSAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There also seems to be considerable cooperativity in the binding, so I wonder if a shorter RNA oligonucleotide might facilitate the measurement of Kds.</p></disp-quote><p>The length of the used RNA was selected based on the estimated elongated size of the full-length PURA and the presence of 3 PUR repeats. Assuming that one PUR repeat interacts with about 6-7 bases (data from the co-structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PURA with DNA; PDB-ID: 5FGP) and that full-length PURA forms a dimer consisting of three PUR repeats, the full-length protein in its extended form should cover a nucleic-acid stretch of about 24 bases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clear how the affinities were measured particularly for hsPURA III since free band is never fully bound at the highest protein concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>It was not our goal to measure Kds for the interaction of PURA variants with RNA. The EMSA experiments were conducted to detect relative differences in the interaction between PURA variants and RNA. To estimate the differences, we measured total intensity of the bound (shifted) and unbound RNA. The intensities of the bands observed on the scanned EMSA gels were quantified with FUJI ImageJ software. We calculated the percentage of the shifted RNA and normalized it. hsPURA III fragment shows much lower affinity therefore it does not fully shift RNA with the highest protein concentration when compared to the full-length PURA and to PURA I-II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Do the human PURA I+II and dmPURA I+ II crystallize in the same space group and have similar packing? Can the observed structural flexibility be due to crystal contacts?</p></disp-quote><p>hsPURA I+II and dmPURA I+II crystallize in different space groups with different crystal packing. In both cases, the asymmetric unit contains 4 independent molecules with the flexible part of the structure composed of the β4 and β8 (β ridge) exposed to solvent. In the case of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> structure, we do not observe any flexibility of both β-strands. In contrast, for the human PURA structure the β ridge exhibits lots of flexibility and it adopts different conformations in all 4 molecules of the asymmetric unit. We observe similar flexibility of the β4 and β8 (β ridge) in the structure of K97E mutant which contains 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. We would like to add that we expect crystal contacts to rather stabilize than destabilize domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, can the conformations observed for the K97E mutant be partially explained by packing?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the sequence shift observed for the β5 and β6 strands in hsPURA I+II K97E variant: although the β5 strand with shifted amino acid sequence is involved in the contact with the symmetry-related molecule with another β5 strand we don’t consider this interaction as a source of the shift. To be sure that the shift is not forced by the crystallization, we had performed NMR measurement which confirmed that in solution there is a strong change in the β-stands comparing WT and K97E mutant. This is an unambiguous indication that the structural changes observed in the crystal structure are also happening in solution. In addition, the MD simulations provide additional confirmation of our interpretation that K97E destabilizes the corresponding PUR domain. Taken together, we provide proof from three different angles that the observed differences indeed affect the integrity and hence function of the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Perhaps, it is my misunderstanding, but I find the NMR data on the Arg sidechains for the K97E confusing. If they are visible for K97E and not WT, doesn't this indicate that there is an exchange between two conformations or more dynamics in the WT structure? This does not seem to be the opposite of the expectation if K97E is thought to have more conformational flexibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to a technical issue (peak contour level), arginine side chain resonances were not clearly visible in the WT spectrum. The figure 5F has been updated. Now, they do correspond to those seen in the mutant spectrum. However, to prevent any confusion or mis/overinterpretation, we removed the sentence regarding arginine side chain: &quot;Intriguingly, arginine side chain resonances Nε-Hε were only visible in the K97E variant, while they were broadened out in the wild-type spectrum.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) The most speculative part of the paper is the interpretation of SG and PB localization of PURA in Fig 1 and 2. There is an important issue with the statistics that must be clarified because it would appear that statistical significance was determined using each SG or PB as an independent measurement. This is incorrect and significance should be measured by only using the means of three biological replicates. This is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rupress.org/jcb/article/219/6/e202001064/151717/SuperPlots-Communicating-reproducibility-and">well described here</ext-link>. It is not clear at this time if the reported P values will be confirmed upon reanalysis, and this may require reinterpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this clarifying comment and agree that the statistical analysis of P-body and stress granule was misleading. Of note, while the figures depicted all the values independent of the biological repeats, the statistical analyses were done on the mean value of each replicate of each cell line and not all raw data points.</p><p>We prepared new Plots, only showing the mean value of each replicate, and also re-calculated P-values. The values have changed only slightly in this new analysis because we now also included the previously labeled outliers (red points) to better demonstrate that significance still exists even when considering them.</p><p>In the new analysis of stress-granule association, only the value of the K97E mutant lost its significance, indicating that its association to stress granules is not lost. Therefore, we adjusted the following sentences in the manuscript.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Original: &quot;While quantification showed a reduced association of hsPURA K97E mutant with G3BP1-positive granules (Fig 1B), the two other mutants, I206F and F233del, showed the same co-localization to stress granules as the wild type control.&quot;</p><p>Corrected: &quot;In all the patient-related mutations, no significant reduction in stress granule association was seen when compared to the wild type control (Fig 1C).&quot;</p><p>Original: &quot;The observation that only one of the patient-related mutations of hsPURA, K97E, showed reduced stress granule association indicates that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.&quot;</p><p>Corrected: &quot;As we did not observe significant changes in the association of patient-related mutations of hsPURA to stress granules, it is suggested that that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome. It should be noted however that this interpretation must be considered with some caution as the experiments were performed in a PURA wild-type background.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(f) A western blot showing the level of overexpression of the PURA proteins should be shown in Figure 1 as well as the KD of endogenous PURA for Figure S2?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, a Western blot showing the level of overexpression of the different PURA proteins has been added as Appendix Figure S1.</p><p>A Western blot of the siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments of PURA and their corresponding control has been added to Appendix Figure S3. Quantification of three biological repeats showed a significant reduction of PURA protein levels upon knock down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(g) While I appreciate that rewriting is time-consuming, I would recommend considering restructuring the manuscript because I think that it would aid the overall clarity. I think the foundation of the work is the structural characterization and would suggest beginning the paper with this data and the biochemical characterization. The co-localization with SGs and PBs and how this may be relevant to disease is much more speculative and is therefore better to present later. While I appreciate that the structural interpretation of why some mutants localize to PBs differently is not entirely clear, I do think that this would provide some context for the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial version of the manuscript we first presented the structural characterization of PURA and afterwards the co-localization with SGs and PBs. As this reviewer stated him-/herself in (e), we also noticed that the SG and PB interpretation is the most speculative part of this manuscript. We felt that having this at the end of the results section would weaken the manuscript. On the other hand, we consider that the structural interpretation of mutations is much stronger and has a greater impact for future research. After long discussion we decided to swap the order to leave the most important results for the end of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors: Reviewer #3</bold></p><p>Concerns and Suggested Changes:</p><p>(a) For the characterization of G3BP1-positive stress granules in HeLa cells upon depletion of PURA, it remains unclear what is the efficiency of siRNA? The authors should provide a western blot to indicate how much the endogenous levels were reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the stated concern and addressed it accordingly. We had performed this experiment prior to submission but for some unknown reason it was not included in the manuscript.</p><p>The Western blot of siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments of PURA and their corresponding control is now shown in Appendix Figure S3. Quantification of three biological repeats, showed a significant reduction of PURA protein levels upon knock down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) How does knocking down PURA affect DCP1A-positive structures in HeLa cells? Would P bodies be formed even in the absence (or reduction) of total PURA?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the stated question is very interesting. In fact, we have already shown in our recent publication (Molitor et al., 2023) that a knock down of PURA in HeLa and NHDF cells leads to a significant reduction of P-bodies. We actually referred to this finding on page 6:</p><p>&quot;Since hsPURA was recently shown to be required for P-body formation in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (Molitor et al. 2023), PURA-dependent liquid phase separation could potentially also directly contribute to the formation of these granules.&quot;</p><p>On the same page, we also refer to the underlying molecular mechanism:</p><p>&quot;However, when putting this observation in perspective with previous reports, it seems unlikely that P-body formation directly depends on phase separation by hsPURA, but rather on its recently reported function as gene regulator of the essential P-body core factors LSM14a and DDX6 (Molitor et al., 2023).&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
