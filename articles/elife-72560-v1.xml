phenotype, while the most life-threatening features are cardiovascular abnormalities. Nowadays, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with subchronic (10 days) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results reveal the modulation of the ECS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key phenotypic alterations in WBS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare disorder that causes hyper-social behavior, intellectual disability, memory problems, and life-threatening overgrowth of the heart. Behavioral therapies can help improve the cognitive and social aspects of the syndrome and surgery is sometimes used to treat the effects on the heart, although often with limited success. However, there are currently no medications available to treat WBS.</p><p>The endocannabinoid system – which consists of cannabis-like chemical messengers that bind to specific cannabinoid receptor proteins – has been shown to influence cognitive and social behaviors, as well as certain functions of the heart. This has led scientists to suspect that the endocannabinoid system may play a role in WBS, and drugs modifying this network of chemical messengers could help treat the rare condition.</p><p>To investigate, Navarro-Romero, Galera-López et al. studied mice which had the same genetic deletion found in patients with WBS. Similar to humans, the male mice displayed hyper-social behaviors, had memory deficits and enlarged hearts. Navarro-Romero, Galera-López et al. found that these mutant mice also had differences in the function of the receptor protein cannabinoid type-1 (CB1).</p><p>The genetically modified mice were then treated with an experimental drug called JZL184 that blocks the breakdown of endocannabinoids which bind to the CB1 receptor<bold>.</bold> This normalized the number and function of receptors in the brains of the WBS mice, and reduced their social and memory symptoms. The treatment also restored the animals’ heart cells to a more normal size, improved the function of their heart tissue, and led to lower blood pressure. Further experiments revealed that the drug caused the mutant mice to activate many genes in their heart muscle cells to the same level as normal, healthy mice<bold>.</bold></p><p>These findings suggest that JZL184 or other drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system may help ease the symptoms associated with WBS. More studies are needed to test the drug’s effectiveness in humans with this syndrome. Furthermore, the dramatic effect JZL184 has on the heart suggests that it might also help treat high blood pressure or conditions that cause the overgrowth of heart cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a hemizygous deletion of a region containing 26–28 genes at chromosomal band 7q11.23. The estimated prevalence of this disorder is 1 in 7500 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strømme et al., 2002</xref>). Subjects present manifestations affecting mainly the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez Jurado, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Royston et al., 2019</xref>). WBS subjects show mild-to-moderate intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient (IQ) score from 40 to 90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellugi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mervis and Klein-Tasman, 2000</xref>) affecting their quality of life, where independent living is infrequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howlin and Udwin, 2006</xref>). One of the most prominent features of the cognitive profile of WBS is a hypersociable phenotype characterized by uninhibited social interactions and a reduced response to social threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gosch and Pankau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plesa-Skwerer et al., 2006</xref>). This phenotype is opposite to the archetypic social phenotype of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) characterized by lack of social interest and deficits in social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barak and Feng, 2016</xref>). Notably, the congenital cardiovascular phenotype in WBS is the major source of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins, 2018</xref>), characterized by elastin arteriopathy, supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and hypertension, which require in many cases surgical correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pober et al., 2008</xref>). While strategies such as behavioral intervention can improve WBS cognitive skills to some extent, or certainly invasive surgical procedures are available, their success is limited and WBS is largely without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morris et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several mouse models have been developed mimicking the genetic alterations observed in WBS subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osborne, 2010</xref>). Among them, the complete deletion (CD) mouse model resembles the most common hemizygous deletion found in WBS patients and displays several WBS phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, this model shows significant alterations in social behavior with enhanced sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>), cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ortiz-Romero et al., 2018</xref>), and a mild cardiovascular phenotype with cardiac hypertrophy, borderline hypertension, and mildly increased arterial wall thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>) among others.</p><p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a homeostatic modulatory system involved in a plethora of physiological functions at both central and peripheral levels. It is composed by cannabinoid receptors, including cannabinoid type-1 and cannabinoid type-2 receptors (CB1R and CB2R, respectively), their endogenous ligands or endocannabinoids (mainly, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG, and <italic>N</italic>-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA), and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and inactivation of these ligands. The main enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 2-AG and AEA are 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and <italic>N</italic>-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), respectively, while their degradation is controlled mainly by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), in the case of 2-AG, and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the case of AEA. CB1R and CB2R are both G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mainly signaling through inhibitory G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lutz, 2020</xref>). CB1R is highly expressed in different brain regions, including the hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex, where it is mainly located at presynaptic terminals. Endocannabinoids act as retrograde messengers binding to presynaptic CB1R and controlling neurotransmitter release at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>). The ECS regulates different behavioral responses including sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2017</xref>), cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>), or emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>), which are usually impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders. In fact, multiple lines of evidence point to the dysregulation of the ECS in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Navarro-Romero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, alterations of the ECS have been described in several mouse models for ASD with altered sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamberletti et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the pharmacological modulation of the ECS, whether targeting the cannabinoid receptors, or the enzymes involved in the degradation of the endocannabinoids, restores social abnormalities in some of these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamberletti et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, approaches targeting the ECS have been demonstrated to improve cognitive impairment and plasticity in mouse models of Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Navarro-Romero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, nowadays, there is an interest in developing clinical trials to assess the real therapeutic potential of the ECS in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller-Vahl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller-Vahl et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>So far, the role and therapeutic potential of the ECS in social behavior, cognition, and other key phenotypes of WBS had not been addressed before. In this study, we investigated the brain components of the ECS in the WBS CD model to find significant alterations in CB1R expression and G-protein coupling in specific brain regions. Additionally, we reveal that subchronic administration of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 normalized relevant behavioral phenotypes in CD mice including social behavior and memory alterations. Interestingly, this treatment also partially restored cardiovascular deficits and cardiac transcriptional alterations found in the model. Altogether, our results indicate that the modification of the endocannabinoid signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy worth evaluating in the context of WBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD mice exhibit social and cognitive alterations</title><p>We first analyzed social behavior in CD mice and their WT littermates using the Vsocial-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martínez-Torres et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This test allows to assess exploration, sociability, and preference for social novelty in the same mouse. Exploratory behavior was analyzed in the empty Vsocial-maze during the habituation phase by accounting the time mice explored both empty compartments (E1 and E2) at the end of the corridors. No changes were observed between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left). Then, during the sociability phase, both WT and CD mice displayed a significant preference for exploring a compartment with an unfamiliar juvenile mouse (stranger 1, S1) rather than an empty compartment. Notably, CD mice spent significantly more time than WT mice exploring S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle). Finally, during the preference for social novelty phase, CD mice explored similarly S1 and a novel unfamiliar juvenile mouse (stranger 2, S2) in contrast to WT animals that showed a significant preference for the novel stranger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right).

For this purpose, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of heart samples from mice treated with vehicle or JZL184 for 10 days. Before analyzing differences in gene expression, a principal component analysis was performed that revealed the samples used were informative with respect to the differences between experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). After that, we first compared RNA-seq data between WT and CD treated with vehicle, and found 3838 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a |log<sub>2</sub> fold-change| &gt; 0 and adjusted p values &lt;0.05 excluding the genes of the WBS critical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Of these DEGs, 1882 were upregulated and 1956 downregulated, indicating a relevant alteration in cardiac gene expression in CD mice.

This yielded 2122 upregulated and 1990 downregulated genes as a result of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Interestingly, overlap analysis revealed that 1433 DEGs, 73% of total downregulated in CD vehicle, were upregulated following JZL184 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Enrichment analysis identified significant changes in several GO biological processes. Notably, among the 10 most significant GO biological processes, the majority were related to cardiovascular function including heart contraction, heart process, regulation of heart contraction, muscle system process, cardiac muscle contraction, muscle cell development, and regulation of blood circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In addition, 1262 DEGs, 67% of total upregulated in CD vehicle, were downregulated after JZL184 treatment. Enrichment analysis identified much more diverse GO biological processes than those observed on the set of DEGs upregulated after JZL184 treatment, but also included some GO biological processes linked to the cardiovascular system such as regulation of vasculature development, endothelial cell migration, and blood vessel endothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). We put together a set of relevant pathways associated to cardiac function and hypertrophy to assess in a targeted manner the implication in CD mice and the effect of JZL184 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We observed many of the genes differentially expressed in CD mice related with these selected pathways. Surprisingly, the expression of most altered genes associated to cardiac function and hypertrophy in CD mice was reverted after JZL184 treatment and therefore could had a significant beneficial effect toward the pathological condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Moreover, when cardiovascular genes were only considered, the proportion of overlapping genes that reversed their expression as a result of treatment was higher than that described above: 79% of downregulated and 69% of upregulated in CD vehicle.

In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>), we observed a significant increase in the sociability of these mice compared to WT mice. This phenotype resembles the human condition in which WBS subjects show higher social motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riby et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riby and Hancock, 2009</xref>). In addition, we described for the first time that CD mice did not show preference for social novelty. This lack of social novelty preference is dependent on social stimuli since CD mice assessed on object novelty behaved similar to WT mice, and reflect a lack of habituation of CD mice to the previously encountered stranger mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>). This trait is reminiscent of the lack of habituation to faces observed through electrodermal measures in WBS individuals, which may cause that social stimuli appear continuously novel and interesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Järvinen et al., 2012</xref>). These results improved the characterization of the social behavior of CD mice as a significant model of WBS.</p><p>The analysis of the main components of the ECS revealed an increased density and functional coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins of CB1R in specific brain regions. Changes in CB1R density in polymorphic and granular layers of dentate gyrus were not accompanied by a commensurate decrease in CB1R-mediated G<sub>i/o</sub> protein activity suggesting a compensatory increase of CB1R function in these regions. Notably, density and functional coupling were increased in the amygdala, a region with major role in social behavior and where structural and functional abnormalities have been described in WBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muñoz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capitão et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Subchronic administration of the compound JZL184 at 8 mg/kg reduced to WT levels the time that CD mice spent exploring a stranger mouse. In addition, CD-treated mice spent more time exploring an unfamiliar stranger mouse instead of a familiar one, which indicates a restoration of the preference for social novelty and, it may suggest an improvement in the lack of habituation to social stimuli of CD mice. The treatment did not have any effect over WT animals, revealing that the effects of JZL184 over social interactions were selective for the social phenotype of CD mice.</p><p>In the context of social behavior, previous results using JZL184 showed that a single systemic dose of this compound increased social play in juvenile rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manduca et al., 2016</xref>) and social interaction in a mouse model of ASD, Shank3B−/− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folkes et al., 2020</xref>), and repeated social stress enhanced brain levels of 2-AG as well as decreased CB1R density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tomas-Roig et al., 2016</xref>). We did not observe a major effect over social behavior after a single dose of JZL184 in CD mice suggesting that changes in CB1R density and signaling after chronic exposure may be determinants of the effect observed over social behavior in CD mice.</p><p>Together, we demonstrated that the subchronic administration of JZL184 at 8 mg/kg normalizes social abnormalities of CD mouse model that resemble the human condition. Atypical social functioning of WBS subjects predisposes to social vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jawaid et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, WBS subjects have difficulties in peer interactions, maintaining friendships, and around 73% have experienced social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, they have an increased risk to suffer psychiatric conditions that are not associated to the IQ range or to language disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stinton et al., 2010</xref>) and seem related to the hypersocial phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng-Cordell et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, improvements in social functioning may have a beneficial effect over the quality of life of WBS subjects.</p><p>The treatment with the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 also restored short-term hippocampal-memory deficits of CD mice. In line with previous findings, our data also revealed that the JZL184 treatment did not have any effect over WT mice memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore, it is specific for the disorder context. Consequentially, our results on memory performance after JZL184 treatment could be further explored for cognitive restoration in the context of WBS.</p><p>As expected, we observed an increase in 2-AG brain levels resulting from JZL184 treatment for 10 consecutive days. In addition, we showed a decrease in CB1R density in the basolateral amygdala of CD mice. These results agree with previous studies that have pointed to a downregulation of CB1R in chronic JZL184-exposed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Llorente-Ovejero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinsey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlosburg et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, we observed a normalization of functional coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins of CB1R in the basolateral amygdala, the olfactory bulb and the <italic>CA1 stratum radiatum</italic> of CD mice. These results indicate that treatment with JZL184 is normalizing alterations in CB1R signaling in different key brain regions of CD mice, and that these may be mediating the beneficial effect of the treatment on social novelty and cognition.</p><p>Notably, treatment with JZL184 may have additional benefits in WBS since it proved to have positive effects on the cardiac phenotype of CD mice. CD animals present a cardiovascular phenotype with cardiac hypertrophy present from an early age and accompanied by a decrease in the ejection fraction. We observed a normalization of the heart weight/body weight ratio and left ventricular wall thickness and size of cardiomyocytes after treatment with JZL184, indicating an improvement in heart hypertrophy. Moreover, ejection fraction was also improved after JZL184 treatment. In addition, mild hypertension observed in CD mice was also reversed after JZL184 treatment. This could be of major clinical relevance, given that the cardiovascular phenotype is the most life-threatening complication of the disorder, and constitutes a relevant new potential therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disorders.</p><p>CB1R are predominantly located in the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem and hypothalamus but also in myocardium, postganglionic autonomic nerve terminals, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Therefore, modulation of the ECS may have effects on the cardiovascular system by multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haspula and Clark, 2020</xref>). Both agonists and antagonists of CB1R have shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular function in mouse models of different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bátkai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Slavic et al., 2013</xref>) pointing that effects of the modulation of CB1R over cardiovascular systems seems to be highly dependent on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haspula and Clark, 2020</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drugs are known to cause a regression of left ventricular hypertrophic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Zwieten, 2000</xref>). Therefore, a decrease in blood pressure in CD mice may play a role in the normalization of the hypertrophic phenotype. In addition, we observed the upregulation of CB1R mRNA levels of heart homogenates of CD mice in comparison to WT mice, while normalized after JZL184 treatment, which could be related to the beneficial effect of the drug.</p><p>Our transcriptome analysis of the heart tissue revealed that expression of the majority of genes that were down- or upregulated in the CD mice, and were linked to cardiovascular function (including cardiac muscle contraction and development, and endothelial cell migration and vasculature development), were brought back to control levels after treatment with JZL184. Of special significance was the genes deregulated in hypertrophic phenotypes, which were surprisingly responsive to the JZL184 treatment in the CD context. We also found an enrichment of genes related to macroautophagy/autophagy in CD samples after JZL184 treatment. These biological processes have been previously associated with improved cardiac function after heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi, 2019</xref>). We also found a decrease in expression of genes involved in translation and ribosomal function, which could be associated with reduced hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hannan et al., 2003</xref>). Further experiments may address the status of the different components of the ECS in the WBS context to better understand the mechanism of action of JZL184 over the cardiovascular system.</p><p>Additionally, other strategies of modulation such as inhibitors of CB1R activity could be worth assessing in CD mice, since one marked effect of repeated JZL184 was to desensitize CB1R in specific regions of the brain. Approaches with inhibitors could also help understand whether the effects of JZL184 are mainly due to the inhibition of CB1R function, or to other targets of enhanced 2-AG levels.</p><p>Taken together, the results of this study are of great importance given the few preclinical studies addressing potential treatments for WBS. In this regard, the modulation of the ECS may be an appropriate novel therapeutic strategy to tackle not only the social phenotype but also memory shortfalls and cardiovascular deficits in WBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014</xref>) and maintained on C57BL/6J background (backcrossed for nine generations). WT littermates were used as controls. Male mice aged between 8 and 16 weeks were used for experiments and groups were balanced by age. In order to test social behavior juvenile (4 weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice were used as stranger mice.</p><p>Mice were housed in controlled environmental conditions (21 ± 1°C temperature and 55 ± 10% humidity) and food and water were available ad libitum. All the experiments were performed during the light phase of a 12 hr light/dark cycle (light on at 8 <sc>am</sc>; light off at 8 <sc>pm</sc>). Mice were habituated to the experimental room and handled for 1 week before starting the experiments. All behavioral experiments were conducted by an observer blind to the experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Drug treatment</title><p>JZL184 (Abcam) was diluted in 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (Scharlau Chemie), 4.25% polyethylene glycol 400 (AppliChem), 4.25% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 76.5% saline. JZL184 was injected in a volume of 5 ml/kg of body weight, respectively. Drugs were administered daily by i.p. injection 2 hr prior behavioral testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral tests</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Sociability and preference for social novelty</title><p>Social behavior was performed in the V-social-maze (30 cm long × 4.5 cm wide × 15 cm height each corridor) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martínez-Torres et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, the protocol consists of three phases: habituation (Phase I), sociability (Phase II), and preference for social novelty (Phase III). First, experimental mice were introduced into the central part of the V-maze where they freely explored the two empty chambers at the end of the corridors. This measurement is important to discard a possible bias for one particular chamber and it informs about the baseline activity of the mouse in the maze. Then, during the sociability phase an unfamiliar juvenile mouse assigned as stranger 1, was placed in one of the chambers (both sides were alternated during the experiments). The experimental mouse was allowed to explore both compartments for 5 min. The experimenter recorded the time that the experimental mouse spent exploring the empty chamber or the stranger 1. Finally, the preference for social novelty phase was performed just after the sociability session. A second novel juvenile mouse, assigned as stranger 2, was placed inside the previously empty chamber, while the stranger 1 remained inside the same chamber as in Phase II. For 5 min, the experimental animal was allowed to explore the two strangers and the time spent exploring each stranger was recorded.</p><p>The procedure was performed in a sound-attenuated room with dim illumination 5–10 lux. A digital camera on top of the maze was used to record the sessions. Social exploration was considered when the experimental mouse directed the nose in close proximity (1 cm) to the vertical bars of the chambers. Mice that explored &lt;10 s both mice were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Acute treatment and last administration of the subchronic treatment (10 days) of JZL184 were performed 2 hr before the V-social-maze test.</p><p>In order to assess the exploratory behavior toward objects in the same setting, the same procedure was performed using objects instead of juvenile stranger mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Locomotor activity</title><p>After 9 days of treatment with vehicle or JZL184, locomotor activity was assessed 2 hr after the last administration. Spontaneous locomotor responses were assessed for 30 min by using individual locomotor activity boxes (9 cm width × 20 cm length × 11 cm high, Imetronic) in a low luminosity environment (5 lux). The total activity (number of horizontal movements) was detected by a line of photocells located 2 cm above the floor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Novel object-recognition test</title><p>The NORT was performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puighermanal et al., 2009</xref>) in a V-shaped maze (V-maze). On day 1, mice were habituated to the empty V-maze for 9 min (habituation phase). On day 2, two identical objects (familiar objects) were presented at the end of each corridor of the V-maze and mice were left to explore for 9 min before they were returned to their home cage (familiarization phase). After 10 min for short-term memory, or 24 hr for long-term memory, mice were placed back in the V-maze where one of the familiar objects was replaced by a new object (novel object) in order to assess memory performance (test phase). The time spent exploring each of the objects (familiar and novel) during the test session was computed to calculate a discrimination index (DI = (TIMEnovel − TIMEfamiliar)/(TIMEnovel + TIMEfamiliar)), defining exploration as the orientation of the nose toward the object within 2 cm from the object and with their nose facing it. A higher discrimination index is considered to reflect greater memory retention for the familiar object. Drug administration was performed 2 hr before the habituation and the training phases the 6th and 7th day of the subchronic treatment, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>The elevated plus maze was performed to measure anxiety-like behavior as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Escudero-Lara et al., 2020</xref>). The test consisted of a black Plexiglas apparatus with four arms (29 cm long × 5 cm wide), two closed arms with walls (20 cm high) and two open arms, set in cross from a neutral central square (5 × 5 cm) elevated 40 cm above the floor. Light intensity in the open and closed arms was 45 and 5 luxes, respectively. Mice were placed in the central square facing one of the open arms and tested for 5 min. The percentage of time spent in the open arms was determined as a measure of anxiety. The total entries in both arms were measured as a control for locomotion. Animals that exit the maze during exploration were excluded. Drug administration was performed 2 hr before the task on the 10th day of the subchronic treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Context fear conditioning</title><p>Context recognition memory was assayed in a conditioning chamber with an electrifiable floor, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomis-González et al., 2021</xref>). On training phase, mice were placed in the shuttle box, and after a period of free exploration, mice received a footshock (unconditioned stimulus [US]: 2 s, 0.35-mA intensity). Freezing behavior (lack of movement except for respiration) due to context reexposure was assessed in the same conditioning chamber 24 hr after the conditioning session. For testing, mice were placed again in the conditioning chamber for 5 min in the absence of the shock and the freezing behavior was manually counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Barnes maze</title><p>Spatial learning and reference memory were assessed using the Barnes maze, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomis-González et al., 2021</xref>). The maze consists of a circular platform (90 cm in diameter) with 20 equally spaced holes through which mice may escape from a bright light (300 lx). Only one hole allows the escape to a dark/target box. Visual cues were placed surrounding the maze for navigational reference. Smart v3.0 software was used to control the video-tracking system. Briefly, mice were first habituated to the maze. In this phase, animals were placed in the center of the maze covered by an opaque cylinder for 10 s. After removal of the opaque cylinder, mice were gently guided to the target hole by surrounding them within a cylinder with transparent walls so mice could see where the scape hole was located. Then, they were left inside the target box for 2 min and then taken to the home cage. One hour later, the first training phase was carried out. During training, each mouse performed two trials per day on 4 consecutive days. Each training trial started with the mouse placed in the center of the Barnes maze covered by an opaque cylinder for 10 s. Then, animals were allowed to explore the maze for 3 min. During this period, the primary latency to find the target hole was measured. Each training trial ended when the mouse entered the target box or after 3 min of exploration. The mouse was allowed to stay in the target box for 1 min. When mice did not reach the target box within 3 min, the experimenter guided the mouse gently to the escape box using a transparent cylinder. On day 5, the test trial was conducted 24 hr after the last training day. During the test trial, the target hole was closed. Animals were placed in the center of the maze covered by an opaque cylinder for 10 s. Next, exploration was analyzed during 90 s to reveal the number of pokes in each hole. Using the tracking system, the time spent in each quadrant (target, opposite, left, and right quadrants) were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Endocannabinoid quantification by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>The following <italic>N</italic>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols were quantified: AEA, DEA, DHEA, 2-AG, 2-LG, and 2-OG.

Afterwards, 5 ml of chloroform was added, and samples were shacked for 20 min and centrifuged at 1700 × <italic>g</italic> over 5 min at room temperature. Lower organic phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, reconstituted in 100 μl of a mixture water:acetonitrile (10:90, vol/vol) with 0.1% formic acid (vol/vol) and transferred to microvials for liquid chromatography analysis.</p><p>An Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole Liquid-Chromatograph equipped with a 1200 series binary pump, a column oven and a cooled autosampler (4°C) were used to separate endocannabinoids. Chromatographic separation was carried out with a Waters C18-CSH column (3.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm particle size). The composition of the mobile phase was: A: 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid in water; B: 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid in acetonitrile. Gradient chromatography was used to separate endocannabinoids and related compounds and the ion source was operated in the positive electrospray mode. The selective reaction monitoring mode was used for the analysis. Quantification was done by isotope dilution with the response of the deuterated internal standards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cannabinoid receptor autoradiography</title><p>Five fresh consecutive sections from brain of CD and WT mice were dried and submerged in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer containing 1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in the same buffer in the presence of the CB1R/CB2R radioligand, [<sup>3</sup>H]CP55,940 (3 nM) for 2 hr at 37°C. Nonspecific binding was measured by competition with nonlabeled CP55,940 (10 µM) in another consecutive slice. The CB1R antagonist, SR141716A (1 µM) and the CB2R antagonist, SR144528 (1 µM), were used together with [<sup>3</sup>H]CP55,940 in two consecutive slices to check the CB1R- or CB2R-binding specificity. Then, sections were washed in ice-cold (4°C) 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer supplemented with 1% BSA (pH 7.4) to stop the binding, followed by dipping in distilled ice-cold water and drying (4°C). Autoradiograms were generated by exposure of the tissues for 21 days at 4°C to β-radiation sensitive film together with [<sup>3</sup>H]-microscales used to calibrate the optical densities to fmol/mg tissue equivalent (fmol/mg t.e.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Labeling of activated G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins by [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS-binding assay</title><p>Brain samples from WT and CD mice were fresh frozen, cut into 20 µm sections, mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and stored (−25 °C) until used. Six fresh consecutive sections from each mouse were dried, followed by two consecutive incubations in HEPES-based buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 1% BSA, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 30°C. Briefly, sections were incubated for 2 hr at 30°C in the same buffer supplemented with 2 mM GDP, 1 mM DTT, and 0.04 nM [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer). The [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS basal binding was determined in two consecutive sections in the absence of agonist. The agonist-stimulated binding was determined in a consecutive brain section in the same reaction buffer in the presence of the CB1R/CB2R agonist, WIN55,212–2 (10 µM). The CB1R antagonist, SR141716A (1 µM) and the CB2R antagonist, SR144528 (1 µM), were used together with the agonist in two consecutive slices to check the specificity of the CB1R or CB2R functionality. Nonspecific binding was defined by competition with cold GTPγS (10 µM) in another section. Then, sections were washed twice in cold (4°C) 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), dried, and exposed to β-radiation sensitive film with a set of [<sup>14</sup>C] standards (American Radiolabelled Chemicals). After 48 hr, the films were developed, scanned, and quantified by transforming optical densities into nCi/g tissue equivalence units using a calibration curve defined by the known values of the [<sup>14</sup>C] standards (ImageJ). Nonspecific binding values were subtracted from both agonist- and basal-stimulated conditions. The percentages of agonist-evoked stimulation were calculated from both the net basal and net agonist-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS-binding densities according to the following formula: ([<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS agonist-stimulated binding × 100/ [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS basal binding) − 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Tissue preparation for immunofluorescence</title><p>Immediately after social behavior assessment, a group of mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) mixture in a volume of 0.2 ml/10 g of body weight.

were identified in a mouse model of Williams-Beuren syndrome (CD mice). Modulation of CB1R by JZL184 treatment improved social and cognitive phenotypes and also cardiac function of CD mice. These are important and novel findings highlight a role of the endocannabinoid system and its dysfunction in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) that provide a basis for future developments of potential therapeutics for WBS patients. This study will be of great interest to researchers and clinicians in the field of human genetic diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72560.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Emoto</surname><given-names>Noriaki</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00088z429</institution-id><institution>Kobe Pharmaceutical University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kwang Mook</surname><given-names>Jung</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.16.456474">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.16.456474v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jung Kwang Mook (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript explored the ECS properties in a mouse model for WS. This is a novel research field in Williams-Beuren syndrome, which is of high interest and relevance. The authors improved behavioral aspects by modulating the ECS, and also demonstrate improvement of cardiovascular function. Advancing our understanding of the ECS in Williams-Beuren syndrome is important given the fact that the treatment options for Williams-Beuren syndrome are still limited. Thus, this manuscript has potential to be ground-breaking. The use of the MAGL inhibitor, based on the ECS characterization and the alterations found in CD mice compared to control animals, is elegant and well-designed. The mechanisms how the treatment affects behavior and cardiovascular function are still unclear.</p><p>1. In general, the reviewer has difficulties with the test mice age range, being 8-16 weeks of age. This is relatively a wide range, that can lead to the unclear behavioral and other phenotypes described in the manuscript. Many studies showed dynamic changes in the developmental trajectory of the endocannabinoid system in the mouse brain. It might be that the 8-16 weeks of age range is responsible for the different stages of the endocannabinoid system maturation. This is a major issue in this study in the reviewer's opinion.</p><p>2. In the novel object test, why did the authors decided to exclude from the analysis mice that explored &lt;10s both objects? How many mice were excluded based on this criteria? Raw data should be included to allow the reader better judgement of the raw data (with all excluded mice included) and the presented final graphs.</p><p>3. In the novel object test, Figure 1c,d make no sense to me: the CD mice should have higher (!) discrimination index than WT based on Figure 1c, right, while Figure 1d shows the opposite.</p><p>4. The behavioral characterization in this study is very limited. Why the authors did not characterize other aspects related to WS, such as anxiety and motor capabilities? Tests such as elevated zero maze, open field exploration, rotarod, etc. will better define mice properties and the effectiveness of the drug to modulate these. Especially given the fact that previous article from this group showed motor deficits in CD mice (Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014) , Figure 5a-b. Also contextual fear conditioning can add more insights on fear and cognition in these mice with and without the drug. Similarly, short (i.e. 1 hour) and long-term memory (i.e. 24 hour) should be studied in the NOR test, to better define the results in Figure 1c,d (see comment below).</p><p>5.

Why should it affect heart properties, especially given such a short treatment of only several days? This should be further demonstrated and explained, with more histological and molecular and cellular evidence to support this surprising effect. Moreover, did these changes in weight etc. were specific to the heart only? The different number of mice in each of the tests presented in Figure 4 is unjustified and makes the reviewer feel uncomfortable.

If these results are not available, such limitation in interpretation should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72560.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript explored the ECS properties in a mouse model for WS. This is a novel research field in Williams-Beuren syndrome, which is of high interest and relevance. The authors improved behavioral aspects by modulating the ECS, and also demonstrate improvement of cardiovascular function. Advancing our understanding of the ECS in Williams-Beuren syndrome is important given the fact that the treatment options for Williams-Beuren syndrome are still limited. Thus, this manuscript has potential to be ground-breaking. The use of the MAGL inhibitor, based on the ECS characterization and the alterations found in CD mice compared to control animals, is elegant and well-designed. The mechanisms how the treatment affects behavior and cardiovascular function are still unclear.</p><p>1. In general, the reviewer has difficulties with the test mice age range, being 8-16 weeks of age. This is relatively a wide range, that can lead to the unclear behavioral and other phenotypes described in the manuscript. Many studies showed dynamic changes in the developmental trajectory of the endocannabinoid system in the mouse brain. It might be that the 8-16 weeks of age range is responsible for the different stages of the endocannabinoid system maturation. This is a major issue in this study in the reviewer's opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of the Reviewer about the age of mice. Although globally 8-16 weeks seems a wide age range, we did all our efforts to compare in each experiment, littermate mice with similar ages, to prevent any age bias. In the new version of the manuscript, we indicate now that mice in experiments were always balanced for genotype and age (Methods, Line 419).</p><p>Age-related changes in the components of the endocannabinoid system have been analyzed in different studies using rodent models. CB1R density and function and the levels of the main endocannabinoids have been described to be increased, reduced or remain without changes in different brain regions (Berrendero et al., 1998; Ginsburg and Hensler, 2022; Liu et al., 2003; Maccarrone et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003). These discrepancies may be due to the brain regions analyzed, the age of the animals, the models used or even the experimental procedures employed. In our experimental set, we did not find the age to be a relevant factor. We have analyzed the age of mice that were used on CB1R density, CB1R functional coupling to Gi/o proteins or endocannabinoid levels analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and we have not observed significant differences in the age between genotypes.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Age distribution of mice used for the characterization of the endocannabinoid system.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72560-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the novel object test, why did the authors decided to exclude from the analysis mice that explored &lt;10s both objects? How many mice were excluded based on this criteria? Raw data should be included to allow the reader better judgement of the raw data (with all excluded mice included) and the presented final graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We normally exclude those extremely rare mice with low (&lt;10 sec) total exploration time during the test session of the novel object-recognition test (Gomis-González et al., 2021; Navarro-Romero et al., 2019) since it has been demonstrated that a minimum amount of exploration is required for reliable discrimination between the familiar and the novel object (Akkerman et al., 2012). However, after close examination of the data in the present manuscript, we realized that in this study there were no mice excluded because of this criterion, so we have removed the referred sentence from the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the novel object test, Figure 1c,d make no sense to me: the CD mice should have higher (!) discrimination index than WT based on Figure 1c, right, while Figure 1d shows the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1c refers to an experiment specifically designed to assess motivation to explore object novelty. In this case, we took advantage of the Vsoc-maze employed for the social behavior (Figure 1a) but making use of novel objects (Object 1 and Object 2) instead of stranger mice (Stranger mouse 1 and Stranger mouse 2). The results in Figure 1c correspond to the exploration times in three consecutive phases performed in 15 min (Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, each 5 min) without any inter-phase interval. As displayed in Figure 1c, we observed that CD mice were able to discriminate between Object 1 (firstly encountered) and Object 2 (secondly encountered), and therefore in Phase II and Phase III CD and WT mice show similar preference for object novelty. In contrast, Figure 1d shows the novel object recognition test performed in the V-maze. This test consists of a habituation phase, a familiarization/training phase, and a test phase (each of 9 min), with an inter-phase interval of 10 min between the training and the test, where the animal goes back to the homecage, to assess short-term memory 10 min after the training phase (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1b for scheme). Therefore, the results in Figure 1c and 1d suggest that CD mice have preference for object novelty but when there is an interval of 10 min between training and test phases CD mice do not discriminate novelty which is interpreted as a deficit in short-term memory. To clarify this extent, we have added a new panel including a schematic cartoon of short-term object recognition memory in Figure 1—figure supplement 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The behavioral characterization in this study is very limited. Why the authors did not characterize other aspects related to WS, such as anxiety and motor capabilities? Tests such as elevated zero maze, open field exploration, rotarod, etc. will better define mice properties and the effectiveness of the drug to modulate these. Especially given the fact that previous article from this group showed motor deficits in CD mice (Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014) , Figure 5a-b. Also contextual fear conditioning can add more insights on fear and cognition in these mice with and without the drug. Similarly, short (i.e. 1 hour) and long-term memory (i.e. 24 hour) should be studied in the NOR test, to better define the results in Figure 1c,d (see comment below).</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s comments, we have explored several other behavioral traits. We investigated the anxiety-like responses in the elevated-plus maze where we found an effect of JZL184 in the anxiety phenotype in CD mice. JZL184 repeated administration produced an anxiogenic effect in CD mice, that turned CD behavior to WT control levels. We have now included this result in the manuscript Figure 3c</p><p>We further characterized the cognitive profile of CD mice. In particular, the long-term novel object-recognition memory test to assess low-arousal object-recognition memory, the context fear conditioning to study emotional memory and the Barnes maze test to study spatial learning and memory. Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences between CD and WT mice in any of these tests, now displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, so we did not further assess the effect of the treatment in these paradigms.</p><p>Regarding novel object-recognition memory, our new data on long-term memory reveals, together with the alterations already reported in short-term memory, better pinpoint the deficits in CD mice. These new data are displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2a. Regarding context fear-conditioning, our new data show no significant differences between genotypes, reminiscent of those previously reported using a similar approach (Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014). These new data are reported in Figure 1—figure supplement 2b. Finally, the Barnes maze test did not reveal significant differences between genotypes in spatial learning and memory, somehow resembling the results previously described for spatial memory in the Morris water maze (Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014). These new data are displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, c and d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the authors show that the i.p. administration of the drug resulted in increased drug concentration in the brain of treated mice control to placebo? The reported alterations following drug administration might be secondary to other drug-related responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment. We focused in assessing the levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG in the main brain regions of interest (amygdala and hippocampus) after treatment. We observed that repeated i.p. administration of JZL184 significantly increases between seven times in the case of the amygdala, and nine times, in the case of the hippocampus, the levels of 2-AG, but not those of anandamide. Both CD and WT mice showed similar levels of 2-AG after JZL184 treatment. We have included this new analysis in Table 2. While moderate increases of 2-AG levels (two-fold increases) were not observed to modify CB1R activity (Schlosburg et al., 2010), higher increases on 2-AG content were found to produce CB1R downregulation and desensitization (Chanda et al., 2010; Schlosburg et al., 2010). Therefore, the downregulation/desensitization of CB1R in specific brain regions in our experimental conditions could be associated to the strong upregulations of 2-AG levels (seven-to-nine-fold increases).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. From Figure 3c in this manuscript it seems that the drug has negative effects on NOR discrimination index in WT animals (together with the positive effects on CD mice). This should be discussed in the manuscript to emphasize the potential negative effects of the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect referred by the Reviewer was a non-significant tendency towards a decrease of discrimination index in WT mice treated with JZL184. According to our results in the present manuscript, JZL184 shows surprisingly different effects in WT and CD mice, which could be due to a potential different basal status of the ECS. Therefore, we think that we cannot extrapolate the results from WT mice into CD mice, that are the target of the treatment. In this regard, we have emphasized the differential effect of the drug depending on the genetic context (CD or WT), since this is a common feature in several observations in the manuscript, as for example, we undoubtedly observed in the cardiac phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Why did the authors not characterize the signaling of the CB1R following drug treatment in Figure 3 as they did in Figure 2? This should be demonstrated, to further study the drug's effect on the ECS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this important suggestion. We have now characterized CB1R G protein coupling after JZL184 treatment and we have demonstrated how CB1R-mediated Gi/o activity is normalized in specific brain regions of CD mice after treatment: basolateral amygdala, olfactory bulb and <italic>CA1 stratum radiatum</italic>. These results have been included in Figure 4, c and d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The effect of the drug on the cardiovascular phenotype is not clear. There is no mechanistic explanation for this change. RNAseq is only partial aspect of this surprising effect, and is not sufficient to understand and support the mechanistic explanation of how the drug affected cardiovascular properties in only a few days. Why should it affect heart properties, especially given such a short treatment of only several days? This should be further demonstrated and explained, with more histological and molecular and cellular evidence to support this surprising effect. Moreover, did these changes in weight etc. were specific to the heart only? The different number of mice in each of the tests presented in Figure 4 is unjustified and makes the reviewer feel uncomfortable. Why did the author have to use 20 mice in Figure 4b, but used 7 in Figure 4c? Can they show statistical power calculation to support the huge difference in mice number between the tests?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestions of the Reviewer on this point, we have obtained additional evidence to support the unexpected effect of JZ184 over the cardiovascular phenotype of CD mice.</p><p>First, we analyzed the size of cardiomyocytes in both CD and WT mice after JZL184 or vehicle treatment. The size of cardiomyocytes was found significantly increased in CD mice, and JZL184 treatment had a significant effect normalizing this anomalous parameter to WT values. This result further supports anti-hypertrophic effect of JZL184 over the cardiac phenotype of CD mice. These new data are included in Figure 5, b and c.</p><p>Second, we have now assessed systolic blood pressure of CD and WT mice exposed to JZL184 or vehicle treatment. CD mice showed an increase in arterial blood pressure that was reversed after JZL184 treatment (included in Figure 5e). Several studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drugs cause a regression of left-ventricular hypertrophic phenotype (Van Zwieten, 2000), and reversion of similar cardiovascular phenotypes have been observed after different short treatments (15 days to 4 weeks) in other animal models (Marin et al., 2011; Molkentin et al., 1998; Ng et al., 2017).</p><p>Therefore, a decrease in blood pressure in CD mice may be playing a role in the normalization of the hypertrophic phenotype. This argument has been included in the discussion (Discussion, Lines 379-382) as a potential explanation of the rapid effect of JZL184 treatment over the hypertrophic phenotype.</p><p>Third, we assessed CB1R mRNA levels in the heart using qPCR approaches (Figure 5f). We observed a significant upregulation of CB1R mRNA in CD mice which was reversed after JZL184 treatment. These results suggest that enhanced CB1R density in the heart relate to the hypertrophic phenotype, and that JZL184 can abrogate both hypertrophy and CB1R overexpression in CD mice, without any effect in WT mouse heart tissues.</p><p>Fourth, we addressed whether the changes in weight by JZL184 were specific to the heart. CD mice show a significant decrease in body weight from the first month of age and it is maintained until two years of age (Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014). The weight of the brain is proportional to this decrease in body weight, but this is not the case for the cardiac tissue. Indeed, we measured brain weight normalized by body weight and we did not observe any changes due to JZL184 sub-chronic administration. These measures of relative brain weight are now displayed in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Regarding previous Figure 4b, commented by the Reviewer, it showed the mean of the 20 observations in 20 sections corresponding to 4-5 animals (4-5 sections per animal) as it was indicated in the figure legend. In the new version of the manuscript, we show these data averaging 4-5 observations for every mouse, and groups are composed by 4-5 mice (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 4B, the muscle proportion measurement method in this paper is uncommon. Heart state whether in systolic or diastolic condition at the time of sacrifice and also paraffin processing possibly produce artifacts that will affect the heart morphology and ventricular wall thickness. It will be better if the researcher showed cardiac hypertrophy by echocardiography parameters such as PWTd (posterior wall thickness diastolic) PWTs (posterior wall thickness systolic).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have now included additional echocardiographic data in Supplementary File 3 regarding heart morphology: left ventricular posterior wall thickness diastolic (LVPWd), interventricular septum diastolic (IVSd), left ventricular mass diastolic (Lvmass) and LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDd). In addition, as mentioned above, we have performed histological studies where we analyzed cardiomyocyte size in all experimental conditions and found significant phenotype effects that were resolved to control levels by treatment (Figure 5, b and c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Since WBS cardiac phenotype includes hypertension, we suggest the researcher do blood pressure measurement in CD mice, also to confirm the phenotype from previous paper by Segura-Puimedon et al., Hum Mol Genet 2014.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the suggestion of the Reviewer and assessed arterial blood pressure in CD and WT mice treated with vehicle or JZL184. Sub-chronic treatment of JZL184 reversed hypertension of CD mice. We have included these new results to Figure 5e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Did the authors try acute or subchronic CB1 inverse agonists? If not, what would be the benefit of subchronic JZL184 than pharmacological CB1 inhibition? As a related discussion, do the authors expect any side (reverse) effect during the early phase of JZL184 treatment, maybe first a few days, when 2-AG signaling must have been elevated but changes in CB1 receptor expression is not occurred yet?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and valuable point. We did not assess the effect of acute or sub-chronic CB1R inverse agonists. This would be very interesting for future studies in CD mice. We included this possibility in the Discussion section (Discussion, Lines 397-401). We reasoned that the advantage of sub-chronic JZL184 treatment rather than pharmacological CB1R inhibition is that boosting the ECS with JZL184 may be particularly effective only on active sites of endocannabinoid production (Mechoulam and Parker, 2013), which could turn this approach more specific than a straight targeting of CB1R. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic inactivation of MAGL has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory properties under certain conditions by decreasing the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators, specifically, the eicosanoids derived from the arachidonic acid (Katz et al., 2014; Nomura et al., 2011; Pihlaja et al., 2015). Nomura et al., showed that in mice that have received lipopolysaccharide injection, JZL184 decreased inflammatory cytokine levels and hippocampal microglia did not show signs of activation. In addition, MAGL inactivation by JZL184 decreased hippocampal microglial reactivity in the hippocampus in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Pihlaja et al., 2015). Interestingly, it was recently described that CD mice show increased microglial reactivity in the hippocampus and motor cortex (Ortiz-Romero et al., 2021). Therefore, we cannot rule out, that the beneficial effects of JZL184 over CD mice may be in part mediated by these anti-inflammatory properties. Future studies should also address this question more specifically.</p><p>The possible effects during early phases of JZL184 treatment should be further explored in future studies. In the present study, we performed the Vsoc-maze for sociability and social novelty after a single administration of JZL184 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and we did not observe any significant effect of the treatment, while the repeated administration managed to improve the cognitive outcome. Then we focused the rest of the study on the effects of the sub-chronic schedule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Endocannabinoid levels quantified from discrete brain regions closely related to the behavioral tests could be a good addition. Also, usually, the absolute values rather than comparative units are displayed for these kind of quantitation results (maybe shown in Table 1 is %? The unit was not clearly defined).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the endocannabinoid levels of CD and WT mice in amygdala and hippocampus after administration of vehicle and of JZL184. We have not observed differences in endocannabinoids between CD and WT mice receiving vehicle. However, as expected, we observed the effect of JZL184 treatment over 2-AG levels in both WT and CD mice (Table 2). No changes were found in anandamide levels assessed in the same homogenates. Following the suggestion of the Reviewer, we have also changed relative values of Table 1 for absolute values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Does JZL184-induced normalization CB1 receptors density observed in hippocampus or heart that are related to other phenotypes (NORT or cardiac hypertrophy, respectively) that were normalized by JZL184? Otherwise, is it possible that the beneficial effects are actually a result from long-term elevation of 2-AG signaling? If these results are not available, such limitation in interpretation should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have assessed CB1R function after treatment in brain regions where CD mice presented CB1R activity alterations.

Regarding CB1R in the heart, we now report mRNA levels of CB1R. We observed a decrease in CB1R mRNA expression of CD mice normalized after sub-chronic treatment of JZL184. Overall, CD mice present alterations in CB1R in different key regions and JZL184 sub-chronic treatment is normalizing some of these changes. These new data are displayed in Figure 5f.</p><p>References</p><p>Akkerman, S., Blokland, A., Reneerkens, O., van Goethem, N.P., Bollen, E., Gijselaers, H.J.M., Lieben, C.K.J., Steinbusch, H.W.M., and Prickaerts, J.
