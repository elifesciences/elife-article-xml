In <italic>Drosophila</italic> polyploid cells, the SNF2-domain-containing SUUR protein inhibits replication fork progression within specific regions of the genome to promote DNA underreplication. While dissecting the function of SUUR’s SNF2 domain, we identified an interaction between SUUR and Rif1. Rif1 has many roles in DNA metabolism and regulates the replication timing program. We demonstrate that repression of DNA replication is dependent on Rif1. Rif1 localizes to active replication forks in a partially SUUR-dependent manner and directly regulates replication fork progression. Importantly, SUUR associates with replication forks in the absence of Rif1, indicating that Rif1 acts downstream of SUUR to inhibit fork progression. Our findings uncover an unrecognized function of the Rif1 protein as a regulator of replication fork progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>common fragile sites</kwd><kwd>replication timing</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd><kwd>under replication</kwd><kwd>polyploid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R00GM104151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nordman</surname><given-names>Jared T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AI110527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mallal</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>To regulate DNA copy number during development in Drosophila, the SUUR protein recruits Rif1 to replisomes where Rif1 inhibits replication fork progression, thus controlling copy number independently of origin firing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate duplication of a cell’s genetic information is essential to maintain genome stability. Proper regulation of DNA replication is necessary to prevent mutations and other chromosome aberrations that are associated with cancer and developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). DNA replication begins at thousands of cis-acting sites termed origins of replication. The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) binds to replication origins where, together with Cdt1 and Cdc6, it loads an inactive form of the MCM2-7 replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). Inactive helicases are phosphorylated by two key kinases, S-CDK and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), which results in the activation of the helicase and recruitment of additional factors to form a pair of bi-directional replication forks emanating outward from the origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). Although many layers of regulation control the initiation of DNA replication, much less is known about how replication fork progression is regulated.</p><p>In metazoans, replication origins are not sequence specific and are likely specified by a combination of epigenetic and structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggarwal and Calvi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cayrou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eaton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mesner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Remus et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, replication origins are not uniformly distributed throughout the genome. The result of non-uniform origin distribution is that, in origin-poor regions of the genome, a single replication fork must travel great distances to complete replication. If a replication fork encounters an impediment within a large origin-less region of the genome, then replication will be incomplete, resulting in genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newman et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, origin-poor regions of the genome are known to be associated with chromosome fragility and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Debatisse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Durkin and Glover, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Letessier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Norio et al., 2005</xref>). This highlights the need to regulate both the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication to maintain genome stability.</p><p>DNA replication is also regulated in a temporal manner where specific DNA sequences replicate at precise times during S phase, a process known as the DNA replication timing program. While euchromatin replicates in the early part of S phase, heterochromatin and other repressive chromatin types replicate in the latter portion of S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilbert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). Although the process of replication timing has been appreciated for many years, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling timing have remained elusive. The discovery of factors that regulate the DNA replication timing program, however, demonstrate that replication timing is an actively regulated process.</p><p>One factor that regulates replication timing from yeast to humans is Rif1 (Rap1-interacting factor 1). Rif1 was initially identified as a regulator of telomere length in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardy et al., 1992</xref>), but this function of Rif1 appears to be specific to yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, Rif1 has been shown to regulate multiple aspects of DNA replication and repair. In mammalian cells, Rif1 has been shown to regulate DNA repair pathway choice by preventing resection of double-strand breaks and favoring non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di Virgilio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zimmermann et al., 2013</xref>). Rif1 from multiple organisms contains a Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) interaction motif and Rif1 is able to recruit PP1 to DDK-activated helicases to inactive them and prevent initiation of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In yeasts, flies and mammalian cells, Rif1 has been shown to regulate the replication timing program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sreesankar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). The precise mechanism(s) through which Rif1 functions to control replication timing are not fully understood. For example, Rif1 has been show to interact with Lamin and is thought to tether specific regions of the genome to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foti et al., 2016</xref>). How this activity is related to Rif1’s ability to inactivate helicases together with PP1 in controlling the timing program remains obscure.</p><p>Studying DNA replication in the context of development provides a powerful method to understand how DNA replication is regulated both spatially and temporally. Although DNA replication is a highly ordered process, it must be flexible enough to accommodate the changes in S phase length and cell cycle parameters that occur as cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matson et al., 2017</xref>). For example, during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development the length of S phase can vary from ~8 hr in a differentiated mitotic cell to 3 – 4 min during early embryonic cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blumenthal et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spradling and Orr-Weaver, 1987</xref>). Additionally, many tissues and cell types in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are polyploid, having multiple copies of the genome in a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lilly and Duronio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zielke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In polyploid cells, copy number is not always uniform throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rudkin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hua and Orr-Weaver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spradling and Orr-Weaver, 1987</xref>). Both heterochromatin and several euchromatic regions of the genome have reduced DNA copy number relative to overall ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nordman et al., 2011</xref>). Underreplicated euchromatic regions of the genome share key features with common fragile sites in that they are devoid of replication origins, late replicating, display DNA damage and are tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andreyeva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yarosh and Spradling, 2014</xref>). The presence of underreplication is conserved in mammalian cells, but the mechanism(s) mammalian cells use to promote underreplication is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hannibal et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, underreplication is an active process that is largely dependent on the distribution of ORC and on the Suppressor of Underreplication protein, SUUR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how the SUUR protein functions will significantly increase our understanding of the developmental control of DNA replication. The SUUR protein has a recognizable SNF2-like chromatin remodeling domain at its N-terminus, but based on sequence analysis, this domain is predicted to be defective for ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>). Outside of the SNF2 domain, SUUR has no recognizable motifs or domains, which has hampered a mechanistic understanding of how SUUR promotes underreplication. Recently, however, SUUR was shown to control copy number by directly reducing replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>). SUUR associates with active replication forks and while loss of SUUR function results in increased replication fork progression, overexpression of SUUR drastically inhibits fork progression without affecting origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sher et al., 2012</xref>). These findings, together with previous work showing that loss of SUUR function has no influence on ORC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sher et al., 2012</xref>) and that SUUR associates with euchromatin in an S phase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolesnikova et al., 2013</xref>), further supports SUUR as a direct inhibitor of replication fork progression within specific regions of the genome. The mechanism through which SUUR is recruited to replication forks and how it inhibits their progression remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here we investigate how SUUR is recruited to replication forks and how it inhibits fork progression. We show that localization of SUUR to replication forks, but not heterochromatin, is dependent on its SNF2 domain. We identify an interaction between SUUR and the conserved replication factor Rif1, indicating they are in the same protein complex. Importantly, we demonstrate that underreplication is dependent on <italic>Rif1</italic>. Critically, we have shown that Rif1 localizes to replication forks in an SUUR-dependent manner, where it acts downstream of SUUR to control replication fork progression. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the process of underreplication and define a new function for Rif1 in replication control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SNF2 domain is essential for SUUR function and replication fork localization</title><p>As a first step in understanding the mechanism of SUUR function, we wanted to define how it is localized to replication forks. SUUR has only one conserved domain: a SNF2-like domain in its N-terminal region that is predicted to be defective for ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nordman and Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>). To study the function of SUUR’s SNF2 domain, we generated a mutant in which the SNF2 domain was deleted and the resulting mutant protein was expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>SuUR</italic> promoter. This mutant, <italic>SuUR<sup>∆SNF</sup>,</italic> was then crossed to an <italic>SuUR</italic> null mutant so that it was the only form of the the SUUR protein present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We tested the function of the SUUR<sup>∆SNF</sup> mutant protein by assessing its ability to promote underreplication in the larval salivary gland. We purified genomic DNA from larval salivary glands isolated from wandering third instar larvae and generated genome-wide copy number profiles using Illumina-based sequencing. We compared the results we obtained from the <italic>SuUR<sup>∆SNF</sup></italic> mutant to copy number profiles from wild-type (WT) and <italic>SuUR</italic> null mutant salivary glands. To identify underreplicated domains, we used CNVnator, which identifies copy number variants (CNVs) based on a statistical analysis of read depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abyzov et al., 2011</xref>).

At a precise time in their differentiation program, follicle cells cease genomic replication and amplify six defined sites of their genome through a re-replication-based mechanism. Early in this gene amplification process, both initiation and elongation phases of replication are coupled. Later in the process, however, initiation no longer occurs and active replication forks can be visualized by pulsing amplifying follicle cells with 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claycomb et al., 2002</xref>). Active replication forks resolve into a double-bar structure, where each bar represents a series of active replication forks travelling away from the origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Claycomb and Orr-Weaver, 2005</xref>). By monitoring SUUR localization in amplifying follicle cells, we can unambiguously determine if SUUR associates with active replication forks.</p><p>SUUR has two distinct modes of chromatin association during the endo cycle. It constitutively localizes to heterochromatin and dynamically associates with replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolesnikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swenson et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, SUUR localized to both replication forks and heterochromatin in amplifying follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the SUUR<sup>∆SNF</sup> mutant localized to heterochromatin, but its recruitment to active replication forks was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the SNF2 domain is important for SUUR recruitment to replication forks and is essential for SUUR-mediated underreplication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SUUR associates with Rif1</title><p>Interestingly, overexpression of the SNF2 domain and C-terminal portion of SUUR have different underreplication phenotypes. Whereas overexpression of the C-terminal two-thirds of SUUR promotes underreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolesnikova et al., 2005</xref>), overexpression of the SNF2 domain suppresses underreplication in the presence of endogenous SUUR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolesnikova et al., 2005</xref>). The C-terminal region of SUUR, however, has no detectable homology or conserved domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>). These observations, together with our own results demonstrating that the SNF2 domain of SUUR is responsible for its localization to replication forks, led us to hypothesize that SUUR is recruited to replication forks through its SNF2 domain where it could recruit an additional factor(s) through its C-terminus to inhibit replication fork progression.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that a critical factor interacts with the C-terminal region of SUUR to promote underreplication, we used immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry studies to identify SUUR-interacting proteins. We generated flies that expressed FLAG-tagged full-length SUUR or the SNF2 domain of SUUR under control of the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter, induced and immunoprecipitated these constructs and identified associated proteins through mass spectrometry. We verified that both full-length SUUR and the SNF2 domain were expressed equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). If SUUR recruits a factor to replication forks outside of its SNF2 domain, then we would expect this factor to be present only in full-length purifications and not in the SNF2 domain purification. A single protein fulfilled this criteria: Rif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Strikingly, underreplication is abolished upon loss of Rif1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We validated our sequence-based copy number assays with quantitative PCR at a subset of underreplicated regions using ddPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, we determined the read density at all euchromatic sites of underreplication called in our wild-type samples, which quantitatively demonstrates that Rif1 is essential for underreplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results demonstrate that underreplication is dependent on <italic>Rif1</italic>.</p><p>It is possible that the <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant indirectly influences underreplication through changes in replication timing. Underreplicated domains, both euchromatic and heterochromatic, tend to be late replicating regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belyaeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, if these regions replicated earlier in S phase in a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant, then this change could prevent their underreplication. In fact, SUUR associates with late replicating regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Filion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pindyurin et al., 2007</xref>). Due to their large polyploid nature, salivary gland cells cannot be sorted to perform genome-wide replication timing experiments. Because heterochromatin replicates exclusively in late S phase, however, late replication can be visualized when EdU is incorporated exclusively in regions of heterochromatin. To assess if <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants have a clear pattern of late replication in larval salivary glands, we isolated salivary glands from early 3rd instar larvae, which are actively undergoing endo cycles. We pulsed these salivary glands with EdU to visualize sites of replication and co-stained with an anti-HP1 antibody to mark heterochromatin. In wild-type salivary glands, only rarely (1 of 238 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells; 0.4%) did we detect EdU incorporation in regions of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with the lack of heterochromatin replication due to underreplication. In contrast, in both <italic>SuUR</italic> and <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants, we could readily detect cells that were solely incorporating EdU within regions of heterochromatin (32 of 327 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells; 9.8% for <italic>SuUR</italic> and 70 of 385 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells; 18.2% for <italic>Rif1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants still have a clear pattern of late replication. Given that heterochromatin underreplication is suppressed in a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant, although it is still late replicating, indicates that replication timing cannot solely explain the lack of underreplication associated with loss of Rif1 function.</p><p>While characterizing Rif1’s role in underreplication and patterns of DNA replication in endo cycling cells, we did observe differences in the heterochromatic regions of <italic>SuUR</italic> and <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants. First, although underreplication is suppressed in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the chromocenters were abnormally large in the <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant relative to an <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant as observed by DAPI staining consistent with the ‘fluffy’ enlarged chromocenters seen in Rif1 mutant mouse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>). Although, this phenotype was present in all endo cycling cells, it was especially dramatic in the ovarian nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, Illumina-based copy number profiles revealed an increase in copy number in some pericentric heterochromatin regions in the <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant relative to the <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that heterochromatin is partially, but not fully replicated in <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant endo cycling cells, consistent with previous cytological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Demakova et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, loss of Rif1 function appears to completely restore heterochromatic replication in endo cycling cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rif1 affects replication fork progression</title><p>SUUR-mediated underreplication occurs through inhibition of replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sher et al., 2012</xref>).

Previously, it was shown that a prolonged period of EdU incorporation in the <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant, within the 7.5 hr span of gene amplification, gives rise to the extended replication gradient at sites of amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>). Gene amplification starts synchronously in all follicle cells at stage 10B of egg chamber development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvi et al., 1998</xref>). By the end of gene amplification, however, only a subset of follicle cells display visual amplification foci as judged by EdU incorporation, likely representing a stochastic end to the gene amplification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>). To determine if Rif1 controls replication fork progression by increasing the period of EdU incorporation within the 7.5 hr time window of gene amplification, comparable to an <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant, we quantified the fraction of stage 13 follicle cells that were EdU positive. Similar to an <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant, loss of Rif1 function also resulted in a prolonged period of EdU incorporation with 34% of follicle cells visibly incorporating EdU in wild-type follicle cells, 100% in an <italic>SuUR</italic> mutant and 98.5% in the <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result suggests that Rif1 has a destabilizing effect on replication forks, resulting in a premature cessation of replication fork progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Rif1 acts downstream of SUUR</title><p>Rif1 could control SUUR activity and underreplication by at least two different mechanisms.

Although SUUR was recently shown to promote underreplication through inhibition of replication fork progression, the underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Through biochemical, genetic, genomic and cytological approaches, we have found that SUUR recruits Rif1 to replication forks and that Rif1 is responsible for underreplication. This model is supported by several independent lines of evidence. First, SUUR associates with Rif1, and SUUR and Rif1 co-localize at sites of replication. Second, underreplication is dependent on Rif1, although <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants have a clear pattern of late replication in endo cycling cells. Third, SUUR localizes to replication forks and heterochromatin in a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant, however, it is unable to inhibit replication fork progression in the absence of Rif1. Fourth, Rif1 controls replication fork progression and phenocopies the effect loss of SUUR function has on replication fork progression. Fifth, SUUR is required for Rif1 localization to replication forks. Critically, using the gene amplification model to separate initiation and and elongation of replication, we have shown that Rif1 can affect fork progression without altering the extent of initiation. Based on these observations, we have defined a new function of Rif1 as a regulator of replication fork progression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SNF2 domain and fork localization</title><p>Our work suggests that the SNF2 domain of SUUR is critical for its ability to localize to replication forks. This is based on the observation that deletion of this domain results in a protein that is unable to localize to replication forks, but still localizes to heterochromatin. SUUR has previously been shown to dynamically localize to replication forks during S phase, but constitutively binds to heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolesnikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nordman et al., 2014</xref>). SUUR associates with HP1 and this interaction occurs between the central region of SUUR and HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pindyurin et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the interaction between SUUR and HP1 is responsible for constitutive SUUR localization to heterochromatin, while a different interaction between the SNF2 domain and a yet to be defined component of the replisome, or replication fork structure itself, recruits SUUR to active replication forks during S phase.</p><p>Uncoupling of SUUR’s ability to associate with replication forks and heterochromatin also provides a new level of mechanistic understanding of underreplication. Overexpression of the C-terminal two-thirds of SUUR is capable of inducing ectopic sites of underreplication. In contrast, overexpression of the SUUR’s SNF2 domain, in the presence of endogenous SUUR, suppresses SUUR-mediated underreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolesnikova et al., 2005</xref>). Together with the data presented here, we suggest that overexpression of the SNF2 domain interferes with recruitment of full-length SUUR to replication forks, by saturating potential SUUR binding sites at the replication fork. Although the C-terminal region of SUUR is necessary to induce underreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolesnikova et al., 2005</xref>), the C-terminal portion of SUUR remains associated with heterochromatin in the SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> construct, but this protein is not sufficient to induce underreplication. We suggest that at physiological levels, the affinity of SUUR for replication forks is substantially diminished in the absence of the SNF2 domain. Our work raises questions about the biological significance of SUUR binding to heterochromatin, since without the SNF2 domain SUUR is still constitutively bound to heterochromatin, yet unable to induce underreplication. Additionally, SUUR dynamically associates with heterochromatin in mitotic cells although heterochromatin is fully replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swenson et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rif1 controls underreplication</title><p>While trying to uncover the molecular mechanism through which SUUR is able to inhibit replication fork progression, we have uncovered an interaction between SUUR and Rif1. Through subsequent analysis, we demonstrated that Rif1 has a direct role in copy number control and that Rif1 acts downstream of SUUR in the underreplication process. Although underreplication is largely dependent on SUUR, there are several sites that display a modest degree of underreplication in the absence of SUUR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Demakova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sher et al., 2012</xref>). In a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant, however, these sites are fully replicated and there is no longer any detectable levels of underreplication within any regions of the genome. It is possible that Rif1 is capable of promoting underreplication through a mechanism independent of SUUR. Therefore, we conclude that Rif1 is a critical factor in driving underreplication.</p><p>Further emphasizing the critical role Rif1 plays in copy number control, we have shown that Rif1 acts downstream of SUUR in promoting underreplication. SUUR is still able to associate with chromatin in the absence of Rif1 but is unable to promote underreplication. Underreplicated regions of the genome, including heterochromatin, tend to be late replicating, raising the possibility that changes in replication timing in a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant suppresses underreplication. <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant endo cycling cells of Drosophila display a cytological pattern of late replication, where heterochromatin is discretely replicated. While Rif1 controls replication timing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is necessary for the onset of late replication at the mid-blastula transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seller and O'Farrell, 2018</xref>), we argue that the changes in copy number associated with loss of Rif1 function are not solely due to a loss of late replication. This is supported by the clear pattern of late replication of heterochromatin in <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant endo cycling cells, although heterochromatin appears to be fully replicated in these cells. Previous work in mammalian polyploid cells has shown that underreplication is dependent on Rif1, which was attributed to changes in replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hannibal and Baker, 2016</xref>). It is important to note that Rif1-dependent changes in replication timing were not measured in this system and that many genomic regions transition from early to late replication in a <italic>Rif1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foti et al., 2016</xref>). Our work raises the possibility that Rif1 has a direct role in mammalian underreplication through a mechanism similar to that of Drosophila and may not simply be due to indirect changes in replication timing. Future work will be necessary to define the role of mammalian Rif1 in underreplication.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rif1 regulates replication fork progression</title><p>Our analysis of amplification loci demonstrates that Rif1 controls replication fork progression independently of initiation control, thus demonstrating that Rif1 has a specific effect on replication fork progression. Therefore, we have uncovered a new role for Rif1 in DNA metabolism as a regulator of replication fork progression and copy number control. Rif1 has been identified as part of the replisome in human cells by nascent chromatin capture, a technique that identifies proteins associated with newly synthesized chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alabert et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple studies have assessed whether loss of Rif1 function affects replication fork progression in yeast, mouse and human cells, but have come to different conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). DNA fiber assays have been used to measure fork progression in these studies and nearly all have shown that <italic>Rif1</italic> mutants have a slight increase in replication fork progression, although not always statistically significant. There could be several reasons for these differing results; Rif1 may control replication fork progression in specific genomic regions that may be underrepresented in some assays, Rif1 function could vary among different cell types, or sample sizes may have been too small to reach significance. Our observations, taken together with these previous studies, leave open the possibility that Rif1-mediated control of replication fork progression could be an evolutionarily conserved function of Rif1. We do not suggest that Rif1 is constitutively associated with replication forks in all cell types. Rather, Rif1 could be recruited to replication forks at a specific time in S phase, or in specific developmental contexts, to modulate the progression of replication forks and provide an additional layer of regulation of the DNA replication program.</p><p>How could SUUR and Rif1 function in concert to inhibit replication fork progression? We have shown that Rif1 retention at replication forks is dependent on SUUR. Additionally, underreplication depends on Rif1’s PP1-binding motif, raising the possibility that a Rif1/PP1 complex is necessary to inhibit replication fork progression. Rif1/PP1 dephosphorylates DDK-activated helicases to control replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, however, DDK-phosphorylated MCM subunits were shown to be necessary to maintain CMG association and stability of the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alver et al., 2017</xref>). This result suggests that continued phosphorylation of the helicase is necessary for replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alver et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that SUUR recruits Rif1/PP1 to replication forks where it is able to dephosphorylate MCM subunits, ultimately inhibiting replication fork progression. Although this mechanism needs to be tested biochemically, it provides a framework to address the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for controlling DNA copy number and could provide new insight into the mechanism(s) Rif1 employs to regulate replication timing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Drosophila</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Suppressor of</italic> <break/><italic>Underreplication</italic> <break/>(<italic>SuUR</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">FBgn0025355</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>D.</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rap1 interacting</italic> <break/><italic>factor 1 (Rif1)</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">FBgn0050085</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>D.</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT: <italic>Oregon R</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>D.</italic> <break/><italic>melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SuUR</italic></td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makunin et al., 2002</xref>) <break/>PMID: 11901119</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>w<sup>118</sup>;

For each biological replicate, 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells were pulsed with 10 μM EdU and immediately fixed in 2% formaldehyde (pulse samples) or pulsed with 10 μM EdU for 10 minutes and chased with 100 μM Thymidine for 30 min prior to fixation (chase samples). iPOND purifications were done according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dungrawala and Cortez, 2014</xref>) with the exception that LB3 was used in place of RIPA buffer. Purifications were processed for mass spectrometry as described above.</p><p>To quantify protein abundance in by mass spectrometry, raw mass spectrometry data were imported into Skyline version 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schilling et al., 2012</xref>). Chromatographic traces were manually inspected for proper peak picking and where necessary adjusted manually in the chromatographic window. Only matching isotopic envelopes that had an error &lt;5 ppm, an isotope dot product &gt;0.9, and similar retention times between samples were used. MS1 peak areas from each peptide and observed charge state were summed to get the intensity for a given protein. To account for variation between samples, each sample was normalized to histone H3 summed areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) with nascent DNA</title><p>S2 cells were grown in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gemini Bio Products) and 100 units/mL Penicillin Streptomycin (Life Technologies). For nascent DNA PLA, asynchronously growing S2 cells were seeded onto Concanavalin A-coated coverslips. After attaching to coverslips for 1 hr, cells were pulsed with 125 µM EdU for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then permeabilized in PBS + 0.25% Triton X-100 for 60 min. The cells were biotinylated using standard click chemistry conditions for 30 min. After washing 3 times, blocking was performed for 1 hr with Duolink blocking solution. Cells were incubated with their primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The following day, cells were washed in Duolink Wash Buffer A, then incubated at 37°C with the appropriate Plus and Minus PLA probes at a 1:5 dilution. After an hour, the cells were washed in Wash Buffer A twice, ligation buffer was made at 1:40 dilution and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed 2x in Wash Buffer A, then incubated in amplification buffer at 1:80 for 100 min at 37°C. Slides were washed in Wash Buffer B, then 1:100 dilution of Wash Buffer B before being mounted in Duolink In Situ Mounting Media with DAPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data access</title><p>Data sets described in this manuscript can be found under the GEO accession number: GSE114370.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kristie Rose and Hayes McDonald at the Vanderbilt Proteomics core for mass spectrometry and Olivia Koues from the VANTAGE core at Vanderbilt for Illumina sequencing.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers found the work of general interest but each felt that certain biochemical experiments needed to be done to shore up the conclusions drawn from the genetics.</p><p>This manuscript reports the interesting finding that SuUR and Rif1 have a relationship to regulate DNA replication in different cell types of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The manuscript is well written, the experiments well controlled, and the data well documented. It also reports new transgenes/mutants for both SuUR and Rif1. The data is convincing that SuUR and Rif1 co-purify, with certain caveats as to if the interactions are as direct as stated from embryos, and that both proteins promote under-replication in salivary glands and restrict the developmental window for fork progression during amplification. It is also convincing that Rif1 co-localizes to amplicon forks by immunnofluorescent labeling, that SuUR localization to these forks does not depend on Rif1, and that mutation of a putative PP1 interacting domain in Rif1 also results in more heterochromatic replication. The authors propose that the C terminal two-thirds of SUUR is important for interacting with an effector protein that suppresses replication fork progression. Thus they identify the protein as Rif1 and demonstrate that loss of Rif1 produces a phenotype similar to loss of SUUR: reversal of under-replication in endocyling cells. They show that Rif1 associates with elongating replication forks, that the association is dependent on SUUR and that the PP1 interacting motif of Rif1 is important for the suppression of replication fork progression.</p><p>As stated above, what is less clear is whether the SuUR and Rif1 interaction is direct, whether Rif1 inhibition of amplicon forks is &quot;direct&quot;, and the extent to which fork progression versus origin activity explain the effect of Rif1 mutants on under-replication in polyploid salivary gland. These rather opposing ideas should be discussed. Indeed, the data presented suggest that Rif1 localization to forks and its effect on replication is only partially dependent on SuUR. In general, there is a deficit of biochemical approaches (e.g. iPOND, DNA fiber analysis, pull down) to bolster the conclusions from the genetic and cytological data. A previous report for a Rif1 effect on forks in frog extracts also partially compromises novelty. Therefore, although the manuscript reports some interesting findings, there are a number of changes that would address rigor. Major points for revision are put into context below and will be required for revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that Rif1 affects &quot;fork progression.&quot; This is based on two observations: a) Rif1 mutant salivary glands still have a late replication pattern of EdU incorporation but increased copy number of some heterochromatic DNA, b) IF co-localization of Rif1 with forks and an extended developmental time window of replication fork migration at amplicons in Rif1 mutants. The first argument in salivary glands is very indirect. Only a subset of the under-replicated loci in salivary glands are affected, others remain fully under-replicated, and it is not surprising that some of the late replication program would be retained. Moreover, it is not directly addressed to what extent Rif1's known activity at origins explains the increased DNA copy number in the mutant, e.g. activation of dormant origins. The second observation for amplification shows that the developmental time window is extended but does not address whether fork rate is affected. It seems like the manuscript stops short of doing the key experiments to show Rif1 directly affects fork rate/stability, i.e. iPOND and DNA fiber analysis during amplification and genomic replication. One or another of such experimental approaches needs to be done.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that SNF2 domain is essential for SUUR function and replication fork localization. a) The authors should state in the Results that they are over-expressing the mutant using the hsp70 promoter. b) Does deletion of the SNF2 domain affect SUUR protein abundance (despite over-expression)? In Figure 1E, It appears some localization to heterochromatin remains but looks reduced. Is it possible to do a Western or other quantification of protein abundance? Going beyond those controls, has it been addressed whether the FLAG-SNF2 is sufficient for fork localization?</p><p>3) The SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> localizes to heterochromatin but not the amplifying loci. Is the protein as stable and expressed at the same level as wild type SUUR?</p><p>4) The SNF2 domain of SUUR did not co-IP Rif1. This is an important negative control. However, the co-IP was done after formaldehyde cross-linking like in a ChIP experiment. Are the authors sure that the SNF2 domain of SUUR is expressed to the same level as full length SUUR and localizes properly to the chromatin? In the same vein, is it possible that the interaction between SUUR and Rif1 will be lost if the samples were DNAsed? If the latter, then the idea that SUUR directly recruits Rif1 may be incorrect. SUUR may set up conditions at the fork that enable Rif1 to be recruited.</p><p>5) A notable omission is that the authors do not mention whether Rif1 mutants have a DNA replication phenotype in diploid cells. Perhaps a comment on this even if not known would be worth mentioning</p><p>6) The Rif1-PP1 mutant is believed to not interact with PP1 based on evolutionary arguments. A simple demonstration that WT Rif1 co-IPs PP1 (the authors have a very nice antibody to Rif1) and that the Rif1-PP1 mutant does not do so will greatly strengthen the hypothesis. Even with that result, it is still possible that the effector downstream of Rif1 is another protein (not PP1) that interacts with Rif1 near the same site as PP1. It is best to leave that possibility open.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39140.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that Rif1 affects &quot;fork progression.&quot; This is based on two observations: a) Rif1 mutant salivary glands still have a late replication pattern of EdU incorporation but increased copy number of some heterochromatic DNA, b) IF co-localization of Rif1 with forks and an extended developmental time window of replication fork migration at amplicons in Rif1 mutants.

The observation that loss of Rif1 function suppresses under-replication merely raised the possibility that Rif1 could control replication fork progression in endo cycling cells based on what is known about SUUR function.</p><p>We would like to make clear that loss of Rif1 function results in increased fork progression at all amplicons without altering the developmental time window of gene amplification. We have measured the distribution of egg chambers in wild-type and Rif1 mutant follicle cells to make this clearer. If the developmental window for gene amplification was increased, we would expect to see an increase in amplification stage egg chambers in the Rif1 mutant. In contrast, we see no difference in egg chamber between wild-type and the Rif1 mutant. These data have been added as a Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The increased percentage of EdU+ stage 13 follicle cells we observe in the Rif1 mutant reflects that forks are more stable and therefore extend the window of EdU incorporation. Importantly, this prolonged EdU incorporation is occurring within the same 7.5 hour time window of gene amplification as in wild-type follicle cells. We have also changed the text to distinguish between the period of EdU incorporation and the developmental window of gene amplification to make this crucial point more clear.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that DNA fiber analysis would be a convenient way to compare directly fork rates in under-replicated regions of wild-type and Rif1 mutant endo cycling cells. Under-replicated domains are where we predict Rif1 will have the strongest effect. Unfortunately, we would not be able to interpret this experiments because 1) UR domains are largely blocked for replication in wild-type endo cycling cells and 2) while UR is not complete, it is not known if the molecules that escape UR are at all affected by SUUR/Rif1. Therefore, we lack the proper, and interpretable, control for track length in UR domains for wild-type endo cycling cells. For example, the only visible tracks that we ultimately score within under-replicated domains may be those that are not affected by SUUR/Rif1.</p><p>We did, however, perform iPOND as the reviewers suggested. It is not feasible to perform iPOND in amplifying follicle cells due the large amount of hand-dissected material required for biochemical analysis. Therefore, we performed iPOND mass-spec in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured S2 cells and quantified Rif1 protein abundance in pulse and chase samples along with PCNA and Histone H1 controls, which should be enriched in the pulse and chase samples respectively. Our results reveal that Rif1 is enriched at replication forks in S2 cells and has been included as Figure 6—figure supplement 2A. Additionally, we used a proximity ligation assay (PLA)-based technique to monitor Rif1 localization at newly synthesized DNA. This recently developed technique, is the cytological equivalent of iPOND where the proximity of a protein of interest is monitored relative to newly synthesized DNA. Here show that Rif1 is associated with newly replicated DNA is cultured cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that SNF2 domain is essential for SUUR function and replication fork localization. a) The authors should state in the Results that they are over-expressing the mutant using the hsp70 promoter. b) Does deletion of the SNF2 domain affect SUUR protein abundance (despite over-expression)? In Figure 1E, It appears some localization to heterochromatin remains but looks reduced. Is it possible to do a Western or other quantification of protein abundance? Going beyond those controls, has it been addressed whether the FLAG-SNF2 is sufficient for fork localization?</p></disp-quote><p>Our observation that the SNF2 domain is essential for SUUR function was based on our analysis of the <italic>SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup></italic> mutant, where we deleted the SNF2 domain of SUUR and expressed this mutant form of <italic>SuUR</italic> under control of its own promoter. This was described in the first paragraph of the Results subsection “The SNF2 domain is essential for SUUR function and replication fork localization”. We did, however, use the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter to overexpress the SNF2 domain and full length SUUR protein for IP-mass spec experiments where we identified an interaction between SUUR and Rif1. We have added the following sentence to make this clear in the Results section “We generated flies that expressed FLAG-tagged full length SUUR or the SNF2 domain of SUUR under control of the hsp70 promoter, immunoprecipitated these constructs and identified associated proteins through mass spectrometry.” We also added included the following statement in the Materials and methods section “The resulting construct was cloned into the pCaSpeR-hs vector, which contains a <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter (Thummel and Pirrotta, V.: <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center”</p><p>Unfortunately, no reagents exist to monitor endogenous SUUR by Western blotting, which limits our ability to ensure that the SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> mutant is maintained at the same levels as wild-type SUUR. What we were able to do, however, is quantify the signal intensity of SUUR and SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> proteins at heterochromatin by quantitative IF. This analysis revealed no significant difference in levels of SUUR and SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> protein signal at heterochromatin, while there is a dramatic difference in SUUR and SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> protein levels at sites of amplification. This data has now been added as Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We currently do not know if FLAG-SNF2 is sufficient for fork localization. When we monitor FLAG-SNF2 localization in follicle cells, we see a strong staining throughout the nucleus. It is possible that this construct is at replication forks, but the overall chromatin signal may be masking signal at amplification regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The SUUR<sup>ΔSNF</sup> localizes to heterochromatin but not the amplifying loci.

Are the authors sure that the SNF2 domain of SUUR is expressed to the same level as full length SUUR and localizes properly to the chromatin? In the same vein, is it possible that the interaction between SUUR and Rif1 will be lost if the samples were DNAsed? If the latter, then the idea that SUUR directly recruits Rif1 may be incorrect. SUUR may set up conditions at the fork that enable Rif1 to be recruited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we have not provided any evidence that the interaction between Rif1 and SUUR is direct. We initially described the interaction as a ‘physical interaction’ to distinguish it from a genetic interaction. We have now repeated the IP in the absence of crosslinking, +/- benzonase, to support the idea that SUUR recruits Rif1 to replication forks rather than setting up a condition at the fork that enables Rif1 to be recruited. Our new results show a robust interaction between SUUR and Rif1 using NP40 extraction and treating extracts with benzonase to cleave DNA. We’ve combined these data with our initial Table 1 as a single figure (Figure 2). We have not been able to purify full-length SUUR for in vitro binding assays to test directness, however, our new results provide much more compelling evidence that SUUR and Rif1 are closely associated. We have described SUUR and Rif1 as being in the same complex rather than a physical interaction to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A notable omission is that the authors do not mention whether Rif1 mutants have a DNA replication phenotype in diploid cells. Perhaps a comment on this even if not known would be worth mentioning</p></disp-quote><p>While preparing this manuscript, Seller and O’Farrell published an elegant paper on the role of Rif1 in the diploid cells of the early embryo (Seller and O’Farrell, 2018). They demonstrate that Rif1 localizes to heterochromatin and is necessary to establish a program of late replication at the MBT. We have cited this manuscript and commented when appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Rif1-PP1 mutant is believed to not interact with PP1 based on evolutionary arguments. A simple demonstration that WT Rif1 co-IPs PP1 (the authors have a very nice antibody to Rif1) and that the Rif1-PP1 mutant does not do so will greatly strengthen the hypothesis. Even with that result, it is still possible that the effector downstream of Rif1 is another protein (not PP1) that interacts with Rif1 near the same site as PP1. It is best to leave that possibility open.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Seller and O’Farrell manuscript referenced above, it was shown that Rif1 can co-IP PP1. Furthermore, Sreesankar et al., previously demonstrated that an HA tagged version of PP1 could co-IP Rif1 (Sreesankar et al., 2015). We have tried to co-IP PP1 with Rif1 using our antibody and have found, unfortunately, that our antibody blocks that interaction between Rif1 and PP1. The epitope we used to generate the antibodies included the PP1-binding motif. Regardless, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude the possibility that another downstream effector molecule other then PP1 interacts with this region. We have raised this possibility in the Results and Discussion sections and have been careful to say that the PP1-binding motif is essential for Rif1 function rather than PP1 binding or an interaction between Rif1 and PP1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
