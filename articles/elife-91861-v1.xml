and enteroendocrine cells. Using both wild-type human FFAR2 and a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) variant we explored the activation and phosphorylation profile of the receptor, both in heterologous cell lines and in tissues from transgenic knock-in mouse lines expressing either human FFAR2 or the FFAR2-DREADD. FFAR2 phospho-site-specific antisera targeting either pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> or pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> provided sensitive biomarkers of both constitutive and agonist-mediated phosphorylation as well as an effective means to visualise agonist-activated receptors in situ. In white adipose tissue, phosphorylation of residues Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup> was enhanced upon agonist activation whilst Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> did not become phosphorylated. By contrast, in immune cells from Peyerâs patches Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> become phosphorylated in a strictly agonist-dependent fashion whilst in enteroendocrine cells of the colon both Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup> and Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> were poorly phosphorylated. The concept of phosphorylation bar-coding has centred to date on the potential for different agonists to promote distinct receptor phosphorylation patterns. Here, we demonstrate that this occurs for the same agonist-receptor pairing in different patho-physiologically relevant target tissues. This may underpin why a single G protein-coupled receptor can generate different functional outcomes in a tissue-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>free fatty acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/X001814/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name><name><surname>Milligan</surname><given-names>Graeme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000453/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name><name><surname>Milligan</surname><given-names>Graeme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differential agonist-induced phosphorylation of free fatty acid receptor 2 is shown in different tissues of transgenic mice engineered to express variant forms of the human ortholog of the receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) routinely are constitutively phosphorylated or become phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, located either within the third intracellular loop or the C-terminal tail, following exposure to activating agonist ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). This is generally accompanied by new or enhanced interactions with arrestin adapter proteins. Canonically this results in receptor desensitisation because the positioning of the arrestin precludes simultaneous interactions of the GPCR with a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein and hence âarrestsâ further G protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun and Kim, 2021</xref>). The earliest studies on GPCR phosphorylation determined that receptors exist in multiply phosphorylated states where numerous kinases, that include members of the G protein receptor kinase (GRK) family, second messenger-regulated kinases, and even those of the casein kinase family are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pitcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Torrecilla et al., 2007</xref>). Using mass spectrometry approaches and phospho-site-specific antibodies it emerged that the pattern of receptor phosphorylation was distinct among cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaya et al., 2020</xref>). This led to the notion that the tissue-specific signalling output of GPCRs might be determined, at least in part, by the pattern of receptor phosphorylation â a hypothesis coined the phosphorylation barcode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tobin et al., 2008</xref>). This notion has recently been taken a step further with appreciation that the conformation adopted by an arrestin on interaction with the phosphorylated form of a GPCR might be affected by the pattern of receptor phosphorylation and in turn this may affect the signalling outputs mediated by arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Latorraca et al., 2020</xref>). The challenge in fully appreciating the impact of the receptor phosphorylation barcode on the physiological activity of GPCRs is in the identification of the receptor-phosphorylation patterns in native tissues. Here, we address this issue by use of antibodies raised against specific phosphorylation sites within the free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2).</p><p>A number of GPCRs are able to bind and respond to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are generated in prodigious quantities by fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2023</xref>). The most studied and best characterised of these is FFAR2 (also designated GPR43) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognini et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeda et al., 2022</xref>). This receptor is expressed widely, including by a range of immune cells, adipocytes, enteroendocrine, and pancreatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognini et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeda et al., 2022</xref>). This distribution has led to studies centred on its potential role at the interface of immune cell function and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Curto and Milligan, 2016</xref>), as well as other potential roles in regulation of gut mucosal barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2023</xref>) and the suppression of bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sencio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schlatterer et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to being widely expressed FFAR2 is, at least when expressed in simple heterologous cell lines, able to couple to a range of different heterotrimeric G proteins from each of the G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>q</sub>, and G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this, however, studies suggest more selective activation of signalling pathways is induced by stimulation of FFAR2 in different native cells and tissues. For example, in white adipocytes stimulation of FFAR2 is clearly anti-lipolytic, an effect mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> proteins and reduction in cellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolognini et al., 2016a</xref>), whilst in GLP-1-positive enteroendocrine cells activation of FFAR2 promotes release of this incretin hormone in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and G<sub>q</sub>-mediated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolognini et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>A challenge in studying the molecular basis of effects of SCFAs in native cells and tissues is that the pharmacology of the various GPCRs that respond to these ligands is very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milligan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milligan et al., 2017b</xref>) and there is a particular dearth of antagonist ligands for anything other than the human ortholog of FFAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milligan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milligan et al., 2017b</xref>). Designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) forms of GPCRs contain mutations that eliminate binding and responsiveness to endogenously generated orthosteric agonists whilst, in parallel, allowing binding and activation by defined, but non-endogenously produced, ligands that do not activate the wild-type form of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shchepinova et al., 2020</xref>). Such DREADDs have become important tools to probe receptor function in the context of cell and tissue physiology. Here, in addition to studying wild-type human FFAR2 we also employed a DREADD form of human FFAR2 (hFFAR2-DREADD) that we have previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>) and characterised extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milligan et al., 2021</xref>). This has the benefit of providing both small, highly selective, water-soluble orthosteric agonists for FFAR2 and, when using the human ortholog of FFAR2, there are high affinity and well-characterised antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Milligan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milligan et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sergeev et al., 2017</xref>) that can be used to further define on-target specificity of effects that are observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterisation of phospho-site-specific antisera to identify activated hFFAR2-DREADD</title><p>We performed mass spectrometry on a form of hFFAR2-DREADD with C-terminally linked enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP) following its doxycycline-induced expression in Flp-In T-REx 293 cells. These studies identified phosphorylation at residue Ser<sup>297</sup> in both the basal state and after addition of the orthosteric hFFAR2-DREADD agonists (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (sorbic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>) or 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barki et al., 2022</xref>).

The potential pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum was able to identify a diffuse set of polypeptides centred at 70 kDa in preparations generated from vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the intensity of staining was increased in samples derived from cells after exposure to the hFFAR2-DREADD agonist MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast when samples were produced from a Flp-In T-REx 293 cell line induced to express a variant of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP in which both Ser<sup>296</sup> and Ser<sup>297</sup> were converted to Ala (hFFAR2-DREADD-PD1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) the potential pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum was unable to identify the receptor protein either with or without exposure of the cells to MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar studies were performed with the putative pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum on samples induced to express hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP. In this case there was no significant detection of the receptor construct in samples from vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), however, after exposure to MOMBA there was also strong identification of diffuse polypeptide(s) centred at 70 kDa corresponding to hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such staining was absent, however, when a variant hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP, in which in this case both Thr<sup>306</sup> and Thr<sup>310</sup> were altered to Ala (hFFAR2-DREADD-PD2), was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To ensure that the lack of recognition by the potential phospho-site-specific antisera was not simply due to poor expression of either the hFFAR2-DREADD-PD1 or hFFAR2-DREADD-PD2 variants, we also immunoblotted equivalent samples with an anti-GFP antiserum (that also identifies eYFP). This showed similar levels of detection of the approximately 70 kDa polypeptide(s) in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although as noted earlier we did attempt to generate a potential pSer<sup>324</sup>/pSer<sup>325</sup> antiserum, we were unable to detect the receptor using this in samples containing hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP exposed to either MOMBA or vehicle (data not shown). As such, this was not explored further. However, as we also generated both a hFFAR2-DREADD-PD3 variant, in which both Ser<sup>324</sup> and Ser<sup>325</sup> were altered to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and an hFFAR2-DREADD-PD4 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in which both Thr<sup>328</sup> and Thr<sup>329</sup> were altered to alanine, we assessed the effects of these changes on the capacity of MOMBA to promote interactions of wild-type and the phospho-deficient (PD) variants of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP with arrestin-3. MOMBA promoted such interactions with the intact DREADD receptor construct in a concentration-dependent manner with pEC<sub>50</sub>=4.62Â±0.13 M (meanÂ± SEM, n=3). The maximal effect, but not measured potency, of MOMBA was reduced for all the PD variants except hFFAR2-DREADD-PD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but in no case was the effect on maximal signal reduced by more than 50%. We hence combined these PD variants to produce a form of the receptor in which all potential phospho-acceptor sites in the C-terminal tail were altered to alanines (hFFAR2-DREADD-PD1-4). This variant was poorly able to recruit arrestin-3 (20.8Â±2.3% of wild-type receptor, mean Â± SD, n=3) in response to addition of MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is likely that GRK2 and/or GRK3 played a key role in allowing MOMBA-induced interaction with arrestin-3 because this was greatly reduced when cells expressing the wild-type form of the receptor construct were pre-treated with the GRK2/GRK3 selective inhibitor compound 101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marsango et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To extend this analysis we pre-treated cells induced to express hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP with either vehicle or compound 101 and then, after addition of MOMBA, assessed receptor phosphorylation as detected by the putative pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> and pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antisera. Pre-treatment with compound 101 did not substantially reduce MOMBA-mediated identification by either the pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum or the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylation of these sites are not controlled by GRK2/3 and that these are not, at least in isolation, sufficient to define interactions of the receptor with arrestin-3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of MOMBA on antisera recognition are both on-target and reflect receptor phosphorylation</title><p>The selective effect of the hFFAR2-DREADD agonist MOMBA in promoting enhanced phosphorylation of Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup> and in allowing phosphorylation of Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> was further substantiated because both these effects of MOMBA were re-capitulated by the second hFFAR2-DREADD-specific agonist, sorbic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Indeed, pre-addition of CATPB (10 mM) to cells induced to express hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP prevented the effects of MOMBA on receptor recognition by both the putative pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> and the pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, pre-addition of CATPB lowered the extent of basal detection of the receptor by the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As CATPB possesses inverse agonist properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudson et al., 2012b</xref>) this may indicate that at least part of the basal pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> signal reflects agonist-independent, constitutive activity of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP. Once more, parallel immunoblots using anti-GFP confirmed that there were similar levels of the receptor construct in vehicle and MOMBAÂ±CATPB-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To conclude the initial characterisation of the antisera we confirmed that both the putative pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> and pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antisera were detecting phosphorylated states of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP. To do so, after exposure of cells induced to express hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP to either vehicle or MOMBA, samples were treated with LPP prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. This treatment is anticipated to remove phosphate from proteins in a site-agnostic manner. Now, MOMBA-induced detection of the receptor by both pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> and pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antisera was eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as was most of the agonist-independent detection by pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MOMBA-induced phosphorylation of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP is also detected in immunocytochemical studies</title><p>The pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum was also effective in detecting MOMBA-induced post-activation states of hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP in immunocytochemistry studies. When induced in Flp-In T-REx 293 cells the presence of the receptor construct could be observed via the eYFP tag with or without exposure to MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, also in this setting, the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum was only able to identify the receptor after treatment with MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and, once again, pre-addition of CATPB prevented the effect of MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) without affecting direct identification and imaging of the receptor via the eYFP tag. Similar studies were performed with the hFFAR2 pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum with very similar outcomes. In this setting identification of hFFAR2 DREADD-eYFP by the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum was almost entirely dependent on exposure to MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and this was also prevented by pre-treatment with CATPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phospho-specific antisera differentially identify hFFAR2-DREADD in mouse tissues</title><p>To assess physiological roles of FFAR2 in mouse tissues without potential confounding effects of either activation of the related SCFA receptor FFA3 or non-receptor-mediated effects of SCFAs, we recently developed an hFFAR2-DREADD knock-in transgenic mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milligan et al., 2021</xref>). Here, mouse FFAR2 is replaced by hFFAR2-DREADD with, in addition, an appended C-terminal anti-HA epitope tag sequence to allow effective identification of cells expressing the receptor construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barki et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>White adipose tissue</title><p>FFAR2 is known to be expressed in white adipose tissue and we previously used these hFFAR2-DREADD-HA mice to define the role of this receptor as an anti-lipolytic regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). To explore the expression and regulation of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA more fully, we took advantage of the appended HA tag to immunoprecipitate the receptor from white adipose tissue taken from hFFAR2-DREADD-HA mice. As a control, equivalent pull-down studies were performed with tissue from âCRE-MINUSâ animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barki et al., 2022</xref>). These harbor hFFAR2-DREADD-HA at the same genetic locus but expression has not been induced and hence they lack protein corresponding to either hFFAR2-DREADD-HA or mouse FFAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). In all of these studies, and those using other mouse-derived tissues (see later), as well as an anti-protease cocktail, we included the phosphatase inhibitor cocktail PhosSTOP, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fritzwanker et al., 2023</xref>), to prevent potential dephosphorylation of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA and other proteins. Following SDS-PAGE of such immune precipitates from hFFAR2-DREADD-HA mice immunoblotting with an HA antibody resulted in detection of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA predominantly as an approximately 45 kDa species, with lower levels of a 40 kDa form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These both clearly corresponded to forms of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA as such immunoreactive polypeptides were lacking in pull-downs from white adipose tissue from CRE-MINUS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, parallel immunoblotting with an antiserum against the non-post-translationally modified C-terminal tail sequence of human FFAR2 identified the same polypeptides as the HA antibody and, once more, this was only in tissue from the hFFAR2-DREADD-HA and not CRE-MINUS animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, immunoblotting of such samples with the anti-pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum also detected the same polypeptides. However, unlike the hFFAR2 C-terminal tail antiserum, although the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum did identify hFFAR2-DREADD-HA without prior addition of a ligand, pre-addition of MOMBA increased immune detection of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is consistent with the ligand promoting quantitatively greater levels of phosphorylation of these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, pre-addition of the hFFAR2 antagonist/inverse agonist CATPB not only prevented the MOMBA-induced enhanced detection of the receptor protein by the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum but showed a trend to reduce this below basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Peyerâs patches act as immune sensors of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2023</xref>). Anti-HA staining showed extensive and high-level expression of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA in cells within these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Co-staining for CD11c indicated many of the hFFAR2-DREADD-HA-positive cells correspond to dendritic cells, monocytes, and/or macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Co-staining to detect the presence of the nuclear transcription factor RoRÎ³t also indicated, as shown previously at the mRNA level for mouse FFAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chun et al., 2019</xref>), that hFFAR2-DREADD-HA is well expressed by type-III innate lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). HA pull-down immune-captured hFFAR2-DREADD-HA from Peyerâs patches and associated mesenteric lymph nodes of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Anti-HA immunoblotting of such material indicated a more diffuse pattern of immunostaining than observed from white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This may reflect a more complex pattern of post-translational modifications, including differing extents of N-glycosylation (see later) than observed in white adipose tissue (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Once more, however, this range of HA-detected polypeptides did indeed all represent forms of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA as they were completely absent from HA immunocapture conducted in equivalent tissue from the CRE-MINUS animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Parallel immunoblots of such samples with the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum now indicated that, in contrast to adipocytes, hFFAR2-DREADD-HA became phosphorylated on these residues in a MOMBA-dependent manner, with no detection of phosphorylation of these residues without agonist treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, this effect of MOMBA was clearly mediated by the hFFAR2-DREADD-HA receptor because anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> recognition was entirely lacking when MOMBA was added after the addition of the hFFAR2 antagonist/inverse agonist CATPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) that blocks this receptor with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudson et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). Similar outcomes were obtained in this tissue with the anti-pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum. Basal detection of the immune-captured receptor was low and this was increased markedly by pre-treatment with MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). As for the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum the effect of MOMBA on recognition of the receptor was not observed when cells were exposed to CATPB in addition to MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Immunostaining of fixed Peyerâs patch tissue with the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum confirmed the marked agonist dependence of recognition of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA in such cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We detected a low level of immunostaining with this antiserum in Peyerâs patch tissue in the absence of addition of MOMBA but, as we detected a similar level of staining in tissue from CRE-MINUS animals, in both the presence and absence of MOMBA, this may represent a small level of non-specific reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In this tissue, immunostaining with the pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> antiserum indicated a degree of agonist-independent phosphorylation of these sites as this was not observed in tissue from CRE-MINUS mice, and a further increase in staining following pre-treatment with MOMBA was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

To do so we next employed Flp-In T-REx 293 cells that allowed doxycycline-induced expression of wild-type hFFAR2-eYFP. As the wild-type and DREADD forms of hFFAR2 are identical within their C-terminal regions it was anticipated that the anti-pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> and anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antisera would be able to detect phosphorylation of these residues in wild-type hFFAR2-eYFP, as noted for hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP, but instead regulated by SCFAs such as propionate (C3) rather than by MOMBA. Immunoblots using lysates from these cells with either of these antisera showed predominant identification of a group of polypeptides migrating with apparent mass in the region of 60 kDa after treatment of cells induced to express hFFAR2-eYFP with C3 (2 mM, 5 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Recognition in this setting of hFFAR2-eYFP by anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> was almost completely dependent on addition of C3 whilst, although also markedly enhanced by addition of C3, there was some level of identification of hFFAR2-eYFP by anti-pSer<sup>296</sup>/pSer<sup>297</sup> without addition of C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Parallel immunoblotting with anti-GFP confirmed the presence of similar levels of hFFAR2-eYFP both with and without treatment with C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and confirmed in addition that expression of the receptor construct was lacking if cells harbouring hFFAR2-eYFP had not been induced with doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As with the effect of MOMBA on the hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP construct, in studies using the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum, C3-induced recognition of the hFFAR2-eYFP receptor was lacking in the co-presence of the hFFAR2 antagonist CATPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

For most GPCRs, as well as interaction with members of the family of heterotrimeric G proteins, upon agonist occupancy this also results in rapid phosphorylation of various serine and threonine residues, usually within the third intracellular loop and/or the C-terminal tail. Often mediated by members of the GRK family of kinases such phosphorylation allows higher affinity interactions with arrestin proteins. Classically this is linked to desensitisation of receptor-mediated second messenger regulation, as binding of an arrestin usually occludes the G protein binding site. However, now and for a considerable period, it has been established that arrestin interactions can promote distinct signalling functions and that these might be dependent on the detailed architecture of the GPCR-arrestin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher et al., 2022</xref>). This can vary with the pattern of agonist-induced GPCR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eiger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2016</xref>).

Here, guided by combinations of mass spectrometry-identified sites of basal and agonist-regulated phosphorylation of a chemogenetically modified form of the SCFA responsive receptor FFAR2, and informatic predictions of sites that might be or become phosphorylated in an activation-dependent manner, we generated three distinct sets of antisera. For one of these, potentially targeting pSer<sup>324</sup>/pSer<sup>325</sup> hFFAR2-DREADD, we had no direct evidence from mass spectrometry performed on the receptor enriched from an HEK293-derived cell line expressing hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP of phosphorylation of these sites. Moreover, we failed to find evidence to support such phosphorylation, using the generated antiserum, in either the cell line or the mouse tissues we studied. As we will discuss for the other antisera, this does not however explicitly exclude that these sites might be phosphorylated in other tissues or settings. For the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> hFFAR2-DREADD antiserum we also did not find direct mass spectrometry support for phosphorylation of these residues in the HEK293-derived cell line. However, in both immunoblotting studies performed on lysates of these cells and in immunocytochemical studies, this antiserum was able to identify hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP in a sensitive and agonist activation-dependent manner. Moreover, experiments in which we denuded the receptor of phosphorylation by treatment with LPP demonstrated that the antiserum was only able to identify the phosphorylated receptor and mutation to Ala of both Thr<sup>306</sup> and Thr<sup>310</sup> also eliminated detection of the receptor, confirming the sites of modification.</p><p>To assess aspects of potential differential bar-coding we required a second antiserum able to identify a different site(s) of phosphorylation in hFFAR2-DREADD. Here, we did have direct mass spectrometry-derived evidence for basal phosphorylation of Ser<sup>297</sup> and, in addition, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of Ser<sup>296</sup>. In the same way as discussed for the anti-pThr<sup>306</sup>/pThr<sup>310</sup> antiserum we confirmed the specificity of this antiserum and showed in both immunoblotting studies and immunocytochemical studies that there was increased immunoreactivity of this antisera after cells expressing hFFAR2-DREADD were exposed to an appropriate agonist.</p><p>Most significantly in the context of phosphorylation bar-coding we were able to show tissue-selective phosphorylation of Thr<sup>306</sup> and Thr<sup>310</sup>. To do so we took advantage of a knock-in transgenic mouse line that we have characterised extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milligan et al., 2021</xref>). In this line we replaced mouse FFAR2 with hFFAR2-DREADD. In addition, this line has an additional in-frame HA epitope tag added to the C-terminus of the receptor. Both previously, and in the current studies, we have therefore detected the HA tag to identify specific cells expressing the receptor. Herein, however, we built on this to identify the activated receptor and cells directly expressing the activated receptor. These studies provided direct evidence of tissue-specific patterns of agonist-induced FFAR2 receptor bar-coding. In each of the three tissues we explored, white adipose tissue, immune cells in gut Peyerâs patches, and in lower intestine enteroendocrine cells, we observed in immunocytochemical studies both basal and agonist-enhanced phosphorylation of Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup>. By contrast, although we observed agonist regulation of Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> in both immune cells and enteroendocrine cells, these residues were not phosphorylated in white adipocytes. Hence, we provide clear evidence that the same agonist-GPCR pairing results in a different phosphorylation bar-code in adipocytes compared to Payerâs patch immune cells. In addition, the extent of phosphorylation of each of these sites was quantitatively much lower in colonic epithelial than either of the other tissues examined. As we have noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fritzwanker et al., 2023</xref>) successful outcomes of these experiments required the maintenance of phosphatase inhibitors throughout.</p><p>Importantly we also expanded these studies to a second transgenic knock-in mouse line in which we replaced mFFAR2 with wild-type hFFAR2-HA. This was to assess whether the regulation of receptor phosphorylation we observed in tissues from the hFFAR2-DREADD-HA-expressing line might differ from the wild-type receptor and, if so, whether this could possibly relate to the differences in the way the hFFAR2-DREADD agonist MOMBA activates the receptor compared to the endogenous SCFAs at the wild-type receptor. We considered this unlikely as we have previously shown indistinguishable characteristics of these two ligand-receptor pairs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, using HA immunoprecipitation from equivalent tissues from these two lines we observed very similar levels of expression of hFFAR2-DREADD-HA and hFFAR2-HA in both white adipose tissue and colonic epithelial preparations and in each the receptor constructs migrated similarly in SDS-PAGE suggesting that co- and post-translational modifications were at least similar. Moreover, as the DREADD variant differs from wild-type receptor only in two amino acids of the orthosteric ligand binding pocket, and the intracellular sections of the two forms are identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>), we anticipated that the phospho-site-specific antisera would recognise each in an equivalent manner. Overall, comparisons between tissues from the wild-type hFFAR2 and hFFAR2-DREADD-expressing animals were very similar. There was a hint that Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup> are more highly phosphorylated in the basal state when examining wild-type hFFAR2-HA mice but phosphorylation of Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> was entirely agonist-dependent in both Peyerâs patches and when using Flp-In T-REx 293 cells.</p><p>A further interesting feature, although not inherently linked to bar-coding, is that co-translational N-glycosylation, and potentially other post-translational modifications, of the hFFAR2-DREADD-HA receptor (and probably of hFFAR2-HA) was markedly different in these various tissues. As we were able to use the HA tag to immunoprecipitate the receptor from different tissues, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting studies showed that the predominant form of the receptor in colonic epithelium migrated as a substantially larger species than that isolated from white adipocytes, and this was also the case when the receptor was immune-enriched from Peyerâs patches and associated mesenteric lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). De-glycosylation studies using an enzyme able to cleave N-linked carbohydrate confirmed these differences to reflect, at least in part, differential extents of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The basis of the distinct bar-coding induced by MOMBA activation of hFFAR2-DREADD in adipocytes and Peyerâs patch immune cells remains to be understood at a molecular level. An obvious possibility is that, at least, the agonist-dependent element of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>296</sup>/Ser<sup>297</sup> and Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> is mediated by distinct GRKs and that the expression patterns or levels of the GRKs vary between these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthees et al., 2021</xref>). These and other possibilities will be assessed in future studies. In arrestin-3 interaction studies performed in HEK293 cells alteration of both Thr<sup>306</sup>/Thr<sup>310</sup> to Ala resulted in only a modest effect on MOMBA-induced recruitment of the arrestin, whereas alteration of both Ser<sup>296</sup> and Ser<sup>297</sup> to Ala produced a more substantial effect. However, it would be inappropriate to attempt to correlate this directly with the phosphorylation observed in different native tissues. FFAR2 is also expressed in other cell types and tissues, including in pancreatic islets. We have also highlighted previously that the G protein selectivity of agonist-activated FFAR2 varies between different cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). In time, an extensive analysis across a full range of tissues, which explores G protein, GRK (and potentially other kinases), and arrestin expression, as well as the integration of functions into cell signalling networks and physiological outcomes, will be required to fully appreciate the implications of tissue-selective FFAR2 phosphorylation bar-coding. Despite this, the current studies show clear evidence of how the same ligand-GPCR pairing generates distinct phosphorylation patterns and hence different âbar-codesâ in distinct patho-physiologically relevant tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (2bscientific, H-1200), anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche, 11815016001), cOmplete ULTRA Tablets, Mini, EASYpack Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 5892970001), PhosSTOP (Roche, 4906837001), NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0001), NuPAGE 4â12%, Bis-Tris, 1.0â1.5 mm, Mini Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0321BOX), Tris-Glycine Transfer Buffer (Thermo Fisher scientific, LC3675), Laemmli buffer (Sigma, 53401-1VL), Nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88018), TSA tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) detection kit (AKOYA Biosciences), SKU NEL702001KT, Tissue culture reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

harbouring hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP were cultured to confluence. Receptor expression was induced with 100 ng/ml of doxycycline for 24 hr, followed by 5 min stimulation at 37Â°C with sorbic acid or MOMBA (100 Î¼M). The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and TE buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails was added to the dishes followed by transfer of cells into pre-chilled tubes. The cells were homogenised and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 45 min at 4Â°C. The resulting pellet was solubilised in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, and 0.1% [vol/vol] 2-mercaptoethanol [pH 7.5]) and the protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP was immunoprecipitated using GFP-Trap Agarose resin (Proteintech) followed by separation on a 4â12% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue and the bands corresponding to hFFAR2-DREADD-eYFP (~75 kDa) were excised. Gel pieces were destained in 50% EtOH and subjected to reduction with 5 mM DTT for 30 min at 56Â°C and alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min before digestion with trypsin at 37Â°C overnight. The peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid and concentrated to 20 Âµl. The peptides were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO<sub>2</sub> beads packed into a StageTip column, and phosphorylated peptides were then eluted, dried, and then injected on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 trap and an Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a nanoLC Ultra 2D plus loading pump and nanoLC as-2 autosampler (Eksigent).</p><p>Peptides were loaded onto the trap column for 5 min at a flow rate of 5 Âµl/min of loading buffer (98% water/2% ACN/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Trap column was then switched in-line with the analytical column and peptides were eluted with a gradient of increasing ACN, containing 0.1% formic acid at 300 nl/min. The eluate was sprayed into a TripleTOF 5600+electrospray tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex Pte. Foster City, USA) and analysed in Information Dependent Acquisition mode, performing 120 ms of MS followed by 80 ms MS/MS analyses on the 20 most intense peaks seen by MS.</p><p>The MS/MS data file generated was analysed using the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Science Inc, Boston, MA, USA), against SwissProt as well as against our in-house database to which we added the protein sequence of interest, using trypsin as the cleavage enzyme. Carbamidomethylation was entered as a fixed modification of cysteine and methionine oxidation, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine as variable modifications. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the MS/MS mass tolerance to Â±0.1 Da.</p><p>Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.8.7, Proteome Software Inc) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 20.0% probability. Peptide Probabilities from X! Tandem and Mascot were assigned by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Peptide Probabilities from X! Tandem were assigned by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least two identified peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data analysis and curve fitting</title><p>All data presented represent mean Â± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using the GraphPad Prism software package v.10 (GraphPad). Concentration-response data were fit to three-parameter sigmoidal concentration-response curves. In the case of inhibition experiments with antagonists, an equivalent analysis was followed to fit an inverse sigmoidal curve. Statistical analyses were carried out on data derived from at least three independent experiments by performing one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnetâs or Tukeyâs post hoc test as indicated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The generation and characterization of both transgenic FFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing and CRE-MINUS mouse lines are detailed in Bolognini et al., 2019.

If two arrestins have to recognize 800 different phosphorylated GPCRs, is it possible that any barcode serves the same purpose: arrestin recognition followed by signal arrest and internalization?

Specifically, this approaches the question of how GPCR signals are directed to different outcomes under different conditions. There is rich complexity within this question; there are potentially billions of molecules that could interact with &gt;800 human GPCRs and thousands of molecular effectors that may be activated. However, these outcomes are filtered through a small number of GPCR-interacting proteins that direct the signal.</p><p>Experimentally, strengths include the initial experimental controls employed in characterizing their ever-important antisera, on which their conclusions hinge. In showing strong agonist-dependent and phosphosite-dependent recognition, as well as the addition of GRK inhibitors and eventually an antagonist and phosphatase treatment, the authors substantiate the role of the antiserum in recognizing their intended motifs. When employed, those antisera overall give clear indications of differences across variables in immunoblots, and while the immunocytochemical studies are qualitative and at times not visually significantly different across all variables, they are in large part congruent with the results of the immunoblots and provide secondary supporting evidence for the author's major claims. One confounding aspect of the immunocytochemical images is the presence of background pThr306/pThr310, like in Figures 4C and 6A and B. In 4A and C, while the immunoblot shows a complete absence of pThr306/pThr310, Figure 4C's immuno image does not. In 6A and B, a similar presence of pThr306/pThr310 is seen in the vehicle image, which is not strikingly over-shown by the MOMBA-treated image. In addition, only Ser/Thr residues of the C-terminus were investigated, while residues of ICL3 have long been known to direct signaling in many GPCRs. Because of the presentations of sequences, it was not clear whether there were residues of ICL3 that have the possibility of being involved.</p><p>It may be possible and further testable to show whether the residues that maintain basal phosphorylation could also be tissue-specific, especially considering the presence of pThr306/pThr310 detection in both the Figure 6A immunoblot's vehicle lane (but not MOMBA lane). The aforementioned detection in the immunocytochemical vehicle image could support differential basal phosphorylation in the enteroendocrine cells. Should this be the case, it could have confounded the initial mass-spec screen wherein the Ser residues were basally active in that cell type, while in a distinct cell type that may not be the case. Lastly, should normalized quantification of these images be possible, it may help in clearing up these hard-to-compare visual images.</p><p>It is noted that aspects of the writing and presentation may lead to confusion for some readers, but this does not affect the overall significance of the work.</p><p>Nevertheless, in terms of the global goal of the authors, the indication of differences in phosphorylation states between tissues is still evident across the experiments. Accordingly, the paper is overall strongly well-researched, well-controlled, and the conclusions made by the authors are data-grounded and not overly extrapolated. Providing direct evidence for the tissue-based branch of the barcode hypothesis is both novel and significant for the field, and the paper leaves room for much more exciting research to be done in the area, opening the door for new questions and hypotheses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91861.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors generate and characterize two phosphospecific antisera for FFA2 receptor and claim a &quot;bar code&quot; difference between white fat and Peyers patches.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The question is interesting and the antibody characterization is convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The mass spectrometry analysis is not convincing because the method is not quantitative (no SILAC, TMT, internal standards etc). Figure 1 shows single tryptic peptides with one and two phosphorylation fragmentations as claimed, but there is no data testing the abundance of these so the differences claimed between cell treatment conditions are not established.</p><p>The blot analysis cannot distinguish 296/7 but it does convincingly show an agonist increase. Can the authors clarify why the amount of constitutive phosphorylation is much higher in the example blot in Figure 2 than in Figure 3? It would be helpful to quantify this across more than one example, like in Figures 4 and 5 for tissue.</p><p>Compound 101 is shown in Figure 2 to block barrestin recruitment. I agree this suggests phosphorylation mediated by GRK2/3 but this is not tested. The new antibodies should be good for this so I don't understand why the indirect approach.</p><p>The conditions used to inhibit dephosphorylation are not specified, the method only says &quot;phosphatase inhibitors&quot;. How do the authors know that low P at 306/7 in white fat is not a result of dephosphorylation during sample preparation?

We have considered these, added additional data and made various changes to the text as detailed below. We now submit a modified version that we would be happy to view as the âVersion of Recordâ.</p><p>We are very pleased to note the highly positive reports from the reviewers. The major change we have made is to alter the Introduction to include further consideration of the development of the âbar-codeâ hypothesis. As highlighted by reviewer 2 the Lefkowitz/Duke University Group have been major proponents of this concept. However, as with many topics their views did not emerge in isolation. Indeed we (specifically Tobin) were developing similar ideas in the same period (see Tobin et al., (2008) Trends Pharmacol Sci 29, 413-420). Moreover, other groups, particularly that of Clark and collaborators at University of Texas, were developing similar ideas using the beta2-adrenoceptor as a model at least as early as this (e.g. Tran et al., (2004) Mol Pharmacol 65, 196-206). As such we have re-written parts of the Introduction to reflect these early studies whilst retaining information on more recent studies that have greatly expanded such early work. This has resulted in the addition of extra references and re-numbering of the Reference section. We have also provided statistical analysis of agonist-induced arrestin interactions with the receptor as requested by a reviewer and performed additional studies to assess the effect of the GRK2/3 inhibitor in agonist-regulation of phosphorylation of the hFFA2-DREADD receptor. This has led to an additional author (Aisha M. Abdelmalik) being added to the paper.</p><p>To address first the âpublic reviewsâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>1. We agree that we do not at this point explore the implications of the tissue specific barcoding we observe and report. However, as noted by the reviewer these will be studies for the future.</p><p>2. The question of why these are only 2 widely expressed arrestins and very many GPCRs is not one we attempt to address here and groups using various arrestin âconformationâ sensors are probably much better placed to do so than we are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p></disp-quote><p>1. It is difficult to address the potential low level of âbackgroundâ staining in some of the immunocytochemical images versus the âcleanerâ background in some of the immunoblotting images. The methods and techniques used are very distinct. However, it should be apparent that the immunoblotting studies are performed (both using cell lines and tissues) post-immunoprecipitation and this is likely to reduce such background to a minimum. This is obviously not the case in the immunocytochemical studies. It is also likely, even though the antisera are immune-selected against the peptide target, there may be some level of immune-recognition this is not limited to the phosphorylated residues.</p><p>2. Whilst this reviewer has commented in detail in the ârecommendationsâ section on the use of English, the other reviewers have not, and we do not find the manuscript challenging to follow or read.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p></disp-quote><p>1. We agree that the mass-spectrometry presented is not quantitative. The intention was for the mass spec to be a guide for the development of the antisera used in the study. We have re-written the initial part of the Results section (page 7) to state that phosphorylation of Ser297 was evident in the basal and agonist-stimulated receptor whilst phosphorylation of Ser296 was only evident following agonist addition.</p><p>2. Immunoblotting is intrinsically variable as parameters of antiserum titre in re-used samples is not assessed and although we are aware that FFA2 displays a degree of constitutive activity (see for example Hudson et al., (2012) J Biol Chem. 287(49):41195-209) we did not make any specific effort to supress this by, for example, including an inverse agonist ligand. Agonist-regulation of phosphorylation of the receptor, as detected in cell lines by the anti- pThr306/pThr310antiserum, is exceptionally clear cut in all the images displayed, and as we note for the pSer296/pSer297 antiserum this was always, in part, agonist-independent.</p><p>The point about compound 101 not being tested directly in the immunoblotting studies performed on the cell line-expressed receptor is a good one. We have now performed such studies which are shown as Figure 2E. These illustrate that the GRK2/3 inhibitor compound 101 does not reduce substantially agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor at least as detected by the pThr306/pThr310antiserum or by the pSer296/pSer297 antiserum. Equally this compound had little effect on recognition of the receptor. As the PD2 mutations which correspond to the targets for the pThr306/pThr310antiserum have no significant effect on recruitment of arrestin 3 in response to MOMBA (please see additional statistical analysis in modified Figure 2C) this is perhaps not surprising. Moreover, the PD1 mutations that correspond to the pSer296/pSer297antiserum also, in isolation, only have a partial effect of MOMBA-induced interactions with arrestin 3.</p><p>1. The use of phosphatase inhibitors is an integral part of these studies. As noted in Materials we used PhosSTOP (Roche, 4906837001). However, we failed to make it sufficiently clear that this reagent was present throughput sample preparation for both cell lines and tissue studies. This had been specified previously by two of us (SS, FN, see Fritzwanker S, Nagel F, Kliewer A, Stammer V, Schulz S. In situ visualization of opioid and cannabinoid drug effects using phosphosite-specific GPCR antibodies. Commun Biol. 6, 419 (2023)) but we agree this was insufficient and we now correct this oversight by making this explicit in Results.</p><p>Recommendations</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Competing interest: We apologise for this typographic error.

Although there were no significant differences in potency for MOMBA to promote interactions with arrestin-3 to each of the PD mutants versus wild type receptor, there were in terms of maximal effect. Statistical analysis was performed via one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnettâs multiple comparisons test. This is now detailed directly in Figure 2C and its associated legend. As noted by the reviewer there was indeed a highly significant effect of the GRK2/3 inhibitor compound 101 and this is now also noted in Figure 2D and its associated legend.</p><p>Units on page 9: pEC50 is considered as Molar by default but we have now specified this.PD1-4: It would be cumbersome to write out (and to read) 8 mutations that make up PD1-4 and hence we think this is specified appropriately in the Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p></disp-quote><p>1.
