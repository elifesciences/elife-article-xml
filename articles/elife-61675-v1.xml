Some of the compounds found abundantly in the blood are lipids, which include fatty acids and cholesterols. Lipids function as membrane components, signaling molecules and energy sources in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, decades of research reveal many vector-borne pathogens have a unique dependence on host lipids for survival. For instance, tick-borne bacteria, including <italic>Borrelia</italic>, <italic>Anaplasma</italic>, and <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> spp. are some of the few bacterial species known to accumulate host cholesterol in their membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lin and Rikihisa, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Toledo and Benach, 2015</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. require lipid building blocks from mammalian and mosquito hosts to complete their life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Kilian et al., 2018</xref>). The life cycle of flaviviruses is intimately associated with host lipid metabolism and synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Leier et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to note that microbes cannot synthesize cholesterol, and many of these pathogens are limited in their ability to synthesize certain lipids or preferentially acquire lipids from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lin and Rikihisa, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Ramakrishnan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Vector-borne pathogens have long fascinated scientists from multiple disciplines, including, but not limited to, microbiologists, immunologists, entomologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and public health professionals. Recently, the scientific community has also become increasingly interested in the metabolic response to infection. The rising use of metabolomics has improved and expanded our understanding of biological processes, including lipid metabolism of vector-borne infections. However, a comprehensive and unifying <italic>Review</italic> Article describing the basic framework of lipid utilization by these pathogens is lacking.</p><p>In this <italic>Review</italic>, we aim to convey the shared role of host lipid hijacking in vector-borne diseases. We will explore how extracellular and intracellular microbes scavenge lipids from hosts, how they manipulate host factors and metabolism for invasion and growth and how they use lipids in immune evasion and disease severity. We will also describe mechanisms of lipid utilization in both mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors. Finally, we will discuss outstanding questions in the fields of microbiology and vector biology and how cutting-edge technologies may be applied. By defining shared mechanisms of resource exploitation by diverse pathogens, we hope to draw attention to the importance of these processes and how future studies could lead to novel strategies in the treatment or prevention of vector-borne diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Classification of lipids</title><p>Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that structure cellular membranes, activate signaling pathways and provide energy to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). They are defined by their insolubility in water and solubility in organic solvents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fahy et al., 2011</xref>). There are eight main classifications of lipids: fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, prenols, saccharolipids, and polyketides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fahy et al., 2011</xref>). Fatty acyls include fatty acids (e.g. palmitate and oleate, both found abundantly in the human body) and make up the hydrophobic components of complex lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Classification of membrane lipids.</title><p>Lipids structure the membranes of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. (<bold>A</bold>) Fatty acids are hydrophobic building blocks for many membrane lipids. Common fatty acids include palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1), and arachidonic acid (20:4), whose structures differ in the number of carbons and number of double bonds per chain. The presence of double bonds in the chains of certain fatty acids, such as oleic acid and arachidonic acid, makes these lipids unsaturated. (<bold>B</bold>) Glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids are two classifications of lipids found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes. Glycerolipids (e.g. diacylglycerol) contain a glycerol backbone and at least one fatty acyl chain. Glycerophospholipids, conversely, are glycerolipids that contain a polar head group comprised of phosphate and an alcohol, and are named accordingly (e.g. PG, PE, PI, PS, PC). In the membrane, these lipids largely consist of two fatty acyl chains connected to the glycerol backbone. (<bold>C</bold>) Sphingolipids are membrane lipids that possess a sphingosine backbone. These include sphingomyelin, which contains a sphingosine backbone, one fatty acyl chain, and either phosphocholine (shown) or phosphoethanolamine. (<bold>D</bold>) Glycolipids refer to membrane lipids, such as glycerolipids or sphingolipids, that are covalently linked to a sugar residue. (<bold>E</bold>) Bacterial lipoproteins are membrane molecules that possess an exposed polypeptide chain and either two (diacyl; shown) or three (triacyl) fatty acyl chains. (<bold>F</bold>) Sterols are essential in eukaryotic physiology and include the animal sterol cholesterol, a critical component of cell membranes. p = phosphate, G = glycerol, E = ethanolamine, I = inositol, S = serine, C = choline, PG = phosphatidylglycerol, PE = phosphatidylethanolamine, PI = phosphatidylinositol, PS = phosphatidylserine, PC = phosphatidylcholine.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61675-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids are two groups that comprise a significant portion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). They both contain a glycerol backbone and at least one fatty acyl chain. However, they differ in their presence or absence of a polar head group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, sphingolipids are membrane lipids that contain a sphingosine backbone. Sphingomyelin, a lipid found in animal cell membranes, is an example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Generally speaking, bacteria and parasites are capable of synthesizing phospholipids and sphingolipids but may prefer scavenging available host lipids or animal-specific lipids.</p><p>Glycolipids consist of membrane lipids that are covalently linked to a sugar residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Glycolipids are not to be confused with saccharolipids, which have fatty acid chains directly linked to a sugar backbone. The most well-known example of saccharolipids is lipid A, a component of lipopolysaccharide found in Gram-negative bacterial membranes. Bacterial membranes may also contain lipoproteins on their surface, which possess both fatty acyl and polypeptide components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, sterols are essential in eukaryotic physiology and include cholesterol, a component of animal cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Other eukaryotes, such as parasites and fungi, may synthesize alternative sterols (e.g. ergosterol).</p><p>Importantly, lipids can act as signaling mediators. Lipid signaling molecules include sterols, lysophospholipids (a subclass of glycerophospholipids consisting of one fatty acyl chain and a polar head group), phosphoinositides (PIPns) and eicosanoids, which are derived from arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or other polyunsaturated fatty acids. Lipid mediators, particularly eicosanoids, can be produced during infection and may promote or inhibit inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Dennis and Norris, 2015</xref>). Phosphoinositides are derived from phosphatidylinositol (PI) and interact with intracellular proteins to generate second messengers, such as inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>). Although PIPn signaling has been implicated as a critical process during pathogenesis, we will primarily refer to literature on eicosanoids and lysophospholipids regarding lipid signaling. An extensive classification of lipid structures is reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fahy et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Lipid scavenging by extracellular pathogens</title><p>Membrane formation is a critical step in microbial proliferation. Microbes are generally divided into extracellular or intracellular organisms based on their metabolic requirements and lifecycles. Extracellular microbes often harbor their own replication and synthesis machinery. However, vector-borne pathogens may lack lipid synthesis enzymes and must acquire these components from the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this section, we will discuss how extracellular vector-borne pathogens scavenge host lipids for survival.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lipid scavenging by extracellular arthropod-borne pathogens.</title><p>Certain pathogens can obtain nutrients directly from their environment and may not require host cell invasion for lipid uptake.

These parasites acquire various lipids from the blood and can synthesize their own fatty acids using the type II fatty acid synthase system (FASII) and the microsomal elongase pathway when resources are restricted. In the tsetse fly, the enzyme acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) regulates the microsomal elongase pathway based on lipid abundance. (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is extracellular in its trypomastigote and epimastigote forms. Within the triatomine, epimastigotes acquire various lipids from the blood meal. Additional lipids function as signaling molecules and promote the differentiation from epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes. At this stage, metacyclic trypomastigotes may be deposited in the skin of a mammal before invading cells to become amastigotes. Intracellular amastigotes transform into trypomastigotes, burst out of host cells, and enter the bloodstream.

The incorporation of host lipids is strongly tied to their unique membrane formation.

However, these bacteria lack the enzymes to synthesize fatty acids, such as palmitate or oleate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, they acquire these fatty acids from hosts and integrate them into bacterial phospholipids and lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belisle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Hossain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Lipoproteins are an immunogenic component of <italic>Borrelia</italic> membranes and have several functions, including critical roles in the colonization of the blacklegged tick <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brandt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Pal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Pal et al., 2004</xref>). Despite their extracellular lifecycle, there is evidence that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection influences lipid metabolism in the host. A recent study in Lyme disease patients demonstrated that <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection increases serum levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a variant of PC that contains one fatty acyl chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fitzgerald et al., 2020</xref>). Lysophospholipids are generated as a byproduct of phospholipid degradation or an intermediate of phospholipid synthesis. Lysophospholipid accumulation during bacterial infection may be a result of bacterial stress, lipoprotein synthesis, or host response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib227">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). However, the significance of this increase during Lyme disease has yet to be explored.</p><p>Bacteria cannot synthesize cholesterol. However, <italic>Borrelia</italic> are one of a few bacterial species that integrate host cholesterol into their membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Toledo and Benach, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In mammals, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> scavenges cholesterol directly from the plasma membranes of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Crowley et al., 2013</xref>). It may also acquire cholesterol from the blood meal, as ticks fed on mice infected with <italic>Borrelia</italic> spp. display dysregulated cholesterol levels compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Hoxmeier et al., 2017</xref>). Uniquely, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> organizes cholesterol and cholesterol glycolipids into eukaryotic-like lipid rafts on their inner or outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">LaRocca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Toledo et al., 2018</xref>). Inner and outer membrane lipid rafts appear to be distinct from each other. For example, outer membrane rafts contain well-defined lipoproteins involved in colonization, such as the outer membrane proteins (Osp) A and B, while inner membrane rafts possess proteins with signaling and transport functions, including ATP-binding cassette transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Toledo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Toledo et al., 2018</xref>).

In the mammalian host, trypanosomatids internalize low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), whose hydrolysis can yield fatty acids and sterols for parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Gillett and Owen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Coppens et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrade-Neto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">De Cicco et al., 2012</xref>).

The activity of this enzyme is regulated by lipid abundance in the tsetse fly, therefore maintaining a balance between lipid scavenging and synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Ray et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the triatomine vector, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigotes use lipids from the blood meal for differentiation and membrane composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The blood meal contains components such as phospholipids, triacylglycerols, and sphingomyelin that are quickly degraded into free fatty acids by the vector. These lipids are then incorporated into epimastigotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Wainszelbaum et al., 2003</xref>). Epimastigotes may scavenge additional lipid building blocks from the host to synthesize their surface molecules. For example, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> requires inositol for many of their membrane components, such as glycoinositolphospholipids, and utilizes transporters to acquire it for their synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Einicker-Lamas et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the blood meal possesses signaling lipids, including oleic acid, LPC, and lysophosphatidic acid that promote the differentiation and proliferation of these parasites in triatomines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">Wainszelbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chagas-Lima et al., 2019</xref>). If epimastigotes internalize excess lipids, they store them in specialized lipid organelles for later use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>). Ultimately, these extracellular pathogens rely on host lipids to complete their life cycles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Cellular invasion</title><p>There are a variety of strategies intracellular microbes employ to successfully invade host cells. Often, host lipids such as membrane cholesterol are co-opted for cellular entry. Cholesterol regulates host cell plasma membrane fluidity and helps structure lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Simons and Ehehalt, 2002</xref>). For example, the <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria and comprise the tick-borne bacterial genera <italic>Anaplasma</italic> and <italic>Ehrlichia. A. phagocytophilum</italic> and <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic>, two human pathogens transmitted by Ixodidae ticks, infect granulocytes and monocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">McClure et al., 2017</xref>). To invade cells, these bacteria utilize cholesterol-containing lipid rafts in host membranes for entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Lin and Rikihisa, 2003b</xref>). Lipid rafts often contain receptors required for entry and enable a cascade of signaling events leading to engulfment of the pathogen by the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Simons and Ehehalt, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Membrane cholesterol is also important for arboviral invasion. Alphaviruses are the only genus of the <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and are positive sense, single-stranded RNA mosquito-borne viruses, including Chikungunya (CHIKV), Semliki Forest (SFV), and Sindbis (SINV) viruses. They have broad tropism and can cause severe pathology by infecting neurons in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atkins, 2013</xref>). Alphaviruses enter cells through the endocytic pathway, where the acidic pH of the endosomes causes the fusion of viral and endosome membranes and allows viral RNA to be released into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Phalen and Kielian, 1991</xref>). Membrane cholesterol was found to play a critical role in the ability of SFV and SINV to fuse with the endosomal membrane, as viral fusion and replication were interrupted in cholesterol-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Phalen and Kielian, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Lu et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, neither SFV nor SINV rely on lipid rafts to successfully fuse with target membranes, suggesting they require cholesterol for membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Waarts et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular parasites may use membrane lipids and host membrane repair pathways to facilitate entry. Invading <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> require membrane cholesterol similar to other intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Pucadyil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fernandes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). However, unlike the alphaviruses, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> utilizes lipid rafts containing sphingolipids, cholesterol and the ganglioside GM1 for cellular entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fernandes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barrias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hissa et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanism of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> invasion is unique because it triggers a plasma membrane repair pathway to drive internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Tardieux et al., 1992</xref>). After induction of a membrane lesion or injury, lysosomes are recruited to the host plasma membrane to provide membranes for repair. These lysosomes contain acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), an enzyme that converts sphingomyelin to ceramide, which promotes the endocytosis of membrane lesions. It was shown that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> creates lesions in the host cell plasma membrane and uses recruited lysosomal membranes to create the parasitophorous vacuole, or replication niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Tardieux et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>). These parasites then require ASM to generate ceramide and drive internalization of the parasite by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fernandes et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> co-opts lipid membrane repair processes to successfully invade host cells.</p><p>Some parasites and viruses enter cells through host lipid receptors and transporters. <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> are a family of positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with diverse tropisms, including dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Zika (ZIKV), and Powassan (POWV) viruses. Mosquitoes transmit the majority of these pathogens, excluding POWV, which is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex. Flaviviral entry has been shown to be impacted by interactions with lipid-binding proteins. DENV infection is enhanced by the interaction between viral particles and serum apolipoprotein A-I, which is a major component of HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Li et al., 2013</xref>). This interaction assists DENV entry through scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a surface lipid transporter, and leads to severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the parasite <italic>T. cruzi</italic> exploits other lipid receptors for invasion by binding serum lipoproteins. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> binds LDL, which may interact with LDL receptor (LDLR) to facilitate fusion and entry into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Nagajyothi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Additional lipid receptors, including phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, play important roles in arboviral invasion. PS receptors are phospholipid-binding proteins that mediate the removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytosis. Two of these receptor families, TIM and TAM, were shown to facilitate DENV entry by interacting with PS on viral envelopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Meertens et al., 2012</xref>). TIM1 appears to promote the entry and replication of other enveloped arboviruses as well, including various alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jemielity et al., 2013</xref>).

DENV and WNV upregulate intracellular cholesterol levels, induce its accumulation at the ER and require it for the formation of replication sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Rothwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Soto-Acosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Soto-Acosta et al., 2017</xref>). Because cholesterol is important for membrane remodeling, it is likely that these viruses use host cholesterol to maintain the membrane architecture of replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Soto-Acosta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another important component of flavivirus replication complexes are sphingolipids. The sphingolipid ceramide is required for vesicle biogenesis, an important process during flaviviral replication, and may be generated by the degradation of sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>). It was shown that both WNV and ZIKV increase cellular sphingolipid levels, and blocking the conversion from sphingomyelin to ceramide inhibits their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Martín-Acebes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Martín-Acebes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Leier et al., 2020</xref>). Using ZIKV, it was also demonstrated that ceramide is redistributed to replication membranes, suggesting their involvement in flaviviral vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Leier et al., 2020</xref>). Patients infected with flaviviruses exhibit lipidomic changes, such as dysregulated sphingolipids levels and perturbed lipid metabolic pathways, pointing to a critical process during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Melo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>How these viruses acquire host lipids is heavily studied. During the formation of ER invaginations, host factors are recruited to replication complexes to provide lipids for structure and energy. For instance, DENV recruits host enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase and the cholesterol synthesis enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), to synthesize lipids at replication sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Heaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Soto-Acosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Soto-Acosta et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, DENV uses HMGCR to elevate cholesterol and increases its activity through impaired AMPK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Soto-Acosta et al., 2017</xref>). Flaviviruses also interact with host lipid droplets (LD), which are ER-derived organelles that store lipids for energy reserves and immunity. DENV increases the numbers of LDs in the cell and promotes their consumption by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Samsa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Heaton and Randall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Peña and Harris, 2012</xref>). They trigger LD consumption by interacting with the LD protein AUP1 to drive virus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib224">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, these viruses use LDs for viral assembly. DENV capsid proteins colocalize to LDs, and their availability controls viral particle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Samsa et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these viruses have evolved a multitude of processes for acquiring necessary lipids from the mammalian host.</p><p>While not as abundantly studied as the flaviviruses, the alphaviruses display some reliance on host lipids. Similar to DENV, CHIKV requires intracellular cholesterol transport for replication and its nonstructural proteins localize to LDs, although the significance of this interaction is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib211">Wichit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Remenyi et al., 2017</xref>). During SINV infection, mice defective in ASM accumulate intracellular lipids that promote a greater production of infectious particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Ng et al., 2008</xref>). Because ASM is known to regulate cholesterol and sphingolipid levels, these may be implicated in their proliferation. Alphaviruses may also shift the metabolism of the cell to make lipids. It was shown that SFV uses the Akt pathway to drive glucose metabolism towards fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Mazzon et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, there may be uncovered mechanisms of lipid utilization by these arboviruses.</p><p>An emerging field of arbovirus research explores their interactions with the mosquito vector. Insects are cholesterol auxotrophs; therefore, mosquito-borne viruses must co-opt different processes to obtain lipids in the vector. To maintain intracellular cholesterol, DENV downregulates expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), a protein involved in cholesterol export that facilitates viral replication in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Tree et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, while the induction of DENV replication vesicles is conserved between mammals and mosquitoes, infected mosquito cells do not display convoluted ER membranes, possibly due to the lack of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Junjhon et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, flaviviruses alter the lipidome of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes by increasing phospholipid and sphingolipid synthesis, likely for their replication and membrane formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Perera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Melo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chotiwan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Vial et al., 2019</xref>). DENV accomplishes this by regulating expression of acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT1), which increases phospholipid concentrations and promotes infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Vial et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the interactions between arboviruses and LDs appear to be conserved, as both flaviviruses and alphaviruses induce their formation in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barletta et al., 2016</xref>). Mosquito LD biogenesis was shown to be a direct result of immune activation; however, whether these viruses require mosquito LDs is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barletta et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Parasites</title><sec id="s5-3-1"><title>Apicomplexa</title><p>The Apicomplexa are a phylum of intracellular protozoans.

Notably, engagement of TAM receptors with enveloped viruses was shown to dampen innate immune responses by inhibiting type I interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that PS on flavivirus and alphavirus envelopes contributes to innate immune inactivation and evasion.</p></sec><sec id="s6-3"><title>Parasites</title><sec id="s6-3-1"><title>Apicomplexa</title><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. primarily use protein antigens to evade host immunity. However, these parasites utilize host lipid receptors to invade other tissues and promote disease severity. One of the most defined mechanisms of host-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> interaction is with CD36, an evolutionarily conserved lipid scavenger receptor and transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). CD36 contributes to apoptotic cell clearance, pathogen recognition and uptake of host lipids, including the potentially harmful form of cholesterol, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Febbraio et al., 2001</xref>). During <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, oxLDL is responsible for the phagocytosis of infected red blood cells (iRBCs), regulation of inflammatory responses and induction of cellular immunity by phagocytic immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Serghides and Kain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Gowda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Thylur et al., 2017</xref>). However, CD36 has been implicated as a determinant of severe malarial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Endothelial CD36 binds domains of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) with high affinity, tethering iRBCs to the endothelium in a phenomenon called cytoadherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barnwell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). Sequestration of iRBCs to the endothelium promotes parasite survival, potentially by preventing splenic clearance, and is tied to severe pathologies such as cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Fonager et al., 2012</xref>). In the mosquito vector, the CD36 ortholog Croquemort may also be involved in parasite recognition although this relationship is not explicitly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">González-Lázaro et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In terms of disease severity, lipidomics has been used to distinguish clinical manifestations of malaria, including acute and chronic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cordy et al., 2019</xref>). Susceptibility to severe malaria is correlated with decreased levels of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in both <italic>P. falciparum</italic>- and <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Perkins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu-Filho et al., 2019</xref>). Studies from <italic>P. vivax-</italic>infected patients also reveal that parasitemia is significantly associated with metabolites involved in lipid metabolism, an observation that may be tied to their intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Gardinassi et al., 2017</xref>).

The ability of an infected individual to respond to malaria treatment may also be tied to host lipids, where patients with lower levels of baseline glycerophosphocholines were more likely to develop chloroquine-resistant malaria after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Uppal et al., 2017</xref>). Together, the relationship between clinical presentation and host lipidomics allows for the use of lipid biomarkers in patients with malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s6-3-2"><title>Trypanosomatida</title><p>Trypanosomatids use membrane components and parasite lipids to evade the immune response. <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes contain lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a critical virulence factor and lipid-containing polysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Späth et al., 2003</xref>).

In the vector, LPG facilitates arthropod colonization. This membrane component is critical for midgut attachment and protection from hydrolytic enzymes in the sand fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Sacks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Kamhawi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Kamhawi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Myskova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Jecna et al., 2013</xref>). Other lipids have been implicated in <italic>Leishmania</italic> immune evasion as well. For example, infective parasites express higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites and may promote the differentiation of macrophages into a less inflammatory phenotype, known as the M2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Paloque et al., 2019</xref>). These M2 macrophages produce high levels of pro-resolving bioactive lipids to facilitate parasite survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Paloque et al., 2019</xref>). For <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, these parasites possess membrane lipids that may be involved in the induction of severe disease. It was demonstrated that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> glycolipids activate a specific γδ-T cell population associated with cardiomyopathy, a severe outcome of Chagas disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Passos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Within the host cell, regulation of host cholesterol is critical for intracellular trypanosomatid survival. Paradoxically, cholesterol appears to have a protective effect against <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections. <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival outside of the parasitophorous vacuole depends on lower cholesterol. For example, mice and patients infected with <italic>Leishmania</italic> exhibit decreased levels of serum cholesterol, which may be a result of downregulated microRNA expression by the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Lal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>). This dependence on lower cholesterol extends to the plasma membrane, where reduced membrane cholesterol disrupts membrane lipid rafts and inhibits antigen presentation to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chakraborty et al., 2005</xref>). Additional studies have shown that hypocholesterolemia promotes host susceptibility to <italic>Leishmania,</italic> while the converse protects against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, cholesterol may be somewhat protective against severe <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, as mice fed a high fat diet had increased survival and less myocardial damage despite increased cardiac cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Nagajyothi et al., 2014</xref>). This was attributed to the ‘obesity paradox’, where obesity has been observed as having a positive effect on certain chronic disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Nagajyothi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another shared mode of evasion and disease severity by these parasites is the differential expression of eicosanoids. Specifically, prostaglandins appear to promote immunosuppression and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). During <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, PGE<sub>2</sub> and prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>α (PGF<sub>2</sub>α) were shown to be upregulated and enhance parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araújo-Santos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">França-Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> has an immunosuppressive effect during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and can be derived from host or parasite LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Toledo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Lovo-Martins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">de Almeida et al., 2018</xref>). Although less understood, this eicosanoid may be somewhat involved in <italic>T. brucei</italic> immunosuppression as well. <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection induces the generation of suppressor macrophages that inhibit T cell proliferation, a hallmark of African trypanosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Schleifer and Mansfield, 1993</xref>). The suppressive activities of these macrophages are partially mediated by PGE<sub>2</sub>, where it was shown that the inhibition of NO and prostaglandin synthesis together abrogates T cell suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Schleifer and Mansfield, 1993</xref>). Along with the host, <italic>T. brucei</italic> may produce PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2</sub>α, although their functional significance is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kubata et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> may contribute to clinical complications. The prostaglandin synthesis enzyme COX-2 and PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling were shown to be important for cardiac inflammation during Chagas disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Guerrero et al., 2015</xref>). The role of this eicosanoid in cardiomyopathy is controversial, however, as conflicting reports show that PGE<sub>2</sub> may also be cardioprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The differential production of eicosanoids directly affects the capacity of the host to control trypanosomatid infection. Leishmaniasis manifests in several different types, including the milder presentation of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis and the more severe mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis display higher levels of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>), a proinflammatory eicosanoid that recruits neutrophils, and decreased PGE<sub>2</sub> compared to patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, suggesting this enhanced inflammatory profile contributes to severe <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">França-Costa et al., 2016</xref>). Whether LTB<sub>4</sub> is produced for the benefit of the parasite or host is debatable. LTB<sub>4</sub> has been shown to be critical for parasite killing by neutrophils and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Morato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Tavares et al., 2014</xref>). However, as <italic>Leishmania</italic> may infect neutrophils before being ingested by macrophages, it has been suggested that these parasites use LTB<sub>4</sub> to recruit additional cells to the site of infection. <italic>L. major</italic> induces LTB<sub>4</sub> during early neutrophil infection in a manner similar to <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, which has a tropism for neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Plagge and Laskay, 2017</xref>). Thus, this could be a mechanism to promote early persistence of the pathogen.</p><p>In the insect vector, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> have adopted additional strategies for evasion and transmission. <italic>Trypanosoma rangeli</italic>, another species native to Central and South America, shares many characteristics with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> but infects the insect salivary glands for transmission. To accomplish this, <italic>T. rangeli</italic> uses its surface glycolipids to subvert nitric oxide (NO) production in the salivary glands and persist in the vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Gazos-Lopes et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> parasites may also use lipids to promote successful transmission. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites bind lipoproteins from the vertebrate blood meal on their surface, thus agglutinating parasites and enhancing infectivity in the insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Moreira et al., 2018</xref>). These parasites may benefit from the immunosuppressive properties of arthropod-derived lipids, where LPC in the salivary glands of <italic>Triatoma infestans</italic> and <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> was shown to enhance <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission by altering the local inflammatory environment at the bite site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Mesquita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Lima et al., 2018</xref>). Ultimately, the interactions between parasites, hosts, and lipids are critical for the establishment and dissemination of arthropod-borne infections.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conclusion and perspective</title><p>Recent advances in the field of metabolism have allowed for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions.

Based on their shared environment, it is easy to speculate why tick-borne bacteria are overrepresented for this quality. Other discoveries have prompted the development of novel therapeutics for vector-borne diseases. For instance, both extracellular and intracellular arthropod-borne pathogens must salvage lipids from their hosts for survival (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To this end, drugs targeting lipid metabolism have been shown to inhibit arboviral and parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Tewary et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bobenchik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Merino-Ramos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Jiménez de Oya et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, their use in humans is a promising area of research. Studying host lipid requirements by these pathogens can also aid in understanding host susceptibilities to infection, such as comorbidities and medications taken for other diseases.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Requirement of lipid scavenging for microbial growth.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Cholesterol</th><th valign="bottom">Fatty acids</th><th valign="bottom">Phospholipids</th><th valign="bottom">Sphingolipids</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"><italic>Anaplasma and Ehrlichia</italic></td><td valign="bottom">Essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Lin and Rikihisa, 2003a</xref>;

Molecular strategies of vector competence, or the ability of an arthropod vector to efficiently transmit disease, are currently being defined in insect and non-insect arthropods. These include: (1) pathogen recognition by diverse arthropod immune systems, (2) secretion of salivary effector proteins, (3) survival advantages provided by colonized microbes, and (4) interactions with mammalian immunity and the microbiome at the bite site. This emerging area of research is critical for understanding why arthropod vectors are tolerant of certain human pathogens and how these interactions developed on an evolutionary scale.</p><p>Vector-borne microbes are required to adapt to the mammalian host and the arthropod environment. However, most microbes considered ‘human pathogens’ are not detrimental to the arthropod, which is a phenomenon that is not well understood. For example, lipid utilization by microbes does not appear to impair arthropod fitness, yet lipid dysregulation is often a symptom of severe disease in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biswas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Toledo et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Werling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cordy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fitzgerald et al., 2020</xref>). This observation is intriguing, considering the general lipid compositions of invertebrate vectors and mammalian hosts are fairly similar. They both store excess lipids in the form of triacylglycerols and intracellular lipid droplets, they synthesize fatty acids and phospholipids for cellular membranes, and hematophagous arthropods acquire mammalian lipids (e.g. cholesterol) during blood meal and incorporate them in their cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Tree et al., 2019</xref>). Although many of these processes are conserved across species, the role of metabolism in dual host adaptation remains to be defined. Perhaps, the metabolic requirements for the microbe differ in each environment or the arthropod vector supplies necessary metabolites that prevent pathogenesis. During DENV infection, for instance, mosquito cells produce a significant number of unidentified metabolites that may represent unannotated, mosquito-specific molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chotiwan et al., 2018</xref>). A high-resolution comparison of human and arthropod metabolites under infection conditions, as well as a larger focus on understudied vectors (e.g. sand flies, tsetse flies, triatomines) may help answer these questions.</p><p>The emergence of new and systems-based technologies offers an exciting outlook for the fields of vector biology and microbiology. For example, metabolomics is a high-throughput technique that provides a full picture of cellular perturbations underlying disease processes. By studying levels of metabolites, researchers can interrogate thousands of molecular changes including those involved in lipid metabolism. Lipidomics has already been applied for several vector-borne pathogens and has been instrumental in understanding host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blaho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Perera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Gulati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Gardinassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gazos-Lopes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Melo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Melo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chotiwan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cordy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Vial et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Leier et al., 2020</xref>); however, its further implementation with hypothesis-driven research may uncover universal mechanisms shared by several microbes. Additionally, the rise of cutting-edge technologies, such as single-cell metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging, allows researchers to take a systems biology approach to answering metabolic questions. Mass spectrometry imaging reveals spatial distribution of individual metabolites, such as lipids, which can be applied to individual tissues from mammals or arthropods. Single-cell metabolomics can provide insight into the heterogeneity of infection and how individual cells respond to infection. Thus, a more holistic understanding of lipid hijacking by vector-borne diseases is on the horizon.</p><p>Collectively, we aimed to shed light on the unifying principle of lipid utilization in vector-borne diseases. Research in this field is essential for our understanding of mammalian pathogenesis and disease transmission by arthropods. We hope that continuing research in arthropod biology and understudied microbes will provide a greater understanding of host-vector-pathogen interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Pedra laboratory for insightful discussions.
