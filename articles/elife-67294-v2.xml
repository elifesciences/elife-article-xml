Egg activation triggers this transition and results in, amongst other changes, completion of the meiotic program in the oocyte and restoration of a totipotent cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avilés-Pagán and Orr-Weaver, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krauchunas and Wolfner, 2013</xref>). This transition is regulated exclusively by post-transcriptional mechanisms, as it occurs in the absence of new transcription and depends on translational control of stockpiled maternal mRNAs as well as proteolysis and posttranslational modification of proteins. These maternal mRNAs also support early embryogenesis until the onset of zygotic transcription. The stockpiles of maternal mRNAs and absence of transcriptional input at the oocyte-to-embryo transition provide the opportunity to elucidate conserved mechanisms regulating mRNA translation during a cell state transition.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the PNG kinase complex is a master regulator of mRNA translation at the oocyte-to-embryo transition. The active kinase requires the PNG catalytic subunit, a kinase with a preference for threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), and the PLU and GNU activating subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Initially shown to control translation of a few targets (<italic>cyclins A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, <italic>smg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>), recent analyses of global translation revealed that around 90% of all transcripts present in the activated egg are completely or partially dependent on PNG to either activate or inhibit their translation following egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Following egg activation, PNG phosphorylates the translational regulators TRAL, ME31B, and BIC-C amongst other regulators of mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation by PNG is thought to inhibit the translational repressor activity of TRAL and PUM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>), suggesting a key mechanism by which PNG directly alters translation through changing the activity of translational repressors. PNG activity also is required for the degradation of ME31B and TRAL at the onset of the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) later in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, translation of PNG mRNA targets such as <italic>smg</italic> is required for translational repression and clearance of maternal transcripts at the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>), one example of indirect regulation of the maternal mRNA pool by PNG. PNG can affect both polyadenylation and deadenylation of maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the PNG complex regulates maternal mRNA translation through various downstream mechanisms.</p><p>PNG kinase complex activity is limited to a narrow developmental window. Crucial to this regulation is the coordinated binding of the subunits of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas PNG and PLU are bound in mature oocytes, phosphorylation of GNU by CDK1/CYCB inhibits its binding to the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the complex is inactive in mature oocytes. Upon egg activation, GNU is dephosphorylated, and it is then able to bind and activate the kinase activity of the complex. The complex is once again inactivated following egg activation by PNG-dependent degradation of GNU, thereby limiting its activity to the oocyte-to-embryo transition. It remains unknown if, in addition to its role in the activation of PNG, GNU has additional roles in mature oocytes or during egg activation.</p><p>Cytoplasmic RNP granules are observed in the oocytes of many metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schisa, 2012</xref>). RNP granules are membrane-less organelles that regulate different aspects of mRNA metabolism in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). In addition to their roles in oocytes, RNP granules or P-bodies are also present in other cell types, such as neurons, where they have been implicated in the control of rapid cell state transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>). In oocytes, RNP granules can be observed as large granular structures by immunostaining of resident proteins or in situ hybridization to localized mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato and Nakamura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noble et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schisa, 2012</xref>). Oocyte RNP granules, similar to their counterparts in other cells, are thought to play roles in regulating the localization and translation of mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato and Nakamura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schisa, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, egg activation triggers the disassembly of these ‘oocyte’ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weil et al., 2012</xref>), and they reform as ‘embryonic’ RNP complexes in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with roles for these complexes in the regulation of maternal mRNAs at this time.</p><p>Along with the RNA components of RNP granules, conserved protein components of P-bodies have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>), with DDX6 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ME31B) and LSM14 (aka RAP55 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRAL) being key. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, both TRAL and ME31B are localized in RNP granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>). Another translational repressor, BIC-C, also localizes to RNP granules in oocytes of some species, such as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kugler et al., 2009</xref>). It is hypothesized that the recruitment of these proteins to RNP granules is reflective of the role of these structures in mRNA storage and translational control both in the quiescent oocyte and during egg activation. The change observed as oocyte RNP complexes are disassembled upon egg activation and give way to the formation of embryonic RNP complexes may reflect developmental changes in mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato and Nakamura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). A complete understanding of which proteins localize and function within oocyte RNP granules, as well as the different roles played by these complexes during the oocyte-to-embryo transition, is lacking.</p><p>Here, we examine the regulation of the GNU activating subunit of the PNG kinase complex in mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. We found by immunoprecipitation analysis, localization studies, and genetic interactions that GNU is a component of RNP granules present in mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. Furthermore, we define roles for the sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domain of GNU and the CDK1 phosphorylation sites in the interactions of GNU with RNP granules and PNG regulation. Finally, we discuss new models of activation of the PNG complex and control of mRNA translation during egg activation based on these findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GNU interacts with RNP components in mature oocytes</title><p>GNU is not in a complex with PNG in mature oocytes, raising the question of whether GNU alone plays roles prior to egg activation. As a first step to address this, we identified proteins that potentially interact with GNU by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We decided to use a previously reported functional GNU-GFP fusion protein expressed in <italic>gnu-gfp</italic> transgenic lines to pull-down GNU through the GFP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). In these transgenic lines, GNU-GFP is expressed under endogenous regulatory elements, and GNU-GFP is expressed at levels comparable to wild-type, untagged GNU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). In our experiments, however, the transgenes were crossed into a <italic>gnu<sup>305</sup></italic> null mutant background, so the only form of GNU present was the GNU-GFP fusion.</p><p>Mature oocytes were isolated and extracts were prepared for incubation with anti-GFP beads. Following the pull-down, we analyzed the eluate samples by mass spectrometry to identify potential interactors with GNU, also performing pull-downs from a no GFP transgene control. In addition, immunoprecipitations were done from extracts prepared from mature oocytes expressing H2Av-GFP to control for interactions specific to the GFP tag. Each pull-down was performed in at least two biological replicates, and to be considered valid hits, we required that any given protein was represented in both replicates and enriched at least sevenfold in GNU-GFP precipitates over the no transgene control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the experiment using H2Av-GFP to control for interactions with GFP, we required that proteins be enriched at least fourfold in GNU-GFP versus H2Av-GFP pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Interactors with GNU in mature oocytes identified through IP-MS.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Identified protein</th><th align="center" colspan="13">Total spectrum count</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">No GFP</th><th colspan="3">GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP</th><th colspan="2">GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP</th><th colspan="2">GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-GFP</th><th colspan="3">H2Av-GFP</th><th>GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP <break/>(+RNase A)</th></tr><tr><th>Rep 1</th><th>Rep 2</th><th>Rep 1</th><th>Rep 2</th><th>Rep 3</th><th>Rep 1</th><th>Rep 2</th><th>Rep 1</th><th>Rep 2</th><th>Rep 1</th><th>Rep 2</th><th>Rep 3</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GFP</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>319</td><td>376</td><td>307</td><td>62</td><td>52</td><td>353</td><td>520</td><td>358</td><td>49</td><td>31</td><td>467</td></tr><tr><td>GNU</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>179</td><td>178</td><td>220</td><td>81</td><td>90</td><td>152</td><td>109</td><td>3</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>205</td></tr><tr><td>BIC-C</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>92</td><td>13</td><td>73</td><td>5</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>TYF</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>64</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>–</td><td>45</td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>–</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>YPS</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>40</td><td>11</td><td>23</td><td>10</td><td>–</td><td>38</td><td>2</td><td>28</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>TWS</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>39</td><td>9</td><td>22</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>92</td><td>14</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>TRAL</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>37</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>22</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>2</td><td>–</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>PP2A-29B</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>27</td><td>4</td><td>30</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>52</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>CUP</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>–</td><td>4</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>ATX-2</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>20</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>23</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>ME31B</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>MTS</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>10</td><td>–</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>–</td><td>42</td><td>5</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>RPL36A</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Given PNG’s key role in controlling maternal mRNA translation at egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>), it was striking that the most enriched proteins recovered were translational repressors. The translational repressor BIC-C had the most enriched interaction with GNU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The translational repressors TYF and YPS were also significantly enriched in GNU-GFP pull-downs. Interestingly, BIC-C and YPS form a complex with TRAL, ME31B, and CUP during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chicoine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kugler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>), so the immunoprecipitation of these proteins by GNU suggests an interaction of GNU with this complex. Although not significantly enriched under our stringent criteria, a noticeable spectrum count was observed for ME31B in GNU-GFP pull-downs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction with BIC-C was not affected by the treatment of extracts with RNase A, indicating that this interaction does not depend on RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>ME31B, TRAL, and BIC-C are PNG phosphorylation substrates, and genetic data are consistent with a functional interaction between PNG and TRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>).

Both BIC-C and ME31B were detected in GNU-GFP pull-down samples, in accordance with the mass spectrometry analysis. These interactions are not indirectly mediated by RNA, as they were unaffected by treatment with RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 11). Although pull-downs were performed using an available YPS-GFP line, we were not able to confirm the interaction between YPS and GNU through immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GNU physically associates with BIC-C and ME31B in mature oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of GNU-GFP immunoprecipitation of extracts from mature oocytes.

Moreover, the interaction with TWS was significantly higher in GNU-GFP compared to the H2Av-GFP control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Given that GNU is known to become dephosphorylated at egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>), the presence of these phosphatase subunits in a complex with GNU raises a potential role for this complex in the dephosphorylation of GNU. Although this is an intriguing possibility, for this study, we prioritized analysis of the relationship between GNU and BIC-C, ME31B, and TRAL.</p><p>Because CDK1 phosphorylation of GNU changes its association with PNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>), we investigated whether its interaction with BIC-C and ME31B was affected by the phosphorylation state of GNU in mature oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krauchunas et al., 2012</xref>). We performed pull-downs from extracts of mature oocytes expressing a <italic>gnu<sup>9A</sup>-gfp</italic> transgene. The GNU<sup>9A</sup> mutant has all nine CDK1 phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), inhibiting phosphorylation by CDK1 and mimicking the dephosphorylated state of GNU. GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP is still able to bind and activate PNG, and confers partial GNU function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). We found that most interactions with GNU were unaffected by the GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, BIC-C was significantly lower in GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP than in GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP precipitates, suggesting that the interaction of GNU with BIC-C depends on the CDK1 phosphorylation state of GNU. The reduced interaction of GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP with BIC-C was confirmed by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 3 and 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is possible that the phosphorylation state of GNU affects the strength of the interaction with BIC-C, leading to the observed reduction in BIC-C levels in GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP precipitates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GNU interaction with BIC-C is dependent on the SAM domain</title><p>From the amino acid sequence, the sole recognizable domain in GNU is a SAM domain at its C-terminus. The N-terminal region is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, and it contains most of the CDK1 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). SAM domains can mediate both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim and Bowie, 2003</xref>). We thus examined whether the SAM domain of GNU is needed for the protein interactions we identified. We performed immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analyses of extracts from mature oocytes expressing a <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> transgene. This transgene expresses GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-GFP, which carries a deletion of the SAM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that most interactions were unaffected by deletion of the SAM domain, with only the interaction of GNU with BIC-C being blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We confirmed the requirement of the SAM domain for the interaction between GNU and BIC-C by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis. BIC-C immunoprecipitated with GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP but not GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 4 and 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with the SAM domain of GNU being necessary for the interaction with BIC-C, an interaction that we showed above does not require RNA. In the immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiment, the amount of ME31B immunoprecipitated with GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>GFP appears less than with GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP. Because we did not detect a statistically significant enrichment of ME31B in the pull-down/mass spec experiments, we could not confirm that the interaction between ME31B and GNU is affected by deletion of the SAM domain by this independent method.</p><p>The observed association between GNU and BIC-C in vivo prompted us to test whether in vitro this could be a direct interaction. GNU and BIC-C were found previously to interact in yeast two-hybrid tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chicoine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giot et al., 2003</xref>).

We observed that MBP-GNU was pulled down with GST-BIC-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, deleting the SAM domain of GNU resulted in only background levels of GNU in eluates following GST-BIC-C pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our in vitro experiments support the in vivo results of the requirement of the SAM domain of GNU for BIC-C association and indicate that GNU directly interacts with BIC-C. Given BIC-C also contains a SAM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gamberi and Lasko, 2012</xref>), it is possible that the interaction between GNU and BIC-C requires the SAM domain of BIC-C as well.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of the SAM domain of GNU reduces the interaction with BIC-C and confers partial GNU function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of in vitro pull-down of GNU by BIC-C.

The partial rescue conferred by GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-GFP is consistent with some GNU functions in this form of the protein.</p><p>The giant nuclei phenotype observed in <italic>gnu</italic> mutants is due to a lack of <italic>cycB</italic> translation, which results in DNA replication without nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>). Translation of <italic>cycB</italic> mRNA upon egg activation is completely dependent on PNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the levels of CYCB in early embryos can be used to assess PNG activation. Because of our finding that <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> confers partial <italic>gnu</italic> function, we examined the activation of PNG in these mutants by immunoblot analysis of the levels of CYCB in oocytes and early embryos. We found that CYCB was present in early embryos from <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> females, though at lower levels than in <italic>gnu<sup>wt</sup>-gfp</italic> control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9 to 10 and 11). The observed decrease in embryonic CYCB levels is consistent with the observed partial rescue of the <italic>gnu</italic> phenotype in <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> embryos.</p><p>As an independent confirmation of the ability of GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup> to activate PNG, we performed in vitro kinase assays with PNG. In this assay, recombinant PNG kinase complex was incubated with either purified MBP-GNU<sup>WT</sup> or MBP-GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>, and PNG kinase activity was measured by radiolabeling of Myelin Basic Protein by γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP. We found that incubation with MBP-GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup> resulted in PNG kinase activity comparable to incubation with MBP-GNU<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The fact that <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> only confers partial rescue of <italic>gnu</italic> function in vivo despite the ability of GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-GFP to fully activate PNG in vitro indicates a requirement of the SAM domain of GNU in the activity of PNG in vivo, perhaps by defining targets for PNG phosphorylation. Alternatively, detection of in vitro kinase activity may be a less sensitive test of PNG function than the phenotypic analysis.</p><p>In our immunoblot analysis comparing mature oocytes and early embryos, we also analyzed protein levels of BIC-C, with unexpected results. In oocytes, we observed no difference in BIC-C levels between <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp, gnu<sup>305</sup></italic>, or <italic>gnu<sup>wt</sup>-gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 2–6). However, we saw decreased BIC-C levels in embryos from both <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> lines compared to embryos from <italic>gnu<sup>wt</sup>-gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9 to 10 and 11). Interestingly, this decrease in BIC-C levels in <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> embryos also occurred in <italic>gnu<sup>305</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 12), showing that lack of the SAM domain is comparable to complete loss of GNU in relation to BIC-C levels. In contrast, no effect was observed on ME31B protein levels. The mechanism for the decrease in BIC-C in embryos from <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> mothers is unknown at this time. Previous work demonstrated that PNG function is not required for translation of <italic>Bic-C</italic> mRNA in oocytes or following egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>). As BIC-C can be phosphorylated by PNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that the loss of the GNU interaction with BIC-C or the lower level of PNG activity in these mutants reduces phosphorylation of BIC-C by PNG. Consistent with PNG kinase activity being important, quantitative proteomic studies showed that in <italic>png</italic> mutant-activated eggs BIC-C protein levels were reduced relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>).

The persistence of GNU protein in the <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-gfp</italic> transgene lines suggests that the SAM domain of GNU is necessary for its degradation following egg activation.

We observed no visible differences in GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP in heterozygous <italic>Bic-C</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

GNU-GFP exhibited a mostly dispersed appearance in these oocytes, reminiscent of GNU<sup>ΔSAM</sup>-GFP localization, but with a portion of GNU-GFP still localized to granules. The effect of <italic>Bic-C</italic> mutations on GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP localization raises the possibility that the reduced granular localization observed for GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) could be due in part to its weakened interaction with BIC-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, the disruption of GNU localization in the <italic>Bic-C</italic> mutant is less severe than the localization of GNU<sup>9A</sup>-GFP. The effect of mutations in <italic>Bic-C</italic> on GNU<sup>WT</sup>-GFP was not due to differences in GNU protein levels, as immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) yielded no significant difference in GNU levels across these genotypes.

We found that loss of <italic>gnu</italic> function resulted in an observable effect on BIC-C-GFP localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), because the localization of BIC-C became partially dispersed in 30% of <italic>gnu</italic> mutant oocytes. We also observed that in oocytes where BIC-C-GFP localization was affected, some BIC-C-GFP granules were still observed. Given that nearly half of BIC-C granules do not contain GNU, it was expected that in the absence of GNU only a subset of the BIC-C RNPs would be affected. BIC-C-GFP localization was unaffected in 70% of oocytes. Our result suggests that the interaction between GNU and BIC-C, while not necessary for BIC-C localization in mature oocytes, might be modulating or stabilizing BIC-C in granules. However, the disruption of BIC-C-GFP in <italic>gnu</italic> mutant oocytes could be due to the disruption of RNP granules in these mutants.

This model makes two predictions. The first is that GNU would no longer be associated with BIC-C after egg activation, because BIC-C function and binding serve to localize GNU to RNPs. The second is that release of GNU from the granules by disruption of the association with BIC-C in the ΔSAM mutant would lead to premature activation of PNG kinase in the mature oocyte, as has been previously observed for the GNU<sup>9A</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>).

Moreover, not only does GNU interact with the known components of oocyte RNP granules, ME31B and BIC-C, it also co-localizes with these two proteins as well as TRAL in large cytoplasmic structures. In addition to interactions or co-localization with GNU, all three of these proteins are phosphorylated by PNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These results reveal the features of GNU required for RNP granule localization: the SAM domain and CDK1 phosphorylation sites. The observation that the SAM domain is required for the localization of GNU to granules as well as its interaction with BIC-C is consistent with a model in which GNU is recruited to RNP granules via specific protein-protein interactions through its SAM domain. Once recruited to these complexes, GNU could indirectly interact with RNAs but without depending on them for its recruitment, which would account for the observation that the protein-protein interactions of GNU are largely unaffected by treatment with RNase. Interestingly, in addition to the SAM domain, GNU also contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that contains eight of the nine CDK1 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Studies on RNP granule assembly have suggested that IDRs, although alone not sufficient for granule localization, can form weak non-specific interactions that stabilize their localization within RNP granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Protter et al., 2018</xref>). We found that when the SAM domain of GNU is deleted, leaving the IDR intact, the truncated GNU was not able to localize to granules. Thus, while not sufficient for localization in RNP granules, the IDR could stabilize GNU in these complexes.</p><p>Posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the recruitment of proteins into RNP granules. For example, in mammalian axons, phosphorylation of FMRP promotes assembly of FMRP granules, and in response to action potentials, dephosphorylation of FMRP promotes their disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsang et al., 2019</xref>). The opposite effect of phosphorylation can occur; in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> phosphorylation of the MEG granule proteins promotes granule disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our finding that the CDK1 phosphorylation sites of GNU play a role in localizing GNU suggests potential modulation of GNU RNP recruitment by CDK1 phosphorylation. The observation that GNU<sup>9A</sup> has reduced granular localization is consistent with the idea that CDK phosphorylation may act to enhance or stabilize the interaction with RNP granules. Thus, GNU phosphorylation appears to drive, at least in part, its recruitment into granules, as with FMRP. Given the localization of the CDK1 phosphorylation sites of GNU within the IDR domain, CDK1 phosphorylation could act by modifying structural features of the IDR that might affect GNU localization to granules in mature oocytes.</p><p>Here, we identified an in vivo interaction between BIC-C and GNU in mature oocytes dependent on the SAM domain of GNU; we propose this is the main mechanism by which GNU is recruited into RNP granules. This interaction had previously only been shown to occur as a two-hybrid interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chicoine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giot et al., 2003</xref>). The observations that the interaction with BIC-C requires the SAM domain of GNU, but that the interactions with other proteins such as YPS do not, indicates that the interaction of YPS with GNU is unlikely to be mediated through BIC-C. Similarly, the interaction of ME31B with GNU is at least in part independent of BIC-C. In addition, a key role for GNU-BIC-C interactions in the localization of GNU is supported by the dispersion on GNU in <italic>Bic-C</italic> mutant oocytes. It appears that CDK1/CYCB phosphorylation of GNU in mature oocytes aids in stabilizing GNU in RNP granules, possibly through strengthening the interaction of GNU with BIC-C in these structures. Because BIC-C-containing granules are present in oocytes starting at mid-oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kugler et al., 2009</xref>), and GNU levels increase later during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>), GNU may be recruited onto pre-existing granules as its levels increase. The increasing levels of CDK1/CYCB activity during late oogenesis would further promote the recruitment of GNU into RNP granules.</p><p>Our findings also reveal a synergistic relationship between GNU and BIC-C in granules. We found an effect on BIC-C localization in <italic>gnu</italic> mutant oocytes, where BIC-C granules are diminished and take on a more dispersed appearance. The affected granules are presumed to be the subpopulation of BIC-C granules that also contain higher levels of GNU. If so, this suggests that GNU has a role in maintaining or stabilizing BIC-C in granules. We also observed a requirement of the SAM domain of GNU, and likely the interaction with BIC-C, in maintaining BIC-C protein levels in early embryos, which indicates modulation of BIC-C stability by GNU.</p><p>An implication of our work is the presence of a diverse pool of RNP granule subtypes in the mature oocyte. Most studies of oocyte RNP granules have been limited to earlier stages of oogenesis, whole-ovary extracts, or have relied on a limited set of markers to observe RNP granules in oocytes. These approaches have precluded the identification of subtypes of RNP granules in mature oocytes, except in the germplasm at the oocyte posterior where germ granules are heterogeneous for constituent mRNAs and form as homotypic clusters by self-recruitment of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niepielko et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study characterizing the interaction of six RNA-binding proteins through GFP-immunoprecipitation of proteins from whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary extracts, followed by mass spectrometry-based protein identification, identified both known and some new interactors with polar granule and nuage granule proteins, but did not identify GNU as an interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansal et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, by examining the interactions of GNU at a specific stage in oogenesis, we found that GNU indeed interacts with several RNA-binding proteins and known RNP granule components. In the current study, we detected GNU only in a subpopulation of TRAL, ME31B, and BIC-C RNP granules in mature oocytes. Because TRAL and ME31B are thought to be present in all granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato and Nakamura, 2012</xref>), the present findings identify GNU-containing granules as a new subpopulation of oocyte RNP granules. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of the presence of BIC-C granules in mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. These different RNP granule subtypes are likely to reflect different roles in the regulation of maternal mRNAs, and they highlight the complexity of the regulation of maternal mRNAs by oocyte RNP complexes.</p><p>The demonstration that GNU is a component of RNP granules has led us to rethink how it regulates PNG activity upon egg activation. Our data can be explained by two alternative models. In the first model, the recruitment of GNU onto RNP granules functions as a sequestration mechanism to prevent premature activation of PNG prior to egg activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this ‘sequestration’ model, GNU is prevented from interacting with the PNG/PLU complex by spatial separation from PNG. Upon egg activation, RNP granules disassemble, thus releasing GNU as it is being dephosphorylated. In activated eggs, GNU is no longer prevented from binding PNG by sequestration in RNP granules, and PNG phosphorylates its substrates. The interaction of GNU with PNG targets could also function as a mechanism for substrate recognition. Although much of our data are consistent with this model, both the finding that GNU is still bound to BIC-C after egg activation and the observation that loss of RNP granule localization of GNU is not sufficient to prematurely activate PNG argue against the sequestration model.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models of regulation of PNG by GNU in RNP granules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequestration Model. In this model, GNU is prevented from interacting with the PNG/PLU complex by spatial separation. In mature oocytes, GNU is sequestered to granules in a CDK1 phosphorylation and SAM-domain-dependent manner (left panel), where it interacts with BIC-C, ME31B, and TRAL. PNG and PLU are localized throughout the oocyte cytoplasm. Upon egg activation, RNP granules disassemble, thus releasing GNU as it is being dephosphorylated (middle panel). In activated eggs, GNU is no longer prevented from binding PNG by sequestration of RNP granules, and PNG mediates the phosphorylation of its targets as well as autoregulation through phosphorylation of its subunits (right panel). (<bold>B</bold>) Beacon model. In this model, localization of GNU to RNP granules functions to localize PNG activity to these granules. In mature oocytes, GNU is recruited onto granules via SAM domain interactions, with CDK1 phosphorylation stabilizing its interactions within the granules (left panel). Inactive PNG is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm. As egg activation occurs, GNU is dephosphorylated and brings PNG to the disassembling granules, where it can phosphorylate TRAL, ME31B, BIC-C, and potentially other translation regulators (middle panel). In fully activated eggs, PNG activity would not be restricted to granules previously marked by GNU, and the complex is able to phosphorylate targets throughout the activated egg prior to inactivation of the complex (right panel). The beacon model is more consistent with our data than the sequestration model.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67294-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The data are more consistent with a ‘beacon’ model of regulation of PNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In this model, GNU is recruited into granules as a mechanism to mark these granules to target PNG to them. As egg activation occurs, GNU is dephosphorylated and recruits PNG to the disassembling granules, where it can phosphorylate TRAL, ME31B, BIC-C, and potentially other translation regulators. In fully activated eggs in which granules are dissociated, PNG activity would not be spatially restricted, being able to phosphorylate substrates throughout the activated egg. In this model, GNU localization would function to localize and activate PNG at a subset of cytoplasmic RNPs where the most imperative targets are present. Although our data are more consistent with the ‘beacon’ model, we cannot presently rule out the ‘sequestration’ model. Experiments using FRAP to measure how strongly GNU is bound to RNP granules could be helpful, as sequestration would require tight retention of GNU in the granules.</p><p>A final implication of this work is the possible roles of GNU in addition to the activation of PNG. Whether GNU regulation of PNG follows the ‘sequestration’ or ‘beacon’ models, the presence of GNU in oocytes suggests a potential PNG-independent role in regulating maternal mRNA translation. This idea is further supported by the effect of <italic>gnu</italic> on BIC-C RNP granules. A detailed analysis of mRNA translation in <italic>gnu</italic> null mutant oocytes, as well as in <italic>gnu<sup>9A</sup></italic> and <italic>gnu<sup>ΔSAM</sup></italic> mutant mature oocytes, is needed to assess the independent roles of GNU in regulating RNP granules and mRNA translation in mature oocytes.</p><p>Understanding the regulation of the PNG kinase complex, a major regulator of mRNA translation, and the role of its subunits is crucial for understanding the transition from oocyte to embryo. Moreover, in addition to implications in fertility, understanding the relationship between the PNG complex, RNP granules, and mRNA translation will yield insights into conserved regulation underlying developmental transitions that require rapid control of translation. Indeed, parallels between the roles of GNU and the PNG complex can be found in other organisms and in other developmental contexts. During left-right patterning in frog and fish, BICC1, the BIC-C homolog, can bind to the ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3 and ANKS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rothé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rothé et al., 2020</xref>). The interaction with ANKS3 can recruit a Ser/Thr kinase, NEK7, to regulate left-right patterning by restricting its activity to the right side of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramachandran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rothé et al., 2020</xref>). This model of regulation of NEK7 by ANKS3 and BICC1 is reminiscent of our model of regulation of PNG activity by GNU and BIC-C. The interaction with ANKS3 and ANKS6 also plays a role in regulating BICC1 polymerization and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rothé et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to the ankyrin repeats, ANKS6 and ANKS3 also contain a SAM domain, and they can interact with BICC1 via SAM:SAM domain interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rothé et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of the PNG complex, a Ser/Thr kinase, these features are split between the two regulating subunits. Whereas GNU contains a SAM domain, in PLU the only discernable domains are ankyrin repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axton et al., 1994</xref>). The similarities between the regulation of these two complexes suggest that similar control mechanisms are at play in different developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0001120</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>png</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0000826</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>plu</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0003114</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Bic-C</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0000182</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tral</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0041775</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>me31b</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0004419</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT: <italic>Oregon R</italic></td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu-wt-gfp[1-5]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w;P{w[+mC], gnu-wt-gfp}; gnu[305]/</italic> <break/><italic>TM3, Sb</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu-wt-gfp[1-4]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w, P{w[+mC], gnu-wt-gfp};;gnu[305]/TM3, Sb</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu-wt-gfp[1-8]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w;P{w[+mC], gnu-wt-gfp}; gnu[305]/</italic> <break/><italic>TM3, Sb</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu-9A-gfp[2-7]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w;P{w[+mC], gnu-9A-gfp}; gnu[305]/</italic> <break/><italic>TM3, Sb</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gnu-9A-gfp[2-8]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w;P{w[+mC], gnu-9A-gfp}; gnu[305]/</italic> <break/><italic>TM3, Sb</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>tral-gfp[89]</italic></td><td valign="top">The Flytrap Project; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morin et al., 2001</xref>; PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11742088/">11742088</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Flytrap:G00089; DGRC:110584; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/DGGR_110658">DGGR_110658</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w[*];P{w[+mC]=PTT-un1}</italic> <break/><italic>G00089</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>me31b-gfp</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Genotype: <italic>w, P{[W[+mC]], me31b-gfp}</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Bic-C-gfp[v318872]</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarov et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/VDRC_v318872">VDRC_v318872</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Transgene carries dsRed marker.

The study is careful, the data are clear and convincing, and the authors support their initial biochemistry with genetic and cell biological experiments. In my opinion this is a strong study with no major weaknesses in the data presented.</p><p>The conclusion that GNU is bound to BIC-C in RNP particles in the oocyte, and that its dispersal at fertilisation is relevant to the control of the translation of Cyclin B will be of interest because it reveals a feedback between RNP granules and the regulator of a kinase that controls mRNA unmasking and translation. The data also reveal that the make-up of RNA granules is heterogeneous. Lastly, the relationship revealed here could also have wider implications for kinase regulation in other developmental contexts.</p><p>Figure 1B: Although it looks as if less BIC-C is brought down with the GNU 9A mutant, it also looks as if less GNU is present in the IPs.

Upon egg activation, GNU disperses into the cytoplasm, concomitant with dispersal of the RNP particles. The authors' immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, verified by immunoprecipitation and consistent with yeast two-hybrid results where available, show that GNU associates with several, but not all, proteins found in RNPs. They then determine many specifics of this association. GNU is shown to associate with BIC-C, and the RNP particles that contain GNU also contain BIC-C, defining a subpopulation of RNP particles. The authors show that GNU's SAM domain is needed to interact with BIC-C, and that mutations that disable GNU's CDK1 target sites diminish its interactions with RNP proteins. They propose two models for the implications of GNU's association with RNP particles. In one, GNU is sequestered from PNG by being stored in these particles. Its release upon egg activation frees GNU to complex with and activate PNG. Some of the data presented are consistent with this model, but others are decidedly not. This led the authors to propose and favor a new, creative, &quot;beacon&quot; model in which PNG is attracted to the GNU-containing subset of RNP particles, allowing the kinase to be activated there and to phosphorylate its targets there. The authors' data are consistent with this model.</p><p>The study is at the intersection between, and contributes to, several timely and important questions: the roles of RNP particles, IDP domain proteins, and mechanisms for transitioning to totipotency. The methods are state of the art. The experiments include all appropriate controls, appropriate sample sizes and biological repeats. The data are high-quality and clear, and interpreted carefully and rigorously. Conclusions are also verified by independent alternative approaches. As typical for this lab's papers, every time I thought of an alternative explanation for a result, the next sentence of the paper and next panel of the figure addressed my issue and laid it to rest. The interesting models are important for the research community to think about. The writing and logic are very clear. The only small concern, which does not diminish my enthusiasm for this work, is that some of the largest interpretations are speculative, including that the beacon model is not yet proven. However, this is already a very large paper, and there is not room for all possible tests. And the important question, rigorous and interesting results, and novel conclusions will be of great interest to the field.</p><p>Suggested modifications.</p><p>1.

In Figure 6A, lane 5, why are there two bands for GNU-GFP? Also, if not noted in the text (I may have missed it) it may be worth noting that band size differences for both GNU and BIC-C in lane 6 vs. 5, and BIC-C in 3 vs. 2, are due to changes in phosphorylation states, if this is the case.</p><p>3.

This is an important time in development, at which the pre-pattern in the oocyte transitions to the beginning of bringing that pre-pattern to life using a combination of pre-localised determinants and new transcription in the early embryo. The current manuscript uses biochemical methods combined with microscopy in wild type and mutants to further characterise the interactions and relationships of the factors required for this transition. They examined the interactions of PGN and GNU (and requirement of its SAM domain for the interactions) as well as the co-localisation at granules. They found interesting interactions with GNU with several granule factors of major known developmental significant, TRAL, ME31B, and BIC-C in mature oocytes. The authors propose different classes of granules with distinct compositions and present two interesting alternative models for the regulation of PGN by GNU during the three critical developmental stages: mature oocyte, during activation and activated embryo.</p><p>There are some specific issues that I would recommend resolving, which in my opinion will greatly improve the manuscript and the clarity of data presentation.</p><p>1) I think the title of the manuscript would be improved if it were a statement of the key THM or finding. &quot;The GNU subunit of PNG kinase, the developmental regulator of mRNA translation, an RNP component in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes&quot;.

There is nearly any colour content in them (they are mostly black and white with a tinny hint of colour). This may just be a simple reproduction issue. It would also be good to present a bit more analysis or &quot;blow up&quot; of the granules to describe/quantitate the co-localisations presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67294.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All the referees have agreed that only textual revisions are required for publication as follows:</p><p>The title of the manuscript would be improved if it were a statement of the key theme or finding.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B: Although it looks as if less BIC-C is brought down with the GNU 9A mutant, it also looks as if less GNU is present in the IPs.
