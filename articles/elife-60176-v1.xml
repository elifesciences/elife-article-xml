algal food in their intestinal cells and photosynthesize for months. This phenomenon, kleptoplasty, poses a question of how the chloroplast retains its activity without the algal nucleus. There have been debates on the horizontal transfer of algal genes to the animal nucleus. To settle the arguments, this study reported the genome of a kleptoplastic sea slug, <italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic>, and found no evidence of photosynthetic genes encoded on the nucleus. Nevertheless, it was confirmed that light illumination prolongs the life of mollusk under starvation. These data presented a paradigm that a complex adaptive trait, as typified by photosynthesis, can be transferred between eukaryotic kingdoms by a unique organelle transmission without nuclear gene transfer. Our phylogenomic analysis showed that genes for proteolysis and immunity undergo gene expansion and are up-regulated in chloroplast-enriched tissue, suggesting that these molluskan genes are involved in the phenotype acquisition without horizontal gene transfer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Elysia marginata</italic></kwd><kwd>kleptoplasty</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd><italic>Halimeda borneensis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25128713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Taro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22128001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishiyama</surname><given-names>Tomoaki</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasebe</surname><given-names>Mitsuyasu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H06553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minagawa</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221S0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Taro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shigenobu</surname><given-names>Shuji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The newly opened genome of a kleptoplastic mollusk, <italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic>, indicated that sequestered plastids retain their activity within the animal cell without horizontal algal gene transfer to the animal nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the Hershey–Chase experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hershey and Chase, 1952</xref>), which proved that DNA is the material transferred to bacteria in phage infections, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been considered essential for cross-species transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber, 2014</xref>). Although the prion hypothesis has rekindled the interest in proteins as an element of phenotype propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crick, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wickner et al., 2015</xref>), HGT is still assumed to be the cause of transformation. For example, in a secondary plastid acquisition scenario in dinoflagellates, (1) a non-phototrophic eukaryote sequesters a unicellular archaeplastid; (2) the endogenous gene transfer to the non-phototrophic eukaryote leads to the shrinkage of the archaeplastidan nuclear DNA (nucDNA); and (3) the archaeplastidan nucleus disappears, and its plastid becomes a secondary plastid in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reyes-Prieto et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Chloroplast sequestration in sea slugs has attracted much attention due to the uniqueness of the algae-derived phenotype acquisition. Some species of sacoglossan sea slugs (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Heterobranchia) can photosynthesize using the chloroplasts of their algal food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Vries and Archibald, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kawaguti, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pierce and Curtis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rumpho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Serôdio et al., 2014</xref>). These sacoglossans ingest species-specific algae and sequester the chloroplasts into their intestinal cells. This phenomenon is called kleptoplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilyarov, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pelletreau et al., 2011</xref>).

Sacoglossan sea slugs puncture the cell wall of food algae to suck out the protoplasm. The chloroplasts in the protoplasm are transported to the sea slug’s intestinal tract, and the intestinal epithelial cells sequester chloroplasts by phagocytosis. The sequestered chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) maintain the photosynthetic activity in the cell for days to months. The sacoglossan cell contains no algal nuclei.

Although transcriptomic analyses of other sea slug species failed to detect HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wägele et al., 2011</xref>), transcriptomic data were insufficient to ascertain genomic gene composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vries et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rauch et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, the genome sequences of another sacoglossan species, <italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), are presented to clarify whether HGT is the primary system underlying kleptoplasty. For more than 70 years, multiple research groups have studied <italic>P. ocellatus</italic> for its long-term (&gt;3 months) ability to retain kleptoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Evertsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Greve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawaguti, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trench et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wade and Sherwood, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wägele et al., 2011</xref>). However, a recent phylogenetic analysis showed that <italic>P. ocellatus</italic> is a species complex (a set of closely related species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christa et al., 2014c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krug et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meyers-Muñoz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is useful to revisit previous studies on <italic>P. ocellatus</italic>. This study first confirmed the photosynthetic activity and adaptive relevance of kleptoplasty to <italic>P. ocellatus</italic> type black (a species confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krug et al., 2013</xref> via molecular phylogenetics; hereafter ‘PoB’). The genome sequences of PoB (N50 = 1.45 Mb) and a related species, <italic>Elysia marginata</italic> (N50 = 225 kb), were then constructed. By improving the DNA extraction method, the genome sequences from a single sea slug individual in each species were successfully assembled. The comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of these species demonstrate the complete lack of photosynthetic genes in these sea slug genomes and supported an alternative hypothetical kleptoplasty mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Does the kleptoplast photosynthesis prolong the life of PoB?</title><p>To explore the photosynthetic activity of PoB, three photosynthetic indices were measured: photochemical efficiency of kleptoplast photosystem II (PSII), oxygen production rate after starvation for 1–3 months, and effect of illumination on PoB longevity. The Fv/Fm value, which reflects the maximum quantum yield of PSII, was 0.68–0.69 in the ‘d38’ PoB group (starved for 38 days) and 0.57–0.64 in the ‘d109’ group (starved for 109–110 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These results supported that light exposure does not affect sacoglossan longevity in the absence of kleptoplasts. Although plastid-free PoB may directly indicate that kleptoplasty extends longevity, there is no way to remove kleptoplasts from PoB, except during long-term starvation. PoB feeds on nothing but algae and retains the kleptoplast for 3–5 months. Although future research methods may allow for more experimental analyses of kleptoplast functions, the currently most straightforward idea is that kleptoplast photosynthesis increases the starvation resistance of PoB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Do kleptoplasts encode more photosynthetic genes than general plastid?</title><p>To reveal the proteins synthesized from kleptoplast DNA (kpDNA), we sequenced the whole kpDNA from PoB and compared the sequences with algal plastid and nuclear genes.

Simple homology searches (blastp) against the RefSeq database found 127 PoB gene models with top hits to Cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae. Eighty-two of the 127 top hits encoded functionally unknown protein (annotated as ‘hypothetical protein’ or ‘uncharacterized protein’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Viridiplantal <italic>Volvox</italic> was the most abundant source of algae of the top-hit sequences (17 genes), and cryptophytan <italic>Guillardia</italic> was the second most abundant source (10 genes). However, the prediction of taxonomical origin using multiple blast-hit results (Last Common Ancestor [LCA] analysis with MEGAN software; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Huson et al., 2007</xref>) denied the algal origin of the genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). A blastp search using the A614 dataset, which contains sequences of the potential gene donor (e.g., transcriptomic data of <italic>H. borneensis</italic>), also determined no positive HGT evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>Using LCA analysis for all PoB gene models, some genes were predicted to originate from species other than Lophotrochozoa. These genes may be due to HGT, but no photosynthesis-related genes were found from them. MEGAN predicted that 20,189 of the PoB genes originated from Lophotrochozoa and its subtaxa. The prediction also assigned 5550 genes to higher adequate taxa as Lophotrochozoa (e.g., Bilateria). MEGAN assigned the 2964 genes to Opisthokonta other than Lophotrochozoa (e.g., Ecdysozoa) and 312 genes derived from proteobacteria as promising horizontally transferred genes. However, these 3276 genes contained no photosynthetic gene. Many of the PoB genes assigned as promising horizontally transferred genes encoded reverse transcriptase. For the remaining 48,215 genes, MEGAN assigned no species. A homology search against the public database annotated 41,203 of the no-taxon-assigned genes as functionally unknown genes (FigShare; DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.13042016). Other no-taxon-assigned 7012 genes were not associated with photosynthesis, except one gene (p288c60.92) annotated to ‘photosystem I assembly protein ycf3’. However, this annotation to p288c60.92 was not reliable because it seems to be derived from incorrect annotations on public databases. Our reannotation via blastp search against the RefSeq database indicated the similarity of the PoB gene (p288c60.92) to ‘XP_013785360, death-associated protein kinase related-like’ of a horseshoe crab. The details of the analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. MEGAN-based analysis, hence, indicated that several non-photosynthetic genes might have originated from proteobacteria or other organisms but provided no evidence of algae-derived HGT.</p><p>In gene function assignment with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, no PoB gene model was annotated as a gene relating ‘Photosynthesis (GO:0015979),” although the same method found 72 to 253 photosynthesis-related genes in the five referential algal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

For six algal queries (e.g., peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase gene), the number of matching reads was comparable between PoB and the A614 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; the normalized read count was higher than 100). However, the presence of homologous genes on the PoB genome (e.g., p310c70.15) suggests that the reads were not derived from an algae-derived region but rather resemble molluskan genes. For example, a simple alignment showed that the <italic>C. lentillifera-</italic>derived g566.t1 gene (encoding peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) was partially similar to the PoB p310c70.15 gene, and 76% (733/970) of reads that hit against g566.t1 were also hitting against p310c70.15 under the same MMseq2 parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Hence, it was considered that no loss of algal-derived HGT regions occurred in the assembly process.</p><p>Changing the focus to HGT of non-photosynthetic algal genes, the indices for prokaryote-derived HGT (h-index; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boschetti et al., 2012</xref>) and algae-derived HGT (hA-index; see Materials and methods) were calculated for PoB and two non-kleptoplastic gastropods (negative controls; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Three PoB gene models as potential algae-derived genes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); however, two of these encoded a transposon-related protein, and the other encoded an ankyrin repeat protein with a conserved sequence with an animal ortholog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, non-kleptoplastic gastropods (e.g., <italic>Aplysia californica</italic>) had similar numbers of probable HGT genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taking these results together, it was concluded that there is no evidence of algae-derived HGT in the PoB genomic data.</p><p>The presence of algae-like RNA in PoB was then examined, as a previous study of another sea slug species <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> hypothesized that algae-derived RNA contributes to kleptoplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharya et al., 2013</xref>). This previous study used short-read-based blast searches and reverse transcription PCR analyses to detected algal mRNA (e.g., <italic>psbO</italic> mRNA) in multiple adult <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> specimens (no tissue information was provided; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharya et al., 2013</xref>). To analyze the algal RNA distribution in PoB, 15 RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from six tissue types (digestive gland [DG], parapodium, DG-exenterated parapodium [DeP], egg, head, and pericardium; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>), and MMseq2 searches were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although almost all (594/614) of the A614 dataset queries matched no reads, 19 queries matched 1–10 reads and the <italic>C. lentillifera</italic>-derived g566.t1 query matched more than 10 reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This high hit rate for g566.t1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), however, is due to its high sequence similarity with PoB ortholog, p310c70.15, as mentioned above. A previous anatomical study showed the kleptoplast density in various tissues to be DG &gt; parapodium &gt; DeP = head = pericardium &gt;&gt;&gt; egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hirose, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the amount of algae-like RNA reads did not correlate with the kleptoplast richness among the tissues. Enrichment of algae-like RNA was only found in the egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The PoB egg is considered a kleptoplast-free stage and is covered by a mucous jelly, which potentially contains environmental microorganisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). Hence, it was presumed that these RNA fragments are not derived from kleptoplasts but from contaminating microalgae. The searches for algae-like RNA in PoB found no credible evidence of algae-derived RNA transfer and no correlation between algal RNA and kleptoplasty.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>What kind PoB genes are reasonable candidates for kleptoplasty-related genes?</title><p>Because the PoB genome was found to be free of algae-derived genes, it was considered that a neofunctionalized molluskan gene might contribute to kleptoplasty. To find candidate kleptoplasty-related molluskan (KRM) genes, we assessed genes that were up-regulated in DG (the primary kleptoplasty location) versus DeP in the RNA-Seq data described above. As a result, 162 DG-up-regulated genes were found (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.01, triplicate samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). By conducting GO analysis, the functions of 93 DG-up-regulated genes were identified. These up-regulated genes are enriched for genes involved in proteolysis (GO terms: ‘Proteolysis,’ ‘Aspartic-type endopeptidase activity,’ ‘Cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity’, and ‘Anatomical structure development’), carbohydrate metabolism (‘Carbohydrate metabolic process’, ‘One-carbon metabolic process’, ‘Cation binding’, and ‘Regulation of pH’), and immunity (‘Defense response’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Manual annotation identified the function of 42 of the remaining DG-up-regulated genes. Many of these are also related to proteolysis and immunity: three genes relate to proteolysis (i.e., genes encoding interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase, replicase polyprotein 1a, and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein), and 21 genes contribute to natural immunity (i.e., genes encoding lectin, blood cell aggregation factor, and MAC/perforin domain-containing protein; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Manual annotation also found four genes encoding apolipoprotein D, which promotes resistance to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charron et al., 2008</xref>), and three genes involved in nutrition metabolism (i.e., genes encoding betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1-like protein, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and cell surface hyaluronidase). Because the analyzed slugs were starved for 1 month, it was considered that DG-up-regulated genes contribute to kleptoplasty rather than digestion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Probable KRM genes in PoB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot comparing gene expressions in DG and DeP tissues of PoB.

The phylogenomic analysis showed that 6 of the 193 orthogroups that underwent gene expansion in this lineage contained DG-up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). This result supported the notion that these DG-up-regulated genes play a role in kleptoplasty. The most distinctive orthogroup in the six groups was OG0000132, which contained 203 cathepsin D-like genes of PoB. Forty-five of the 203 genes were DG-up-regulated, and Fisher’s exact test supported the significant enrichment of DG-up-regulated genes (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). Other heterobranchian mollusks only had four to five genes belonging to OG0000132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These gene duplications in PoB might reduce selection pressure to maintain function via redundancy and promote new function acquirement of the paralogs, as occurs in the well-known neofunctionalization scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conrad and Antonarakis, 2007</xref>). Significant enrichment of DG-up-regulated genes was also detected in OG0000005 (18 genes) and OG0000446 (four genes; both p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>), which contain lectin-like and apolipoprotein D-like genes, respectively. DG-up-regulated genes were also detected in OG0000002, OG0009179, and OG0000194. However, no significant enrichment of these genes was found in these orthogroups (p&gt;0.05). OG0000002 contains DG-up-regulated gene for type two cystatin and various genes with reverse transcriptase domains. This result suggested that the reverse transcriptase domain clustered the various genes as one orthogroup, and the gene number expansion was due to the high self-duplication activity of the retrotransposon in PoB. OG0009179 and OG0000194 contain DG-up-regulated genes of unknown function. From the above results, 67 genes were finally selected as promising targets of study for PoB kleptoplasty: 45 genes for cathepsin D-like proteins, 18 genes for lectin-like proteins, and 4 genes for apolipoprotein D-like protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Evolution of candidate KRM genes</title><p>For a more detailed analysis of the evolution of KRM genes in sacoglossan lineages, a new draft genome sequence of another sacoglossan sea slug <italic>E. marginata</italic> (previously included in <italic>E. ornata</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krug et al., 2013</xref>) was constructed. PoB and <italic>E. marginata</italic> belong to the same family (Plakobranchidae; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both species sequester plastids from Bryopsidales algae; however, the kleptoplast retention time is limited to a few days in <italic>E. marginata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>). These features suggested that their common ancestor obtained a mechanism to sequester algal plastids, but <italic>E. marginata</italic> did not develop a system for their long-term retention. Hence, it was considered that comparing gene expansion in these species would clarify the genetic basis of plastid sequestration and long-term retention.</p><p>Using the same methods as described for PoB, one complete circular kpDNA, one complete mtDNA, and 790.3 Mbp nucDNA (87.8% of the estimated genome size; 14,149 scaffolds; N50 = 0.23 Mbp; 70,752 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">13,</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">14</xref>) were sequenced for <italic>E. marginata</italic>.

In cathepsin D-like genes, sacoglossan (PoB and <italic>E. marginata</italic>) genes formed a specific subgroup in the OG0000132 phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and gene duplication in OG0000132 seemed to be accelerated along the PoB lineage (203 genes in PoB versus five genes in <italic>E. marginata</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). All sacoglossan cathepsin D-like genes belonged to a clade with several other heterobranchian homologs; this clade contained three subclades (α, β, and γ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The basal α-clade contained three <italic>A. californica</italic> genes, one <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> gene, and three sacoglossan genes. The β- and γ-clades contained sacoglossan genes only and an <italic>A. californica</italic> gene located at the basal position of the β- and γ-clades. Almost all duplicated PoB genes (201/203) belonged to the γ-clade, including one <italic>E. marginata</italic> gene (e8012c40.2). These phylogenetic relationships suggested that the γ-clade has undergone dozens of gene duplication events in the PoB lineage. Interestingly, all DG-up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonged to the γ-clade, and the PoB paralogs that belong to the α- and β-clades showed different expression patterns from the γ-clade paralogs; the gene p609c69.52 (α-clade) was ubiquitously expressed in the examined tissues, and p374c67.53 (β-clade) was expressed only in the egg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The mammalian genes encoding cathepsin D and its analog (cathepsin E) were ubiquitously expressed on various tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we considered that (1) the ubiquitously expressed p609c69.52 gene in α-clade is a functional ortholog of the mammalian cathepsin D gene, (2) the p374c67.53 gene in β-clade relates sea slug embryo development, and (3) the γ-clade genes have been acquired with the development of plastid sequestration. To test the positive or relaxed selection on the duplication event, the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) sites (ω = dN/dS) was used. Longly alignable heterobranchian genes from OG0000132 were used and statistically tested using CodeML and RELAX software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). The CodeML analysis (branch-site model) determined no significant positive selection on the basal node of the γ-clade (p&gt;0.05, χ<sup>2</sup> test), but RELAX suggested that the γ-clade evolved under relaxed selection relative to the rest branches (K = 0.44, p&lt;0.001). The cathepsin D-like genes formed multiple tandem repeat structures in the PoB genome, although other Heterobranchia had no tandem repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). In <italic>E. marginata</italic>, the gene e8012c40.2 located at the basal position of the γ-clade had no repeat structure, although two genes from the α-clade (e4981c37.5 and e4981c37.4) and two from the β-clade (e2244c39.16 and e2244c39.20) made two tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

The revealed genomic structure indicated that the duplicates were not due to whole-genome duplication but rather a combination of several subgenomic duplication events: the dispersed duplicates are likely due to replicative transposition by a transposable element, and the tandem repeats are likely due to a local event (e.g., unequal crossover).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Evolutional process of KRM gene candidates of OG0000132.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ML phylogenetic tree for OG0000132 genes (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The sacoglossan genes were duplicated in a monophyletic clade (clade I) only, and all DG-up-regulated DEGs were contained in clade I. CodeML found no significant positive selection on the basal node of clade Ia (p&gt;0.05), but RELAX suggested evolution under relaxed selection relative to the rest branches (K = 0.69; p=0.003; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). On the other subclades, no significant positive selection or relaxed selection was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). All DG-up-regulated DEGs were contained in clade I. It was hypothesized that duplication on the common lineage relates to plastid sequestration, and the PoB-specific duplication events contribute to long-term kleptoplasty.</p><p>In OG0000005 (lectin-like gene group), the gene counts were comparable between PoB (367 genes) and <italic>E. marginata</italic> (213 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); however, the phylogenetic tree suggests that this similarity is due to different gene duplication events in each species.

The observed gene expansions of lectin-like genes in each of these sea slugs may widen their targets and complicate the natural immune system to distinguish the kleptoplast from other antigens. Four clades having expanded homologs on the sacoglossan lineage were detected (clades A–D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Candidate KRM genes, i.e., apolipoprotein D-like, cathepsin D-like, and lectin-like genes, were also identified using a combination of genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Data present a paradigm of kleptoplasty in which PoB obtains the adaptive photosynthesis trait by a HGT-independent phenotype acquisition.</p><p>The PoB genomic sequence clarified the gene repertory of its kpDNA, mtDNA, and nucDNA. The whole kpDNA sequence indicated that PoB kleptoplasts could produce some proteins involved in photosynthesis (e.g., PsbA, a core protein in PSII; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) if gene expression machinery is sufficiently active, as reported in <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pierce et al., 2007</xref>). The absence of core photosynthetic genes in the PoB genome was then demonstrated. For instance, no genes encoding PsaF of photosystem I, PsbO of PSII, or RbcS of Rubisco in kpDNAs, mtDNA, or nucDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) were detected despite the queries (e.g., A612 dataset; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) containing multiple algal orthologs of these genes; these gene products are essential for photosynthesis in various plants and algae and located on their nuclear genome, not plastid genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farah et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pigolev et al., 2009</xref>). This result means that PoB can perform photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) without de novo synthesis of these gene products. The absence of algae-derived HGT is consistent with previous transcriptomic analyses of <italic>P.</italic> cf. <italic>ocellatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wägele et al., 2011</xref>) and other sacoglossan species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vries et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wägele et al., 2011</xref>). A previous genome study of <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> predicted that fragmented algal DNA and mRNAs contribute to its kleptoplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharya et al., 2013</xref>), and fluorescence in situ hybridization study detected algal gene signals on <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). Although our manual check of gene annotation found no photosynthesis-related gene from a more complete version of the <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> nuclear genome sequence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2019</xref> provided no discussion about HGT. After all, the PoB results proposed that algal DNA and/or RNA is not an absolute requirement for kleptoplast photosynthesis.</p><p>The combination of genomics and transcriptomics suggests that the maintenance of algae-derived protein activity is the most probable mechanism for retaining PoB photosynthesis. Because of the limited longevity of the photosynthetic proteins in algal cells and/or in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>), previous studies have discussed the elongation of algal protein lifespans via protective sea slug proteins as an alternative hypothesis to HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Vries and Archibald, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Serôdio et al., 2014</xref>). This study shows three types of potential KRM genes: apolipoprotein D-like, cathepsin D-like, and lectin-like genes. Some of these KRM genes may encode proteins that protect algae-derived proteins. Although further studies are needed to elucidate their functional roles in detail, the obtained results are consistent with HGT’s alternative hypothesis, algal protein retention.</p><p>Previous RNA-Seq studies of <italic>Elysia timida</italic> and <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> found up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes in response to photostress and postulated that SOD protects algal proteins in the kleptoplasts from oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vries et al., 2015</xref>). No significant up-regulation of the SOD gene in PoB DG was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was up-regulation of apolipoprotein D-like genes and the expansion of these genes in PoB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Apolipoprotein D, a lipid antioxidant, confers resistance to oxidative stress in higher plants and animal brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charron et al., 2008</xref>). Ortholog analysis of the new <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> data found no gene number expansion of these homologs in <italic>E. chlorotica</italic>, i.e., only three apolipoprotein D-like homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp15">Supplementary file 15</xref>). Although the retention process details may differ among species and abiotic conditions, it is attractive to speculate that oxidative stress resilience is of major importance for kleptoplasty in multiple sacoglossan species.</p><p>Previous kleptoplasty studies have not focused on cathepsin D-like and lectin-like genes. The involvement of the mechanisms of these proteins in kleptoplasty remains to be solved. Cathepsin D degrades intracellular proteins and contributes to the degradation of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). In general, damaged photosynthetic proteins generate abundant ROS, promoting further protein damage. In PoB, cathepsin D-like protease may degrade damaged proteins and prevent further protein inactivation. Lectin is involved in self‐recognition in natural immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Worthley et al., 2005</xref>). The diverse lectins expressed in PoB DG tissue may bind the antigens of algae-derived molecules, mediate the detection of non-self-proteins and/or saccharides, and lead to the selective degradation and retention of algae-derived proteins and organelles.</p><p>These genomic data indicate that a proteomic analysis of kleptoplasts is warranted. A previous isotopic study indicated that <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> kleptoplasts contain function-unknown proteins transported from the sea slug cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pierce et al., 1996</xref>). Although several algal photosynthetic proteins have been immunoassayed in kleptoplasts, animal nuclear-encoded proteins have been out of the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pierce et al., 1996</xref>). The in silico study found no typical chloroplast localization signal in PoB KRM genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>). However, the genomic data will help identify kleptoplast-localized sea slug proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting.</p><p>This study provides the first genomic evidence of photosynthesis acquisition without horizontal DNA or RNA transfer. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA is the core material for heredity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hershey and Chase, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Watson and Crick, 1953</xref>) and assumed that horizontal DNA transfer causes cross-species phenotype acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuña et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dehal et al., 2002</xref>). However, our studies indicate that PoB gains adaptive photosynthetic activity without acquiring any of the many algal nucleic genes involved in photosynthesis. This is evidence of a phenotype (and organelle) acquisition, although temporally, from the donor without DNA or RNA transfer. Recent studies of shipworms (wood-feeding mollusks in the family Teredinidae) showed that they utilize several symbiont-derived proteins for their food digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>). Golden sweeper fish (<italic>Parapranthus ransonneti</italic>) gain the luciferase for their bioluminescence from ostracod prey, suggesting phenotype acquisition via the sequestration of a non-self-protein (kleptoprotein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bessho-Uehara et al., 2020</xref>). However, these two examples of HGT-independent phenotype acquisition are limited to the transfer of simple phenotypes that depend on just a few enzymes. In contrast, the well-known complexity of photosynthesis suggests that sea slug kleptoplasty depends on DNA/RNA-independent phenotype acquisition of complex pathways requiring multiple enzymes (e.g., entire photosystems and the Calvin cycle). It is attractive to speculate that other symbiont-derived organelles (e.g., mitochondria) and obligate endosymbiotic bacteria and protozoan kleptoplasts (e.g., in <italic>Dinophysis acuminata</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hackett et al., 2003</xref>) can obtain traits derived from another species via a HGT-independent system. Although several organisms have multiple HGT-derived functional genes, it is still unclear how the organism evolutionarily obtained the appropriate expression control system of the non-self-gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sasakura et al., 2016</xref>). These PoB data suggested that the transfer of complex adaptive phenotypes sometimes precede the gene transfer from the donor species, having the potential to explain the process of cross-species development of complex phenotypes. Some organisms might evolutionarily obtain the HGT-derived genes and appropriate control system of the gene expression after the transfer of phenotype. Our finding of HGT-independent complex phenotype acquisition may open new viewpoints on cross-species evolutionary interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samplings of sea slugs and algae</title><p>Samples were collected from southwestern Japan.

During the light phase, the photosynthetic photon flux density was 10 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (LI-250A Light Meter with LI-193 Underwater Spherical Quantum Sensor; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The seawater was not changed during the incubation period, except to adjust the salinity using distilled water. Photosynthetic activity indices (oxygen generation rate and PAM fluorometry) were measured using oxygen sensor spots (Witrox 4; Loligo Systems, Tjele, Denmark) and PAM-2500 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). <italic>H. borneensis</italic>, which was easily collected and kept in the laboratory, was used as a reference for comparison in the PAM analysis. This species is a donor alga of PoB kleptoplasts and closely related species with the major donors of PoB, <italic>R. lewmanomontiae</italic>, and <italic>Poropsis</italic> spp. These two major donors firmly adhered to the rock, were tangled up in other algal species, and were difficult to be collected.</p><p>The oxygen sensor spots were affixed to the inside of a glass respirometry chamber. Before performing the measurements, the system was calibrated using sodium sulfite (0% O<sub>2</sub> saturation) and fully O<sub>2</sub>-saturated seawater (100% O<sub>2</sub> saturation). A sea slug was placed into a respirometry chamber filled with fully O<sub>2</sub>-saturated filtered artificial seawater (7 ml). The top of the chamber was closed with a glass slide. All visible bubbles were removed from the chamber. The chamber was maintained at a constant temperature (23–24°C) using a water jacket attached to a temperature-controlled water flow. The Witrox temperature probe for calibration was immersed in the water jacket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>).</p><p>The oxygen concentration was measured sequentially under changing light conditions. The percent O<sub>2</sub> saturation was monitored continuously and recorded using AutoResp software (Loligo Systems) for 10 min after the respirometry chamber acclimation period (10 min). The oxygen consumption rate by respiration was measured under dark conditions. Next, the respirometry chambers were exposed to the red LED light (800 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) to measure the change in the oxygen concentration under light conditions due to the balance between the photosynthesis and respiration rates. The chambers were illuminated from the sides because a mounted LED light increased the oxygen meter’s noise. The light direction to the sea slug was inconsistent because the slug kept moving around the chamber during the measurement period. In sea slugs, the rate of photosynthesis was unaffected by the direction of illumination because the rate of O<sub>2</sub> generation rate under a particular constant illumination did not change regardless of the sea slug’s position in the chamber. The percent O<sub>2</sub> saturation was measured for 10 min. One blank (i.e., without sea slug) condition was run as a negative control to account for background biological activity in seawater. AutoResp software was used to convert the percent saturation to an oxygen concentration ([O<sub>2</sub>], mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) based on the rate of change in the percent O<sub>2</sub> saturation, water temperature, and barometric pressure (fixed at 1013 Pa). A regression analysis was performed using the ‘lm’ function in R version 3.5.2 (tidyverse 1.2.1 package) to calculate the changing oxygen concentration rate under dark and light conditions. A gross oxygen generation rate was then obtained by photosynthesis (oL + oD = oG; oL, oxygen production rate under light conditions; oD, oxygen consumption rate under dark conditions; oG, gross oxygen generation by photosynthesis).</p><p>During PAM fluorometry analysis, each sea slug was caged in a single well of a 12-well cell culture plate (Corning, Corning, NY) after adaptation to the dark for 15 min. To ensure reproducibility, the sea slug was caged upside down (i.e., the ventral surface was brought to the upside), the animal was softly squeezed with a plastic sponge, and the PAM light probe was connected to the plate from underneath the well. Consequently, the samples could not move during the measurement, and the PAM light probe always measured the fluorescence of the dorsal surface. The maximal quantum yield, Fv/Fm, was determined by a saturation pulse of &gt;8000 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and a measurement light of 0.2 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Effect of light conditions on <italic>P. ocellatus</italic> longevity</title><p>The longevity of PoB was measured using a modified medaka (Japanese rice fish) housing rack system (Iwaki, Japan). For the longevity measurement, different individuals from the photosynthetic activity measurement were used. The longevity was investigated from the samples used in the above-mentioned photosynthetic activity measurement. Using centrally filtered systems, the water tank rack maintained consistent water conditions (e.g., temperature and mineral concentrations) among the incubation chambers (subtanks) and enabled a focus on the effect of light conditions. After acclimating the collected sea slugs under the same conditions for 1 week in an aquarium, the organisms were incubated separately for 8 months under different light conditions (continuous dark and 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle). The sea slugs’ conditions were measured daily, and death was defined when a sea slug remained motionless for 30 s after stimulation (i.e., touching with plastic bar).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sequencing of <italic>H. borneensis</italic> cpDNA</title><p>A combination of pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate <italic>H. borneensis</italic> cpDNA.

Total DNA was purified from the supernatant according to the protocol supplied with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit. The resulting DNA yield (76.8 µg) was measured using a dsDNA HS Assay Qubit Starter Kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA) and used to prepare a single-fragment library for pyrosequencing. The Pyrosequencer GS-FLX Titanium Platform (Roche, Germany) was used to generate 23.04 Mb of total singleton reads (68032 reads; average read length, 368 bp). After filtering low-quality reads, the remaining 21865 reads (~8 Mb) were submitted for assembly by Newbler (Roche).

The gaps between the four identified contigs (55551, 21264, 8076, and 3435 bp) and ambiguous sites in the contigs were amplified by PCR using inverse primers. The PCR products were sequenced by primer walking and Sanger sequencing with Takara LA Taq (Takara, Japan), a dGTP BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit (Thermo), and an ABI PRISM 3130xl DNA Sequencer (Thermo). Regions that could not be read by direct sequencing were amplified using specific primers, cloned with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Thermo), and sequenced with plasmid-specific primers. Complete cpDNA sequences were obtained by assembling the GS-FLX contigs and reads generated by Sanger sequencing using Sequencher version 4.10 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).

A fresh PoB sample (collected on October 17, 2013 and starved for 21 days) was cut into pieces and homogenized in 2× CTAB using a BioMasher. To digest the tissues, 2% vol of proteinase K solution (Qiagen) was added, and the sample was incubated overnight at 55°C. The lysate was emulsified by gentle inversion with an equal volume of chloroform; after centrifugation (12,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 2 min), the aqueous phase was collected using a pipette. This phase was combined with a one-tenth volume of 10% CTAB, mixed well at 60°C for 1 min, and again emulsified with chloroform. These 10% CTAB and chloroform treatment steps were repeated until a clear aqueous phase was achieved. The aqueous phase was then transferred to a new vessel, an equal volume of CTAB precipitation buffer was overlaid onto the mixture, and the liquids were gently mixed by tapping. The resulting filamentous precipitations (DNA) were removed using a pipette chip and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in high salt TE buffer. DNA was purified according to the protocol supplied with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen); briefly, the supernatant was transferred after vortex mixing, equal volumes of buffer AL (supplied with the kit) and EtOH were added to the supernatant, and the sample was processed on a Qiagen spin column according to the protocol.

Two paired-end Illumina libraries containing 250 and 600 bp insertions (DRR029525 and DRR029526) were constructed using a TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Three mate-pair libraries with 3000, 5000, and 10,000 bp insertions (DRR029528, DRR029529, and DRR029530) were constructed using a Nextera Mate Pair Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced (150 bp from each end) on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina). A total of 1,130,791,572 and 787,040,878 raw reads were obtained for the paired-end (170 Gb) and mate-pair (118 Gb) libraries.

PoB RNA was extracted from an individual after starvation for 20 days (collected on October 17, 2013). TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit (Thermo) was used to extract RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A paired-end Illumina library (DRR029460) was constructed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced (150 bp from each end) on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina). The library produced a total of 286,819,502 raw reads (28 Gb).</p><p>The PoB assemblies were processed using a single transcript-based gene model construction pipeline (AUGUSTUS version 3.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stanke and Morgenstern, 2005</xref>), two transcriptomic data mapping tools (Trinity version 2.4.0 and Exonerate version 2.2.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slater and Birney, 2005</xref>), and two non-transcript-based model construction pipelines (GeneMark-ES version 4.33 and glimmerHMM version 3.0.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Majoros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008</xref>). The four obtained gene sets were merged with the EVidenceModeler version 1.1.1 pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haas et al., 2008</xref>) to yield a final gene model set. For AUGUSTUS, Braker pipeline version 1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hoff et al., 2019</xref>) was used to construct PoB-specific probabilistic models of the gene structure based on strand-specific RNA-Seq data. After filtering the low-quality and adapter sequences, the remaining 181,873,770 RNA-Seq reads (16 Gb) were mapped to the PoB genome assembly using TopHat version 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), with the default setting and the Braker pipeline-constructed PoB-specific probabilistic models from mapped read data. TopHat mapped 132,786,439 of the reads (73%) to the PoB model. AUGUSTUS then predicted 78,894 gene models from the TopHat mapping data (as ‘splicing junction’ data) and the Braker probabilistic model. Using Trinity and Exonerate, de novo transcriptomic data from RNA-Seq data were then constructed, and these were aligned to the genome. Trinity constructed 254,336 transcripts, which were clustered to 194,000 sequences using CD-Hit version 4.6 (-c 0.95); subsequently, Transdecoder identified 44,596 protein coding regions from these sequences. Exonerate (<monospace>--bestn 1 --percent 90</monospace> options) then aligned 13,141 of the transcripts to the genome. GeneMark-ES with the default settings predicted 107,735 gene models, and glimmerHMM predicted 115,633 models after the model training, with 320 manually constructed gene models from long scaffolds. EVidenceModeler was then used to merge the model with the following weight settings: AUGUSTUS = 9, Exonerate = 10, GeneMark-ES = 1, and glimmerHMM = 2. Finally, EVidenceModeler predicted 77,444 gene models.</p><p>The removal of contaminant sequences was minimized to avoid missing horizontally transferred genes. Bacterial scaffolds were defined as those encoding &gt;1 bacterial gene with no lophotrochozoan gene, and the potential bacterial scaffolds were removed from the PoB assemblies. The bacterial genes were predicted using MEGAN software according to a blastp search against the RefSeq database. Of the 40,330 gene hits identified from the RefSeq data, MEGAN assigned the origins for 39,113 genes. Specifically, 719 and 23,559 genes were assigned as bacterial and lophotrochozoan genes, respectively. MEGAN results before removing bacterial scaffolds are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary file 17</xref>, with the detailed data of removed scaffolds. Fifty-five of the 8716 scaffolds contained two or more bacterial genes and no lophotrochozoan gene. The mean depth of read coverage of the bacterial scaffolds differed from the mean coverage of sea slug scaffolds.</p><p>Kleptoplast- or mitochondria-derived scaffolds were also removed from the assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp18">Supplementary file 18</xref>). The source of scaffolds was determined based on a blast bit score against the three referential organelle DNAs (kRhip AP014542, kPoro AP014543, and PoB mtDNA AP014544) and the difference of the read depth value from the other (nuclear-derived) scaffolds. The blastn search detected 13 and 1 scaffolds as sequences of kleptoplast or mitochondrial origin, respectively (bit score &gt; 1000; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp18">Supplementary file 18</xref>). Mapping back of the Illumina read (DRR029525) by Bowtie version 2.4.1 indicated that the depth values of the 14 scaffolds were 537 to 5143, and the averaged depth of the other scaffolds was 31 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary files 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp18">18</xref>), indicating that the 14 scaffolds were derived from organelle DNAs or repetitive regions on the nucDNA. Mapping of the reads derived from DG (kleptoplast enriched tissue; DRR063263) and parapodium (including a muscle, gonad, and DG; DRR063261) indicated that the relative read depth of the 13 kpDNA-like scaffolds was higher in the DG sample than in the parapodium sample, supporting that the 13 scaffolds are derived from the kleptoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s12">Figure 4—figure supplement 12</xref>). It was then confirmed that the 14 scaffolds contain no algal nuclear-derived photosynthetic gene using two methods: dot plots with referential organelle DNAs and homology search using A612 query set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s13">Figure 4—figure supplement 13-15</xref>). Therefore, even if these removed 14 scaffolds are part of the nucDNA, they do not provide HGT evidence.

In the process of kleptoplasty animals transfer food algal chloroplasts into their digestive gland cells and benefit from the continued photosynthesis for up to several months. Previous studies suggested that the incorporation of photosynthesis-related genes from the algal nucleus into the host (sea slug) genomic DNA is a pre-requirement for kleptoplasty to occur. This study shows that such gene transfer is not necessary. The work suggests that also other mechanisms can be in place to establish and maintain the plastid-sea slug relationship. It in turn also implies that the establishment of such connections is likely easier than previously assumed, which should be considered in the context of adaptation mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chloroplast acquisition without the gene transfer in kleptoplastic sea slugs, <italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eugene V Koonin (Reviewer #1); Jia-Xing Yue (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional experimental data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. However, there are several issues raised by the reviewers that we ask you to clarify, before we can take a final decision on your work.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript addresses interesting evolutionary questions and hints at possible mechanisms about the phenomenon that certain sea slugs can take advantage of algal photosynthesis by maintaining their chloroplasts long after having ingested algae. The authors present high-quality genome assemblies and address the question of whether algal to slug HGT may have facilitated sequestration of algal chloroplasts and find no evidence to support this. There appear to be other genomic changes in the slug genome that could support retention of the chloroplasts.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The candidate kleptoplasty-related molluscan (KRM) genes that the authors identified in this study serve as an important stepping stone for direct assessment of their kleptoplasty-related function in future. That being said, their functional involvement is far from being proven. The authors demonstrate significant up-regulation of the expression of a set of nearly 200 genes in kleptoplast-harboring slugs. There are some functional trends among these genes, in particular, the enrichment of proteases and carbohydrate metabolism proteins, but it is unclear how this could possibly solve the enigma of the long-term persistence of the functioning kleptoplast given the short life time of the photosynthetic proteins. It is fine to present the data on gene expression up-regulation and the complementary evolutionary analysis, but the authors should be far more circumspect in their conclusions on the direct relevance of the respective genes and rather admit that the puzzle remains.</p><p>2. We think that naming the phenomenon of the slugs retaining chloroplasts &quot;DNA/RNA-independent transformation&quot; is problematic, because of the fixed definition of the word &quot;transformation&quot; in (molecular) biology, where transformation is defined as a genetic alteration, which it is not. It does not appear to be plausible that the phenotype and organelle &quot;have moved beyond the species&quot; – they are not inherited in the new species and it is a dead-end for these chloroplasts that are eaten and die a few months later than the rest of the algae. There is likely selective pressure for the slug to hold on to its &quot;food&quot; for a while longer due to the chemical activity of the chloroplast, but there is no selective pressure on the chloroplast to be consumed in this way that would constitute reciprocal evolutionary changes. We do not see this as anything beyond animal adaptations that facilitate utilization of a food source.</p><p>3. &quot;Taken together, the data for the three photosynthetic indexes indicate that kleptoplast photosynthesis increases resistance to starvation in PoB.&quot; – This isn't directly shown here. There are no plastid-free control slugs. Light exposed slugs live longer – but how do we know it is photosynthesis? Light can affect other cellular processes – ROS, etc.</p><p>4. In the photosynthesis experiments (Figure 2), the authors compare the kleptoplast activity to the plastid in the algae H. borneensis. However, genome sequencing revealed two distinct plastid genomes (kRhip and kPoro) which corresponded with plastids from Rhipidosiphon lewmanomontiae and Poropsis spp., neither of which were included in genomic comparisons, and were not used in the comparison for photosynthetic rate.</p><p>5. Have the authors considered that the slugs may have acquired photosynthesis related genes from non-algal origins that could potentially support the kleptoplasts? There are other examples of symbioses with many partners where HGTs not from any of the original lineages support the relationship (Husnik, 2013, Cell). Line 170 mentions 6 Chloroplast-related genes in PoB but there is no follow up on what these are, only that they do not look like algae. Could these support the photosynthetic abilities of the kleoptoplasts?</p><p>6. In general, the manuscript's readability needs improvement. This is particularly severe for the referral to the figures and a lack of clarity for the RNA seq analyses.</p><p>- Different panels of main figures (e.g. Figure 1A-1F, Figure 2B) are not well-referred in the current manuscript, which compromised the readability of the current manuscript.</p><p>- Figure 5C is too complex and busy. We recommend to simplify this panel. Here are some suggestions regarding its current form: The authors could consider further subdividing it into multiple panels. Also, the &quot;domain structure&quot; key boxes should belong to the left side of this panel , whereas an additional key box should be provided for explaining colors used in the gene position graph (on the right side of this panel). Otherwise, the readers could easily get confused. Finally, the authors might want to consider changing the color scheme used for FDR to make it more different from the color schemes used for denoting domain structure and gene position.</p><p>- Some of the RNASeq analyses are difficult to follow. For instance trying to match Figure S22 with the text is difficult. The methods states that 5 slugs were used for whole-transcriptome sequencing, but 15 libraries were constructed, and there are only 13 library IDs in Figure S22. There are 15 libraries in the heat maps in the main text. What model was used in DESeq2 to call differential expression? What level of coverage was achieved in the RNA-Seq libraries? It seems there is no biological replication for some of the samples?</p><p>7. It is interesting that the genes that are expanded in copy number also look to be upregulated. However, it is unclear whether or not multiple mappings are accounted for, and how. If multiple mappings of closely related genes are not properly accounted for then it may appear as up-regulation. Similarly, how close in sequence are the paralougs of these genes, ie, would the reads map to each other?</p><p>8. During genome assembly, were the removed &quot;bacterial scaffolds&quot; also present at different coverage levels? Did the authors screen for fungal contaminants also? They mention in the RNA-Seq analyses how other food/biofilms can be present, so there it is likely that other contaminants could be in the assembly.</p><p>9. Figure 3C: According to the authors, &quot;the vertical bar chart indicates the number of genes conserved among the species&quot;, but if so, why do rare genes seem to be more conserved than core genes according to this bar chart? This needs to be clarified.</p><p>10. To test if duplicated genes in PoB are under diversifying selection (a.k.a positive selection) or relaxed purifying selection during neofunctionalization, the authors could use tools such as PAML for a formal test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60176.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In accordance with the editor's comment, we emphasized that the direct relevance of the potential KRM genes for kleptoplasty remains unclear.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“The comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of these species demonstrate the complete lack of photosynthetic genes in these sea slug genomes and supported an alternative hypothetical kleptoplasty mechanism.”</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“The combination of genomics and transcriptomics suggests that the maintenance of algae-derived protein activity is the most probable mechanism for retaining PoB photosynthesis. Because of the limited longevity of the photosynthetic proteins in algal cells and/or in vitro (Roberts et al., 2013), previous studies have discussed the elongation of algal protein lifespans via protective sea slug proteins as an alternative hypothesis to HGT (de Vries and Archibald, 2018; Serôdio et al., 2014). This study shows three types of potential KRM genes: apolipoprotein D-like, cathepsin D-like, and lectin-like genes. Some of these KRM genes may encode proteins that protect algae-derived proteins. Although further studies are needed to elucidate their functional roles in detail, the obtained results are consistent with HGT’s alternative hypothesis, algal protein retention.</p><p>Previous RNA-Seq studies of <italic>Elysia timida</italic> and <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> found up-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes in response to photostress and postulated that SOD protects algal proteins in the kleptoplasts from oxidative damage (Chan et al., 2018; de Vries et al., 2015). No significant up-regulation of the SOD gene in PoB DG was found (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). However, there was up-regulation of apolipoprotein D-like genes and the expansion of these genes in PoB lineages (Figure 5). Apolipoprotein D, a lipid antioxidant, confers resistance to oxidative stress in higher plants and animal brains (Bishop et al., 2010; Charron et al., 2008). Ortholog analysis of the new <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> data found no gene number expansion of these homologs in <italic>E. chlorotica</italic>, i.e., only three apolipoprotein D-like homologs (Supplementary File 15). Although the retention process details may differ among species and abiotic conditions, it is attractive to speculate that oxidative stress resilience is of major importance for kleptoplasty in multiple sacoglossan species.</p><p>Previous kleptoplasty studies have not focused on cathepsin D-like and lectin-like genes. The involvement of the mechanisms of these proteins in kleptoplasty remains to be solved. Cathepsin D degrades intracellular proteins and contributes to the degradation of damaged mitochondria (Benes et al., 2008). In general, damaged photosynthetic proteins generate abundant ROS, promoting further protein damage. In PoB, cathepsin D-like protease may degrade damaged proteins and prevent further protein inactivation. Lectin is involved in self‐recognition in natural immunity (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009; Worthley et al., 2005). The diverse lectins expressed in PoB DG tissue may bind the antigens of algae-derived molecules, mediate the detection of non-self-proteins and/or saccharides, and lead to the selective degradation and retention of algae-derived proteins and organelles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have also emphasized that the organellar acquisition is a temporary phenomenon as below.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“However, these two examples of DNA/RNA-independent phenotype acquisition are limited to the transfer of simple phenotypes that depend on just a few enzymes. In contrast, the well-known complexity of photosynthesis suggests that sea slug kleptoplasty depends on DNA/RNA-independent phenotype acquisition of complex pathways requiring multiple enzymes (e.g., entire photosystems and the Calvin cycle).”</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“However, these studies indicate that PoB gains adaptive photosynthetic activity without acquiring any of the many algal nucleic genes involved in photosynthesis. This is evidence of a phenotype (and organelle) acquisition, although temporally, from the donor without DNA or RNA transfer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. &quot;Taken together, the data for the three photosynthetic indexes indicate that kleptoplast photosynthesis increases resistance to starvation in PoB.&quot; – This isn't directly shown here.

Light can affect other cellular processes – ROS, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Given the reviewer's comment, we have changed the text about the relationships between the kleptoplast photosynthesis and starvation resistance. We have included a new citation about another sacoglossan species having a shorter photosynthetic maintenance period. We agree that additional information on plastid-free control slugs, as the reviewer suggested, would be valuable. Regrettably, however, we would be unable to do the experimentation, because it is technically impossible to obtain kleptoplast-free healthy individuals due to the long-term kleptoplast retention period of PoB. As reviewers suggest, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a typical biochemical reaction against light illumination. However, we consider that ROS, which is toxic to many organisms, is an inadequate explanation for the presented results. ROS production is expected to shorten the survival period of illuminated PoBs. In our understanding, the simplest positive effect of light on growth is nutrient production through photosynthesis. Although several organisms have light-dependent secondary metabolites (e.g., vitamin D synthesis in vertebrates), the importance of such metabolites has rarely been studied in sea slug, and further research is needed to discuss the impact of their production.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“Although a study using <italic>P.</italic> cf. <italic>ocellatus</italic> reported that photosynthesis had no positive effect on the survival rate (Christa et al., 2014c), our results indicated that this finding does not apply to PoB.</p><p>Given the three photosynthetic indices’ data, we concluded that the increase in PoB survival days was due to photosynthesis. A previous study using the short-term (retention period of 4–8 days) kleptoplastic sea slug, <italic>Elysia atroviridis</italic>, indicated no positive effect of light illumination on their survival rate (Akimoto et al., 2014). These results supported that light exposure does not affect sacoglossan longevity in the absence of kleptoplasts. Although plastid-free PoB may directly indicate that kleptoplasty extends longevity, there is no way to remove kleptoplasts from PoB, except during long-term starvation. PoB feeds on nothing but algae and retains the kleptoplast for 3 to 5 months. Although future research methods may allow for more experimental analyses of kleptoplast functions, the currently most straightforward idea is that kleptoplast photosynthesis increases the starvation resistance of PoB.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the photosynthesis experiments (Figure 2), the authors compare the kleptoplast activity to the plastid in the algae H. borneensis. However, genome sequencing revealed two distinct plastid genomes (kRhip and kPoro) which corresponded with plastids from Rhipidosiphon lewmanomontiae and Poropsis spp., neither of which were included in genomic comparisons, and were not used in the comparison for photosynthetic rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point requires clarification. We have added the text to the Results and the Materials and methods. As mentioned by the editors, the algal species used in the photosynthetic analysis (<italic>H. borneensis</italic>) do not match the species detected in the kleptoplast genome sequencing (<italic>R. lewmanomontiae</italic> and <italic>Poropsis</italic> spp.). This discrepancy is due to the thallus of <italic>R. lewmanomontiae</italic> and <italic>Poropsis</italic> spp were too small for our photosynthesis experiments. Instead of the two algal species, we selected <italic>H. borneensis</italic> from the already known donors of PoB kleptoplasts because its thallus is large enough for photosynthesis analysis.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“These values were only slightly lower than those of healthy <italic>Halimeda borneensis</italic>, a kleptoplast donor of PoB (Maeda et al., 2012), which showed Fv/Fm values of 0.73 to 0.76. The donor algae of PoB consisted of at least eight green algal species, and they are closely related to <italic>H. borneensis</italic> (Maeda et al., 2012). Although it is not clear whether the Fv/Fm was the same for all donor algae, in healthy terrestrial plants, Fv/Fm is almost identical (~0.83) regardless of species (Maxwell and Johnson. 2000), and the values of <italic>H. borneensis</italic> were similar to those of other green algae (e.g., <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, Fv/Fm = 0.66–0.75; Bonente et al. 2012). Hence, we assumed that Fv/Fm values are similar among the donor species. The Fv/Fm value suggested that PoB kleptoplasts retain a similar photochemical efficiency of PSII to that of the food algae for more than 3 months.”</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“The seawater was not changed during the incubation period, except to adjust the salinity using distilled water. Photosynthetic activity indices (oxygen generation rate and PAM fluorometry) were measured using oxygen sensor spots (Witrox 4; Loligo Systems, Tjele, Denmark) and PAM-2500 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany), respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F). <italic>H. borneensis</italic>, which was easily collected and kept in the laboratory, was used as a reference for comparison in the PAM analysis. This species is a donor alga of PoB kleptoplasts and closely related species with the major donors of PoB, <italic>R. lewmanomontiae</italic> and <italic>Poropsis</italic> spp. These two major donors firmly adhered to the rock, were tangled up in other algal species, and were difficult to be collected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Have the authors considered that the slugs may have acquired photosynthesis related genes from non-algal origins that could potentially support the kleptoplasts?

Line 170 mentions 6 Chloroplast-related genes in PoB but there is no follow up on what these are, only that they do not look like algae. Could these support the photosynthetic abilities of the kleoptoplasts?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment on this point. In our previous MS, we had conducted a MEGAN analysis and confirmed that there were no genes derived from algae or plants in the PoB gene model. Because we had included all photosynthetic organisms (except land plants) as &quot;algae&quot;, we had considered these results indirectly indicated that there were no genes related to photosynthesis. However, as pointed by the editors, we did not mention the presence or absence of photosynthesis-related genes based on their predicted functions. Therefore, in this revised MS, we have added a detailed section about the potential HGT from non-algal species (MEGAN analysis) and the functional feature of the gene having non-algal origin (Supplementary file 5 and Supplementary file 6). We also added descriptions and a table (Supplementary file 7) about six Chloroplast-related genes. As a consequence, we were not able to find any genes functionally related to photosynthesis via the functional analysis.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“A blastp search using the A614 dataset, which contains sequences of the potential gene donor (e.g., transcriptomic data of <italic>H. borneensis</italic>), also determined no positive HGT evidence (Supplementary file 5).</p><p>Using LCA analysis for all PoB gene models, some genes were predicted to originate from species other than Lophotrochozoa. These genes may be due to HGT, but no photosynthesis-related genes were found from them. MEGAN predicted that 20,189 of the PoB genes originated from Lophotrochozoa and its subtaxa. The prediction also assigned 5550 genes to higher adequate taxa as Lophotrochozoa (e.g., Bilateria). MEGAN assigned the 2964 genes to Opisthokonta other than Lophotrochozoa (e.g., Ecdysozoa) and 312 genes derived from proteobacteria as promising horizontally transferred genes. However, these 3276 genes contained no photosynthetic gene. Many of the PoB genes assigned as promising horizontally transferred genes encoded reverse transcriptase. For the remaining 48,215 genes, MEGAN assigned no species. A homology search against the public database annotated 41,203 of the no-taxon-assigned genes as functionally unknown genes (FigShare; DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.13042016). Other no-taxon-assigned 7012 genes were not associated with photosynthesis, except one gene (p288c60.92) annotated to “photosystem I assembly protein ycf3.” However, this annotation to p288c60.92 was not reliable because it seems to be derived from incorrect annotations on public databases. Our reannotation via blastp search against the RefSeq database indicated the similarity of the PoB gene (p288c60.92) to “XP_013785360, death-associated protein kinase related-like” of a horseshoe crab. The details of the analyses are summarized in Supplementary File 6. MEGAN-based analysis, hence, indicated that several non-photosynthetic genes might have originated from proteobacteria or other organisms but provided no evidence of algae-derived HGT.</p><p>In gene function assignment with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, no PoB gene model was annotated as a gene relating “Photosynthesis (GO:0015979),” although the same method found 72 to 253 photosynthesis-related genes in the five referential algal species (Figure 4A). Six PoB genes assigned to the child terms of “Plastid (GO:0009536)” were found (Figure 4A; Supplementary File 7). However, an ortholog search with animal and algal genes did not support these six genes’ algal origin (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). It was considered that the sequence conservation beyond the kingdom caused these pseudo-positives in the GO assignment. The function of these six genes had no relationships to photosynthesis (Supplementary File 7); six genes relate proteasome (p2972c65.3), arginine kinase (p197c68.18), DNA-binding response regulator (p234c64.89), chromatin structure (p466c59.83), mitochondrial inner membrane translocase (p503c65.126), and functionally unknown protein (p45387c41.1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The chloroplasts in the protoplasm are transported to the sea slug’s intestinal tract, and the intestinal epithelial cells sequester chloroplasts by phagocytosis. The sequestered chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) maintain the photosynthetic activity in the cell for days to months. The sacoglossan cell contains no algal nuclei.

The bands’ color indicates the correlation between the gene and position, purple text and arrows indicate the scaffold ID and direction, and colored boxes on the scaffolds mean the genes’ positions (magenta, OG0000132 gene; gray box, other protein-encoding genes). Scaffolds having less than five OG0000132 genes were omitted from the figure.” Figure</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Some of the RNASeq analyses are difficult to follow. For instance trying to match Figure S22 with the text is difficult. The methods states that 5 slugs were used for whole-transcriptome sequencing, but 15 libraries were constructed, and there are only 13 library IDs in Figure S22. There are 15 libraries in the heat maps in the main text. What model was used in DESeq2 to call differential expression? What level of coverage was achieved in the RNA-Seq libraries? It seems there is no biological replication for some of the samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment on this point. The reviewer's comment is correct. In the previous version, we missed descriptions for the two libraries in Figure S22. We have added a description of these two libraries, the model used for DEseq2, level of coverage, and biological replication statement to Figure 4—figure supplement 10 (renamed from Figure S22).</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“Figure 4—figure supplement 10</p><p>Overview of the sample preparation for <italic>P. ocellatus</italic> type black transcriptomic analysis</p><p>(A–C) Photographs of the PoB dissection and the positions of sample tissues.

It is interesting that the genes that are expanded in copy number also look to be upregulated. However, it is unclear whether or not multiple mappings are accounted for, and how. If multiple mappings of closely related genes are not properly accounted for then it may appear as up-regulation. Similarly, how close in sequence are the paralougs of these genes, ie, would the reads map to each other?</p></disp-quote><p>The editors have raised an important point; however, we believe that our analysis adequately considers the effect of multiple mapping. Adopted software excludes multiple mapping regions from the analysis, and there are large sequence differences among the PoB expanded genes.</p><p>We have used &quot;Stringtie&quot; software to convert Hisat2 bam data to mapping count data. This software skips the analysis of multi-mapped locus. In their original paper about Stringtie, authors described, &quot;Note that if more than a certain percentage of the reads (by default 95%) aligned in a gene locus are multi-mapped, then StringTie will skip processing that locus.&quot; (Pertea et al., 2015 <italic>Nature Biotechnology</italic>). Hence, the highly resemble genes were removed from the analysis via Stringtie. We assumed that this handling will reduce the type I error on our gene enrichment analysis on the duplicated orthogroup.</p><p>We have also described the condition of the sequence similarity among the paralogs as belows. The similarity (pairwise percent similarly) in the KRM-having orthogroup (OG0000005, OG0000132, and OG0000446) was summrized on Supplementary file 21. The averaged pairwise sequence similarities were 70.3%, 71.0%, and 66.9% in OG0000005, OG0000132, and OG0000446, respectively. These differences suggest that multiple mapping is rare among the paralgos.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“The obtained BAM files were processed using Stringtie version 1.3.4d (-e option) with PoB gene model data (gff3 format) acquired through the above-mentioned EVidenceModeler analysis. Following the default settings of Stringtie software, if more than 95% of the reads aligned in a gene locus are multi-mapped, processing of that locus is skipped (Pertea et al. 2015). It was assumed that this reduces the type I error on the gene enrichment analysis on the duplicated orthogroup. The pairwise sequence similarity of three KRM gene-including orthogroups is summarized on Supplementary File 21. The averaged pairwise sequence similarities were 70.3%, 71.0%, and 66.9% in OG0000005, OG0000132, and OG0000446, respectively. The resulting count data were analyzed using R and the DESeq2 package, and 1490 DEGs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and <italic>p</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) were identified between the tissues.

During genome assembly, were the removed &quot;bacterial scaffolds&quot; also present at different coverage levels? Did the authors screen for fungal contaminants also? They mention in the RNA-Seq analyses how other food/biofilms can be present, so there it is likely that other contaminants could be in the assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point requires clarification. We have added sequence file of the removed bacterila scaffolds and a description of summarized coverage levels for bacterial assembly in the table (Supplementary file 17). We found no scaffold indicating the similar mean coverage of reliable sea slug scaffolds (31, SD = 7). The mean coverages of the bacterial scaffolds were around 10 (3-23), althogh a scaffold (scaffold4993_cov50) indicated higher coverage than sea slug scaffolds (328). About fungal contamination, because too much sensitive removal may exclude HGT regions as contaminant sequences, we minimized the removal of potential bacterial contamination and skipped the removal of potential fungal contamination.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“GeneMark-ES with the default settings predicted 107,735 gene models, and glimmerHMM predicted 115,633 models after the model training, with 320 manually constructed gene models from long scaffolds. EVidenceModeler was then used to merge the model with the following weight settings: AUGUSTUS = 9, Exonerate = 10, GeneMark-ES = 1, and glimmerHMM = 2. Finally, EVidenceModeler predicted 77,444 gene models.</p><p>The removal of contaminant sequences was minimized to avoid missing horizontally transferred genes. Bacterial scaffolds were defined as those encoding &gt;1 bacterial gene with no lophotrochozoan gene, and the potential bacterial scaffolds were removed from the PoB assemblies. The bacterial genes were predicted using MEGAN software according to a blastp search against the RefSeq database. Of the 40,330 gene hits identified from the RefSeq data, MEGAN assigned the origins for 39,113 genes. Specifically, 719 and 23,559 genes were assigned as bacterial and lophotrochozoan genes, respectively. MEGAN results before removing bacterial scaffolds are summarized in Supplementary file 17 with the detailed data of removed scaffolds. Fifty-five of the 8716 scaffolds contained two or more bacterial genes and no lophotrochozoan gene. The mean depth of read coverage of the bacterial scaffolds differed from the mean coverage of sea slug scaffolds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 3C: According to the authors, &quot;the vertical bar chart indicates the number of genes conserved among the species&quot;, but if so, why do rare genes seem to be more conserved than core genes according to this bar chart? This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We are concerned that the editors may have misunderstood &quot;rare genes&quot;. In the previous manuscript, we defined the &quot;rare genes&quot; as below, &quot;Rare gene, determined from a single or no Bryopsidales species&quot;. The second vertical bar from the left shows the number of commonly retained genes in Cyme (<italic>C. merolae</italic>) and Vali (<italic>V. litorea</italic>). Cyme and Vali are not Bryopsidales species (Rhodophyceae and Stramenopiles, respectively). The cpDNAs of Cyme and Vali contain many genes that are not retained in Bryopsidales plastids, which results in a higher vertical bar. However, these genes are not present in Bryopsidales (see intersect connectors), so we have assigned them as &quot;rare genes&quot; in our classification.

To test if duplicated genes in PoB are under diversifying selection (a.k.a positive selection) or relaxed purifying selection during neofunctionalization, the authors could use tools such as PAML for a formal test.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the additional analysis (PAML and RELAX) showed that several branches of the expanded genes have evolved under relaxed selection relative to the rest branches. We have added the following text to the manuscripts. The obtained PAML and RELAX results were summarized in Supplementary file 12.</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“Therefore, we considered that (1) the ubiquitously expressed p609c69.52 gene in α-clade is a functional ortholog of the mammalian cathepsin D gene, (2) the p374c67.53 gene in β-clade relates sea slug embryo development, and (3) the γ-clade genes have been acquired with the development of plastid sequestration. To test the positive or relaxed selection on the duplication event, the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) sites (ω = dN/dS) was used. Longly alignable heterobranchian genes from OG0000132 were used and statistically tested using CodeML and RELAX software (Supplementary file 12). The CodeML analysis (branch-site model) determined no significant positive selection on the basal node of the γ-clade (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test), but RELAX suggested that the γ-clade evolved under relaxed selection relative to the rest branches (<italic>K</italic> = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The cathepsin D-like genes formed multiple tandem repeat structures in the PoB genome, although other Heterobranchia had no tandem repeat (Figure 6B; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Revised version:</p><p>“The gene duplication in OG0000446 seems to have happened in the PoB lineage and at the node between PoB and <italic>E. marginata</italic> (Figure 5B; Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 4). The sacoglossan genes were duplicated in a monophyletic clade (clade I) only, and all DG-up-regulated DEGs were contained in clade I. CodeML found no significant positive selection on the basal node of clade Ia (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but RELAX suggested evolution under relaxed selection relative to the rest branches (<italic>K</italic> = 0.69; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; Supplementary File 12). On the other subclades, no significant positive selection nor relaxed selection was found (Supplementary file 12). All DG-up-regulated DEGs were contained in clade I.
