Although the function of several PG synthetases and hydrolases is well understood, the function, regulation, and mechanism of action of PG hydrolases characterised as lysostaphin-like endopeptidases have remained elusive. Many of these M23 family members can hydrolyse glycyl-glycine peptide bonds and show lytic activity against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> whose PG contains a pentaglycine bridge, but their exact substrate specificity and hydrolysed bonds are still vaguely determined. In this work, we have employed NMR spectroscopy to study both the substrate specificity and the bond cleavage of the bactericide lysostaphin and the <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG hydrolase LytM. Yet, we provide substrate-level evidence for the functional role of these enzymes. Indeed, our results show that the substrate specificities of these structurally highly homologous enzymes are similar, but unlike observed earlier both LytM and lysostaphin prefer the <sc>D</sc>-Ala-Gly cross-linked part of mature peptidoglycan. However, we show that while lysostaphin is genuinely a glycyl-glycine hydrolase, LytM can also act as a D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>LytM</kwd><kwd>NMR spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan hydrolases</kwd><kwd>lysostaphin</kwd><kwd>substrate specificity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004012</institution-id><institution>Jane ja Aatos Erkon Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Permi</surname><given-names>Perttu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Council of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>323435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Permi</surname><given-names>Perttu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Council of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>362535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Permi</surname><given-names>Perttu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Robust NMR approach allowed simultaneous detection of substrate cleavage site and real-time kinetics of hydrolysis for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> peptidoglycan hydrolases lysostaphin and LytM, and revealed D-alanyl-glycine activity for LytM.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the age of antibiotic resistance, multi-resistant bacteria pose a serious threat to global health. This calls for novel strategies to fight the infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shrivastava et al., 2018</xref>). Contemporary means to treat bacterial infections rely on antibiotics. One of the most common mechanisms of action of antibiotics is inhibition of the peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis, a major macromolecular structure in the bacterial cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Džidić et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kapoor et al., 2017</xref>). Alarmingly, the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) is notorious in developing resistance towards β-lactam-based antibiotics, e.g., penicillin and their derivatives, which target penicillin binding proteins that are vital for PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>). These methicillin-resistant strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) can cause life-threatening infections which are very difficult to eradicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, although still rarely occurring, outbreaks of infections caused by vancomycin intermediate-level and fully resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> are lurking on the horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shariati et al., 2020</xref>). Development of alternative means to treat multi-resistant bacterial infections is therefore needed.</p><p>Cell division, cell shape determination, PG remodelling, and recycling are coordinated and executed by peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs), enzymes produced to function as (auto)lysins in the regulation of the cell wall during growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghuysen, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, PGHs may also function as defensive weapons against other bacterial species as in the case of lysostaphin (LSS), an exolysin secreted by <italic>Staphylococcus simulans</italic> biovar staphylolyticus, which displays bactericidal action against competing <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964</xref>). The potential antibacterial role of PGHs is based on the targeted destruction of the protecting PG by hydrolysis, which leads to lysis of the bacterial cells upon increasing turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghuysen, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964</xref>). Given that PGHs are promising bactericins as well as druggable targets for the treatment of multidrug-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, profound knowledge of their structure, function, as well as substrate specificity is instrumental to harness their full potential as a new breed of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szweda et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. aureus</italic> and other Gram-positive bacteria are protected by a thick PG layer that is composed of repeating β-1,4-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine disaccharide units, forming the conserved glycan backbone of murein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghuysen, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schleifer and Kandler, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Each MurNAc carboxyl group is linked to a stem peptide (L-Ala-D-iso-Gln-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) and two stem peptides are connected via a cross-bridge structure, the exact composition, and length of which depends on the bacterial species in question. In <italic>S. aureus</italic> the cross-bridge is characteristically composed of five glycine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghuysen, 1968</xref>). Cross-bridging provides an integral structural support for the entire PG wall and allows PG to reach a thickness of over 40 layers (20–80 nm) in Gram-positive bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghuysen, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) in <italic>S.</italic> <italic>aureus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the cell wall in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

One prominent PGH family are the LSS-like endopeptidases, which specifically target the cross-bridge peptide bonds of <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghuysen et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we compared LytM and LSS, which both belong to the zinc-dependent M23 family of metalloendopeptidases and are designated as glycyl-glycine hydrolases. They have been shown to cleave the peptide bonds between glycine residues in the pentaglycine cross-bridge of <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardelang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Browder et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iversen and Grov, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Odintsov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramadurai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raulinaitis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tossavainen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Warfield et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. simulans</italic> LSS is an exolysin possessing bacteriolytic properties towards staphylococci with a pentaglycine cross-bridge structure, e.g., <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. carnosus</italic>, <italic>S. cohnii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schuhardt, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schleifer and Fischer, 1982</xref>). LytM is a <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG hydrolase with a catalytic M23 domain structurally very similar to that of LSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The common fold consists of a characteristic narrow groove formed by a β sheet and four surrounding loops. At one end of the groove resides the catalytic site in which a zinc cation is coordinated by two conserved histidines and an aspartate. The zinc cation, which polarises the peptide bond, and a nucleophilic water molecule activated by two other conserved histidines act in concert to hydrolyse the substrate glycyl-glycine bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite tens of years of effort in studying substrate specificities of LSS-like M23 endopeptidase family members, the exact molecular targets of these enzymes have remained enigmatic, contradictory, and yet imprecise. Interpretation of results is further complicated by diverse conventions used for the numbering of cross-bridge residues. Indeed, the exact cross-bridge bond that LSS targets remains controversial; Browder et al. reported LSS cleavage between glycines 4 and 5 while Sloan and colleagues observed cleavage of all glycyl-glycine bonds with several substrates of different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Browder et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sloan et al., 1977</xref>). Using mass spectrometry (MS), Schneewind and colleagues observed LSS-mediated cleavage between glycines 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneewind et al., 1995</xref>). This observation was supported by a recent NMR spectroscopic study highlighting that hydrolysis by LSS produced fragments in which either two or three glycines are interlinked to the lysine sidechain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maya-Martinez et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, Xu and coworkers reported cleavage at several sites with digested muropeptides: between glycines 1 and 2, 2 and 3, as well as 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, studies carried out with FRET peptides reported cleavage between glycines 2 and 3 (~60 %) and glycines 3 and 4 (~40%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Warfield et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Much less is understood about the functional role of <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG hydrolase LytM. Based on its high sequence homology with LSS catalytic domain as well as its association with <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall maintenance, LytM has implicitly been envisaged to target pGly cross-bridges in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall. LytM has been shown to hydrolyse pGly into di- and triglycine, and tetraglycine into diglycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Firczuk et al., 2005</xref>). Understanding the substrate specificity is of utmost importance for deciphering the functional role of endogenous LytM in cell division, PG remodelling, antimicrobial resistance, and PG synthesis/hydrolysis in general.</p><p>Thus far, specificity of PG hydrolases has been determined utilising end-point kinetics together with LC/MS analysis of digested PG fragments or turbidity reduction assays to measure the site(s) and efficiency of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frankel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Małecki et al., 2021</xref>). However, these approaches have several pitfalls, e.g., they do not provide information on reaction kinetics or atomic resolution of reaction products, which severely limits determination of substrate specificity. In seeking to understand the functional role of these enzymes we have deciphered substrate specificity of LSS and LytM catalytic domains through a systematic approach by monitoring hydrolysis of various synthetised PG fragments as well as muropeptides from purified sacculus extracted from <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells using solution-state NMR spectroscopy and by utilising turbidity reduction assay on living <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells. Most importantly, NMR enables following the hydrolysis reaction in real time as well as identification of hydrolysis products.</p><p>Here, we show that the substrate specificities as well as catalytic efficiencies of M23 family PGHs targeting <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG are different from what has been earlier anticipated. Moreover, our results reveal that quite unexpectedly LytM substrate specificity extends beyond glycyl-glycine endopeptidase activity, which calls for revision of its classification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Substrate specificities of LSS M23 enzyme family</title><p>Due to inconsistent nomenclature used in the literature to annotate <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG cross-bridge structure and hence substrates used in the enzymatic assays and specificity studies, we conducted a systematic approach by dissecting the complex structure of PG using synthetic peptides spanning from the simplest pGly to more complex branched peptides to elucidate the substrate specificity of LSS and LytM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To measure the rate of pGly hydrolysis in vitro, we added the enzyme and monitored decaying substrate concentration with respect to reaction time using quantitative <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Results indicate that LSS hydrolyses pGly 15-fold faster than LytM in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For comparison, we measured the outcome of hydrolysis of extracted muropeptides using end-point kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, vide infra). In the turbidity reduction assay, lytic efficiencies of externally administered LSS and LytM against <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 (MRSA) strain were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data show that OD<sub>600</sub> of late stationary cells reduced from 100% to 25% in 1.5 and 12 hr for LSS and LytM, respectively. Thus, LSS and LytM display consistent differences in efficiencies in the turbidity and pGly assays. However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall as a macroscopic substrate or cellular milieu differs significantly from the conditions used for the kinetic assay in vitro, i.e., pGly as a substrate represents a poor model for describing substrate specificity and functional differences of M23 family endopeptidases. As the next step, we therefore determined the scissile bonds in pGly as well as extended substrate specificity studies of these enzymes beyond the pGly cross-bridge.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LSS and LytM preferentially hydrolyse the Gly<sub>2</sub>-Gly<sub>3</sub> bond in pentaglycine</title><p>We recently showed using a two-dimensional (2D) <sup>13</sup>C-HMBC NMR experiment that LytU hydrolyses pGly into di- and triglycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raulinaitis et al., 2017</xref>). Whether this was the result of hydrolysis of the bond between Gly<sub>2</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub>, and/or between Gly<sub>3</sub> and Gly<sub>4</sub> in pGly remained undefined because the products are the same in both reactions. Selective <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>13</sup>C-labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) breaks the isotopic symmetry of pGly without introducing per se any non-physiological tags to the substrate and enables to define the preferred cleavage sites for LSS and LytM in pGly using <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy optimised for glycine detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As can be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, isotopic labelling of Gly<sub>2</sub> at Cα and CO carbons in pGly allows unambiguous determination of cleavage site, because the characteristic chemical shift of a C-terminal <sup>13</sup>CO resonance (179.4 ppm) is markedly different from a non-terminal <sup>13</sup>CO chemical shift (173.8 ppm) at physiological pH.

These data clearly show that LytM and LSS are highly specific for the bond between Gly<sub>2</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub> (&gt;85–94%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). However, residual cleavage activity towards the bond between Gly<sub>3</sub> and Gly<sub>4</sub> is also evident (&lt;15%).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The substrate specificity of LytM and LSS is determined by the D-Ala-Gly cross-link between adjacent PG monomers</title><p>In the next phase, we sought to understand the role of plausible auxiliary contacts arising from stem peptides flanking the pGly cross-bridge for the substrate specificity of LSS and LytM. To this end, several larger peptides with PG-specific extensions around the pGly scaffold were utilised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To alleviate complications arising from multiple sites of hydrolysis in pGly, we decided to monitor the rate of substrate hydrolysis rather than the rate of product formation, and to use a similar substrate concentration for all the PG fragments (~0.4 mM). These data using substrates <bold>1–7</bold> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Normalisation of the absolute rates with respect to the common scaffold structure, (pGly) should reveal on the substrate level the preference of LSS and LytM towards different PG fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, the overall rate of hydrolysis for LytM and LSS increases with peptides that mimic cross-linked PG fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Indeed, cross-linking L-Lys-D-Ala dipeptide N-terminally to pGly in <bold>2</bold> increased the rate of hydrolysis with respect to <bold>1</bold> by a factor of 12 and 8 for LSS and LytM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Further elongation in the N-terminus (ADiQKDA-GGGGG, <bold>3</bold>) had only incremental contribution to the rate of overall substrate hydrolysis, <bold>17</bold> and <bold>3</bold> for LSS and LytM, respectively.</p><p>Next, we inspected the influence of a stem peptide linked to the C-terminus of pGly on the substrate hydrolysis rate. In PG fragment <bold>4</bold> the stem peptide is linked to the pGly via an isopeptide bond between lysine ε amino group and the C-terminus of pGly. The PG fragment <bold>5</bold> is similar but corresponds to the peptide moiety in a PG monomer (or pentaglycyl-Lipid II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For LSS, the rate of hydrolysis increased by six- and fivefold for substrates <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, respectively. This increase in overall rate of substrate hydrolysis with respect to pGly is roughly two and three times smaller than for the linear PG fragments <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> that contain a D-Ala-Gly cross-link, respectively. For LytM, the outcome was in stark contrast to the results observed with LSS. Indeed, LytM activity towards PG fragments <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> is only 82% and 72%, respectively, of that found for <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>Next, we studied the significance of capping the pGly moiety from both its termini. PG fragments <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold> both contain an N-terminal D-Ala-Gly cross-linkage in their structure but differ in <bold>6</bold> having a C-terminal tetra- and <bold>7</bold> a pentapeptide stem, i.e., the latter has a D-Ala-D-Ala moiety in its structure. For LSS, 10-fold rate enhancements with respect to <bold>1</bold> for substrate hydrolysis were observed, comparable to enhancements with substrates <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3,</bold> indicating that the moiety C-terminal to pGly does not contribute to LSS catalytic efficiency. Hence, based on these results, it can be deduced that LSS strongly favours substrates that contain a D-Ala-Gly cross-link, i.e., <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>6</bold>, and <bold>7</bold>. In the case of LytM, rate enhancements of PG fragments <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold> with respect to <bold>1</bold> were 5.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, meaning that the branched stem peptide linked to the C-terminal end of pGly has a slight negative effect on LytM activity. These data indicate that similarly to LSS, LytM is more specific towards substrates <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>6</bold>, and <bold>7</bold>, i.e., PG fragments that contain a D-Ala-Gly cross-link.</p><p>In all, overall rates of substrate hydrolysis using comparative real-time kinetics convincingly indicate that LytM as well as LSS prefer mature PG fragments as substrates i.e., PG units that contain a D-Ala-Gly cross-link between two stem peptides. In contrast to the mere end-point kinetics carried out in the past for LytM and LSS, our present results clearly demonstrate the preference of these enzymes for cross-linked PG fragments beyond redundant glycyl-glycine endopeptidase activity. However, the substrate-specific real-time kinetics assay does not tell anything about the site(s) of hydrolysis in the substrates. To understand substrate specificity and the physiological role of these PGHs, we inspected the outcome of these reaction assays in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LSS and LytM display different substrate specificities</title><p>NMR spectroscopy allows the identification of atom connectivities within the substrate and products, enabling determination of site(s) of hydrolysis at atomic resolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> display the LSS and LytM, respectively, catalysed hydrolysis of substrate <bold>2</bold>, the simplest of our PG fragments containing the cross-link between D-Ala and Gly<sub>1</sub> of pGly synthetised by the transpeptidase.

The combined results of their analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The difference in panels C and E is that for the latter we considered only reactions which dominate for the particular PG fragment whereas in the heatmap representation the relative product concentrations at the end of the hydrolysis reaction are shown. These results are consistent with analyses of substrate hydrolysis rates by showing that LSS clearly favours PG fragments with a D-Ala-Gly cross-link. Pentaglycine or other PG monomers in which Gly<sub>1</sub> is not cross-linked to the stem peptide of the adjacent PG fragment are hydrolysed at slower rate and the cutting site is shifted by one residue downstream compared to the cross-linked ones. In addition, the bond specificity of the hydrolysis reaction increases with D-Ala-Gly cross-linked PG fragments. In this case, LSS favours cutting the amide bond between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub> and the hydrolysis rate of this bond is several times higher than that of the Gly<sub>2</sub>-Gly<sub>3</sub> bond, or those of Gly<sub>2</sub>-Gly<sub>3</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub>-Gly<sub>4</sub> bonds in PG monomers devoid of D-Ala-Gly cross-link.</p><p>As we reckoned that D-Ala-Gly cross-link is critical for efficient hydrolysis of LSS substrates, we wanted to study how the length of the glycine containing cross-bridge influences substrate hydrolysis. Substrate <bold>12</bold>, containing four consecutive glycines attached to Lys-D-Ala, was hydrolysed between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub>, as well as Gly<sub>2</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub>, exactly like substrate <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). However, the hydrolysis rate of the Gly<sub>2</sub>-Gly<sub>3</sub> bond was threefold faster than in the case of <bold>2</bold>. This is probably due to the absence of tetraglycine as a secondary substrate in the reaction, i.e., the reaction products resulting from hydrolysis of <bold>12</bold> do not significantly compete with the primary substrate for binding to the LSS catalytic centre. Substrate <bold>13</bold> (KDAGGG) was hydrolysed very slowly and <bold>14</bold> (KDAGG) not at all.</p><p>We carried out a similar analysis for LytM using the same set of PG fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D, and F</xref>). The most striking observation is clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> showing hydrolysis of <bold>2</bold> by LytM, which results in formation of products KDA and KDAG<sub>1</sub>. Indeed, given that LytM is a well-established glycyl-glycine endopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Firczuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramadurai et al., 1999</xref>), we were taken by surprise to observe that LytM, in addition to Gly<sub>1</sub>-Gly<sub>2</sub> bond hydrolysis, is also able to cleave the D-Ala-Gly<sub>1</sub> amide bond in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> PG cross-bridge whenever the cross-linked D-Ala-Gly structure is available.</p><p>We verified that the observed D-alanyl-glycine bond hydrolysis, which has not been reported before this study, is stereospecific and linked to LytM activity. We performed an identical kinetic assay using KLAGGGGG as a negative control. It confirmed that the enzyme is indeed D-enantiomer specific as no cleavage between alanine and glycine was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Further, using a protocol identical to that used for LytM we engineered, expressed, and purified the inactive H291A mutant of LytM and tested it with substrate <bold>2</bold>. As expected, LytM H291A showed no activity. The results confirm that in addition to being a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Firczuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramadurai et al., 1999</xref>), LytM belongs to a small family of endopeptidases which cleave the peptide bond between D-Ala and Gly.</p><p>In substrates <bold>2</bold> and <bold>6</bold> LytM cleaves between D-Ala-Gly and Gly<sub>1</sub>-Gly<sub>2</sub> with approximately equal rates.

For the N-terminally longer substrates <bold>3</bold> and <bold>7</bold>, the balance is shifted in favour of hydrolysis of Gly<sub>1</sub>-Gly<sub>2</sub>. Regarding substrates lacking the D-Ala-Gly cross-link, LytM seems to disfavour the stem peptide in the C-terminus of pGly and the overall rate of hydrolysis with respect to pGly is diminished more drastically in comparison to LSS.</p><p>Analogously to LSS, we compared the rate of hydrolysis of shorter PG fragments with LytM to map the critical length of the glycine-bridge in the substrate needed for the hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Compared to <bold>2</bold>, the rate of hydrolysis did not change drastically when shortening the glycine chain from five glycines to three. However, LytM strongly favoured D-Ala-Gly cleavage in <bold>13</bold> (KDAGGG) whereas it preferred Gly<sub>1</sub>-Gly<sub>2</sub> cleavage in <bold>12</bold> (KDAGGGG). Unlike LSS, LytM can still hydrolyse <bold>14</bold> (KDAGG). Only the D-alanyl-glycine bond is cleaved, and the reaction is five to ten times slower than hydrolysis of <bold>2</bold>, <bold>12</bold>, and <bold>13</bold>. Owing to its D-Ala-Gly cleavage efficiency, we tested whether LytM could also hydrolyse KDAAGGGGG and KDAAA type substrates. However, the former was hydrolysed like pGly, i.e., no D-Ala-L-Ala cleavage occurred, but KDAAGG and KDAAGGG products were observed instead (not shown). <italic>Enterococci</italic> cell wall PG mimicking peptide KDAAA was not cleaved at all. This data further confirms that LytM is not only a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase but also acts as a D-alanyl-glycine hydrolase.</p><p>To confirm the scissile bond specificity determined for LSS and LytM using synthetic PG fragment mimicking peptides, we extracted and purified muropeptides from <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 sacculus using the established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kühner et al., 2014</xref>). After administering muropeptide samples with LSS and LytM, we observed hydrolysis of the same amide bonds as with corresponding synthetic PG fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). LSS hydrolyses the peptide bond between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub>, recognised as the appearance of interconnected C-terminal Gly<sub>1</sub> <sup>1</sup>Hα-<sup>13</sup>CO and D-Ala <sup>1</sup>Hα-<sup>13</sup>CO peaks in the <sup>13</sup>C-HMBC spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Identical correlations are observed for LytM, indicating that it also hydrolyses the amide bond between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, additional resonances stemming from the C-terminal D-Ala that is correlated with the neighbouring Lys are also observed. This indicates that LytM is cutting both glycyl-glycine and D-alanyl-glycine bonds also in muropeptides extracted from <italic>S. aureus</italic> sacculus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differences in susceptibilities of <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutants towards LSS and LytM can be explained by their substrate specificities</title><p>The composition of the cell wall PG of <italic>Staphylococci</italic>, including, e.g., <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. simulans</italic>, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, can be modulated by intracellular enzymes.

We pondered whether the length of the cross-bridge of <italic>S. aureus</italic> could influence the catalytic efficiency or target bond specificity of LSS and LytM. To this end, we studied hydrolysis of PG fragments <bold>8</bold> and <bold>9</bold> mimicking tri- and monoGly cross-bridge composition of PG in <italic>S. aureus</italic> Δ<italic>femB</italic> and Δ<italic>femAB</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, LSS hydrolyses <bold>8</bold> with an increased rate as compared to <bold>7</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, specificity increases, i.e., cutting of glycyl-glycine bond corresponding to the site ‘2’ in <bold>7</bold> and site ‘6’ in <bold>8</bold> is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Quite surprisingly, we also observed that LSS is able to hydrolyse substrate <bold>9</bold>, devoid of glycyl-glycine bond. Instead, LSS hydrolyses the Lys Nζ-monoGly CO isopeptide bond. The rate of hydrolysis is, however, drastically lower (1.2%) than that of the amide bond between glycines in <bold>7</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

It is clear that LSS is a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase as P1 and P1’ positions are invariably occupied by Gly residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the rate of hydrolysis increases when D-Ala occupies the P2 position, i.e., when LSS recognises a D-Ala-Gly cross-link in the cell wall. LytM is flexible regarding the P1 site, it can be accommodated either by D-Ala or Gly, whereas the P1’ position is invariably occupied by Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Substrate specificity of lysostaphin (LSS) and LytM.</title><p>Schechter and Berger nomenclature is employed to describe the differences in substrate specificity between LSS (<bold>A</bold>) and LytM (<bold>B</bold>). Scissile bond in the substrate is between the P1 and P1’ positions, indicated by green (LSS) and purple arrows (LytM), and hence residues towards the N-terminus from the scissile bond are P1-P4, whereas those towards the C-terminus are designated as P1’-P4’.

LytM is also able to cleave the D-Ala-Gly<sub>1</sub> bond (<bold>F</bold>), however, in LSS this would result in a steric clash between the D-Ala sidechain and the residues in loop 1 (<bold>E</bold>). LytM was used at a concentration of 50 μM while LSS was 2 μM.

To address this intriguing question, we utilised the existing structure of LytM in complex with the transition state analog tetraglycine phosphinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grabowska et al., 2015</xref>) and used molecular modelling approach to dock PG fragment <bold>2</bold> into the active sites of LSS and LytM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). As has been proposed earlier, the Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the active site polarises the scissile bond by coordinating the carbonyl oxygen of the residue in the P1 position. For LSS it is Gly, and for LytM it is either D-Ala or Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). D-Ala in the P1/S1 position in the LSS active site results in a steric clash with loop 1, most notably its residues L272-I274, thus preventing hydrolysis of a D-alanyl-glycine peptide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In LytM the corresponding loop is shorter allowing accommodation of D-Ala in the P1/S1 position and hence cleavage of D-alanyl-glycine cross-bridge or alternatively, if the substrate has a Gly in the P1 position, the peptide bond between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>).</p><p>The same loop 1 gates the LSS active site and establishes the structural basis for Lif function. Serine in the P2’ position severely hinders accommodation of the substrate to the LSS active site, which results in a drastic drop in the rate of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and G</xref>). In LytM the three residues shorter loop renders the active site more voluminous, which permits the short polar sidechain of Ser to fit into the P2’ or P3’ positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and H–J</xref>). Consequently, substrates <bold>10</bold> (KDAGSGGG) and <bold>11</bold> (KDAGGSGG) can still be hydrolysed with relatively high efficiency (ca. 50%) in comparison to PG fragment <bold>2</bold> which contains a pGly bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, as the P1’ position only allows Gly, <bold>10</bold> cannot be hydrolysed between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Ser<sub>2</sub>. However, LytM is able to hydrolyse the D-alanyl-glycine bond due to the positioning of the Ser into the P2’ position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and H</xref>). LSS cannot hydrolyse <bold>10</bold> as it would require the disallowed P1’ position to accommodate Ser or alternatively P1 to be occupied by D-Ala, both of which are prevented by the extended loop 1 structure in LSS.</p><p>Interestingly, when the D-Ala-Gly cross-link is missing, e.g., in pGly or PG fragments <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold>, the latter mimicking a non-cross-linked PG monomer, the cleavage site is shifted within the glycine cross-bridge, i.e., cutting occurs between Gly<sub>2</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub> since in minimum a substrate with four residues occupying P2, P1, P1’, and P2’ sites is required for both LSS and LytM. Owing to this limitation in substrate size and distinct difference in the substrate specificity of LSS and LytM, we observe that while both enzymes can hydrolyse tetraglycine, only LytM can cleave <bold>14</bold> (KDAGG) since it accepts D-Ala in the P1 position. We observed significant reduction in rate of hydrolysis for both LSS and LytM when the substrate is too short, i.e., it cannot fill the P3’/S3’ position. This is probably due to the stabilising hydrogen bonds that are formed between the longer glycine chain and a key asparagine residue in loop 4, Asn372 and Asn303 for LSS and LytM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To gain novel insight into LSS enzyme family specificities, we employed NMR spectroscopy to determine the substrate specificities and the cleavage site using real-time kinetics at atomic resolution on substrates mimicking PG fragments.

Thus, determination of the site of hydrolysis often relies on applying abductive reasoning to either include or exclude different PG structures according to the assay results. Because this type of experimental setup often does not reveal the direct cleavage site, nor if there are several cleavage sites it should be supplemented with methods allowing direct observation – such as NMR. Yet, the end-point kinetics type of enzymatic assays, e.g., administering chromatographically purified muropeptides with a lytic catalyst and quenching the reaction after overnight incubation, followed by MS analysis of reaction products, do not necessarily reflect substrate specificity accurately because they only detect reaction products at the end and do not consider plausible secondary reactions.</p><p>Our method is superior to the previous approaches because real-time kinetics data combined with a precise determination of the cleavage site reveal the true substrate specificity of LSS. Our data also explain the inconsistencies between results of previous studies, i.e., our extensive set of PG fragments allowed a more comprehensive interpretation than previous studies with fewer substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardelang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Browder et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gründling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Małecki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maya-Martinez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reste de Roca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sabala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneewind et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sloan et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Warfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). LSS recognises the D-Ala-Gly cross-link. In such a substrate, D-Ala occupies the P2 position, which increases the rate of hydrolysis by 10-fold in comparison to substrates which position glycine into P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As mature PG in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall is highly (D-Ala-Gly) cross-linked, our results are in excellent agreement with the observed efficiency of LSS towards <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells in numerous studies in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kusuma and Kokai-Kun, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Małecki et al., 2021</xref>). We also showed that LSS can hydrolyse cell wall in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> Δ<italic>femB</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strandén et al., 1997</xref>), having three glycines in the cross-bridge, as they contain cross-linked D-Ala-Gly which occupy the P2-P1 positions and two glycines accommodated in the P1’-P2’ positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, our data also demonstrate that LSS is capable of efficiently hydrolysing glycyl-glycine bonds in PG fragments with different levels of cross-linking, including also non-cross-linked PG monomers. In such a case, Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub> house the P2 and P1 positions and the scissile bond is shifted from the preferable Gly<sub>1</sub>-Gly<sub>2</sub> bond one residue forward to the Gly<sub>2</sub>-Gly<sub>3</sub> amide bond. This confirms the findings made by Maya-Martinez and colleagues with non-cross-linked PG fragments, i.e., LSS leaves two or three glycines connected to Lys sidechain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maya-Martinez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Hence, our results provide rationale to the previous observations which show discrepancy regarding the LSS site of hydrolysis. To summarise, LSS prefers cutting between Gly<sub>1</sub> and Gly<sub>2</sub>, whenever Gly<sub>1</sub> is cross-linked to D-Ala of neighbouring stem, whereas it hydrolyses the amide bond between Gly<sub>2</sub> and Gly<sub>3</sub> in non-cross-linked (devoid of D-Ala-Gly bond) PG fragments.</p><p>LytM was originally categorised as a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase based on lytic experiments performed using purified cell walls, which showed that it is active against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. carnosus</italic> but not against <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramadurai et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>M. luteus</italic> PG has the following structure: Ala-(D-γGlu-Gly)-Lys[D-Ala-Lys-D-Glu(-Gly)-Ala-D-Ala-Lys-D-γGlu(-Gly)-Ala]-D-Ala and thus contains neither Gly-Gly nor D-Ala-Gly bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). As was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramadurai et al., 1999</xref> <italic>M. luteus</italic> lacked the bond necessary for LytM cleavage, and here we have identified that bond to be D-Ala-Gly in addition to the known specificity towards glycyl-glycine bonds. <sc>d</sc>-Ala-Gly bond hydrolysis by LytM was not observed in the recent study on LytM and LSS specificity for PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Razew et al., 2023</xref>), which might follow from the type of NMR data acquired.

Use of C-H signals is advantageous in that they are not prone to chemical exchange phenomena and enable unambiguous chemical shift assignment.</p><p>The only other recognised D-Ala-Gly hydrolase in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is LytN. Contrary to LytM, it contains a catalytic CHAP domain, which cleaves both D-Ala-Gly and MurNAc-L-Ala bonds, in other words is a D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase as well as an <italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frankel et al., 2011</xref>).

D-Ala-Gly cleaving activity was also reported, although without quantitative information regarding catalytic efficiency. Given that the P1 site in EnpA can accommodate D-Ala, it exhibits substrate specificity similar to that of LytM, which allows occupation of the P1 position by D-Ala (and Gly). In this way, LytM and EnpA deviate from LSS which requires invariably glycine in the P1 position. On the other hand, similar to LSS, LytM allows only glycine at the P1’ site, whereas EnpA is more promiscuous and can accommodate Gly, L-Ala, and L-Ser in this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Małecki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reste de Roca et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The pivotal findings in this paper are the discovery of the D-Ala-Gly hydrolysis activity of LytM, previously designated solely as a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase.

The exact concentration was verified with NMR using 0.1 mM sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate (DSS, Chenomx Internal standard, 5 mM 99.9% D, lot PS20190624) as the reference compound. Peptides were diluted to a desired concentration in the presence of 50 mM deuterated Tris pH 7.5. For each sample, prepared to 3 mm OD round-bottom NMR tube, 0.1 mM DSS was added as the reference.

NMR data collection for kinetics measurements employed a standard <sup>1</sup>H pulse program (zgpr) having a selective radiofrequency field for residual HDO signal presaturation during the recycle delay. To ensure quantitative detection of substrate and product concentrations, a 20-s-long recycle delay was used between the transients used for the signal averaging. 0.1 mM DSS was used as a reference compound both for the peak integration, chemical shift referencing, as well as lineshape optimisation. For each time point, experiment was accumulated with 24 transients, yielding an experimental time of 8 min per time point.</p><p>First, a reference <sup>1</sup>H spectrum was acquired. The sample was then removed from the magnet, and the enzyme was added. The time of enzyme addition was recorded as t=0. After the enzyme addition the sample was placed back into the magnet, and the shim was manually readjusted before the start of acquisition of consecutive <sup>1</sup>H spectra to follow the hydrolysis. This preparatory work resulted in a delay of about 5–10 min between enzyme addition (t=0) and the end of the acquisition of the first spectrum. This delay was accounted for in the data analysis for each experiment.</p><p>For the resonance assignment of NMR <sup>1</sup>Hα, <sup>13</sup>Cα, and <sup>13</sup>CO chemical shifts in selectively <sup>13</sup>C-labelled Gly<sub>2</sub> position in pentaglycine (<bold>1</bold>), a glycine Hα-detection optimised HCACO-type NMR experiment was devised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Rates of reactions were calculated using linear regression of the first 40–60 min of the reaction. Goodness of fitting was evaluated by using the R<sup>2</sup> value. All the data fitting had R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9. A typical experiment was performed with 0.4 mM enzyme and the reaction followed for ~250 min. The slower hydrolysis reactions necessitated relatively long acquisition times of NMR spectra. Therefore, NMR spectrometer stability is of the essence, and well maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To verify reproducibility of the NMR kinetics data, we carried out two independent measurements for PG fragments <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>.

A similar test for <bold>3</bold>, using [LytM]=50 μM, resulted in rates of 9.24×10<sup>–4</sup> M and 9.35×10<sup>–4</sup> M, SD 7.778×10<sup>–6</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Turbidity reduction assay</title><p>Turbidity assay was performed as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raulinaitis et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA 300 bacterial cells were incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm until OD<sub>600</sub> between 6 and 8 corresponding to late stationary phase.

Bacteria were plated in round-bottom 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the reaction was started by adding the enzymes at final concentration of 3 μM. The assay was carried out in final volume of 100 μL. Bacteria without any enzyme was used as control sample. Reduction of turbidly of bacteria suspension was followed using BioTek Epoch2 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies), at 25°C for 16 hr with continuous shaking at 500 rpm.

Endopeptidases are known to cleave the glycine-bridges of staphylococcal cell wall peptidoglycan (PG). To address this question, various glycine-bridge peptides were synthesized as substrates, the catalytic domain of LSS and LytM were recombinantly expressed and purified, and the reactions were analyzed using solution-state NMR. The major finding is that LytM is not only a Gly-Gly endopeptidase, but also cleaves D-Ala-Gly. Technically, the advantage of using real-time NMR was emphasized in the manuscript. The study explores an interesting aspect of cell wall hydrolases in terms of substrate-level regulation. It potentially identified new enzymatic activity of LytM. However, the biological significance and relevance of the conclusions remain clear, as the results are mostly from synthetic substrates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study explores an interesting aspect of cell wall hydrolases in terms of substrate-level regulation.

The LytM and LSS activities in these two experiments are indeed not directly comparable, but served to highlight the fact that simple pentaglycine is a poor model substrate for M23 enzymes. We carried out a turbidity assay with pristine enzymatic preparation and indeed it is highly consistent both with the kinetic assay using pentaglycine (Fig. 2B) as well as with larger PG fragments (Fig. 2K) indicating that the catalytic domain of LSS is significantly more efficient than LytM in hydrolyzing cells from community acquired methicillin resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain USA300 as well as synthetic PG fragments.

The experiment used purified PG treated with mutanolysin. Presumably, mixed monomers, dimers, trimers, and multimers are used. It would be helpful to show the HPLC profile of the purified muropeptide. It would be informative to analyze which fractions generate D-ala-gly. In addition, the intact murein sacculus should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>For the sake of clarity, we have moved the 13C-HMBC spectra presented in Figure 3H to Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Material. The full carbonyl carbon region of the reference (prior to addition of enzyme) 13C-HMBC spectrum together with larger expansions of spectra acquired from enzyme-treated muropeptides are now shown. Furthermore, graphical presentations of identified PG fragments due to LSS/LytM activity are included. No HPLC analysis of the muropeptides was performed at this stage. Being insoluble, the intact murein sacculus is not amenable to liquid-state NMR studies, but we envisage studies of this remarkably complex structure also with solid-state NMR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the experiments address the question asked by the authors and no additional experiments are required to strengthen the conclusions drawn.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The abstract is not well written and more specific (and accurate) information should be provided by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the constructive and helpful comments to improve our manuscript. The abstract has now been modified by taking into account the Reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction</p><p>The intro is relatively long and wordy. It could most certainly be shortened and written in a more simple way to make it more impactful.</p></disp-quote><p>The introduction has now been modified by taking into account the Reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) One of the peptide stems in Figure 1 is missing a pentaglycine side chain; I would recommend increasing the font size; the peptide stem looks like it is attached to the carbon in position 2, it may be a good idea to move it to the left?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. Figure 1 has been improved, the frameshift has been fixed and the non-cross-linked pGly bridge has been included to the lysine side-chain in tetraStem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Figure 2 is a bit overwhelming and its description is sketchy. Fig 2B shows a much higher activity of LSS on pGly as compared to LytM whilst 2K shows a very similar rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged Figures 1 and 2 by moving the original panel J in Figure 2 (structures of PG fragments) to Figure 1 panel C. The bar graph in Figure 2J now shows absolute rates of substrate hydrolysis for 2 mM LSS and LytM. These indicate that LSS is much more efficient against PG fragments in vitro in comparison to LytM. Rates normalized with respect to pGly are shown in Figure 2K. Also, a table showing absolute rates of hydrolysis for 2 mM LSS and 50 mM LytM has been included in Figure 2, panel L. In this Table, the values for PG fragments 2 and 3 were determined by two independent measurements to test and accredit the reproducibility of the method. This is also now elaborated further in the Materials and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 is impressive and very informative but again hard to follow.</p><p>- Panels 3A and 3B are nicely conceived but the resolution is rather poor and it is difficult to know exactly where the arrows point.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much value suggestions given by the Reviewer to improve readability of our manuscript. In the case of Figure 3, we have now greatly enhanced the resolution and readability of the figure by horizontal scaling of panels A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 shows a comparative analysis of catalytic rate using various substrates, the authors may want to present graphs with the same y-axis to get the most out of the comparison between substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>The scaling of the y-axis is the same for all the substrates now.
