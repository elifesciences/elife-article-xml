pruritus, allergy, and inflammation-related skin disorders. Gain-of-function mutations of TRPV3 cause hair growth disorders in mice and Olmsted syndrome in humans. Nevertheless, whether and how TRPV3 could be therapeutically targeted remains to be elucidated. We here report that mouse and human TRPV3 channel is targeted by the clinical medication dyclonine that exerts a potent inhibitory effect. Accordingly, dyclonine rescued cell death caused by gain-of-function TRPV3 mutations and suppressed pruritus symptoms in vivo in mouse model. At the single-channel level, dyclonine inhibited TRPV3 open probability but not the unitary conductance. By molecular simulations and mutagenesis, we further uncovered key residues in TRPV3 pore region that could toggle the inhibitory efficiency of dyclonine. The functional and mechanistic insights obtained on dyclonine-TRPV3 interaction will help to conceive therapeutics for skin inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

channels belong to a family of calcium-permeable and nonselective cation channels, essential for body sensory processing and local inflammatory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapham, 2003</xref>). As a polymodal cellular sensor, transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 (TRPV3) channel is abundantly expressed in skin keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2002</xref>) and in cells surrounding the hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>). TRPV3 integrates a wide spectrum of physical and chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo and Hu, 2014</xref>). TRPV3 is sensitive to innocuous temperatures above 30–33°C and exhibits an increased response at noxious temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). Natural plant products such as camphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moqrich et al., 2005</xref>), carvacrol, eugenol, thymol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), and the pharmacological compound 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colton and Zhu, 2007</xref>) also activate TRPV3. In addition, TRPV3 is directly activated by acidic pH from cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mounting evidence implicates TRPV3 channel in cutaneous sensation including thermal sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2004b</xref>), nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2008</xref>), and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamamoto-Kasai et al., 2012</xref>). They also participate in the maintenance of skin barrier, hair growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>), and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aijima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). The dysfunction of TRPV3 channels has come to the fore as a key regulator of physiological and pathological responses of skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho and Lee, 2015</xref>). In rodents, the Gly573Ser substitution in TRPV3 renders the channel spontaneously active and caused a hairless phenotype in DS-Nh mice and WBN/Kob-Ht rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asakawa et al., 2006</xref>). DS-Nh mice also develop severe scratching behavior and pruritic dermatitis. TRPV3 dysfunction caused by genetic gain-of-function mutations or pharmaceutical activation has been linked to human skin diseases, including genodermatosis known as Olmsted syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and erythromelalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchatelet et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, TRPV3-deficient mice give rise to phenotypes of curly whiskers and wavy hair coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, hyperactive TRPV3 channels expressed in human outer root sheath keratinocytes inhibit hair growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borbíró et al., 2011</xref>). While being implicated in a variety of skin disorders, whether and how TRPV3 could be therapeutically targeted remains to be elucidated. It is thus desirable to identify and understand the clinical medications that potentially target TRPV3 channels.</p><p>Dyclonine is a clinical anesthetic characterized by rapid onset of effect, lack of systemic toxicity, and low index of sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florestano and Bahler, 1956</xref>). Its topical application (0.5% or 1% dyclonine hydrochloride contained in the topical solution, i.e., ~30.7 mM at a dose of 1%, according to the United States Pharmacopeia) rapidly relieves itching and pain in patients by ameliorating inflamed, excoriated, and broken lesions on mucous membranes and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morginson et al., 1956</xref>). Accordingly, dyclonine is used to anesthetize mucous membranes prior to endoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Formaker et al., 1998</xref>). The clinical scenario targeted by dyclonine treatment echoes the pathological aspects of TRPV3-related skin disorders, suggesting that the therapeutic effects of dyclonine might involve its interaction with TRPV3 sensory channel.</p><p>We report here that mouse and human TRPV3 (hTRPV3) channel activity was potently suppressed by dyclonine. It dose-dependently inhibited TRPV3 currents in a voltage-independent manner and rescued cell death caused by TRPV3 gain-of-function mutation. In vivo, dyclonine indeed suppressed the itching/scratching behaviors induced by TRPV3 channel agonist carvacrol as evidenced by the TRPV3 knock out (KO) mice. At single-channel level, dyclonine reduced TRPV3 channel open probability without altering the unitary conductance. We also identified molecular residues that were capable of either eliminating or enhancing the inhibitory effect of dyclonine. These data demonstrate the effective inhibition of TRPV3 channel by dyclonine, supplementing a molecular mechanism for its clinical effects and raising its potential to ameliorate TRPV3-associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of TRPV3 currents by dyclonine</title><p>We first examined the effect of dyclonine on TRPV3 activity induced by the TRPV channel agonist 2-APB (100 µM). Whole-cell currents were recorded at a holding potential of –60 mV in HEK 293T cells expressing mouse TRPV3. Because TRPV3 channels exhibit sensitizing properties upon repeated stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2004a</xref>), we examined the effect of dyclonine after the response had stabilized following repetitive application of 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presence of 5 and 10 µM dyclonine significantly inhibited TRPV3 currents response to 30% ± 2% and 15% ± 3% of control level, respectively. After washing out of dyclonine, 2-APB evoked a similar response to the control level, indicating that the blocking effect of dyclonine is reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We repeated the experiments with different doses of dyclonine. The dose-response curve indicates that dyclonine inhibited TRPV3 currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.2 ± 0.24 μM (n = 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further examined the inhibitory effect of dyclonine on TRPV3 activated by varying concentrations of 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The dose-response curves to 2-APB were fitted with a Hill equation. The inhibitory effect of dyclonine on TRPV3 activation was consistently observed under all tested 2-APB concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> values and Hill coefficients were not changed by the presence of dyclonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, EC<sub>50</sub> = 22.93 ± 0.02 μM, n<sub>H</sub> = 1.6 ± 0.1 without dyclonine vs. EC<sub>50</sub> = 22.03 ± 0.86 μM, n<sub>H</sub> = 1.7 ± 0.1 with 3 μM dyclonine), as confirmed by the normalized dose-response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Therefore, dyclonine dose-dependently inhibits the response amplitudes of TRPV3 channel.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of transient receptor potential vanilloid-3 (TRPV3) currents by dyclonine (Dyc).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inhibition of 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB)-evoked currents by Dyc in a representative HEK 293T cell expressing mouse TRPV3.

In contrast, excessive upregulation of TRPV3 activity impairs hair growth and increases the incidence of dermatitis and pruritus in both humans and rodents. To determine whether dyclonine affects the process of TRPV3 sensitization, TRPV3-expressing cells were repeatedly exposed to 100 μM 2-APB without or with 5 μM dyclonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). TRPV3 currents evoked by 2-APB alone took approximately eight repetitions to reach full sensitization level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The presence of dyclonine significantly slowed down this process, requiring ~16 repetitions to reach the current level of full sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). As expected, dyclonine also reduced the initial TRPV3 current (31.12 ± 2.86 pA/pF vs. 86.43 ± 5.9 pA/pF without dyclonine; p&lt;0.001; n = 9 per condition).</p><p>As TRPV3 is highly expressed in keratinocytes, we further determined the inhibitory effect of dyclonine in primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes. After stabilizing the channel current by repeated application of 2-APB, we tested the inhibitory effect of 5 and 30 μM dyclonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). On average, TRPV3 currents were reduced to 52% ± 7% and 13% ± 0.01% of control level by 5 and 30 μM dyclonine, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), reaching the similar level of inhibition by the wide-spectrum TRP channel blocker ruthenium red (RR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

Similarly, we performed whole-cell recordings in HEK 293T cells expressing hTRPV3 and frog TRPV3 (fTRPV3), respectively. They were activated to a stable level by repetitive 2-APB stimulation.

We measured membrane currents in TRPV3-expressing HEK 293T cells using a Cs<sup>+</sup>-based pipette solution that blocks most outward K<sup>+</sup> channel current but permits measurement of outward conductance mediated by the nonselective TRPV3 channel. A low-concentration 2-APB (40 μM) activated small voltage-dependent currents with steady-state outward rectification, characteristic of TRPV3 currents in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We therefore explored whether the heat-evoked TRPV3 currents can be also inhibited by dyclonine. We employed an ultrafast infrared laser system to control the local temperature near single cells; each temperature jump had a rise time of 1.5 ms and lasted for 100 ms. TRPV3 sensitization of the channel was induced by repeating a same temperature jump from room temperature to ~51°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We first examined the effect of dyclonine on the electrophysiological activity of mutants. We transfected the inducible cDNA constructs encoding respectively the GFP-tagged wild-type (WT) TRPV3, G573S, or G573 mutant into T-Rex 293 cells and then applied 20 ng/ml doxycycline to induce the gene expression.

As both mutant TRPV3 channels are effectively inhibited by dyclonine, we next explored whether it can rescue the cell death caused by these gain-of-function mutants. Cells expressing G573S or G573S were exposed to different pharmacological drugs (dyclonine, 2-APB, 2-APB and dyclonine, or RR). Cell death was recognized by the narrow and contracted footprints in bright-field images, and the protein expression meanwhile monitored by GFP fluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, massive cell death was seen in cells that expressed G573C and G573S TRPV3 mutants but not those expressing the wild-type TRPV3. Addition of dyclonine largely prevented the cell death while not causing change in the expression of TRPV3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that dyclonine decreased the cytotoxicity caused by the gain-of-function mutants. We further performed flow cytometry analysis and observed that the cell death ratio was maintained at low level (4.96% ± 0.87%, n = 7) in cells expressing WT TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

The inhibitory effect of drugs on ion channels is usually achieved in three ways, competitively binding with agonists, negative allosteric regulation, or directly blocking the channel pore. Dyclonine inhibited TRPV3 currents evoked by both 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), implying that dyclonine is not a competitive antagonist. In addition, the voltage independence of dyclonine inhibition and the fact that dyclonine is a positive charged alkaloid suggest that dyclonine is not simply an open channel blocker. Previous studies have demonstrated that local anesthetics inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels through a common drug-binding region within the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tikhonov and Zhorov, 2017</xref>). We therefore suspected that the inhibition effect of dyclonine is also due to its allosteric interaction with specific residues within the aqueous pore of TRPV3. The grid file of in silico docking was then constructed to examine residues in the upper pore region and the central cavity of TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>); the best receptor–ligand complex was evaluated using the extra precision (XP) scoring. Ligand clusters derived from XP docking suggested three potential TRPV3/dyclonine binding modes (BMs): BM<sub>A</sub>, BM<sub>B</sub>, and BM<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Moreover, residues within 10 Å of dyclonine poses were extensively refined using induce-fit-docking (IFD) based on mTRPV3 cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). BM<sub>B</sub> and BM<sub>C</sub> modes predicted that dyclonine occupies the ion permeation pathway behaving as an open channel blocker. This, however, contradicts the fact that dyclonine is a positive charged alkaloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and its inhibition effect is voltage-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, BM<sub>B</sub> and BM<sub>C</sub> binding modes appear unlikely.

The dose-response curves were fitted with a Hill equation, and the corresponding IC<sub>50</sub> values for each TRPV3 mutant were as follows: IC<sub>50</sub> = 286.7 ± 10.4 μM for L655A; IC<sub>50</sub> = 30.8 ± 2.2 μM for L630W; IC<sub>50</sub> = 37.7 ± 5.1 μM for N643A; IC<sub>50</sub> = 26.1 ± 2.8 μM for I644W; IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.25 ± 0.02 μM for L642A; and IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.56 ± 0.06 μM for I659A compared to IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.2 ± 0.24 μM for WT TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). Notably, all mutant channels except L639A were functional and produced robust responses to 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Covalent modification of L630C, F633C, and L642C, with side chains toward the proposed binding site, using MTSET (2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate, bromide), an MTS reagent with bulk positive side chain, significantly decreased 2-APB-idnuced current in the mutated mTRPV3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). The reduction reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) rescued this inhibitory effect, indicating that the interruption of the allostery of the pore cavity has impaired the channel activation of mTRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). In contrast, MTSET treatment had no effect on the activation of WT TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Along the same line, MTSET modification caused reduced dyclonine blockade in L630C, F633C, and L642C but not WT TRPV3, and DTT restored the blockage of dyclonine in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>), implying that dyclonine-mediated inhibition is mediated by the region predicted by BM<sub>A</sub> binding mode.

Due to either or both the lack of targeting specificity and the clinical application, their remedial potential remains to be determined. Hence, identifying and understanding clinical pharmaceutics that target TRPV3 channels will help to conceive therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Dyclonine is a topical antipruritic agent and has been used for clinical treatment of itching and pain for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargiulo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greifenstein et al., 1956</xref>). While the therapeutic effect of dyclonine has been attributed to the inhibition of cell depolarization, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. In the present study, we provide several tiers of evidence that dyclonine potently inhibits TRPV3 channel. Such inhibition was observed for TRPV3 responses to both chemical and thermal activation, suggesting that dyclonine is a condition-across inhibitor. Accordingly, dyclonine efficiently blocked the excessive activation of TRPV3 mutants and prevented cell death. Single-channel recordings revealed that dyclonine effectively suppresses the channel open probability without changing single-channel conductance. These data not only supplement a molecular mechanism for the therapeutic effect of dyclonine, but also suggest its application to curb TRPV3-related disorders. Using mouse model, we indeed observed that dyclonine ameliorates the TRPV3 hyperactivity-caused itch/scratching behaviors, indicating its therapeutic inhibition effect being maintained in vivo. As TRPV3 responds to moderate temperatures (30–40°C), dyclonine may thus be used to alleviate skin inflammations persisted in physiological temperatures. Also, as a clinical drug dyclonine has been widely used and thus has shown its safety to human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargiulo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sahdeo et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, as a potent inhibitor, dyclonine can also been a research tool to dissect the physiological and pathological characteristics of TRPV3 channel. While dyclonine effectively inhibits TRPV3 channels, our current results do not exclude its targeting of other molecular pathways. For instance, voltage-gated sodium channels have been shown to be inhibited by local anesthetics including dyclonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sahdeo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tikhonov and Zhorov, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The current data also provide clues on the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of TRPV3 by dyclonine. The residues within the pore loop and S6-helix of TRPV3, as suggested by BM<sub>A</sub> binding mode, create a functional ‘hotspot’ contributing to the inhibition of dyclonine. Chemical modification experiment further confirmed the importance of this ‘hotspot’ to channel gating and dyclonine inhibition. Interestingly, the size of pocket BM<sub>A</sub> is distinct in the apo/resting and open states. Likely, binding of dyclonine into this pocket could prevent the structural rearrangements of pore loop during TRPV3 gating, implying that dyclonine behaves as a negative allosteric modulator. Although similar pockets can also be observed on other TRP channels, the amino acids that make up the pocket and the precise shape of the pocket are diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This may be the reason why TRPV3 is targeted by dyclonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). F666 is located below the upper filter and behaves with a bulky hydrophobic side chain, which may play a role in maintaining the shape of BM<sub>A</sub> at the open state. This may be the reason why F666A is capable of decreasing the inhibition of dyclonine. Our current study revealed critical residues located within the pore cavity of TRPV3 that regulate dyclonine inhibition, yet the possibility exists that dyclonine inhibition is mediated by indirect mechanisms involving interactions with other residues. Nevertheless, the molecular sites uncovered by the present study would be instrumental in pinpointing the dyclonine-TRPV3 interaction at the molecular level, thereby developing specific therapeutics for chronic pruritus, dermatitis, and skin inflammations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

HEK 293T and T-Rex 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For T-Rex 293, blasticidin S (10 μg/ml) was also included. Cells grown into ~80% confluence were transfected with the desired DNA constructs using either the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method or lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Transfected HEK 293T cells were reseeded on 12 mm round glass coverslips coated by poly-L-lysine. Experiments took place ~12–24 hr after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK 293T and T-Rex 293 cell lines used in this study were respectively from the American Type Culture Collection and Thermo Fisher, authenticated by STR locus and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mouse epidermal keratinocyte culture</title><p>The animal protocol used in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan University. Primary mouse keratinocytes were prepared according to the method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pirrone et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, newborn WT C57B/6 mice (postnatal days 1–3) were deeply anaesthetized and decapitated and then soaked in 10% povidone-iodine, 70% ethanol, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, respectively. The skin on the back was removed and rinsed with pre-cold sterile PBS in a 100 mm Petri dish and transferred into a 2 ml tube filled with pre-cold digestion buffer containing 4 mg/ml dispase II and incubated overnight at 4°C. After treatment with dispase II for 12–18 hr, the epidermis was gently peeled off from dermis and collected. Keratinocytes were dispersed by gentle scraping and flushing with KC growth medium (Invitrogen). The resulting suspension of single cells was collected by centrifuge, and cells were seeded onto coverslips pre-coated with poly-L-lysine and maintained in complete keratinocyte serum-free growth medium (Invitrogen). Cell culture medium was refreshed every two days. Patch-clamp recordings were carried out 48 hr after plating.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>Conventional whole-cell and excised patch-clamp recording methods were used. For the recombinant expressing system, green fluorescent EGFP was used as a surface marker for gene expression. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) and fire-polished to a resistance between 2 and 4 MΩ when filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 140 CsCl, 2.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with CsOH). Bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. For recordings in keratinocytes, the bath saline consisted of (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucoses, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, and the pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH. For single-channel recordings, the pipette solution and bath solution were symmetrical and contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Isolated cells were voltage clamped and held at –60 mV using an EPC10 amplifier with the Patchmaster software (HEKAElectronics, Lambrecht, Germany). For a subset of recordings, currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and recorded through a BNC-2090/MIO acquisition system (National Instruments, Austin, TX) using QStudio developed by Dr. Feng Qin at State University of New York at Buffalo. Whole-cell recordings were typically sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz, and single-channel recordings were sampled at 25 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The compensation of pipette series resistance and capacitance was compensated using the built-in circuitry of the amplifier (&gt;80%) to reduce voltage errors. Exchange of external solution was performed using a gravity-driven local perfusion system. As determined by the conductance tests, the solution around a patch under study was fully controlled by the application of a flow rate of 100 μl/min or greater. Dyclonine hydrochloride, MTSET and carvacrol were purchased from MCE (MedChemExpress). Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Water-insoluble reagents were dissolved in pure ethanol or DMSO to make a stock solution and diluted into the recording solution at the desired final concentrations before the experiment. The final concentrations of ethanol or DMSO did not exceed 0.3%, which had no effect to currents. In the scratching behavior experiments, carvacrol was first dissolved in 10% ethanol and then diluted in normal saline before administration. All experiments except those for heat activation were performed at room temperature (22–24℃).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ultrafast temperature jump achievement</title><p>Rapid temperature jumps were generated by the laser irradiation approach as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, a single-emitter infrared laser diode (1470 nm) was used as a heat source. A multimode fiber with a core diameter of 100 μm was used to transmit the launched laser beam. The other end of the fiber exposing the fiber core was placed close to cells as the perfusion pipette is typically positioned. The laser diode was driven by a pulsed quasi-CW current powder supply (Stone Laser, Beijing, China). Pulsing of the controller was controlled from computer through the data acquisition card using QStudio software developed by Dr. Feng Qin at State University of New York at Buffalo. A blue laser line (460 nm) was coupled into the fiber to aid alignment. The beam spot on the coverslip was identified by illumination of GFP-expressing cells using the blue laser during experiment.</p><p>Constant temperature steps were generated by irradiating the tip of an open pipette and using the current of the electrode as the readout for feedback control. The laser was first powered on for a brief duration to reach the target temperature and then modulated to maintain a constant pipette current. The sequence of the modulation pulses was stored and subsequently played back to apply temperature jumps to the cell of interest. Temperature was calibrated offline from the pipette current using the dependence of electrolyte conductivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell death analysis by flow cytometry</title><p>T-Rex 293 cells were grown in DMEM containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and blasticidin S (10 μg/ml), and were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Transfections were performed in wells of a 24-well plate using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The GFP-TRPV3 (WT and G573 mutants) cDNAs in pcDNA4/TO vector were individually transfected into T-Rex 293 cells and treated with 20 ng/ml doxycycline 16 hr post-transfection to induce the gene expression following the method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of GFP fluorescence detected by an epifluorescence microscope was used as an indicator of gene expression. After treatments with the compounds for 12 hr, cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, resuspended, and then dyed with propidium iodide (PI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the dark according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membrane integrity of the cells was assessed using a BD FACSCelesta flow cytometer equipped with BD Accuri C6 software (BD Biosciences, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Evaluation of scratching behavior in Mice</title><p>Behavioral studies were performed with 6- to 8-week-old WT or <italic>Trpv3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> adult C57B/6 mice. To assess itch-scratching behaviors, the hair of the rostral part of the mouse’s right neck was shaved using an electric hair clipper 24 hr before the start of experiments. <italic>Trpv3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Scratching behaviors were recorded on video. The number of itch-scratching bouts was counted through video playback analysis. One scratching bout was defined as an episode in which a mouse lifted its right hind limb to the injection site and scratched continuously for any time length until this limb was returned to the floor or mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). All behavioral experiments were conducted in a double-blind manner. To examine acute scratching/itch induced by carvacrol or pruritogen histamine, mice were first placed in an observation box (length, width, and height: 9 × 9 × 13 cm<sup>3</sup>) for acclimatization for about 30 min. Then, carvacrol (0.1%) in a volume of 50 μl was injected intradermally into the right side of the mouse’s neck. To access the effect of dyclonine on itch scratching, normal saline (0.9% NaCl) or dyclonine (1, 10, and 50 μM) was injected intradermally 30 min before intradermal injection of carvacrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun and Dong, 2016</xref>). Behaviors were recorded on video for 30 min following the injection of carvacrol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hargreaves test for behavioral experiments</title><p>All tests were conducted during the light phase of the light/dark cycle by a trained observer blind to the genotype. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 60 min prior to the behavioral tests unless otherwise stated. Hargreaves test was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). All behavioral experiments were conducted in a double-blind manner. For measurement of thermal hyperalgesia, animals were placed individually, 30 min after injection, on a hot plate (Bioseb, Chaville, France) with the temperature adjusted to 55°C. The withdrawal latency of each hind paw was determined until nocifensive reaction appeared (licking foot). Right hind paws of mice were injected intraplantarly with 10 μl normal saline (0.9% NaCl). Left hind paws of mice were injected intraplantarly with 10 μl normal saline (supplemented with 10 or 50 μM dyclonine).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Molecular docking</title><p>The molecular docking approach was used to model the interaction between dyclonine and TRPV3 channel protein (PDB ID code: 6DVZ) according to previous description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The 3D structure of dyclonine was generated by LigPrep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gadakar et al., 2007</xref>). Glide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friesner et al., 2004</xref>) and IFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherman et al., 2006</xref>) were employed to dock dyclonine into the potential binding. For Glide docking, the grid for the protein was defined as an enclosing cubic box within 34 Å to include the upper pore region and the central cavity of TRPV3, and the XP docking mode was selected. During in silico docking, at most 100,000 poses passed through for the initial phase of docking, of which the top 300 poses were processed with post-docking minimization. The threshold for rejecting minimized pose was set to 0.5 kcal/mol. A maximum of 200 poses were finally written out. The docking scores and dyclonine-residue interaction distance were summarized, sorted, and then plotted by Maestro. IFD was performed to refine the interaction between dyclonine and TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherman et al., 2006</xref>), L655, I674 and G638 residues were chosen from the center of the docking box, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dict.youdao.com/w/respectively/#keyfrom=E2Ctranslation">respectively</ext-link>.

currently no specific drugs to either activate or inhibit this channel. Qiang Liu and collaborators discover that TRPV3 channels from mouse, human and frog are inhibited by the topical analgesic dyclonine regardless of whether the channel is activated by agonists, heat or voltage, with much higher potency than TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8 channels. Dyclonine starkly reduces cell death that results from TRPV3 channel activation by either gain of function mutations known to cause skin pathologies as well as by direct activation of wild-type channels by agonist, and that application of dyclonine reduces scratching behavior in mice pre-treated with the TRPV3 channel agonist carvacrol. Using computational approaches together with mutagenesis, the authors provide evidence that dyclonine binds within the pore to inhibit the channel. This is a carefully done study with high-quality data that identifies a novel, reversible and relatively selective inhibitor for an important TRP channel for which few pharmacological tools exist.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Theodore Chesler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The editors and reviewers enjoyed reading your manuscript and were enthusiastic about the potential of your findings. As you will see, all three reviewers have substantial concerns with your key conclusions regarding the mechanism of dyclonine inhibition of TRPV3, selectivity of the drug for TRPV3 and with the physiological roles of TRPV3. The reviewers have suggested additional experiments that could potentially address their concerns, however, doing so would require considerably more than the two months we typically allot for inviting revisions. However, given the potential significance of your study, we would be willing to consider a new manuscript that includes additional experiments that address all of the reviewer's concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The function of the TRPV3 non-selective cation channel is important for skin physiology and hair growth, and gain of function mutations in this channel cause human pathologies that are mirrored in animal models. There are currently no specific drugs to either activate or inhibit this channel. In this study by Qiang Liu and collaborators they identify that when activated by 2-APB, the TRPV3 channels from mouse, human and frog are inhibited by the topical analgesic dyclonine with much higher potency than TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8 channels when these are activated by capsaicin, 2-APB and menthol, respectively. They also find that dyclonine inhibits mouse TRPV3 channels when activated by both voltage and heat. The authors also show that dyclonine starkly reduces cell death that results from TRPV3 channel activation by either gain of function mutations known to cause skin pathologies as well as by direct activation of wild-type channels by 2-APB, and that application of dyclonine reduces scratching behavior in mice pre-treated with the TRPV3 channel agonist carvacrol or by histamine. By performing single-channel recordings they show that dyclonine reduces the open probability of TRPV3 channels activated by 2-APB. Finally the authors identify a series of residues located in the pore cavity of the channel that when individually substituted by alanine either strongly reduce or increase the potency of channel inhibition by dyclonine, suggesting that the drug might bind in the pore to inhibit channel activity or to block cations from permeating through the open channel pore. This is a carefully done study with high-quality data that identifies a novel, reversible and relatively selective inhibitor for an important TRP channel for which few pharmacological tools exist. However, I think that some key considerations are missing regarding the mechanism of action of dyclonine on TRPV3 channels, as well as its specificity for this channel. I have the following specific concerns:</p><p>1. The authors should highlight the zero-current levels in all figure panels where current traces are displayed; this is critical to assess the amount of leak that is present in the recordings.</p><p>2. The authors have not addressed whether the inhibition of TRPV3 channels by dyclonine is state dependent. I think this is important for assessing the specificity of the drug on other channels as well as the quantitative effects on inhibition of the various examined TRPV3 channel mutants. The authors use a variety of 2-APB concentrations to activate TRPV3 channels across experiments, none of which are saturating, whereas near-maximal agonist concentrations are used for TRPV1 and TRPV2. In the case of the examined TRPV3 mutations, those that increase the apparent affinity for dyclonine exhibit currents that are much noisier and activate more slowly than wild-type, suggesting a negative effect of the mutation on gating, whereas mutations that reduce the apparent affinity have larger current densities, faster kinetics of activation and less noise once channel activation reaches steady-state, suggesting a positive effect on gating. If dyclonine inhibition were inversely proportional to open probability, the differences in apparent affinity observed between TRP channel subtypes or between TRPV3 mutants could thus potentially arise from differences in the open probability between channels at the conditions in which inhibition was measured for each. I think that the authors should provide data showing inhibition by dyclonine at super-saturating concentrations of 2-APB and show that it is comparable to inhibition at lower agonist concentrations.</p><p>3. I think that the inhibitory effect of dyclonine on TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8 channels is not low enough as to say that it is a specific effect for TRPV3 channels – the EC50 for inhibition of human TRPV3 channels is only 2-fold lower than that for TRPV2 channels. The authors also only examined a small number of TRP channels. I consider that examining the effects of dyclonine on the TRPA1 channel is particularly important, as this channel is known to also contribute to the pathophysiology of itch. I think it would be better if the authors used more conservative language regarding specificity, stating simply that the apparent affinity under their experimental conditions is larger for TRPV3 than for those other TRP channels that were tested.</p><p>4. Regarding the clinical implications of the study, it would make it much stronger if the authors showed directly using electrophysiological recordings that dyclonine can inhibit the gain of function mutations that are known to cause disease (G573S and G573C).</p><p>5. The in vivo results are highly non-specific, and it is impossible to determine whether the effect of dyclonine that is observed is indeed mediated by TRPV3 channels. As described in the Introduction section, dyclonine was initially looked at by the authors because of its proved effect as topical anesthetic – it is thus not surprising that it reduces scratching behavior in mice. I think these results should be removed from the manuscript, or additional experiments using TRPV3-deficient animals should be included to show that the effect on behavior requires the presence of TRPV3.</p><p>6. I found it hard to rationalize the effects of the distinct TRPV3 mutations on inhibition based on the illustrations for the three proposed binding sites that are shown in Figure 8. The authors should distinguish between alternative hypothesis regarding the proximity of docked dyclonine to the various channel residues in each of the proposed binding sites, clearly highlighting those that are far from the bound drug or close to it in each case. They should also provide more information and a better rationale for their choice of structural model – why was that structure chosen? How were the distinct binding sites ranked? Importantly, the inner cavity of the pore is highly conserved in TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels, suggesting that pore blockers should affect these three channels similarly. Are the identified residues in the pore conserved in TRPV1 and TRPV2, and if they are, how do the authors explain the differences in inhibition observed between these three channels? The authors should provide a discussion that considers whether the effect of dyclonine is on cation conduction (pore block) or on gating (antagonism).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Trpv3 is a non-selective cation channel that can be gated by temperature and environmental irritants.

There are several issues with this aspect of this manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors carried out docking to a cryo-EM structure of TRPV3 at 4.3Å resolution using Induced Fit Docking with the protein conformation fixed and the ligand flexible. At such a resolution the side chains in the pocket may well be very poorly defined and docking is unlikely to be reliable. It is not clear that the protein structure is suitable for docking, especially since the protein side chain orientations were fixed.</p><p>2. The center of the docking box was defined using L655, I674 and G638. The authors do not mention the box size that they use, but default box size in Induced Fit Docking, I believe, is 10x10x10 Å, which leaves very few alternatives for a ligand of this size. Therefore the residues reported to be found at the center of the binding pocket are, in essence, predefined (page 15).</p><p>3. The method used to select the three docking poses from the docking results is unclear. Were there only three results above a specific energy threshold? Did the authors do clustering of the results? More details are required.</p><p>4. The figures do not provide sufficient clarity to understand how the ligand is docking in the three poses mentioned. The overview (Figure 8A) is too general, while the close-up views (Figure 8 B) need labelling of the transmembrane helices and subunits.</p><p>5. While the mutagenesis provides interesting data about the residues that might be involved with the dyclonine effect, it could reflect indirect effects.</p><p>Taken together the presented computational and mutagenesis data should not be used as evidence that the binding site has been identified.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Therapeutic inhibition of keratinocyte TRPV3 sensory channel by local anesthetic dyclonine&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers believe the authors have done an excellent job of addressing most of the concerns raised in the last review of their manuscript, and by performing multiple complicated additional experiments they have provided solid support for most of their conclusions. The reviewers still have a few concerns that need to be addressed by careful revision of the manuscript.</p><p>1. We think the authors should tone down their statements throughout the manuscript about dyclonine functioning as a selective inhibitor of mouse and human TRPV3 channels, for the following reasons: First, as mentioned in the last review, the apparent affinity for dyclonine in TRPV2 (31 uM) is not that much lower than that of the human orthologue of TRPV3 when activated by 2-APB (16 uM) or of mouse TRPV3 activated by heat (14 uM), indicating that dyclonine might not be selective in humans. Second, the number of TRP channels tested is small, and no other channels were tested that could also contribute to the behavioral responses to carvacrol downstream of TRPV3 activation and that could also be affected by dyclonine. Third, TRPV3 is reportedly expressed in human DRG neurons (see Xu et al. Nature 2002 and Smith et al. Nature 2002) but not in mice DRGs (Peier et al. Science 2002), calling into question the relevance of the DRG data in Figure S1A-D to ascertain the specificity of dyclonine action on TRPV3. We think this should be discussed. Fourth, the differences in paw withdrawal latency between WT and TRPV3 KO mice with and without dyclonine (Figure S1E) are too small to be convincing, and there is significant overlap between the data points at all conditions. The authors should tone down their conclusions from these data and state that at best a minimal trend can be observed that suggests an effect of TRPV3 in the latency responses. Fifth, it would have been ideal to show that dyclonine has no effect on the 20% remaining response to carvacrol in TRPV3 KO mice in the scratching experiments in Figure 6. Otherwise with the data provided it can be concluded that TRPV3 is required for the majority of the response to carvacrol, but the data does not prove that TRPV3 is the sole target for the drug. It would also be ideal to for the authors to show that dyclonine also inhibits TRPV3 channel activation by carvacrol. Finally, we don't understand how dyclonine can be a general anesthetic (in people) if it is functioning solely through Trpv3. This point should be discussed and the authors should acknowledge that the drug may have other targets.</p><p>2. The sensitization experiments in Figure 1G-I are not of adequate quality to conclude that dyclonine slows sensitization of the channel; the peak current magnitudes in the last stimulation with 2-APB in Figures 1G and 1H are noticeably larger than the second-to last peak current magnitudes. This suggests that sensitization has not yet reached equilibrium in either case, and yet because experiments without dyclonine were shorter than experiments with dyclonine, it is difficult to determine whether the two are indeed different. We think the authors should show the same data normalized to the initial stimulation with 2-APB instead of normalizing to the last response. This would provide a much clearer way of comparing the two time-courses given that equilibrium has not been reached. We realize that this point does not alter the main conclusions in the paper, but data should be analyzed and discussed in the most accurate way possible regardless.</p><p>3. In relation to the absence of voltage-dependence of inhibition by dyclonine, it is hard to reconcile the data in Figure 3C with the current-voltage relations shown in the upper panel – at negative membrane potentials a concentration of 30 μm dyclonine certainly seems to inhibit as much current as ruthenium red (RR), which we assume provides the baseline for maximal inhibition and would thus represent 100% inhibition instead of 50% as indicated in the lower panel. The authors need to include data for the baseline in the absence of agonists to accurately assess the level of inhibition. In addition, the voltage dependence of RR should be predictably larger than that of dyclonine because it is a hexavalent cation. We think it is necessary for the authors to clarify these discrepancies in the data in order to strongly conclude that there is no voltage dependence to dyclonine action.</p><p>4. In relation to the data in Figure 5E, the fluorescence intensity in GFP expression is not an accurate way to estimate protein expression in general, and even if GFP were covalently attached to the channel, it would still be difficult to estimate channel expression from the intensity of GFP because TRP channels tend to accumulate in intracellular compartments when over expressed in heterologous systems. The authors should remove all statements regarding protein expression levels.</p><p>5. There is indeed a clear decrease in affinity for dyclonine in TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels compared to mouse TRPV3 channels activated by 2-APB. We think providing additional discussion about the sequence and structural differences between the three channels near the proposed binding site for dyclonine would be interesting for readers and might provide additional interesting insight into the potential underlying mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>6. We think the authors have done a nice job of providing more information for the docking analysis and we think this provides valuable information for where dyclonine may bind. Having said that, we also have serious concerns regarding the new metadynamics calculations, and to avoid delaying publication further, would recommend removing them, as the docking data is sufficient basis for the mutagenesis that tests the site.</p><p>First, the methods for the metadynamics include several references to previously-published simulations on TRPV3 and P2X3. It's not clear which parts are taken from which paper. For example, was the well-tempered variant of metadynamics used here? Second, and most importantly, the choice and definitions of the collective variables are unclear. Specifically, why do these definitions represent the possible binding modes of the drug and how can we be sure that they are not biased to what was observed in the docking? Where is E631 (not shown in any figures, nor described) and why was its distance to the N in the ring of dyclonine used for CV1? Similarly, what are the &quot;colored carbon atoms of dyclonine&quot; used to define the dihedral angle in CV2? (Perhaps the authors mean the oxygen and nitrogen atoms, but I count only three atoms of this type, while a dihedral angle requires four atoms. It doesn't help that the (presumably red) oxygen atoms are hard to differentiate from the orange of the carbon atoms in Figure 8A and B). Third, the figure of the results (Figure 8B) indicates two configurations with energy minima at a distance of 9 Å (BM<sub>A1</sub> and BM<sub>A2</sub>). However, it seems to us that those minima at +3 and -3 radians are actually related, given the continuity of angle space. Also, the axis labels are almost impossible to read on the energy landscape plot. Fourth, we are confused by the description of site BM(A): page 17, line 15, says it is formed between the pore loop and S5, whereas Figure 8A/B shows it between the pore helix and S6. Is this a typo?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68128.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The function of the TRPV3 non-selective cation channel is important for skin physiology and hair growth, and gain of function mutations in this channel cause human pathologies that are mirrored in animal models. There are currently no specific drugs to either activate or inhibit this channel. In this study by Qiang Liu and collaborators they identify that when activated by 2-APB, the TRPV3 channels from mouse, human and frog are inhibited by the topical analgesic dyclonine with much higher potency than TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8 channels when these are activated by capsaicin, 2-APB and menthol, respectively. They also find that dyclonine inhibits mouse TRPV3 channels when activated by both voltage and heat. The authors also show that dyclonine starkly reduces cell death that results from TRPV3 channel activation by either gain of function mutations known to cause skin pathologies as well as by direct activation of wild-type channels by 2-APB, and that application of dyclonine reduces scratching behavior in mice pre-treated with the TRPV3 channel agonist carvacrol or by histamine. By performing single-channel recordings they show that dyclonine reduces the open probability of TRPV3 channels activated by 2-APB. Finally the authors identify a series of residues located in the pore cavity of the channel that when individually substituted by alanine either strongly reduce or increase the potency of channel inhibition by dyclonine, suggesting that the drug might bind in the pore to inhibit channel activity or to block cations from permeating through the open channel pore.

Although there are some literatures about histamine-induced itching mediated by TRPV3 activation (Asakawa et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), this issue remains debated. We agree with the reviewer’s concern, and we have now removed the in vivo data from histamine treatment. To validate the involvement of TRPV3 in carvacrol-caused scratching behavior, we performed new experiments using TRPV3 knock out (KO) mice. We observed that TRPV3 KO largely reduced carvacrol-caused scratching (~80% reduction), indicating that TRPV3 underlies the scratching response (new data on Figure 6A-B). Hence, the inhibition effect of dyclonine on carvacrol-caused scratching involves the specific inhibition of TRPV3 channel (Figure 6C-D). These results are described on page 14 lines 2-13.</p><p>2. Also following the suggestion of the reviewer, we performed new electrophysiological experiments in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons, in the presence and absence of dyclonine. We found that the resting membrane potential of both types of neurons was unaffected by the presence of 10 µM (new data now in supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest the specific targeting of keratinocyte TRPV3 by dyclonine. This point is described from page 14 line 20 to page 15 line 2.</p><p>3. In addition to the itching/scratching behavior, we did new experiments in wild-type and TRPV3 KO mice to examine the effect of dyclonine on thermal nociceptive responses to the noxious temperature 55 °C. The results indicate that in wild-type mice, dyclonine dose-dependently reduced the nociceptive response (new data in supplementary Figure 1). TRPV3 KO reduced mice nociceptive response to heating (55°C; comparison between grey bars in supplementary Figure 1E). However, in TRPV3 KO mice, dyclonine showed no further effect, indicating that dyclonine specifically targets TRPV3 in vivo. These new data also suggest that TRPV3 partially contributes to pain sensation in thermal nociception, in line with its polymodal functions in cellular sensing.

To address this, the free energy profiles for TRPV3/dyclonine interaction were further reconstructed by metadynamics, a powerful algorithm for free energy reconstruction in complex Hamiltonians’ systems (Laio and Gervasio, 2008). Then, the TRPV3-dyclonine contacts were extensively sampled (Figure S2A-C). We identified a dyclonine pose with the lowest free energy as the potential binding mode to TRPV3, which is almost identical to the mode BM<sub>A</sub> derived by IFD (Figure 8A-B), suggesting that the IFD model is reasonable, in spite of the relatively low resolution of the mTRPV3 cryo-EM structure.

DTT could restore the relative inhibition effect of dyclonine in these mutants.</p><p>These new analysis and experimental results demonstrate the functional involvement of BM<sub>A</sub> binding pocket in dyclonine-mediated TRPV3 inhibition. These new data are described from page 18 to page 19.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The center of the docking box was defined using L655, I674 and G638. The authors do not mention the box size that they use, but default box size in Induced Fit Docking, I believe, is 10x10x10 Å, which leaves very few alternatives for a ligand of this size. Therefore the residues reported to be found at the center of the binding pocket are, in essence, predefined (page 15).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in induced-fit-docking, residues within 10 Å of the dyclonine pose were extensively optimized. The IFD model used here is aimed to optimize the dyclonine pose.</p><p>The binding modes screening in the pore region was further carried out using extra precision (XP) scoring of GLIDE, in which the box size was set as 34 Å. This information was missed in the original manuscript, and now incorporated into page 16 lines 20 – 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The method used to select the three docking poses from the docking results is unclear. Were there only three results above a specific energy threshold? Did the authors do clustering of the results? More details are required.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for missing this information. Yes, the results were clustered in the XP scoring (Figure S2B, C). Details about the method used to select and define the three docking poses from the docking results are now substantially updated, and provided on page 16 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph to page 17.</p><p>Briefly, dyclonine inhibited TRPV3 currents evoked by either 2-APB or heating, implying that dyclonine is not a competitive antagonist (Figure 1 and 4). We therefore suspected that the inhibition effect of dyclonine arises from its interaction with the aqueous pore of open TRPV3. The grid file of <italic>in silico</italic> docking was constructed to mainly examine residues in the upper pore region and the central cavity of TRPV3 (Figure S2); then, the best receptor–ligand complex was evaluated by the extra precision (XP) scoring. Ligand clusters derived from XP docking suggested three TRPV3/ dyclonine binding modes (BMs): BM<sub>A</sub>, BM<sub>B</sub> and BM<sub>C</sub> (Figure S2A-C). Moreover, residues within 10 Å of dyclonine poses were extensively refined using Induced-Fit-Docking (IFD). BM<sub>B</sub> and BM<sub>C</sub> modes predict that dyclonine occupies the ion permeation pathway behaving as an open channel blocker. However, dyclonine is a positive charged alkaloid (Figure 8B) and its inhibition effect is voltage-independent (Figure 3), which contradicts with the open channel blocker prediction hence makes BM<sub>B</sub> and BM<sub>C</sub> unlikely.</p><p>Further analysis by metadynamics algorithm supports BM<sub>A</sub> binding mode for dyclonine-TRPV3 interaction, where dyclonine makes contacts with the cavity formed by the pore loop and S5-helix of TRPV3 (Figure 8A and Figure S2B). This binding mode yields the lowest free energy (Figure 8B, BM<sub>A1</sub>). The superimposition of <italic>apo</italic> and open structures of TRPV3 revealed remarkable allosteric changes and cavity size reduction in these regions (Figure S2I, J), supporting the rationality of the BM<sub>A</sub> mode. Hence, these new analysis imply that dyclonine likely behaves as a negative allosteric modulator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The figures do not provide sufficient clarity to understand how the ligand is docking in the three poses mentioned. The overview (Figure 8A) is too general, while the close-up views (Figure 8 B) need labelling of the transmembrane helices and subunits.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have updated these panels in the revised manuscript (Figure 8A, B and Figure S2A, B, D). The labelling of the transmembrane helices and subunits are added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While the mutagenesis provides interesting data about the residues that might be involved with the dyclonine effect, it could reflect indirect effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide several lines of data suggesting that dyclonine interacts with the pore cavity residues of TRPV3 and operates likely as a negative allosteric regulator.

The reviewers still have a few concerns that need to be addressed by careful revision of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. We think the authors should tone down their statements throughout the manuscript about dyclonine functioning as a selective inhibitor of mouse and human TRPV3 channels, for the following reasons:</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: In general, we agree with the reviewers’ suggestion and have toned down the statements on the selective effects of dycloine by removing ‘selective’ through out the manuscript, while conservatively describing the effective inhibition on TRPV3 channel. Updates are made on P3, line 7; P5, line 13 ; P6, line 4 and line 11; P9, line 4 and line 17; P10, line 3; P13, line 19; P20, line 12 and line 19; P21, line 10; P22, line 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, as mentioned in the last review, the apparent affinity for dyclonine in TRPV2 (31 uM) is not that much lower than that of the human orthologue of TRPV3 when activated by 2-APB (16 uM) or of mouse TRPV3 activated by heat (14 uM), indicating that dyclonine might not be selective in humans. Second, the number of TRP channels tested is small, and no other channels were tested that could also contribute to the behavioral responses to carvacrol downstream of TRPV3 activation and that could also be affected by dyclonine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these two concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, TRPV3 is reportedly expressed in human DRG neurons (see Xu et al. Nature 2002 and Smith et al. Nature 2002) but not in mice DRGs (Peier et al. Science 2002), calling into question the relevance of the DRG data in Figure S1A-D to ascertain the specificity of dyclonine action on TRPV3. We think this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of the previous review, we tested the effects of dyclonine on neuron excitability in mouse DRG and trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons. The results showed no effect of dyclonine (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-D), which do corroborate the absence of the expression of TRPV3 in mouse DRG. These data also suggest that the in vivo effect of dyclonine arises from the targeting of keratinocyte TRPV3. We add this comment on P15, lines 6 to 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, the differences in paw withdrawal latency between WT and TRPV3 KO mice with and without dyclonine (Figure S1E) are too small to be convincing, and there is significant overlap between the data points at all conditions. The authors should tone down their conclusions from these data and state that at best a minimal trend can be observed that suggests an effect of TRPV3 in the latency responses.</p></disp-quote><p>For the description of thermal nociception, we have modified it as ‘In wild-type mice, dyclonine exhibited a tendency to reduce the nociceptive response’ on P15, line 12. Moreover, we replaced ‘specifically’with ‘mainly’ on P15, line 16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fifth, it would have been ideal to show that dyclonine has no effect on the 20% remaining response to carvacrol in TRPV3 KO mice in the scratching experiments in Figure 6. Otherwise with the data provided it can be concluded that TRPV3 is required for the majority of the response to carvacrol, but the data does not prove that TRPV3 is the sole target for the drug. It would also be ideal to for the authors to show that dyclonine also inhibits TRPV3 channel activation by carvacrol. Finally, we don't understand how dyclonine can be a general anesthetic (in people) if it is functioning solely through Trpv3. This point should be discussed and the authors should acknowledge that the drug may have other targets.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we performed new whole-cell recordings in TRPV3-expressing HEK 293T cells to further confirm the inhibitory effect of dyclonine on TRPV3 currents activated by carvacrol. Similar to that observed with the inhibition of 2-APB-evoked TRPV3 currents (Figure 1A-C), dyclonine also inhibited carvacrol-activated TRPV3 currents in a concentration-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.5 ± 0.34 M following sensitization by repeated application of 0.3 mM 2-APB (<italic>n</italic> = 8, new Figure 6E-F), implying that the itching caused by carvacrol is mainly due to the activation of TRPV3. We have now added this in the result section on P14, line 19 to P15, line 4.</p><p>We completely agree with the comments that dyclonine as a general anesthetic may have other targets. For example, voltage-gated sodium channels have been suggested to be inhibited by local anesthetic. We have now added this note into the discussion part on P21, lines 11-15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The sensitization experiments in Figure 1G-I are not of adequate quality to conclude that dyclonine slows sensitization of the channel; the peak current magnitudes in the last stimulation with 2-APB in Figures 1G and 1H are noticeably larger than the second-to last peak current magnitudes. This suggests that sensitization has not yet reached equilibrium in either case, and yet because experiments without dyclonine were shorter than experiments with dyclonine, it is difficult to determine whether the two are indeed different. We think the authors should show the same data normalized to the initial stimulation with 2-APB instead of normalizing to the last response. This would provide a much clearer way of comparing the two time-courses given that equilibrium has not been reached. We realize that this point does not alter the main conclusions in the paper, but data should be analyzed and discussed in the most accurate way possible regardless.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the careful reading and helpful suggestions. We re-analyzed the sensentization process by normalizing all responses to its initial response, and made a new plot as shown in Figure 1I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In relation to the absence of voltage-dependence of inhibition by dyclonine, it is hard to reconcile the data in Figure 3C with the current-voltage relations shown in the upper panel – at negative membrane potentials a concentration of 30 μm dyclonine certainly seems to inhibit as much current as ruthenium red (RR), which we assume provides the baseline for maximal inhibition and would thus represent 100% inhibition instead of 50% as indicated in the lower panel. The authors need to include data for the baseline in the absence of agonists to accurately assess the level of inhibition. In addition, the voltage dependence of RR should be predictably larger than that of dyclonine because it is a hexavalent cation. We think it is necessary for the authors to clarify these discrepancies in the data in order to strongly conclude that there is no voltage dependence to dyclonine action.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our carlessness. We agree with the reviewers’ judgment. As per your suggestions, we added the baseline in the absence of agonists to Figure 3B and recalculated the inhibition effects of dyclonine on TRPV3 by subtracting leak currents under different voltages (new Figure 3C). The result shows an enhanced inhibition efficiency of dyclonine, with the voltage-independence being retained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In relation to the data in Figure 5E, the fluorescence intensity in GFP expression is not an accurate way to estimate protein expression in general, and even if GFP were covalently attached to the channel, it would still be difficult to estimate channel expression from the intensity of GFP because TRP channels tend to accumulate in intracellular compartments when over expressed in heterologous systems. The authors should remove all statements regarding protein expression levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this constructive comment. We have deleted all statements regarding protein expression levels in the manuscript (P12, line 22 and P13, line 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is indeed a clear decrease in affinity for dyclonine in TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels compared to mouse TRPV3 channels activated by 2-APB. We think providing additional discussion about the sequence and structural differences between the three channels near the proposed binding site for dyclonine would be interesting for readers and might provide additional interesting insight into the potential underlying mechanism of inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have now incorporated the sequence alignment of the pore region among the three channels into new Figure 8—figure supplement 2, and discussed the possible reasons for the different inhibitory effects of dyclonine on TRPV3 from TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels, on P22, lines 2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. We think the authors have done a nice job of providing more information for the docking analysis and we think this provides valuable information for where dyclonine may bind. Having said that, we also have serious concerns regarding the new metadynamics calculations, and to avoid delaying publication further, would recommend removing them, as the docking data is sufficient basis for the mutagenesis that tests the site.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, the methods for the metadynamics include several references to previously-published simulations on TRPV3 and P2X3. It's not clear which parts are taken from which paper. For example, was the well-tempered variant of metadynamics used here? Second, and most importantly, the choice and definitions of the collective variables are unclear. Specifically, why do these definitions represent the possible binding modes of the drug and how can we be sure that they are not biased to what was observed in the docking? Where is E631 (not shown in any figures, nor described) and why was its distance to the N in the ring of dyclonine used for CV1? Similarly, what are the &quot;colored carbon atoms of dyclonine&quot; used to define the dihedral angle in CV2? (Perhaps the authors mean the oxygen and nitrogen atoms, but I count only three atoms of this type, while a dihedral angle requires four atoms. It doesn't help that the (presumably red) oxygen atoms are hard to differentiate from the orange of the carbon atoms in Figure 8A and B). Third, the figure of the results (Figure 8B) indicates two configurations with energy minima at a distance of 9 Å (BM<sub>A1</sub> and BM<sub>A2</sub>). However, it seems to us that those minima at +3 and -3 radians are actually related, given the continuity of angle space. Also, the axis labels are almost impossible to read on the energy landscape plot. Fourth, we are confused by the description of site BM(A): page 17, line 15, says it is formed between the pore loop and S5, whereas Figure 8A/B shows it between the pore helix and S6. Is this a typo?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ suggestion, and have removed metadynamics calculations in the revised manuscript. We also corrrected the description of site BM(A) as ‘BM<sub>A</sub> mode shows that dyclonine makes contacts with the cavity formed by the pore loop and S6-helix of TRPV3’ on P17, from line 20.</p></body></sub-article></article>
