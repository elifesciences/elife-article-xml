Unfortunately, the clinical benefits are often countered by a rapid tumor adaptive response. Here, we report that the oncoprotein B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a core component that confers solid tumor adaptive resistance to genotoxic stress. Multiple genotoxic agents promoted <italic>BCL6</italic> transactivation, which was positively correlated with a weakened therapeutic efficacy and a worse clinical outcome. Mechanistically, we discovered that treatment with the genotoxic agent etoposide led to the transcriptional reprogramming of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, among which the interferon-α and interferon-γ responses were substantially enriched in resistant cells. Our results further revealed that the activation of interferon/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 axis directly upregulated BCL6 expression. The increased expression of BCL6 further repressed the tumor suppressor PTEN and consequently enabled resistant cancer cell survival. Accordingly, targeted inhibition of BCL6 remarkably enhanced etoposide-triggered DNA damage and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of BCL6 signaling in conquering solid tumor tolerance to genotoxic stress, further establishing a rationale for a combined approach with genotoxic agents and BCL6-targeted therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genotoxic agents</kwd><kwd>adaptive resistance</kwd><kwd>BCL6</kwd><kwd>interferon responses</kwd><kwd>combination chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82073073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82060663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82122045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81874207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jointed PI Program from Shanghai Changning Maternity and Infant Health Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11300-412311-20033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Chengbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MOE Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis &amp; Protection (Zhejiang University)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ECNU Construction Fund of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>44400-20201-532300/021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ECNU Multifunctional Platform for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Xiufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oncoprotein BCL6 confers tumor adaptive resistance to genotoxic stress through the IFN-BCL6-PTEN axis in solid tumors and presents a promising combinational target for chemo-sensitization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome instability is the major hallmark of chronic proliferating tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanahan, 2022</xref>). Conventional genotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. topoisomerase II inhibitors, cisplatin, and carboplatin) that introduce DNA damage lesions, devastate genomic integrity and activate pro-apoptotic pathways, are employed as the standard first-line treatment for a wide array of solid malignancies. Despite initial therapeutic success, intrinsic resistance or rapid adaptive resistance in cancer cells is a major hurdle, hampering the clinical efficacy of these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stebbing et al., 2018</xref>). Chemoresistance occurs due to complex reasons, such as an increased DNA damage repair capacity, activation of pro-survival pathways, and defects in caspase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). While several signaling effectors have been identified as predictive markers, such as <italic>ABCA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koh et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>MAST1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2018</xref>), in tumor tolerance to genotoxic agents, the majority of these studies lacked either an evaluation of the clinical correlation or an explanation for how these effectors mediate pro-survival signals in the context of genotoxic stress.</p><p>The transcriptional repressor BCL6 has emerged as a critical therapeutic target in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parekh et al., 2008</xref>). Increasing evidences indicate that BCL6 plays an oncogenic role in several human hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardenas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawabata et al., 2021</xref>). BCL6 binds and represses different target genes to drive tumorigenesis in a cell context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ci et al., 2009</xref>). The constitutive expression of BCL6 sustains the lymphoma phenotype and promotes glioblastoma through transcriptional repression of the DNA damage sensor <italic>ATR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranuncolo et al., 2007</xref>) and the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. According to data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the <italic>BCL6</italic> locus is also predominantly amplified in primary breast cancer and is correlated with a worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). In recent years, small molecular inhibitors that target the interaction between BCL6 and its co-repressors or that trigger BCL6 degradation effectively restored BCL6 target gene expression and impeded tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardenas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Słabicki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The properties of BCL6 as a therapeutic target originate from its normal function in sustaining the proliferative and the phenotype of stress-tolerant germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phan et al., 2007</xref>). BCL6 allows B cells to evade ATR-mediated checkpoints and tolerate exogenous DNA damage by repressing the cell cycle checkpoint genes <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN1B</italic>, and <italic>CDKN2B</italic>, and the DNA damage sensing genes <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>CHEK1</italic>, and <italic>ATR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardenas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phan et al., 2005</xref>). When genotoxic stress is accumulated to some extent, BCL6 is phosphorylated by the DNA damage sensor ATM kinase and degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome system, whereby the germinal center reaction is terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phan et al., 2007</xref>). The critical functions exerted by BCL6 during normal B cell development could be hijacked by malignant transformation, thereby leading to lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2012</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that BCL6 is involved in stress tolerance and drug responses. In more detail, BCL6 can be activated by heat shock factor 1 to tolerate heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernando et al., 2019</xref>). The aberrant expression of BCL6 can be provoked in leukemia cells in response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duy et al., 2011</xref>). Our recent work additionally revealed that an increased expression of BCL6 largely contributes to the resistance of <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant lung cancer to clinical BET inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role and underlying mechanisms of BCL6 in chemo-sensitization of solid tumors remain elusive. Given the fact that BCL6 plays an emerging role in DNA damage tolerance and drug responses, we hypothesized that BCL6 might drive resistance to genotoxic agents in solid tumors.</p><p>Here, we report that the proto-oncogene BCL6 is a central component of the resistance pathway in tumor response to genotoxic agents. We observed a striking association between the activation of pro-inflammatory signals and BCL6 induction in chemoresistant cancer cells. The tumor suppressor PTEN is further characterized as a functional target gene of BCL6. Importantly, addition of BCL6-targeted therapy to the genotoxic agent etoposide markedly restored the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our findings establish a rationale for targeting BCL6 to conquer chemoresistance in solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genotoxic agents promote <italic>BCL6</italic> transcription</title><p>While genotoxic agents have become the mainstay of clinical cancer treatments, many patients show a poor response to these drugs due to the emergence of a tumor rapid adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rottenberg et al., 2021</xref>). To gain a comprehensive understanding of chemoresistance mechanisms, we initially measured the half inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>s) of etoposide and doxorubicin, two well-validated topoisomerase II inhibitors for clinical use, in a panel of 22 cancer cell lines derived from four types of solid tumors, including lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and ovarian carcinomas.

Here, we show that BCL6 upregulation is a prominent mechanism to protect tumor cells from genotoxic killing. Our current findings support the notion that BCL6 functions as a central factor in mediating chemoresistance: (1) the interferon/STAT1 pathway serves as an upstream regulator of BCL6, (2) the tumor suppressor PTEN is identified as a functional target of BCL6, (3) the activation of BCL6 signaling leads to a sustained pro-survival phenotype, whereas blocking it enhances the therapeutic efficacy of genotoxic agents. Our findings establish a rationale for the concurrent targeting of BCL6 to conquer tumor tolerance to genotoxic stress, as evidenced by the striking synergy of genotoxic therapy and BCL6-targeted therapy in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>BCL6 acts as a gatekeeper to protect germinal center B cells from undergoing somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination against DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2008</xref>). We showed that BCL6 was markedly upregulated by genotoxic agents in both in vitro and in vivo settings, leading to a resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, high BCL6 levels were positively associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Our results were conceptually in line with recent findings showing that BCL6 enabled tumor cell tolerance to cytotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernando et al., 2019</xref>) and conferred tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in Ph<sup>+</sup> acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duy et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we discovered that solid tumors respond to genotoxic killing through an alternative mechanism that has not been characterized previously. We found that chemotherapy-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of pro-inflammatory cytokines transactivated the STAT1-BCL6-PTEN axis, therefore protecting solid tumors from cell death. As reported in our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2021</xref>), BCL6 activation attenuated the antitumor efficacy of clinical BET inhibitors in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant lung cancer. Our current work, along with the recently published studies, suggest a crucial role of BCL6 in rendering tumor cells more tolerant to treatments and a model in which multiple factors may contribute to BCL6 upregulation and BCL6-mediated signaling during this process. Moreover, we speculate that BCL6 may functionally program tumor pro-survival signals in drug response and can be used as a predictive biomarker for therapy resistance. As an essential transcription repressor, BCL6 suppresses rapid proliferation and survival of germinal center B cells by recruiting co-repressors, such as BCOR, NCOR, and SMRT, to its BTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Therapy targeting the BCL6 BTB domain lateral groove displayed inhibitory effects in the treatment of lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>).

Aberrant genomic or expressional changes of BCL6 have been detected in lymphomas and multiple solid tumors, including breast cancer, glioblastoma or ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). It has been reported that the transcriptional factor STAT5 serves as a direct negative regulator of BCL6 in lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 2007</xref>), and FoxO3a promoted BCL6 expression in leukemia cells exposed to BCR-ABL inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández de Mattos et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the transcriptional regulation pattern of BCL6 in solid tumors remains largely unknown. Our findings demonstrated that the genotoxic agent etoposide activated the interferon/STAT1 signaling axis, which directly upregulated BCL6 by recruiting STAT1 to the binding regions of the <italic>BCL6</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The regulatory mechanism that BCL6 could be transactivated by STAT1 was also observed in imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madapura et al., 2017</xref>) and contributed to CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper cell T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakayamada et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While numerous cell-intrinsic processes are known to play critical roles in tumor response to genotoxic agents, increasing attention has been paid to multiple cell-extrinsic components of the tumor microenvironment that influence the malignant phenotype and disease progression. During DNA damage, the production of cellular mitogenic growth factors and proteases, such as HGF, EGF, and MMP, are programmed to facilitate tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bavik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to these pro-survival molecules, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL6) provoked by chemotherapy, will promote anti-apoptotic signaling and intrinsic chemo-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert and Hemann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poth et al., 2010</xref>). The efficacy of chemotherapeutics is also linked to their ability to stimulate a type I interferon response through Toll-like receptor 3, an intracellular immune receptor that is involved in sensing viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sistigu et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we showed that, in response to genotoxic stress, etoposide-resistant cells rapidly increased IFN-α and IFN-γ production, and more importantly, the increase in IFNs was sufficient to protect cells from genotoxic killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings support the essential role of IFNs in the tumor microenvironment of conferring drug resistance, along with the fact that the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature acts as a predictive marker for chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weichselbaum et al., 2008</xref>). Our results further delineate a mechanism by which increased production of IFN-α or IFN-γ facilitated cancer cells to evade genotoxic stress by activating the transcriptional factor STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although genotoxic therapy-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment promotes treatment resistance through cell nonautonomous effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), whether targeting the biologically notable upregulation of IFNs in conjunction with conventional therapy could enhance the treatment response requires additional experimentation.</p><p>The BCL6 transcriptional program for the direct silencing of multiple target genes has been elaborated in primary B cells and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ci et al., 2009</xref>). However, few target genes of BCL6 have been characterized in solid tumors. PTEN was reported to be enriched in <italic>BCL6</italic> promoter binding peaks of primary germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ci et al., 2009</xref>), and BCL6 bound to the promoter locus of <italic>PTEN</italic> in lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng et al., 2015</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the role of this regulatory circuit in tumor cell adapation to genotoxic stress and tumor survival is still unclear so far. Given that BCL6 is dynamically regulated in a tumor context-dependent manner, we thus extensively characterized the biological role of PTEN in BCL6-mediated drug tolerance. Our study identified PTEN as a functional target of BCL6 in therapy resistance. We showed that the overexpression of BCL6 suppressed PTEN, while the knockdown of <italic>BCL6</italic> increased the expression of PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, PTEN overexpression increased the sensitivity of etoposide-resistant cells to etoposide, and in contrast, <italic>PTEN</italic> deficiency decreased the cytotoxicity elicited by etoposide in etoposide-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). Our findings strengthened the connection between BCL6 and PTEN that might commonly occur in germinal center B cells and tumor cells. Moreover, the combination of BCL6 inhibitors and genotoxic agents resulted in a marked suppression of the PTEN downstream component mTOR in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), reinforcing that mTOR activation is an actionable mechanism that confers drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). When acting as a transcriptional repressor, the BCL6 BTB domain recruits the co-repressors NCOR, SMRT, and BCOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghetu et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism by which BCL6 mediated the repression of PTEN and whether this action is dependent on the BCL6 BTB domain requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>H1975 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1511">CVCL_1511</ext-link>), PC9 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_B260">CVCL_B260</ext-link>), H661 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1577">CVCL_1577</ext-link>), H522 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1567">CVCL_1567</ext-link>), HCC827 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2063">CVCL_2063</ext-link>), H838 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1594">CVCL_1594</ext-link>), DLD-1 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0248">CVCL_0248</ext-link>), HT-29 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0320">CVCL_0320</ext-link>), HCT-8 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2478">CVCL_2478</ext-link>), HCT116 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link>), LoVo (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0399">CVCL_0399</ext-link>), AsPC-1 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0152">CVCL_0152</ext-link>), BxPC-3 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0186">CVCL_0186</ext-link>), Capan-2 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0026">CVCL_0026</ext-link>), PANC28 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_3917">CVCL_3917</ext-link>), ES-2 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_3509">CVCL_3509</ext-link>), OVCAR8 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1629">CVCL_1629</ext-link>), OVCA420 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_3935">CVCL_3935</ext-link>), HEY (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2Z96">CVCL_2Z96</ext-link>), and HEYA8 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_8878">CVCL_8878</ext-link>) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Correspondingly, specific BCL6 inhibitors suppress their growth in vitro and in vivo. We and others also demonstrated that BCL6 upregulation confers resistance of clinical targeted therapies in either hematological malignancies or solid tumors (Nature. 2011 May 19;473(7347):384-8; J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1):e133090). However, the research regarding to the role and mechanism of BCL6 in chemo-sensitization is quite limited. BCL6 was reported to evolve in vertebrates as a component of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-driven stress response in 2019 (Cancer Discov. 2019 May;9(5):662-679). This study revealed that the HSF1-BCL6-TOX axis is evolutionarily conserved and necessary for cancer cells to tolerate cytotoxic stress by enhancing DNA repair capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work is currently the only one that report a responsive role of BCL6 in chemosensitivity of solid tumors. In our study, we discovered that solid tumor cells respond to genotoxic killing through an alternative mechanism that has not been characterized previously. We found that chemotherapy-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of pro-inflammatory cytokines transactivated the STAT1-BCL6-PTEN axis in solid tumors, protecting them from cell death. Our work, along with the recently published studies, suggest a crucial role of BCL6 in rendering tumor cells more tolerant to treatments and a model in which multiple factors may contribute to BCL6 upregulation and BCL6-mediated signaling during this process.</p><p>We have added these statements in the Discussion section of our revised manuscript (Page 19, Line 22; Page 20, Line 1-9). The changes are marked in red.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. After searching for related papers regarding the role of BCL6 in oncogenesis, though mostly reported in hematogenous malignancies, the upstream STAT1 and the downstream PTEN have both been explored and discussed, and BCL6 contributing to drug-resistance has also been mentioned, please address the innovative points in Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments.</p><p>The variation in BCL6 repressive complex formation and association with different transcriptional factors are indicative of the complexity of BCL6 transcriptional programming (Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5536-48). STAT1 has been reported to directly induce BCL6 expression, which contributed to CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper cell T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation and autoimmunity (J Immunol. 2014 Mar 1;192(5):2156-66). Nevertheless, whether this regulatory action occurs in solid tumor remain elusive. In addition, PTEN was reported to be enriched in BCL6 promoter binding peaks in primary germinal center B cells (Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5536-48), and BCL6 bound to the promoter locus of PTEN in lymphoblastic leukemia (Cancer Cell. 2015 Mar 9;27(3):409-25). The role of this regulatory circuit in tumor cell adaptation to genotoxic stress and survival is still unclear so far. Given that BCL6 is dynamically regulated by a unique mechanism in a cell type-dependent manner, we thus extensively characterized the biological role and regulation machinery of BCL6 in chemoresistance of solid tumors. Our study identified the IFN-BCL6-PTEN axis as an antagonism target for overcoming chemoresistance.</p><p>As suggested, we have added novelty statements and discussion in the Discussion section of our revised manuscript (Page 22, Line 20-22; Page 23, Line 1-11). The changes are marked in red.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, it is very hard for us to get paired tumor samples before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We are sorry that we can’t provide relevant data at current stage.</p><p>In our manuscript, we analyzed published clinical datasets and showed that a high expression of BCL6 was associated with a poor progression-free survival in patients who received chemotherapy (Figure 1G). This result supported the clinical relevance of BCL6 and chemotherapy to some extent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Page 10 Line 3 the in vivo model was established with only one cell line, please include at least two cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this helpful suggestion.</p><p>Following to the suggestion, we additionally set up a tumor xenograft mouse model using PANC28 cells that are more resistant of etoposide treatment than HCT116 cells. Our new data consistently showed that the BCL6 abundance in the xenografts was apparently increased by etoposide treatment. Combing the results from the HCT116 xenograft model that were already shown in our previous manuscript, we clearly demonstrated that etoposide treatment induced BCL6 expression in vivo.</p><p>We have supplemented our new data in Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Page 10 Line 6, are there any more significant reference to support examining level of phosphorylated H2AX to reflect extent of drug-resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate this insightful question.</p><p>We are sorry for the misleading and inappropriate descriptions in our previous manuscript. We intended to use the expression of γH2AX, a well-known DNA damage marker, to indicate cytotoxic responses elicited by chemotherapy. We observed a decreased γH2AX expression in xenografts after etoposide treatment, implying a potentially decreased efficacy of chemotherapy, rather than the emergence of drug resistance as we described previously. Considering that the γH2AX data was not required for Figure 2D, we have removed it in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We previously tested the two reported BCL6 inhibitors, FX1 and compound 7, and found that they both could apparently sensitize etoposide in mice, as indicated by the tumor volume curve, tumor weight graph and xenograft image below. However, considering that compound 7, targeting BCL6 with the same inhibitory mechanism as FX1, currently in a quite early stage of development and exhibited toxicity in mice, we did not show compound 7 results in the manuscript.</p><p>Thus, we could not provide requested xenograft photos of Figure 7D along with the plot in our revised manuscript, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> with FX1 and compound 7 groups together could not be cut and separated.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69255-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
