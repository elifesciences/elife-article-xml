Sustained SASP contributes to a pattern of chronic inflammation associated with aging and implicated in many age-related diseases. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the immunomodulatory cytokine BAFF (B-cell activating factor; encoded by the <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> gene), a SASP protein, in multiple senescence models. We first characterized BAFF production across different senescence paradigms, including senescent human diploid fibroblasts (WI-38, IMR-90) and monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), and tissues of mice induced to undergo senescence. We then identified IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) as a transcription factor required for promoting <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA transcription in senescence. We discovered that suppressing BAFF production decreased the senescent phenotype of both fibroblasts and monocyte-like cells, reducing IL6 secretion and SA-β-Gal staining. Importantly, however, the influence of BAFF on the senescence program was cell type-specific: in monocytes, BAFF promoted the early activation of NF-κB and general SASP secretion, while in fibroblasts, BAFF contributed to the production and function of TP53 (p53). We propose that BAFF is elevated across senescence models and is a potential target for senotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BAFF</kwd><kwd>SASP</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>paracrine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-AG00511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The levels of the cytokine BAFF increase across senescence paradigms, in turn triggering a secretory phenotype in some senescent cells and activating p53 in other senescent cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular senescence is a state of indefinite cell cycle arrest arising in response to a variety of stressful stimuli, including telomere erosion, oncogenic signaling, and damage to DNA and other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayflick, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>). Despite experiencing persistent growth arrest, senescent cells remain metabolically active and express and secrete distinct subsets of proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteases, and growth factors, a trait collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The sustained production of SASP factors in tissues and organs promotes the recruitment of immune cells, tissue remodeling, and chronic inflammation at the systemic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franceschi and Campisi, 2014</xref>). Senescent cells are necessary for developmental processes like embryonic morphogenesis and wound healing, and have tumor-suppressive properties in young individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>). However, with advancing age, the accumulation of senescent cells exacerbates age-related pathologies like cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franceschi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McHugh and Gil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the recognized impact of senescent cells, the unequivocal detection of senescent cells remains a challenge. Several markers of senescence have been described in cultured cells as well as in tissues and organs, but they are not universal markers of all senescent cells, and they are often not exclusive of senescent cells, as non-senescent cells may express them as well. Therefore, multiple markers must be present in order to identify a cell as senescent. Classic markers of senescence include cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. the cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK] inhibitor proteins p16 [CDKN2A] and p21 [CDKN1A]), the presence of nuclear foci of unresolved DNA damage (often visualized by the presence of a phosphorylated histone, γ-H2AX), and increased activity of a senescence-associated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) that functions at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorgoulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Idda et al., 2020</xref>). Our recent screen identified the <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> (<italic>Tumor Necrosis Factor Superfamily Member 13B</italic>) mRNA, encoding the cytokine BAFF (B cell-activating factor), as an RNA marker shared across a number of senescent cell types and inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casella et al., 2019</xref>). BAFF is produced as a membrane-bound or secreted cytokine that plays an essential role in the homeostasis of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalled, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mackay and Schneider, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smulski and Eibel, 2018</xref>). However, BAFF also plays a key role in sustaining the inflammatory processes associated with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Idda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalled, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steri et al., 2017</xref>). The pro-inflammatory role of BAFF is primarily elicited by the activation of three receptors (BAFFR [TNFRSF13C], TACI [TNFRSF13B], and BCMA [TNFRSF17]), which converge on paths that signal through the transcription factor NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bossen and Schneider, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eslami and Schneider, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicoletti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smulski and Eibel, 2018</xref>). In turn, NF-κB transcriptionally activates the production of many pro-inflammatory and adhesion factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of BAFF in cell senescence is unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigated the expression and function of BAFF in senescence. We present evidence that BAFF is elevated in models of cell senescence in mice and cultured human cells. In response to a range of inducers, the levels of <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA and total cellular BAFF were increased, as were the levels of secreted BAFF in the culture media of senescent cells and in the blood of mice following doxorubicin-induced senescence. Mechanistically, the transcription factor IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) was found to increase <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA levels in senescent cells via activated transcription. In the presence of secreted BAFF, the human monocytic leukemia-derived, p53-deficient cell line THP-1 activated NF-κB, which in turn transcriptionally induced the production of SASP factors, while p53-proficient human senescent fibroblasts activated a p53-dependent gene expression program. Interestingly, in senescent p53-proficient mouse macrophage/monocyte-like RAW 264.7 cells, BAFF promoted both p53 phosphorylation and SASP. Our data indicate that BAFF promotes senescence in a pleiotropic manner, enhancing the SASP in some cell types and p53-mediated growth arrest in others.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BAFF increases in cultured senescent cells and in a senescent mouse model</title><p>Our previous analysis of multiple models of senescence, including human primary fibroblasts (WI-38, IMR-90), umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), revealed a unique senescence transcriptome signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casella et al., 2019</xref>), including heightened production of the <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA, encoding the cytokine BAFF, a SASP factor. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casella et al., 2019</xref>) indicated that the levels of <italic>TNFSF13B/BAFF</italic> mRNA were elevated across all the senescence models tested previously. These models included WI-38 fibroblasts that were proliferating at population doubling level (PDL) 25 and then rendered replicatively senescent (RS) by division until exhaustion (~PDL55), exposed to ionizing radiation (IR at 10 Gy, evaluated 10 days later), infected for 18 hr with a lentivirus that triggered oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) by expression of HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and evaluated 8 days later, or treated with doxorubicin (DOX) for 24 hr and evaluated 7 days later. Additional models tested included proliferating IMR-90 fibroblasts (PDL25) rendered RS by culture to ~PDL55 or senescent by exposure to IR (10 Gy, assessed 10 days later), and HUVECs and HAECs which were either proliferating or rendered senescent by exposure to IR (4 Gy, evaluated 10 days later) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Given that BAFF is mainly expressed by myeloid cells like monocytes and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sakai and Akkoyunlu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steri et al., 2017</xref>), we extended the analysis of BAFF expression in senescence using the human monocytic leukemia-derived cell line THP-1. First, we induced senescence in THP-1 cells by treatment with 5 Gy IR, a dose selected because it suppressed cell growth but did not reduce cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Six days after exposure to IR, the rate of proliferation declined, SPiDER-β-Gal staining was elevated, and the proportion of G2/M cells increased modestly relative to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we selected 10 nM DOX treatment for 48 hr, followed by 4 additional days in DOX-free media, as a treatment dose that induced senescence in THP-1 cells without reducing viability (not shown). As additional models of senescence, we included primary WI-38 fibroblasts rendered senescent by exposure to IR or to HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> (OIS) as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). In these treatment groups, we first found markedly increased senescence-associated (SA)-β-Gal levels in all four senescence groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

THP-1 cell fractionation followed by analysis of changes in their subcellular distribution during senescence revealed elevated nuclear localization of IRF1, but not IRF2, in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that IRF1 might be primarily implicated in the transcription of <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA.

We thus analyzed the DNA-binding activity of multiple NF-κB subunits in senescent THP-1 cells upon BAFF silencing (Materials and methods). IR increased the DNA-binding activity of p65, p50, and p52 in control cells, but not the activities of RelB or c-Rel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the activity of p65 and p50, representing the canonical pathway of NF-κB, was strongly reduced after silencing BAFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To assess the changes in p65/RelA activity by other methods, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from proliferating and senescent THP-1 cells expressing either normal levels of BAFF or reduced BAFF levels by silencing using siRNAs. Interestingly, in proliferating THP-1 cells, silencing BAFF did not change the nuclear abundance of p65, while in senescent THP-1 cells, silencing BAFF significantly reduced the levels of nuclear p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Tubulin and PARP1 were used as markers for proper cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation, respectively, and Ponceau S was used to stain the membrane to assess total loaded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These findings suggest a role for BAFF in the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation in senescent THP-1 cells.</p><p>A crucial step in the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation is the degradation of the inhibitory IκB proteins, which precedes NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Israël, 2010</xref>). Thus, to further study the role of BAFF on the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, we analyzed the pattern of IκBα degradation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, IκBα levels declined rapidly after treatment with IR in control cells, but not in cells in which BAFF was silenced, further supporting a role for BAFF in modulating NF-κB activity.</p><p>BAFF was previously shown to activate the canonical NF-κB pathway in monocytes after LPS treatment by affecting p65 acetylation, which is required for DNA binding and full transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardam and Brink, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). Western blot analysis of p65 acetylation relative to total p65 in irradiated THP-1 cells showed a transient peak in p65 acetylation at ~6 hr after irradiation in control cells, and a delayed peak at ~24–48 hr followed by persistently elevated p65 acetylation in BAFF-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Similarly, p65 phosphorylation also showed a delayed peak in BAFFsi cells, reaching a maximum at ~24 hr after irradiation in control cells, and at ~48–72 hr in BAFFsi cells. In sum, the influence of BAFF on IκBα degradation, p65 nuclear accumulation and p65 modifications may affect the DNA-binding activity and transcriptional program of NF-κB. Other NF-κB subunits (p50 and p52) changed only modestly as a function of BAFF abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Although they may also influence NF-κB activity overall, our results point to a major role of BAFF in the regulation of p65 function.</p><p>Finally, to study the impact of BAFF on NF-κB activation in THP-1 cells, we overexpressed BAFF by co-transfecting pBAFF (or the control empty vector pCTRL) with one of three plasmids: a control plasmid driving negligible expression of GFP from a minimal promoter (pMin-GFP), a plasmid driving constitutive expression of GFP from the strong, constitutively active promoter CMV (pCMV-GFP), and a plasmid driving GFP expression from an NF-κB-inducible reporter (pNF-κB-GFP; Cignal Reporter Assay, Qiagen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When compared with pCTRL, ectopic overexpression of BAFF after transfecting pBAFF increased GFP production from pNF-κB-GFP, but did not increase GFP production from pMin-GFP or pCMV-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To assess more broadly other pathways, kinases, and TFs that might be regulated by BAFF in senescent monocytes, we examined the results of phospho-protein array analysis. Interestingly, BAFF silencing in THP-1 cells reduced STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), in agreement with the EnrichR prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and with the role of STAT3 in SASP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kojima et al., 2013</xref>). We also observed a reduction in the active forms of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), previously implicated in the induction of inflammatory responses in monocytes in response to tissue damage and activation of Toll-like receptor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that BAFF contributes to the activation of proinflammatory pathways in senescent monocytes, at least in part by activating p65/NF-κB and possibly other signaling pathways including STAT3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Transcriptomic analysis in fibroblasts reveals alternative roles for BAFF in senescence</title><p>To gain a more complete understanding of the role of BAFF in senescence, we investigated its function in primary fibroblasts, which are well-established models for senescence and, unlike THP-1 cells, express the senescence-relevant protein p53.

We detected for the first time the presence of BAFF receptors in WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), although they were mainly localized intracellularly, rather than on the cell surface, as shown by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and confirmed by flow cytometry (not shown); a similar intracellular presence of BAFF receptors was reported in other cell types and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrakopoulos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Carmona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatzoglou et al., 2000</xref>).

Despite their persistent growth arrest, senescent cells remain metabolically active and release a variety of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and metalloproteinases—a trait collectively known as the SASP. The negative consequences of accumulating senescent cells in tissues are mainly linked to the production of these molecules that promote a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, which in turn activates an immune response and triggers tissue remodeling with loss of normal tissue architecture. Accordingly, senescent cells are believed to participate in the persistent inflammation that develops with age (‘inflammaging’) and is associated with age-related pathologies like cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and dysfunctions of lung, liver, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franceschi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McHugh and Gil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite a heightened interest in cell senescence, the development of translational approaches to identify and clear senescent cells has been hindered by an incomplete understanding of the molecular markers of senescent cells, including those that are universally present in all senescent cells and those that define specific senescent cell subgroups.

We found it elevated not only in cultured cell models but also in a model of senescence in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Besides its role in the homeostasis of the immune system, BAFF was also implicated in autoimmune diseases like lupus and multiple sclerosis, in part associated with its pro-inflammatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moisini and Davidson, 2009</xref>).

THP-1 cells expressed all three BAFF receptors (BCMA, TACI, and BAFFR), and downstream signaling pathways culminated with the activation of the NF-κB component p65/RelA after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The activation of this pathway could explain, at least in part, the reduction of SASP factor production after silencing BAFF in THP-1 cells. Interestingly, however, in senescent fibroblasts, BAFF did not have a strong impact on SASP factor biosynthesis, except for IL6 production; instead, BAFF appeared to modulate the levels and activity of the senescence-associated TF p53 (which is not expressed in THP-1 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It will also be important to study the specific contribution of membrane-bound BAFF relative to secreted BAFF in the implementation of the SASP and other senescence traits. Our preliminary data in THP-1 cells using recombinant BAFF suggest that membrane-bound BAFF has a predominant role over soluble BAFF, as we observed only a minor effect of the recombinant BAFF on the induction of SASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), although further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, however, BAFF-neutralizing agents strongly induced a pro-inflammatory response in THP-1 cells (not shown), supporting a possible reverse signaling triggered by molecules that interact with the membrane-bound BAFF (‘out-to-in’ signaling). However, reverse signaling for BAFF remains a point of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nys et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and further studies are necessary to confirm these possibilities in senescent cells.</p><p>The strategies adopted to eliminate senescent cells or reduce their negative effects include use of senotherapeutic compounds, some of which have entered clinical trials. Senolytic drugs preferentially induce the death of senescent cells over non-senescent cells, while senomorphic compounds modulate the senescent phenotype and SASP production without eliminating senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niedernhofer and Robbins, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Given that BAFF is a SASP factor and plays a key role in modulating senescence-associated phenotypes like the SASP, BAFF could be exploited as a potential target of senomorphic therapy or perhaps even as a marker of the efficacy of senomorphic interventions, not only in laboratory settings in culture, but also in animal models and possibly in human trials. The heterogeneous responses observed between monocytes in fibroblasts underscore the importance of studying the role of BAFF in paradigms of senescence involving other cell types (epithelial cells, myoblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, glial cells, etc.) and different senescence inducers. Specifically, since B lymphocytes have been established as a main target cell for BAFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mackay and Browning, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiemann et al., 2001</xref>), it will be critical to study the role of BAFF in senescent B cells and age-related immunosenescence.

RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC, TIB-71; karyotype was not specified) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. RAW 264.7 cells were established from an ascites of a tumor induced in a male mouse by intraperitoneal injection of Abelson Leukaemia Virus (A-MuLV). All cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and tested negative for mycoplasma. Senescence was induced by exposure to different doses of ionizing radiation (IR) (5 Gy for THP-1 cells and RAW 264.7 cells; 10 Gy for WI-38 and hVSMCs) followed by incubation for the times indicated in text and figure legends. Etoposide (ETO)-induced senescence was achieved by treating IMR-90 cells with 50 μM ETO for 72 hr, followed by culture in fresh media for 7 days (10 days since adding ETO). Replicative senescence of WI-38 fibroblasts was achieved by passaging proliferating cells [typically at population doubling level (PDL) of 20–24] until they stopped proliferating (typically PDL &gt;50). Doxorubicin-induced senescence was triggered by treating cells with a single dose of doxorubicin (DOX; 250 nM for WI-38 cells, 10 nM for THP-1 cells) and culturing for the numbers of days specified in each case. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) was induced by transducing the cells for 18 hr with a lentiviral vector that expressed RasG12V; lentiviral vectors (control and RasG12V) were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2018</xref>). The inhibitors of the interferon pathway Ruxolitinib (Ruxo, used at 1 μM), MRT67307 (MRT67, used at 5 μM), and BX-795 (used at 5 μM) were from InvivoGen. XTT assay and BrdU proliferation assays cells were performed in 96-well plates with specific kits, following the manufacturers’ instructions (XTT Assay Kit, Abcam, ab232856; BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, CST, #6813).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transfection and nucleofection</title><p>Silencing interventions in all the cells analyzed were performed by transfecting 50 nM of siRNAs using Lipofectamine (RNAiMax, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-targeting siRNA pool was purchased from Horizon Discovery (cat. D-001206-14-20). For BAFF silencing in human cells, we first validated two individual siRNAs, BAFFsi #1 (BAFFsi D-017586-01-0005) and BAFFsi #2 (BAFFsi D-017586-03-0005); where indicated, the two siRNAs were used as a pool (referred to as BAFFsi). For BAFF silencing in murine RAW 264.7 cells, we used a SMARTpool consisting of 4 siRNAs (Horizon Discovery, cat. M-046829-00-0010); siRNAs (cat. D-001206-14-20) served as a non-targeting control. For IRF1 silencing, we used two different pools of control and IRF1 siRNAs. Pools #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (IRF1 siRNA, cat. sc-35706, and control siRNA, cat. sc-37007) and pools #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) were from Horizon Discovery (IRF1 siRNA, cat. M-011704-01-0005, and control siRNA, cat. D-001206-14-20). To silence BAFF receptors, we used Horizon Discovery SMARTpools (M-008095-00-0005, M-013424-00-0005, M-011217-02-0005).</p><p>THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cells were transfected at a density of 3×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml; 18 hr later they were treated with IR (5 Gy) in PBS, given fresh medium, and returned to the incubator. WI-38 cells were transfected at a density of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well of a six-well plate; 18 hr later, they were treated with 10 Gy IR in PBS, given fresh medium, and returned to the incubator. IMR-90 cells were transfected at a density of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well; 18 hr later, they were treated with 50 μM etoposide (ETO) for an additional 72 hr, followed by culture for 7 days (10 days total since adding ETO). The plasmid vector for BAFF (pBAFF) was from GenScript (OHu22261) and pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid was used as empty vector (pCTRL). BAFF overexpression in THP-1 cells was achieved by nucleofection (Nucleofector kit V, Lonza, program V-001) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each reaction, we added 0.5 μg of plasmid to 10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 cells; 18 hr later, cells were treated with 5 Gy IR in PBS, given fresh media, returned to the incubator, and analyzed at the times specified in the figure legends. To co-transfect overexpression plasmids and NF-κB reporters, we used lipofectamine LTX with PLUS reagent (A12621), following the manufacturer’s instructions. GFP reporter plasmids for NF-κB (pNF-κB-GFP) and specific controls (minimal promoter plasmid pMin-GFP and constitutively active promoter plasmid pCMV-GFP) were from Qiagen (Cignal Reporter Assay Kit, ID: 336841); 72 hr after transfection, GFP signal was measured following the manufacturer instructions (Ex. 505 Em. 515) with a Glomax reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA isolation, RT-qPCR analysis, and RNA-sequencing</title><p>RNA was isolated using phenol-chloroform according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TriPure Isolation Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich).

immunomodulatory cytokine BAFF (B-cell activating factor) in the context of cellular senescence. They present solid evidence that BAFF is upregulated in response to senescence, and that this upregulation is partially driven by the immune response-regulating transcription factor (TF) IRF1, with potential cell type-specific effects during senescence. Ultimately, these results strongly suggest that BAFF plays a senomorphic role in senescence, modulating downstream senescence-associated phenotypes, and may be an interesting candidate for senomorphic therapy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84238.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Benayoun</surname><given-names>Bérénice A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.25.513730">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.25.513730v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers discussed the manuscript, and believe the study is interesting but has some concerns of a technical and methodological nature that they believe need to be addressed. Specifically:</p><p>1. Some specificity and technical controls are currently missing:</p><p>– Technical controls: validating siRNA specificity/efficiency by Western, antibody specificity, consistency between panels.</p><p>– Biological control: changes in aging tissues, specificity to senescence vs. quiescence, degree of senescence induction, cell type specificity vs. primary/cancer specificity (i.e. also include primary monocytes).</p><p>2. There also are some methodological issues to be cleared up to ensure data robustness.</p><p>– See comments on issues with the RNAseq analysis pipeline as currently implemented</p><p>– See comments on the need to use at least 2 independent siRNA to exclude that observed phenotypes may be due to off-target effects.</p><p>– See comments on the need to use 2-3 RT-qPCR normalizing amplicons to avoid noise due to housekeeping genes not being constant across conditions</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The model proposed by the authors, as currently illustrated in Figure 7, is too general to be supported by the data. While this reviewer agrees that the contributions of BAFF to senescence responses are likely to be cell-type specific, it is unclear that p53 and NF-κB actually play differential roles in senescent fibroblasts and senescent monocytes. For the series of monocyte experiments, cancerous THP-1 cells were used which, as stated by the authors, harbor mutations in p53 that prevent its expression. Thus, it is unclear whether the p53 response is specific to fibroblasts, or whether the lack of a p53 response is an artifact/feature of this specific cancer monocytic cell line. That is, it is still within the realm of possibility that the p53 response may be influenced by BAFF in non-cancerous, senescent monocytes with intact p53. This remains an open question. Since the authors have access to mice based on some of the analyses, a relatively easy source of monocytes with intact p53 can be from bone marrow, which would help strengthen the point they make on the impact of NF-κB. The model, and its discussion, should be revised to take this caveat into account (or additional experiments in WT/primary cells should be added).</p><p>2. Currently, RT-qPCR data is normalized to a single reference gene (ACTB or GAPDH), e.g. in Figure 1G. However, results using a single reference gene are often unstable, since no gene is truly ever impacted by outside stimuli. It is considered a best practice to include multiple reference genes when conducting this type of analysis [PMID: 19246619], for instance using the geometric mean of the Cts of 3+ normalizing amplicons. Although control using 18s rRNA is mentioned in Figure legend, it does not seem like it was used to perform normalization of the RT-qPCR results shown in Figure 1G.</p><p>2.1. Importantly, the cytoskeleton is known to be broadly impacted by senescence [PMID: 15742196], which makes ACTB a poor choice for a normalizing amplicon. Consistent with using ACTB as the single &quot;housekeeping&quot; gene being an issue, ACTB protein levels are highly variable in the spleens of Dox-treated mice in Figure 1H, suggesting that mRNA levels may also be highly variable. Thus, presented RT-qPCR data should be revised or re-run accordingly using a panel of normalizing amplicons (unless RNA-seq has been performed for the same/similar samples and the RNA-seq results can be shown as well for discussed genes, as RNA-seq normalization bypasses housekeeping gene-related issues).</p><p>2.2. In addition, if different normalizing amplicons are used for different panels, please make sure to note which were used for which, as well as a rationale for using different ones for different analyses.</p><p>3. The authors state that DEGs were defined as those genes with padj &lt; 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change &gt; 1. However, it is unclear how fold change filtering was implemented. Fold-change filtering, if not implemented into the statistical model used to identify DEGs, can lead to poor FDR control and is not appropriate (see PMC2654802). Wald tests in DESeq2 can be constructed with thresholds; please run the analysis in this manner if fold change filtering is currently carried out post hoc using the default settings. Alternatively, DESeq's default settings can be used without fold change filtering – if the number of DEGs is the issue, a smaller FDR threshold can be used (e.g. FDR &lt; 0.01). Additionally, please ensure that DEGs are called uniformly throughout the manuscript (or explicitly justify differences between panels). In contrast to the methods section, Figure 3B implements an abs (fold change) &gt; 1.3 thresholds.</p><p>4. Experimental groups were statistically analyzed using unpaired Student's t-tests. Though the data were tested for normality, it is difficult to say whether a sample size of 3 actually came from a normal distribution. To avoid making normality assumptions, analyses should be carried out using non-parametric tests instead, such as Wilcoxon tests. Most effects identified in the manuscript will likely be robust enough to this change.</p><p>5. For reproducibility of code and analyses, all analytical scripts for this study should be deposited in a repository such as GitHub or made available as a Supplementary file.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While we believe, the manuscript as a whole is close to publication quality, one of the major concerns is the reliance on cell lines as the major model system used, as opposed to primary cells and more in-depth in vivo analysis to strengthen the relevance of BAFF in aging. Please see our comments and concerns below:</p><p>1) The amount of DNA damaging stimuli seems fairly weak (5gy IR and 10nM Doxo). Can the authors determine via cell cycle analysis or some other assay, what percent of cells are undergoing cell cycle arrest?</p><p>2) Likewise, in Figure 1 the SA-B-GAL staining in THP-1 cells seems to be only in a small subset of cells, can the authors also quantify the staining perhaps via the use of C12FDG using a plate reader or preferably flow cytometry?</p><p>3) Figure 1: In addition to doxo-treated mice, can the authors also measure BAFF expression in old vs young tissues?</p><p>4) Pg 6: &quot;In all cases, BAFF mRNA levels increased during senescence (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) and secreted BAFF was generally elevated with senescence, although it was undetectable in hVSMCs, and the levels were overall higher in THP-1 cells (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).&quot; The total BAFF in the ELISA experiments in THP-1 and WI-38 cells is equivalent, in fact, the irradiated WI-38 cells have more expression than the irradiated THP-1 cells.</p><p>5) Pg 6: &quot;Next, we investigated if the rise in BAFF mRNA with senescence in THP-1 cells was the result of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms&quot; Please explain the rationale for asking this question.</p><p>6) Figure 2G: The authors show that IRF1 and IRF2 are induced during senescence and may drive BAFF expression. Thus, in addition to IRF1 can the authors also silence IRF2 to test its effect on BAFF mRNA expression.</p><p>7) In Figures 4B and 4C, can the cell viability and cell proliferation be measured via flow cytometry which is more quantitative?</p><p>8) Figure 5: To further define the BAFF signaling mechanism, can the authors also silence or KO the different BAFF receptors to determine which is the major receptor necessary for BAFF signaling in senescent THP-1 and fibroblast?</p><p>9) Figure 5: We suggest the authors perform an NFkB luciferase assay to confirm BAFF silencing impacts NFkB gene expression.</p><p>10) Pg 12 Figure 6: &quot;To gain a more complete understanding of the role of BAFF in senescence, we investigated its function in primary fibroblasts, which are well-established models for senescence and express the senescence-relevant protein p53&quot; The subsequent experiments were not performed in primary fibroblast.</p><p>11) Lastly, as mentioned above the paper would be strengthened if some of the key experiments can be performed in primary mouse or human monocytes and fibroblast to confirm BAFF regulates senescence in cells that are more relevant to normal physiology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

To address the Reviewer’s requests, we performed further experiments to determine whether the p53 response is specific to fibroblasts or could be extended to p53-proficient cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. First, we followed the Reviewer’s suggestion to try to silence BAFF and induce senescence in primary CD14+ monocytes; unfortunately, due to their short lifespan in culture (2-4 days) and the fact that they are inherently difficult to transfect, this experiment was not technically possible. Instead, we investigated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, which, despite being transformed, express p53 and are widely used to study p53 function in the immune system (PMID 25098341, PMID 16046548, PMID 29989329). Interestingly, despite the fact that total p53 levels remain unchanged after BAFF depletion, the levels of phospho-p53 (Ser15) in RAW 264.7 cells were reduced (new data in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These data suggest that BAFF regulates p53 not only in fibroblasts, but also in other p53-proficient cell types. Therefore, we modified our model in Figure 8 (previously Figure 7) to reflect the fact that p53 is implicated in this response in cells other than fibroblasts. We thank the Reviewer for helping us to improve this critical aspect of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For Figure 1G, it is preferable to show the RT-qPCR data normalized to the levels of <italic>18S</italic> rRNA in order to avoid confusion, particularly as the levels of the protein ACTB (β-actin) protein sometimes fluctuate (Figure 1H). We have updated Figure 1G and we now specify in the legend that <italic>18S</italic> rRNA levels are used for normalization. We also note that in our RT-qPCR analysis, we routinely include two or three RNAs (e.g., <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA, <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA, <italic>18S</italic> rRNA, etc) to ensure that our data are robust and consistent. For simplicity, in the manuscript we show only one reference RNA per panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1.

Based on our previous transcriptomic analysis using a range of models of cell senescence [Casella et al., <italic>Nucleic Acids Res</italic>, 2019 (PMID 31251810)], <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA was not significantly altered upon senescence in WI-38 or IMR-90 fibroblasts. For THP-1 cells (which were not included in the aforementioned study by Casella et al.), we did re-analyze some key results by normalizing to <italic>18S</italic> rRNA levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, normalization to <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA levels (left) yielded quite similar results as normalization to <italic>18S</italic> rRNA levels (right). For example, the increase in <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA upon senescence and the effects of BAFF silencing on SASP factor mRNAs (<italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>TNFA</italic>, and <italic>IL1B</italic> mRNAs) were comparable whether we normalized the data to the levels of <italic>18S</italic> rRNA or <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA. We chose <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA as a normalization housekeeping transcript in the manuscript, but we provide the comparison data for the Reviewer.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84238-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2.

We apologize for neglecting to indicate the normalizing amplicons used in each panel. We have updated our Figure Legends to reflect this important information.

The reason behind this choice is that RNA polymerase I (not RNA polymerase II) transcribes the parent transcript of <italic>18S</italic> rRNA, and hence <italic>18S</italic> rRNA levels are refractory to inhibition by actinomycin D treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Please see our comments and concerns below:</p><p>1) The amount of DNA damaging stimuli seems fairly weak (5gy IR and 10nM Doxo). Can the authors determine via cell cycle analysis or some other assay, what percent of cells are undergoing cell cycle arrest?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these questions and comments. Given that THP-1 cells are a leukemia line, they are much more sensitive to IR and Doxo than non-cancer cell types; therefore, we needed to choose doses of IR and Dox that would induce senescence without triggering significant cell death. In the revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C), we compared cell growth and viability of THP-1 cells after exposure to a single dose of 5 or 10 Gy. With 10 Gy, we observed a strong reduction in cell viability by day 6 after IR. Therefore, we decided to adopt 5 Gy for our experiments. To support the senescent state by 6 days after IR (5 Gy), we display several markers, including increased levels of p21 and DPP4 (Figure 1C), reduced BrdU incorporation and cell growth (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D), and increased SA-β-Gal and SPiDER-Gal activities (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Finally, we analyzed the cell cycle distribution profiles of untreated and IR-treated THP-1 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). Under these conditions, we did not observe a clear cell cycle arrest, but rather a modest shift toward G2/M and S phase in irradiated cells. This response profile is in line with the current literature on senescent cancer cells; as reported in the Cancer SENEScopedia, senescent cancer cells lacking TP53 do not undergo growth arrest in a specific phase of the cell cycle (PMID 34320349).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> is the cell cycle distribution of THP-1 cells (6 days after treatment with IR or Doxo):</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84238-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Likewise, in Figure 1 the SA-B-GAL staining in THP-1 cells seems to be only in a small subset of cells, can the authors also quantify the staining perhaps via the use of C12FDG using a plate reader or preferably flow cytometry?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have included quantitative SA-β-Gal analysis in IR-treated THP-1 cells (SPiDER-βGal, Dojindo), as reported in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1: In addition to doxo-treated mice, can the authors also measure BAFF expression in old vs young tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this question. We measured BAFF expression in old (27 months old, m.o.) versus young (3 m.o.) mice. To remain consistent with the Dox-treatment in Figure 1E-H, we analyzed spleen and serum, and used the same positive controls (<italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA in spleen and secreted GDF15 for serum, respectively). We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> the data for the Reviewer. RT-qPCR analysis in spleen revealed that <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> mRNA levels are indeed slightly upregulated with aging. However, in serum, we observed a significant reduction of circulating BAFF with aging. More studies will be necessary to determine if this is due to a higher uptake of BAFF by recipient cells, or if instead BAFF is accumulated in local niches of senescent cells, rather than at the systemic level. We decided not to include these data in our manuscript because it will be important to address these questions in depth in future studies. Given that these mice were models of healthy aging, it will be interesting to study the role of BAFF in the context of specific age-related morbidities, in which senescent cells and inflammation play a crucial role.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84238-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pg 6: &quot;In all cases, BAFF mRNA levels increased during senescence (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) and secreted BAFF was generally elevated with senescence, although it was undetectable in hVSMCs, and the levels were overall higher in THP-1 cells (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).&quot; The total BAFF in the ELISA experiments in THP-1 and WI-38 cells is equivalent, in fact, the irradiated WI-38 cells have more expression than the irradiated THP-1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is quite right.

Given our strong interest in gene regulation, particularly at the RNA level, we strive to identify the molecular factors that drive expression of key senescence-associated proteins. We have revised the sentence to be more descriptive:</p><p>“Next, to study the mechanism(s) underlying BAFF production in senescence, we investigated if the rise in TNFSF13B mRNA in irradiated THP-1 cells was the result of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulatory processes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2G: The authors show that IRF1 and IRF2 are induced during senescence and may drive BAFF expression.

We silenced IRF2 in THP-1 cells following the same approach used for IRF1 silencing. However, we did not observe a reduction in <italic>TNFSF13B</italic> pre-mRNA, and instead we observed a minor increase. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> we provide the data for the Reviewer:</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84238-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figures 4B and 4C, can the cell viability and cell proliferation be measured via flow cytometry which is more quantitative?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we measured cell viability by flow cytometry, as advised, and cell numbers by XTT assay (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). Details are in the revised Materials and methods and Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5: To further define the BAFF signaling mechanism, can the authors also silence or KO the different BAFF receptors to determine which is the major receptor necessary for BAFF signaling in senescent THP-1 and fibroblast?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this interesting comment. We individually silenced each of the three BAFF receptors in THP-1 cells (Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) and WI-38 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). In both cell types, silencing of <italic>TNFSF13C</italic> mRNA (encoding BAFFR) recapitulated part of the effects observed after BAFF silencing. Specifically, silencing BAFFR reduced the expression of some SASP factors in THP-1 cells, and reduced the levels of p53 in WI-38 cells. Interestingly, as described in the revised text, the silencing of BCMA or TACI had the opposite effect, suggesting that TACI and BCMA might be part of a negative feedback regulatory loop that regulates BAFF signaling. More studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to define the precise role of each BAFF receptor in senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 5: We suggest the authors perform an NFkB luciferase assay to confirm BAFF silencing impacts NFkB gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the Reviewer’s helpful suggestion and co-transfected siRNAs and reporter constructs by electroporation in THP-1 cells. However, the co-transfection of plasmids and siRNAs was highly toxic, and we observed significant cell death especially after IR treatment. However, we were able to co-transfect a reporter plasmid [an <italic>NF-ΚB</italic>-driven promoter-reporter construct (pNF-κB-GFP) along with control reporters with a minimal promoter (pMin-GFP) or a constitutively active promoter (pCMV-GFP)] along with a BAFF expression plasmid (pBAFF) and an empty vector (pCTRL) by using lipofectamine LTX, a non-toxic reagent specifically indicated for transfection of DNA vectors. We performed this experiment in proliferating THP-1 cells, and we measured GFP signal in cells overexpressing BAFF (pBAFF) relative to control populations (pCTRL). This experiment is included in Figure 5-Supplemental Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Pg 12 Figure 6: &quot;To gain a more complete understanding of the role of BAFF in senescence, we investigated its function in primary fibroblasts, which are well-established models for senescence and express the senescence-relevant protein p53&quot; The subsequent experiments were not performed in primary fibroblast.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We neglected to explain that WI-38 and IMR-90 fibroblasts are primary cells. They were isolated from normal fetal lung tissue (WI-38 fibroblasts) or from the lung tissue of a 4-month old (IMR-90), both female, and have a finite lifespan in culture before they undergo senescence. We have indicated this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Lastly, as mentioned above the paper would be strengthened if some of the key experiments can be performed in primary mouse or human monocytes and fibroblast to confirm BAFF regulates senescence in cells that are more relevant to normal physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these suggestions. As explained above, we used primary WI-38 and IMR-90 fibroblasts derived from human lung tissue. Regarding monocytes, we obtained and tested primary CD14+ monocytes; however, their short lifespan in culture (2 to 4 days) and the inherent difficulty of transfecting them did not allow us to assess the role of BAFF in primary monocytes. Therefore, we used instead the two monocyte/macrophage-cell lines THP-1 (human, transformed) and RAW 264.7 (mouse immortal) macrophages. As our studies advance, we will develop more tools to enable the analysis of primary human monocytes/macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Figure 1. Test whether the upregulation of BAFF is specific to senescence, or also in reversible quiescence arrest.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s requests. We performed the experiments in fibroblasts and THP-1 cells to assess BAFF levels in quiescence. As shown below in the figure for Reviewers, we induced quiescence in fibroblasts by serum starvation (0.1%) for 96 h and confirmed the quiescent state by measuring two markers of quiescence (reduction of <italic>CCND1</italic> mRNA and reduction of phopho-S6, when compared to cycling cells, following markers established previously [PMID 25483060]) (panel A). In this case, the level of <italic>BAFF</italic> mRNA was increased upon quiescence (panel B).</p><p>In THP-1 cells, we tried to induce quiescence by serum starvation and glutamine depletion for 96 h. Unfortunately, however, inducing quiescence in THP-1 cells was rather challenging, likely because they are cancer cells. Thus, we observed a reduction of cell proliferation in both conditions, but we observed a reduction in phospho-S6 only in the samples without glutamine (panel C). We failed to see increased <italic>BAFF</italic> mRNA levels in quiescent THP-1 cells after either serum starvation or glutamine depletion (panel D).</p><p>In summary, further studies will be necessary to fully understand if the increased expression of BAFF seen in senescent cells is also observed in other conditions of growth suppression (such as quiescence or differentiation), as well as whether this effect is specific to different cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1, Supplement 1G. Show negative control IgG for immunofluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. Along with other changes during the revision, we decided to remove the immunofluorescence data in order to include more informative data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. All results with siRNA should be validated with at least 2 individual siRNAs to eliminate the possibility of off-target effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer on the importance of testing individual siRNAs. For BAFF, we originally tested two independent siRNAs (BAFF#1 and BAFF#2) individually, but we also pooled them for additional analysis (and referred to simply as “BAFFsi” along the manuscript). In the revised version of our manuscript, we included the key experiments performed with these two individual BAFF siRNAs. Upon BAFF silencing in THP-1 cells, we observed a reduction of SASP factors and SA-β-Gal activity levels with each individual siRNA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F) and with the pooled siRNAs (Figure 4C). For WI-38 cells, we observed a reduction of p53 levels with individual and pooled siRNAs (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), as well as a reduction in IL6 levels and SA-β-Gal activity (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E). After IRF1 silencing, we observed a reduction in <italic>BAFF</italic> pre-mRNA with two different pairs of CTRLsi and IRF1si pools (Figure 2I and supplementary Figure 2E). For the data on BAFF receptors, we used SMARTpools from Dharmacon, which are combinations of 4 siRNAs designed by the company to minimize off-target effects. These additions and clarifications are indicated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To confirm a role for IRF1 in the activation of BAFF, the authors should confirm the binding of IRF1 to the BAFF promoter by ChIP or ChIP-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We performed ChIP-qPCR analysis in THP-1 cells that were either proliferating or rendered senescent after exposure to IR (Figure 2H, Materials and methods section), and we confirmed the binding of IRF1 to the proximal promoter region of <italic>TNFSF13B.</italic> As anticipated, this interaction was stronger after inducing senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Key antibodies should be validated by siRNA knockdown of their targets, for example, TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R in Figure 5. Note that there is an apparent discrepancy between BCMA data in Figure 5B vs 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the Reviewer on this point and we thank him/her for helping us to improve this part of our manuscript. To address the discrepancy regarding BCMA western blot analysis and flow cytometry data, we silenced BCMA in THP-1 cells and tested two different antibodies advertised to recognize BCMA. This experiment allowed us to identify the correct band for BCMA by western blot analysis. We then confirmed that BCMA is upregulated in senescence, as observed by both western blot and flow cytometry analyses. We have modified the manuscript to reflect these changes. Please find these data in Figure 5A,B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5E. Negative/specificity controls for this assay should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and regret that we were unable to provide a negative control. The kit only provides a competitive wild-type oligomer used to test the specificity of the binding. For each sample (CTRLsi, BAFFsi, CTRLsi IR, BAFFsi IR) and each antibody tested (p65, p50, p52, RelB and c-Rel), we evaluated the reductions in signal upon addition of excess competitive oligomer per well (20 pmol/well) compared to wells with an inactive oligomer. However, the negative control was performed only as single replicate, due to the limited quantity of nuclear extracts and the high number of samples and antibodies analyzed. We therefore considered this control as being ‘qualitative’ rather than fully ‘quantitative’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Hybridization arrays such as Figure 5H, Figure 6 – Supplement 1I, and Figure 6H should be shown as quantitated, normalized data with statistics from replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this request. We have included the quantification and statistics to the phosphoarrays used for THP-1 and WI-38 cells, which had been performed in triplicate (Figure 7A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). The original arrays are shown in the respective Source Data Files. In the interest of space, we removed the cytokine array performed on IMR-90 cells and left instead the quantitative ELISA for IL6 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). The data obtained from the cytokine array analysis in Figure 4F and Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 1C are supported by quantitative multiplex ELISA measurements (Figure 4E and Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 6B – Supplement 1. Controls to confirm fractionation (i.e., non-contamination by cytosolic and nuclear proteins) should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We tested the efficiency of fractionation and we did in fact observe some degree of contamination from cytosolic proteins using the earlier version of the kit (Pierce, cat. 89881). We therefore purchased an improved version of the kit (Pierce, cat. A44390) and repeated the surface fractionation assay, which this time showed improved fractionation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). Interestingly, with the improved fractionation strategy, we observed that BAFF receptors in fibroblasts were almost exclusively localized inside the cell and not on the surface, as we found in THP-1 cells. Further validation of BAFF receptor antibodies has been provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. As described in the text, the intracellular localization of BAFF receptors was previously reported in other cell types and conditions (PMID 31137630, PMID 19258594, PMID 30333819, PMID 10903733), and thus it is possible that BAFF may act through non-canonical mechanisms in WI-38 cells. Nonetheless, we did detect a small amount of BAFFR on the cell surface, and furthermore, BAFFR silencing reduced the level of p53 in fibroblasts. Therefore, we propose that BAFFR may be the primary receptor involved in p53 regulation in fibroblasts (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C). Our data on BAFF receptors deserve deeper characterization in a future study of the functions of BAFF receptors in senescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 6A. Knockdown of BAFF should be shown by western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, definitely. We appreciate this comment and have included BAFF knockdown data in fibroblasts by western blot analysis (Figure 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 6G. Although BAFF knockdown decreases the expression of p53, p21 increases. How do the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the interesting question. We too were surprised to observe that the p53-dependent transcripts regulated by BAFF did not include <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (<italic>p21</italic>) mRNA, as confirmed by western blot analysis. The accumulation of p21 in senescence can be also regulated by p53-independent pathways and in p53<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> cells, for example by p90<sup>RSK</sup>, SP1, and ZNF84 (PMID 24136223, PMID 25051367, PMID 33925586). Eventually, we removed the data relative to p21 and γ-H2AX in favor of other data and to streamline the content of this manuscript for the reader.</p></body></sub-article></article>
