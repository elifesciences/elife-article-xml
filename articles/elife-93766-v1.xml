However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous PKA upon activation remain debated. The classical model predicts that PKA catalytic subunits dissociate from regulatory subunits in the presence of cAMP, whereas a second model proposes that catalytic subunits remain associated with regulatory subunits following physiological activation. Here, we report that different PKA subtypes, as defined by the regulatory subunit, exhibit distinct subcellular localization at rest in CA1 neurons of cultured hippocampal slices. Nevertheless, when all tested PKA subtypes are activated by norepinephrine, presumably via the β-adrenergic receptor, catalytic subunits translocate to dendritic spines but regulatory subunits remain unmoved. These differential spatial dynamics between the subunits indicate that at least a significant fraction of PKA dissociates. Furthermore, PKA-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity and transmission can be supported only by wildtype, dissociable PKA, but not by inseparable PKA. These results indicate that endogenous PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits dissociate to achieve PKA function in neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cAMP-dependent kinase / protein kinase A (PKA)</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>norepinephrine</kwd><kwd>shRNA knockdown</kwd><kwd>late-phase structural long-term potentiation</kwd><kwd>AMPA and NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS094247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1NS133599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH130784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS127013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Haining</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two alternative models of PKA activation were tested in neurons, and the results support the classical model in which the catalytic subunit dissociated from the regulatory subunit upon activation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent kinase, or protein kinase A (PKA), regulates diverse critical functions in nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. PKA is a tetrameric protein consisting of two regulatory subunits (PKA-Rs) and two catalytic subunits (PKA-Cs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Francis and Corbin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>). In the inactive state, each PKA-R binds to and inhibits a PKA-C. Binding of cAMP to PKA-R activates PKA-C. However, there are different proposals on the molecular events that follow activation.</p><p>For decades, PKA-C is thought to dissociate from PKA-R upon cAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beavo et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Francis and Corbin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gold, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reimann et al., 1971</xref>). Freed PKA-C molecules then move to phosphorylate their substrates. However, several studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gold, 2019</xref>), including two notable recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), propose an alternative model, in which physiological concentrations of cAMP can activate PKA-C but do not result in its dissociation from PKA-R. Testing these two models will not only elucidate the biophysical mechanism of PKA activation, but also have distinct implications in how PKA may achieve its specificity, which is thought to rely on spatial compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have previously found that the majority of type IIβ PKA, as defined by PKA-R, is anchored to microtubules in the dendritic shaft of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons where PKA-RIIβ is bound to the abundant microtubule associated protein MAP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). Upon activation of the β-adrenergic receptor with norepinephrine, a fraction of PKA-C dissociated from PKA-RIIβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tillo et al., 2017</xref>). The freed PKA-C redistributed into dendritic spines, whereas PKA-RIIβ remained anchored at the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>). These results are consistent with the classical PKA activation model. However, recent studies suggest that PKA-Rs other than PKA-RIIβ may be the more abundant isoforms in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Church et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ilouz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</xref>). It remains untested whether these PKA isoforms dissociate upon physiologically relevant stimulations in neurons.</p><p>Here, we examined whether PKA-C dissociates from all major PKA-R isoforms in CA1 neurons. The rescue of function following knockdown of PKA-C was compared between wildtype dissociable PKA and an inseparable PKA variant in which PKA-C is covalently linked to PKA-R. The results support the classical model of PKA activation via dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Recent studies have suggested that PKA-RIIα and PKA-RIβ may be the prevalent isoforms in hippocampal CA1 neurons.

A 5 x lowered norepinephrine concentration (2 μM) also resulted in similar dynamics of PKA-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the PKA-C translocation happens in a wide range of neuromodulator concentrations. This differential re-distribution between PKA-C and PKA-R was more prominent following activation with forskolin (25 μM) and IBMX (50 μM). The translocation of PKA-C was independent of the expression level and the effect remained when extrapolating to the zero-overexpression level using a linear fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results can only be explained if at least a fraction of PKA-C dissociated from both PKA-RIIα and PKA-RIβ when a physiological stimulant was used. The differential re-distribution between PKA-C and PKA-R was also observed when PKA-RIα was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), although it was less implicated in hippocampal neurons. Together with our earlier results regarding PKA-C/PKA-RIIβ, we conclude that PKA-C dissociates from PKA-R with physiologically relevant stimuli.</p><p>Next, we asked whether PKA regulation of neuronal function is dependent on the dissociation of PKA-C from PKA-R. A key experiment supporting the non-dissociating PKA activation model was that PKA regulation of cell growth could be sustained by a construct in which PKA-C was fused to PKA-RIIα in one polypeptide chain via a flexible linker (named R-C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore asked whether this R-C construct could support PKA regulation of neuronal function. When R-C-mEGFP was expressed in CA1 neurons, this construct exhibited a distribution highly similar to that of RIIα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The tendency of this construct to translocate to the spine was largely diminished compared to PKA-C-mEGFP co-expressed with wildtype, unlinked PKA-RIIα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the catalytic subunit in R-C was indeed inseparable from the regulatory subunit.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the inseparable R-C.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of wildtype PKA versus R-C.

Given that PKA activation is required for the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 1997</xref>), we examined the structural LTP of individual dendritic spines of CA1 neurons elicited by focal two-photon glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>).

Given that PKA activity increases by two orders of magnitude when dissociated from PKA-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Miyamoto et al., 1969</xref>), even a small fraction of PKA-C dissociation will result in a marked increase of PKA kinase activity. These results corroborate the observations in intact non-neuronal cells that used FRET imaging and biochemical measurements, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Walker-Gray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zaccolo et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, PKA-C that is covalently linked to PKA-RIIα cannot functionally replace wildtype PKA for normal neuronal transmission or plasticity. Although this R-C construct has been shown to functionally replace endogenous PKA in terms of supporting the growth of a heterologous cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), it cannot support all necessary PKA functions. Overall, we conclude that PKA-C dissociation from PKA-R is essential for PKA regulation of neuronal function. Additionally, PKA specificity is mediated by spatial compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). This is likely mediated by mechanism downstream of PKA dissociation, such as membrane tethering of freed PKA-C or its buffering by extra PKA-Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gaffarogullari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Walker-Gray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition, this study shows that PKA distribution in neuronal dendrites at the resting state is subtype dependent. PKA-RIIα is enriched in dendritic shaft in a way similar to PKA-RIIβ, likely via its interaction with the abundant microtubule binding protein MAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Vallee et al., 1981</xref>). Note that this observation does not exclude the importance a small fraction of PKA being anchored to synaptic sites via other PKA binding proteins. In contrast, PKA-RIα and PKA-RIβ are more evenly distributed between spine and dendrites. These observations establish a spatial organizational base for understanding subtype-specific PKA function in neurons.</p><p>This study also demonstrates that PKA is essential for long-term structural LTP of individual spines. PKA has been shown to facilitate the induction of LTP (i.e. metaplasticity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Thomas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>), and is required for the maintenance of L-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 1997</xref>), as assayed using electrophysiological recording of postsynaptic currents. However, it has been suggested that the structural and synaptic current changes may not be causally linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kopec et al., 2006</xref>). Our results fill the gap to show that PKA is also required for maintaining the late phase of structural LTP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Rattus norvegicus, Sprague Dawley)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sprague Dawley rat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain Code 001;

The research fills a significant gap in our understanding of PKA activation mechanisms in synaptic functioning, presenting valuable insights backed by empirical evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive evaluation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The physiological relevance of the findings regarding PKA dissociation is somewhat weakened by the use of norepinephrine (10 µM) in bath applications, which might not accurately reflect physiological conditions. Furthermore, the study does not address the impact of glutamate uncaging, a well-characterized physiologically relevant stimulation, on the redistribution of PKA catalytic subunits, leaving some questions unanswered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the Reviewer that testing under physiological conditions is critical especially given the current debate in the literature. That is why we tested PKA dynamics induced by the physiological stimulant, norepinephrine. It has been suggested that, near the release site, local norepinephrine concentrations can be as high as tens of micromolar (<italic>Courtney and Ford, 2014</italic>). Based on this study, we have chosen a mid-range concentration (10 μM). At the same time, in light of the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have now also tested PKA-RIIα dissociation at a 5x lower concentration of norepinephrine (2 μM; New Experiment #2). The activation and translocation of PKA-C is also readily detectible under this condition to a degree comparable to when 10 μM norepinephrine was used.</p><p>Regarding the suggested glutamate uncaging experiment, it is extremely challenging because of finite signal-to-noise ratios in our experiments. From our past studies, we know that activated PKA-C can diffuse three dimensionally, with a fraction as membrane-associated proteins and the other as cytosolic proteins. Although we have evidence that its membrane affinity allows it to become enriched in dendritic spines, it is not known (and is unlikely) that activated PKA-C is selectively targeted to a particular spine. Glutamate uncaging of a single spine presumably would locally activate a small number of PKA-C. It will be very difficult to trace the 3D diffusion of these small number of molecules in the presence of surrounding resting-state PKA-C molecules. Finally, we hope the reviewer agrees that, regardless of the result of the glutamate uncaging experiment, the above new experiment (New Experiment #2) already indicate that certain physiologically relevant stimuli can drive PKA-C dissociation from PKA-R and translocation to spines, supporting our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It was a pleasure reading your paper, and the results are well-executed and well-presented.</p><p>My main and only recommendations are two ways to further expand the scope of the findings.</p><p>First, I believe addressing the endogenous localization of PKA-C subunit before and after PKA activation would be highly important to validate these claims. Overexpression of tagged proteins often shows vastly different subcellular distribution than their endogenous counterparts. Recent technological advances with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (Suzuki et al Nature 2016 and Gao et al Neuron 2019 for example) which the Zhong lab recently contributed to (Zhong et al 2021 eLife) allow us to tag endogenous proteins and image them in fixed or live neurons. Any experiments targeting endogenous PKA subunits that support dissociation and synaptic localization following activation would be very informative and greatly increase the novelty and impact of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that addressing the endogenous PKA dynamics is important. However, despite recent progress, endogenous labeling using CRISPR-based methods remains challenging and requires extensive optimization. This is especially true for signaling proteins whose endogenous abundance is often low. We have tried to label PKA catalytic subunits and regulatory subunits using both the homologous recombination-based method SLENDR and our own non-homologous end joining-based method CRISPIE. We did not succeed, in part because it is very difficult to see any signal under wide-field fluorescence conditions, which makes it difficult to screen different constructs for optimizing parameters. It is also possible that, at the endogenous abundance, the label is just not bright enough to be seen. Nevertheless, for both PKA type Iβ and type IIα that we studied in this manuscript, we have correlated the measured parameters (specifically, Spine Enrichment Index or SEI) with the overexpression level (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). We found that they are not strongly correlated with the expression level under our conditions. By extrapolating to non-overexpression conditions, our conclusion remains valid.</p><p>To overcome the inability to label endogenous PKA subunits using CRISPR-based methods, we have also attempted a conditional knock-in method call ENABLED that we previously developed to label PKA-Cα. In preliminary results, we found that endogenously label PKA were very dim. However, in a subset of cells that are bright enough to be quantified, the PKA catalytic subunit indeed translocated to dendritic spines upon stimulation (see Additional Fig. 1 in the next page), corroborating our results using overexpression. These results, however, are not ready to be published because characterization of the mouse line takes time and, at this moment, the signal-to-noise ratio remains low. We hope that the reviewer can understand.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Endogeneous PKA-Cα translocate to dendritic spines upon activation.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93766-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, experiments which would advance and validate these findings in vivo would be highly valuable. This could be achieved in a number of ways - one would be overexpression of tagged PKA versions and examining sub-cellular distribution before and after physiological activation in vivo. Another possibility is in vivo perturbation - one would speculate that disruption or tethering of PKA subunits to the dendrite would lead to cell-specific functional and structural impairments. This could be achieved in a similar manner to the in vitro experiments, with a PKA KO and replacement strategy of the tethered C-R plasmid, followed by structural or functional examination of neurons.</p><p>I would like to state that these experiments are not essential in my opinion, but any improvements in one of these directions would greatly improve and extend the impact and findings of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and the understanding. The suggested in vivo experiments are fascinating. However, in vivo imaging of dendritic spine morphology is already in itself challenging. The difficulty greatly increases when trying to detect partial, likely transient translocation of a signaling protein. It is also very difficult to knock down endogenous PKA while simultaneously expressing the R-C construct in a large number of cells to achieve detectable circuit or behavioral effect (and hope that compensation does not happen over weeks). We hope the reviewer agrees that these experiments would be their own project and go beyond the time and scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please elaborate on the methods used to visualize PKA-RIIα and PKA-RIβ subunits.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now included additional details for visualizing PKA-Rs in the text.
