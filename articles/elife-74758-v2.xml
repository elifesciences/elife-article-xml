nature of learned associations to support appropriate goal-directed and anxiety-like behaviour. Such behaviour occurs via the differential activity of multiple, parallel populations of pyramidal neurons in vH that project to distinct downstream targets, but the nature of BA input and how it connects with these populations is unclear. Using channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in mice, we show that BA input to vH consists of both excitatory and inhibitory projections. Excitatory input specifically targets BA- and nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons and avoids prefrontal cortex-projecting vH neurons, while inhibitory input preferentially targets BA-projecting neurons. Through this specific connectivity, BA inhibitory projections gate place-value associations by controlling the activity of nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons. Our results define a parallel excitatory and inhibitory projection from BA to vH that can support goal-directed behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109360/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacAskill</surname><given-names>Andrew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>215165/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishchanchuk</surname><given-names>Karyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>222292/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passlack</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011680</institution-id><institution>King Fahad Medical City</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>AlSubaie</surname><given-names>Rawan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amygdala input to ventral hippocampus is both excitatory and inhibitory, and the balance of these two projections controls the formation of place preference via differential innervation of each hippocampal output population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus is key for episodic memory, learning and spatial navigation, as well as motivation, affect and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray and McNaughton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wikenheiser and Schoenbaum, 2016</xref>). At almost every level of investigation – from gene expression, to afferent and efferent connectivity, and behavioural function – the hippocampus is organised as a gradient along the dorsal to ventral (posterior to anterior in humans) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). Within this axis the most dorsal portion is proposed to be involved in learning and utilising fine-grained spatial and temporal structure, whereas the most ventral pole is thought to be involved in affect and motivation, and has a key role in value-based and reward-driven decision-making and anxiety-like calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A distinguishing factor that separates the ventral from the dorsal hippocampus is dense input from the corticobasolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (basal amygdala [BA]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). The BA comprises a diverse set of nuclei including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the basomedial amygdala (BMA), the medial amygdala (MEA) and cortical amygdala, each of which sends projections to ventral hippocampus (vH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petrovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). These nuclei, and their projections to vH, are thought to be crucial for the learning of reward- and threat-associated cues, and for the generation of appropriate goal-directed and anxiety-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hitchcott and Phillips, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McHugh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Selden et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang and Wang, 2017</xref>). Thus, it is commonly assumed that powerful and specific synaptic connectivity between these two structures is crucial for the maintenance of such behaviours. However, there is limited information describing the organisation of such functional connectivity between amygdala input and neurons in vH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This lack of understanding is compounded by the fact that the vH, in particular its output structure the ventral CA1 and subiculum – where the majority of BA input is found – is organised as a parallel circuit, such that the majority of neurons project to only one downstream area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). Thus, while vH has powerful connections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and back to the BA, each of these projections arises from a distinct population of neurons. Importantly each of these projection populations is increasingly shown to underlie unique behavioural functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>). For example, vH<sup>NAc</sup> neuron activity is high during motivated behaviour and around rewarded locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reed et al., 2018</xref>), is necessary for place-value associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>) and can promote spatial and instrumental reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, vH<sup>PFC</sup> activity is proposed to support the resolution of approach avoidance conflict and contribute to spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>), while vH<sup>BA</sup> activity is proposed to support contextual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unclear how the activity of these distinct populations in vH is differentially controlled to promote these functions. We reasoned that a means for this control would be projection-specific innervation from BA.</p><p>The circuit organisation of the nuclei in the BA is similar to classic cortical circuitry – with the majority of neurons classed as either excitatory pyramidal neurons or local inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>). However, there is also evidence suggesting the presence of long-range inhibitory projection neurons throughout BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dedic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald and Zaric, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). Similar inhibitory projections from cortex are hypothesised to have a crucial regulatory role in modulating hippocampal circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>), but the connectivity and function of BA long-range inhibitory input in vH has never been directly investigated.</p><p>In this study, we used a combination of retrograde tracing, electrophysiology and channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping to show that BA provides both excitatory and direct inhibitory input to distinct projection populations within vH. We show that excitatory projections uniquely target vH neurons that project to NAc and back to the BA, and do not connect with neurons that project to PFC. In contrast, long-range inhibitory input preferentially targets BA-projecting vH neurons. Next, using a simple network model constrained by our electrophysiology recordings, we predicted that the ability of BA input to drive motivation- and value-promoting vH projections to NAc was dependent on the co-activation of both excitatory and inhibitory input from BA. Finally, we confirmed these predictions using in vivo optogenetics and genetically targeted pharmacology to show that long-range inhibition is required for the generation of spatial place preference. Together, our results outline a novel inhibitory projection from amygdala to vH that defines the activity of vH output neurons and is able to control hippocampal output to promote the formation of spatial place preference.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BA input into vH is both excitatory and inhibitory</title><p>While the majority of investigation of BA-vH connectivity is focussed on projections specifically from the BLA, it is known that multiple BA nuclei project to vH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we first determined the spatial distribution of neurons in BA that send input into vH by injecting a fluorescently conjugated cholera toxin beta subunit (CTXβ) into the ventral part of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CTXβ is taken up by presynaptic terminals at the injection site and retrogradely transported to label the soma of afferent neurons. After 2 weeks, we serially sectioned labelled brains and mapped labelled cell locations to the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fürth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). We found that neurons sending input to vH were widely dispersed throughout the entire BA, including in BLA, BMA and MEA, as well as in more cortical amygdala areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, this experiment confirmed that there is large input from disperse BA nuclei to vH, focussed around the posterior BMA and BLA.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of basal amygdala (BA) input to ventral hippocampus (vH).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experiment.

We repeated our experiment using a vGAT-cre::dtomato reporter mouse. In this experiment, CTXβ-labelled neurons in BA could be distinguished as either GABAergic (vGAT+) or putatively excitatory (vGAT-) based on fluorescence colocalisation. Using this approach, we found that a small but consistent proportion of BA neurons (3.7% of CTXβ-labelled neurons) that projected to vH were GABAergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Using whole-brain registration as before, we found that inhibitory projection neurons were intermingled with excitatory projection neurons, such that there was no obvious anatomical separation between inhibitory and classic excitatory projections. Supporting this, both were found in consistent proportions (~4% of labelled neurons) throughout each nucleus in BA and across all three anatomical axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that long-range inhibitory input in vH arises from somatostatin-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>). Therefore, we repeated our CTXβ experiment and performed immunostaining against somatostatin. Consistent with previous results, we found that a proportion of CTX+ BA neurons projecting to vH were also somatostatin positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, in addition to the classically described excitatory projection from BA to vH, there is a parallel inhibitory projection arising from GABAergic neurons from across the BA, and these neurons are likely to express the peptide somatostatin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Basal amygdala (BA) input to ventral hippocampus (vH) is both excitatory and inhibitory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CTXβ injection in vH in a vGAT::cre::dtomato mouse line reveals inhibitory neurons (vGAT+), putative excitatory neurons that project to vH (CTX+) and inhibitory neurons that project to vH (vGAT+ CTX+).

To recruit both excitatory and inhibitory projections from BA, we used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM). We expressed ChR2 under a pan-neuronal synapsin promoter (hsyn-ChR2) in the BA using an injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) centred on posterior BMA and BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Two weeks later we prepared acute slices of vH from animals performed whole-cell recordings from pyramidal neurons in the axon-rich CA1/ proximal subiculum border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By recording in voltage clamp at –70 mV, we could isolate excitatory currents in response to blue light in ~40% of recorded neurons that were blocked by bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, paired t-test, t<sub>(8)</sub> = 10.04, p=0.000008, n = 9 neurons). In the same neurons, we could also record inhibitory currents at 0 mV in ~30% of cells that were blocked by the GABA-A receptor antagonist gabazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, paired t-test, t<sub>(8)</sub> = 11.7, p=1.48 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, n = 12 neurons). Thus, BA input makes excitatory and inhibitory connections with vH pyramidal neurons via AMPA and GABA-A receptors.</p><p>Our retrograde tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) suggested that in addition to classic feedforward inhibition (where excitatory axons make connections with local interneurons to disynaptically inhibit pyramidal neurons), BA input also contained axons originating from inhibitory neurons, which would putatively make direct inhibitory connections. To confirm this possibility, we first used a pharmacological approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Using mice injected with hsyn-ChR2 in BA as above, we recorded inhibitory currents in vH pyramidal neurons at 0 mV. We first removed feedforward inhibition with bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX. Interestingly, while inhibition was completely blocked in a subset of neurons (8/12), in the remaining population inhibitory currents persisted. This finding suggests that – consistent with our retrograde anatomy – a proportion of this inhibitory input was due to a direct long-range inhibitory projection from the BA. Consistent with this prediction, the remaining current was blocked by bath application of gabazine, indicating that it was a GABA receptor-mediated current.</p><p>To test this more explicitly, we again used vGAT-cre mice where cre is expressed only in GABAergic neurons and expressed ChR2 in BA using either a CaMKii promoter – to confine expression to only putative excitatory pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>) – or using a cre-dependent cassette to restrict ChR2 only to putative GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). After allowing time for expression, we observed both excitatory and inhibitory axon labelling at the CA1/subiculum border in vH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>), consistent with direct projections from both populations of BA neurons. Consistent with the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory projections, CaMKii+ BA input evoked strong inhibitory currents at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), but these currents were blocked by bath application of NBQX, showing that the inhibitory currents were a result of solely feedforward inhibition (repeated-measures ANOVA, F<sub>(2,4)</sub> = 23.4, p=0.006; Tukey’s post hoc test, baseline vs. NBQX, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 4.73, p=0.001, baseline vs. gabazine, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 4.84, p=0.001, NBQX vs. gabazine, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 0.12, p=0.90, n = 3 neurons). In contrast, vGAT+ BA input also showed robust input at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), but this inhibitory current was insensitive to NBQX application, but blocked by gabazine, suggesting a direct inhibitory connection (repeated-measures ANOVA, F<sub>(2,10)</sub> = 10.03, p=0.004; Tukey’s post hoc test, baseline vs. NBQX, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 0.05, p=0.9, baseline vs. gabazine, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 4.12, p=0.001, NBQX vs. gabazine, t<sub>(2)</sub> = 4.16, p=0.001, n = 6 neurons).</p><p>Together, these experiments define a novel, direct inhibitory projection from BA to vH.

As the absolute level of input onto a recorded neuron using the CRACM approach is proportional to the number of connected axons times the unitary amplitude of these connections, light-evoked input is dependent on a number of technical variables such as precise location of the injection site, location of recording in vH and the number of ChR2-positive axons. Therefore, it is not possible to compare input onto different populations of neurons across slices and injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacAskill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we instead compared the relative ChR2-evoked input onto pairs of neighbouring neurons, each of which projected to a different downstream region. Using this approach, we could make a within-experiment comparison of the relative BA input across each of the projection populations, while keeping the stimulus constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>). In order to carry out this experiment, we again injected ChR2 into BA, but also retrograde tracers into either BA and NAc, or BA and PFC. This allowed us, 2 weeks later, to prepare acute slices and obtain whole-cell recordings from pairs of fluorescently identified neurons in vH projecting to each downstream target. Together, the paired recording of neurons in the same slice and field of view allowed for a comparison of ChR2-evoked synaptic input while controlling for variability in the absolute level of input due to confounds such as injection volume and the exact location in CA1/subiculum.</p><p>We first compared excitatory input in voltage clamp at –70 mV as before with pan-neuronal expression of ChR2 using the synapsin promoter.

(2) Do pyramidal neurons from each projection population connect with local interneurons to provide feedback inhibition? (3) Are there differences in how local interneurons connect with pyramidal neurons from different projection populations?</p><p>We first asked whether BA excitatory and inhibitory input targeted interneurons in vH.

To do this, we injected a retrogradely transported AAV (AAVretro) in either NAc and BA to express cre recombinase in NAc- or BA-projecting vH neurons, respectively. In the same surgery, we injected a combination of cre-dependent ChR2 and the fluorescent reporter dlx-mRuby into vH. This allowed us to obtain whole-cell recordings from fluorescently identified vH interneurons, while activating neighbouring projection neurons. Voltage-clamp recordings at –70 mV showed robust responses from both vH<sup>NAc</sup> and vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons onto local interneurons (~80% of recorded neurons were connected in each condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>), confirming previous studies suggesting strong feedback inhibition in vH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2014a</xref>). For both of these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–H</xref>), it is important to note that we did not quantitatively compare the level of synaptic input across different conditions due to the limitations of the CRACM approach (see ‘Discussion’). However, these experiments confirm that there is robust feedforward and feedback inhibition present in the CA1/subiculum border of vH.</p><p>Finally, we asked if local interneurons differentially innervate vH<sup>BA</sup> and vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons. In order to quantitatively compare input across these two populations, as before we expressed ChR2 in vGAT+ interneurons in vH using a vGAT-cre mouse line and injected different coloured retrobeads into NAc and BA. Two weeks later we then obtained paired, whole-cell recordings from neighbouring vH<sup>BA</sup> and vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons in the same slice and investigated light-evoked inhibitory synaptic input at 0 mV. We found that local inhibitory connectivity was markedly biased towards vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–K</xref>), where inhibitory connections onto vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons were on average twice the strength of those onto neighbouring vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons (Wilcoxon rank-sum, W = 2, p=0.006, n = 10 pairs of neurons). Thus, activation of local interneurons in vH, either via direct input from BA or via feedback from local pyramidal neurons, results in biased inhibition of vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons and has a much smaller effect of neighbouring vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons.</p><p>This marked asymmetry of local inhibitory connectivity led us to predict that feedforward inhibition activated by excitatory BA input may also differentially impact the two output populations. We tested this using ChR2 expressed in BA under the control of the CaMKii promoter to limit expression to excitatory projections. As before, excitatory input in this experiment was equivalent in neighbouring vH<sup>BA</sup> and vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref>, Wilcoxon rank-sum, W = 22, p=0.625, n = 10 pairs of neurons).

However, there was also a marked lack of vH<sup>NAc</sup> activity despite these neurons receiving equivalent excitatory synaptic input from BA.

While vH<sup>PFC</sup> neurons remained silent, vH<sup>NAc</sup> neuron activity increased as direct inhibition increased, and vH<sup>BA</sup> neuron activity decreased. This difference peaked around 40% long-range inhibition, where vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons were effectively silent, and vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons were firing robustly. This was due to long-range inhibition efficiently removing feedforward and feedback inhibition onto vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) – both by direct inhibition of local interneuron activity, but also by inhibiting vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons that provide the bulk of feedback inhibitory drive.

Excitatory input from BA to vH has been widely studied and is distributed across a large range of subnuclei, ranging from the MEA to the BLA, and well as cortical amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>). Each of the distinct nuclei of the amygdala are thought to control various aspects of cue-dependent learning and carry out unique roles during behaviour. Increasingly, function has been assigned to BA based on anatomical location. For example, anterior basolateral, basomedial and central amygdala have unique contributions to fear learning and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LeDoux, 2000</xref>), while more posterior and medial regions of BA are increasingly associated with reward learning, value calculations and prosocial behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shemesh et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role within each of these nuclei is also diverse – with interspersed neurons involved in encoding behaviour across a wide range of different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Namburi et al., 2015b</xref>). We found that the BA inhibitory projection arose from GABAergic neurons interspersed between excitatory projection neurons throughout the entire extent of the BA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, it will be important to systematically investigate the synaptic targeting and behavioural contribution of the input from different nuclei separately. However, in addition it will also be important to assess the differential contribution of excitatory and inhibitory drive, most likely through the use of intersectional genetic and anatomical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that inhibitory input from BA to vH may be important for motivated behaviour, in particular we show that co-activation of both excitatory and inhibitory projections from BA, and not excitation alone, is essential for promoting place preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Long-range inhibitory projections from classical excitatory projection areas have been increasingly identified as having a key role in shaping circuit output and for defining motivated behaviour. For example, functional inhibitory projections from PFC to NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014b</xref>), and BA to PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seo et al., 2016</xref>) have both been shown to modulate value-based and reward behaviour, including the support of RTPP and aversion. The hippocampus also receives long-range inhibitory input from numerous regions including entorhinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>), septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesiger et al., 2021</xref>) and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malik et al., 2021</xref>). While these studies focussed on dorsal hippocampal circuitry and a role for these projections in memory and navigation, due to the known dichotomy between dorsal and ventral hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strange et al., 2014</xref>), it would be interesting to investigate the presence and function of such long-range inhibitory projections into vH. In particular, whether a role in motivated behaviour and place preference was specific to BA input or due to the dorsoventral location of this input in hippocampus. Interestingly, long-range inhibition from entorhinal cortex, septum and PFC all preferentially target interneurons and avoid pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesiger et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, our data show that BA long-range inhibition connects with both interneurons and pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), similar to that seen in long-range inhibitory projections from BA to PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that there may at least in part be interesting input-specific connectivity across the different long-range inhibitory inputs into hippocampus.</p><p>We investigated the synaptic and circuit basis by which BA input could promote such motivated behaviour. The vH is increasingly viewed as being composed as a series of parallel output streams, where pyramidal neurons in the CA1/subiculum border are composed of multiple populations each projecting to a distinct downstream region including the NAc, the PFC and the BA. Each projection population in vH underlies a unique role during behaviour. In particular, vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons have been shown to be key for motivated behaviour, and the association of reward with a particular place or time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeGates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trouche et al., 2019</xref>). We found that both excitatory and inhibitory input from BA made specific connections onto each of these projection populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), such that the balance of excitation and inhibition from BA into vH is well placed to determine their relative activity. Excitatory input alone preferentially activated vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons, while excitatory and inhibitory input together preferentially activated vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, BA input is well placed to define the activity of specific vH output pathways in response to a particular environment, state or task. More specifically, the level of inhibitory input form BA can control RTPP by defining the activity of vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note, however, that there is overlap between different projection populations in vH. While roughly 80–90 % of neurons are thought to project to a single downstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>), a proportion of vH neurons collateralise and project to two or more regions. In this study, we recorded from only single-labelled neurons after injection into two downstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), but as the efficiency of retrograde labelling is not 100% we cannot discount the fact that neurons in our dataset may project to more than one region not labelled by our injections. While the large differences in synaptic connectivity across projection populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) reinforce the idea of parallel projection populations in vH, due to their scarcity we did not explicitly address the connectivity of this small population of collateralising neurons. This is therefore an interesting future direction. Importantly, however, using our circuit model we found that the switch in activity from vH<sup>BA</sup> to vH<sup>NAc</sup> populations was robust despite large overlap of each projection population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>When considering the possibility of collateralising vH neurons, it is important to consider the distribution of projection neurons along the transverse (near CA2, to near subiculum) axis. Dual-projecting neurons are much more prominent in the proximal CA1 (at the CA1/CA2 border; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). This part of CA1 is preferentially associated with place coding and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henriksen et al., 2010</xref>). We focussed our investigations in distal CA1 (at the CA1/subiculum border) as this is where we found the most consistent excitatory and inhibitory input from BA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>), and this is where the majority of long-range projection neurons are found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). In this part of the hippocampus, dual-projection neurons are rarer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naber and Witter, 1998</xref>), and this difference in cellular properties coincides with a preferential role of distal CA1 in non-spatial and object-place associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, in the future it will be important to explicitly investigate the properties of these dual-projection neurons and also how their function and connectivity change along the transverse axis.</p><p>In addition to the role of BA and vH in value-based and motivated behaviour, multiple studies have examined the role of excitatory BLA input into vH in the generation of anxiety-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>). The vH has a key role in the generation of appropriate behaviour in anxiogenic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray and McNaughton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kjelstrup et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McHugh et al., 2004</xref>). This is thought to be achieved both by resolving approach-avoidance conflict during decision-making via vH<sup>PFC</sup> projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>), but recently also via generation of a specific anxiogenic state defined via projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we detected only minimal excitatory or inhibitory BA input onto vH<sup>PFC</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that innervation from other local or long-range afferent regions may be key for this behavioural role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>). However, BA input does innervate vH<sup>LH</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>), and thus it is interesting to note the possibility that the anxiogenic influence of excitatory, anterior BLA input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pi et al., 2020</xref>) may be via this distinct circuit. vH<sup>LH</sup> neurons are present in more distal areas of ventral subiculum, with only a minority present in the CA1/proximal subiculum border region considered in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). However, how BA input interacts with distal subicular circuits that project to distinct downstream regions including hypothalamus and retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Spruston, 2012</xref>), and how inhibitory and excitatory input interact with this circuit is an interesting future direction.</p><p>Our study focussed on the postsynaptic influence of BA inhibitory projections, and the cellular properties of these projection neurons remain unknown. Anatomical studies have suggested that BA inhibitory projections are preferentially observed in somatostatin (SOM)- and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald and Zaric, 2015</xref>), and almost completely absent in parvalbumin (PV)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons. Consistent with this, we found a proportion of SOM-positive neurons in BA that project to vH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, there is the potential for inhibitory input to be from both specific nuclei in BA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but also different genetically defined populations of inhibitory neurons, as is seen for excitatory amygdala projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, in our study we did not differentiate BA input onto different types of inhibitory interneuron in vH. There is enormous diversity of interneuron types throughout the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Group et al., 2008</xref>), each of which is involved in distinct parts of the circuit calculation – such as dendritic-targeting SOM- and VIP-expressing neurons, perisomatic PV-expressing interneurons and cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons. Inhibitory input from entorhinal cortex preferentially innervates CCK interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2016</xref>), while input from PFC specifically innervates VIP interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malik et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, how BA input differentially innervates these populations is an important and interesting future question.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that we investigated the connectivity of this circuit at a steady state, and all of our slice physiology was performed in animals that had only experienced their home cage environment. Therefore, it is unknown how this circuit may be updated by experience and new learning, and the plasticity mechanisms that might underlie this updating. The reciprocal connection from vH to BA has been shown to undergo robust plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazelot et al., 2015</xref>), and BA circuitry rapidly updates in response to learning cue associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Namburi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Namburi et al., 2015a</xref>). Therefore, an important future direction will be to understand how the BA-vH circuit is altered by learning and novel experience, and how this plasticity influences the relative targeting of excitatory and inhibitory connections onto each of the vH projection populations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Technical limitations of CRACM</title><p>In this study, we used CRACM to investigate the connectivity between BA and vH. We utilised this technique as axons from BA are severed during the slicing process which renders them unable to be electrically stimulated. In addition, the CRACM technique allowed us to restrict our analysis to specific genetically defined excitatory or inhibitory input. However, there are multiple caveats associated with the CRACM technique that must be taken into account when interpreting such experiments. First, in the standard CRACM setup, light-evoked currents in postsynaptic neurons are heavily dependent on the number of connections with ChR2-positive axons, as well as the amplitude of the postsynaptic response at each connected synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacAskill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the absolute size of a ChR2 response is crucially dependent on the number of infected axons and the level of ChR2 expression in each axon. This makes a comparison across experiments extremely challenging. To mitigate this, in our study we compared the light-evoked response across two neighbouring neurons in the same slice, one projecting to each downstream region under investigation. By comparing responses to the same stimulus in each neighbouring neuron, we could quantitatively compare the relative input onto each cell type across experiments. Importantly where these paired recordings were not possible – such as when investigating interneuron connectivity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–H</xref> and a quantitative comparison was not possible, we could only infer qualitative connectivity. In this case, we used a circuit model to investigate the consequences of systematically altering this connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and found that the behaviour of the circuit was consistent across a broad range of connectivity. A second related issue is that the basic CRACM technique cannot differentiate the postsynaptic mechanism underlying differences in input across cell types. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> we could not differentiate if the greater input onto vH<sup>BA</sup> neurons compared to neighbouring vH<sup>PFC</sup> neurons is due to differences in connection probability or differences in the strength of these connections. Using our circuit model we showed that for the simple circuit layout we consider for this study the precise postsynaptic mechanism did not influence the circuit properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, in more complex situations that require spatial or temporal summation across synaptic locations, these properties will have interesting consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>). Therefore, future work investigating such mechanisms using modifications of the CRACM technique to look at postsynaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Druckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Little and Carter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacAskill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>) is an important future direction.</p><p>Overall we have defined a novel circuit that allows BA input to define the activity of parallel output pathways from vH to control motivated behaviour. The anatomical and functional specificity of this circuit provides an ideal substrate upon which to control reward and value-based learning and decision-making, and helps to explain the multiple and varied roles attributed to this circuit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Information on the ABA hierarchical ontology was scraped from the ABA API (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/structure_graph_download/1.json">http://api.brain-map.org/api/v2/structure_graph_download/1.json</ext-link>) using custom Python routines. For quantification of input fractions, cells residing in different layers within the same structure, for example, COAa1, COAa2, etc., were agglomerated across layers and subdivisions and counted as residing in one single region (e.g. COAa). Structures included as part of BA were 'BLAa', 'BLAv', 'BLAp', 'BMAa', 'BMAp', 'LA', 'COAa', 'COApl', 'COApm', 'MEAa', 'MEAav', 'MEApd', 'MEApv', 'CEAc', 'CEAm', 'CEAl', ‘PAA', 'PA'. For co-localisation of VGAT+ and CTXβ-labelled neurons, images acquired as above were manually annotated with single- and dual-labelled neurons using Napari (napari contributors, 2019, doi.10.5281/zenodo.3555620). Whole-brain distributions were visualised using the Brainrender package for Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claudi et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Hippocampal recordings were studied in acute transverse slices.

After 30 min at 35°C, slices were stored for 30 min at 24°C. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22–24°C). All chemicals were from Sigma, Hello Bio or Tocris.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Whole-cell electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were made from hippocampal pyramidal neurons retrogradely labelled with retrobeads which were identified by their fluorescent cell bodies and targeted with Dodt contrast microscopy, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacAskill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). For sequential paired recordings, neurons were identified within a single field of view at the same depth into the slice. The recording order was counterbalanced to avoid any potential complications that could be associated with rundown. For current-clamp recordings, borosilicate recording pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with (in mM) 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 7 KCl, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 10 EGTA, 4 MgATP and 0.4 NaGTP. For voltage-clamp experiments, three internals were used, First, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I–P</xref>, a Cs-gluconate-based internal was used containing (in mM) 135 gluconic acid, 10 HEPES, 7 KCl, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.4 NaGTP, 10 TEA and 2 QX-314. Excitatory and inhibitory currents were electrically isolated by setting the holding potential at –70 mV (excitation) and 0 mV (inhibition) and recording in the presence of APV. Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, E-H</xref> were carried out using current-clamp internal in APV in order to carry out post-stimulation analysis of intrinsic properties of recorded interneurons. Finally, to record inhibitory currents at –70 mV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref> we used a high chloride internal (in mM): 135 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 7 KCl, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 10 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 10 TEA and 2 QX-314. Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, with electrical signals filtered at 4 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.</p><p>Presynaptic glutamate release was triggered by illuminating ChR2 in the presynaptic terminals of long-range inputs into the slice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez-Bellot and MacAskill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wee and MacAskill, 2020</xref>). Wide-field illumination was achieved via a ×40 objective with brief pulses of blue light from an LED centred at 473 nm (CoolLED pE-4000/Thorlabs M470L4-C1, with appropriate excitation-emission filters). Light intensity was measured as 4–7 mW at the back aperture of the objective and was constant between all cell pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiology data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Electrophysiology data were acquired using National Instruments boards and WinWCP (University of Strathclyde). Optical stimulation was via wide-field irradiance with 473 nm LED light (CoolLED) as described above. Data were analysed using custom routines written in Python 3.6, imported using the neo package in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). For connectivity analysis, a cell was considered connected if the average of light-induced response was greater than 2 standard deviations above baseline. Amplitudes of responses were calculated as the average of a 2 ms window around the peak of the response. Current step data (Figure S2) were analysed using routines based around the eFEL package in Python (Blue Brain Project).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integrate-and-fire model</title><p>An integrate-and-fire model was constructed using the Brian2 package in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stimberg et al., 2019</xref>). 1000 vH-BA, vH-NAc and vH-PFC neurons were modelled interspersed with 80 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2014a</xref>). Neurons were set to have a leak conductance, resting potential, spike threshold and membrane capacitance based on the literature and our current-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): leak conductance 5.5 nS; resting potential –70 mV, spiking threshold –35 mV, membrane capacitance 200 pF. Connectivity of the local vH circuit was based on our electrophysiology recordings. AMPA receptor connections were 1 nS and were modelled with a tau of 5 ms. GABA receptor-mediated connections were 3 nS and modelled with a tau of 10 ms. Feedback connectivity from each pyramidal neuron population was connected at a probability of 0.1. The probability of connection of local interneurons to pyramidal neurons was based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and was 0.8 for vH-NAc neurons and 0.4 for vH-BA and vH-PFC neurons, each with a 3 nS GABA conductance. To simulate excitatory BA input, neurons were supplied with 50,000 BA inputs timed as a Poisson distribution with an average rate of 10 Hz. Each neuron was connected to this input with a probability of 0.1, where the strength of the synaptic connection was randomly drawn from a normal distribution defined by our electrophysiology experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (vH-BA 0.3 ± 0.2 nS, vH-NAc 0.3 ± 0.2 nS, vH-PFC 0.03 ± 0.2 nS, interneurons 0.3 ± 0.2 nS). To simulate BA inhibitory input, neurons were again supplied with 50,000 BA inputs timed as a Poisson distribution with an average rate of 10 Hz, but the connection probability was calculated as a proportion of excitatory input and varied across runs. As before, the strength of each synaptic connection was randomly drawn from a normal distribution defined by our electrophysiology experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (vH-BA 0.3 ± 0.2 nS, vH-NAc 0.08 ± 0.2 nS, vH-PFC 0.03 ± 0.2 nS, interneurons 0.3 ± 0.2 nS). Each simulation was run five times at each level of inhibitory connection strength, with the length of simulation 500 ms for each run. To investigate the influence of feedforward and feedback connection probability, proportion of overlap between populations and postsynaptic mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>), we systematically altered these parameters for each run. Model output was analysed as total spikes produced by each neuronal population over the course of 500 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behaviour</title><p>After sufficient time for surgical recovery and viral expression (&gt;4 weeks), mice underwent multiple rounds of habituation. Mice were habituated to the behavioural testing area in their home cage for 30 min prior to testing each day. Mice were habituated to handling for at least 3 days, followed by 1–2 days of habituation to the optical tether in their home cage for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Real-time place preference</title><p>Axon terminals were labelled as described above, and a 200 µm optical fibre was implanted unilaterally 100 μm above the stimulation area (vH). After habituation (above), behaviour was assessed using an RTPP task. On day 1, mice were exposed to the three-chamber arena (24 cm × 16 cm × 30 cm) for 15 min without stimulation to allow habituation and also to ensure no large side bias was present. The testing chamber was made out of black acrylic, was symmetrical and had no odour, visual or tactile cues to distinguish either side of the arena. The arena was thoroughly wiped down with 70% ethanol between each trial. Mice were excluded if they spent more than 80% of their time in one side of the chamber during this habitation session. On day 2, 20 Hz light stimulation was delivered via a 473 nm laser, coupled to a patch cord (7–10 mW at the end of the patch cord) to activate ChR2-positive terminals. Real-time light delivery was based on the location of the mouse in the RTPP apparatus, where light stimulation occurred only when the mouse was in the light-paired side of the arena. The paired side was chosen randomly for each mouse and each session, thus in combination with the lack of explicit cues in the chamber, this assay represents acute place preference and not learned preference over sessions. Time spent in the light-paired and control side of the arena over the course of the 15 min session was scored for each mouse using automated tracking analysis (Bonsai). For experiments involving pharmacogenetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), mice first underwent habituation and laser-only trials as before, and data from control animals were used to replicate the original RTPP cohort (Figures 6A–C and 7A–C). Next, mice were given 1–2 daily s.c. injections of 100 µl DMSO (10% in saline) for habituation, before undergoing two further days of testing – first with DMSO as a control and with 10 mg/kg SalB the next day to avoid any spillover effects of the SalB injection. All injections were given 15 min prior to RTPP session. Control mice for optogenetics expressed GFP in BA. Control mice for KORD experiments consisted of a mixture of mice expressing smFP in vH<sup>NAc</sup> neurons and mice lacking expression in vH, all of which received an injection of both DMSO and SalB. No differences were seen across the two conditions, and so data were pooled. Several mice were removed from the analysis due to missed injections (seven), broken implants (six), evidence of light-induced seizure (five – all of which were subsequently found to have bleed of ChR2 into vH) and due to an early error in SalB administration (three). No group was overrepresented in any of these issues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Summary data are reported throughout the figures either as boxplots, which show the median, 75th and 95th percentile as bar, box and whiskers, respectively, or as line plots showing mean ± SEM. Example physiology and imaging traces are represented as the median ± SEM across experiments. Data were assessed using statistical tests described in the supplementary statistics summary, utilising the Pingouin statistical package for Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vallat, 2018</xref>). Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05, all tests were two-sided. No statistical test was run to determine sample size a priori. The sample sizes we chose are similar to those used in previous publications. Animals were randomly assigned to a virus cohort (e.g. ChR2 versus GFP), and where possible the experimenter was blinded to each mouse’s virus assignment when the experiment was performed. This was sometimes not possible due to, for example, the presence of the injection site in the recorded slice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the U.K. Home Office as defined by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, and University College London ethical guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical summary of main figures.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74758-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Statistical summary of figure supplements.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74758-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74758-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All main figures are supplied with source data used to generate the figures.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the MacAskill Laboratory for helpful comments on the manuscript.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Control of Parallel Hippocampal Output Pathways by Amygdalar Long-Range Inhibition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sadegh Nabavi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this version of the work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>That said, there was considerable enthusiasm for your manuscript and its potential to report impactful findings. Thus, we would be willing to consider a revised version of your manuscript as a new submission, if you are able to well address each of the concerns noted below. If you choose to resubmit your manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>, it will be editorially evaluated prior to being sent to review. We will endeavor to send a revision to the same reviewers, but cannot guarantee this. The following are the main points that must be addressed.</p><p>1) Circuit mapping is sub-optimal. This key issue has been raised by all the three reviewers and should be carefully addressed. For example, the Authors should provide quantitative EPSCs data based on objective criteria, as explained by comment #1 of reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Key and novel information on the identity of the GABAergic projections from the BA and their cellular targets in the VH should be given.</p><p>3) Divergent VH CA1 projections should be detected, their inputs investigated and added as new experimental and modelling data.</p><p>4) Most of the behavioural experiments are underpowered and need to be improved by substantial increase in the sample size that would also make the statistical comparisons more meaningful.</p><p>5) The authors should provide high quality evidence of the tracer-virus injection sites, in order to evaluate the potential viral spread, and the fiber projection patterns.</p><p>6) Additional technical improvements should be made and submitted in a revised version. They include using more physiological intracellular calcium concentration in some in vitro experiments, as well as to provide a better control for the chemogenetic experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>A strength of the manuscript is that it includes data obtained with a variety of complementary approaches, such as CRACM, electrophysiology, behavior and modeling that all contribute toward a comprehensive definition of BA-VH connectivity.</p><p>However, there are weaknesses that make the claims raised not as direct as they should. Furthermore, the data submitted does contains some important gaps. Specifically: CRACM should significantly improve, a better characterization of the &quot;novel&quot; BA long-range GABAergic neurons should be provided, the identification of the VH cellular targets (CA1, CA3 pyramidal cells?) should be provided too, VH pyramidal cells with multiple projection areas should be investigated.</p><p>I found that the quality and the logic of the submitted manuscript (text, figures, data analysis, methods, and discussion) is quite good. One exception is that some key references are not cited (please see below). Regarding the data weaknesses, I have the specific major comments.</p><p>1) CRACM is sub-optimal. The present data interpretation relies on intrinsic assumptions without experimental support. It is important to consider that the first paper that used CRACM (Petreanu et al., Nature Neurosci 2007) contained important controls and methodological considerations that should not be forgotten. For example, the size of evoked EPSC = (a) number of connected axons x (b) amplitude of unitary EPSP. In the absence of known (a) and (b) is really quite hard to come up with a quantitative comparison of EPSC values obtained from the activation of different inputs from different transfected animals, (d) control data to verify the level of ChR-2 expression in the various transfected inputs.</p><p>The Authors should consider of re-working their approach and provide at least: estimate the amplitude of unitary EPSP for each connection examined, laser power versus spiking probably and latency plots for each neuron type transfected with ChR2, EPSC data normalization based on an estimation of the number of presynaptic fibers transfected for each input.</p><p>2) The identity of the BA GABAergic projection neuron should be provided as part of this manuscript. To include this neuron type characterization (somastostatin-expressing GABAergic cell?) would render this manuscript significantly stronger.</p><p>3) The cellular target identity of the BA projection to the VH also remains unknown. From the present data, it is not clear whether the BA inputs target the CA1 and/or CA3 VH.</p><p>4) Ciocchi et al; Science, 2015 reported VH CA1 pyramidal neurons with divergent projections to the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens with specific behavioral roles. The Author should detect these divergent VH CA1 pyramidal neurons and investigate their role in modeling and behavior.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The work described in this manuscript very elegantly explores the functional connectivity of BA projections to vHPC neurons, using an original and skilful combination of optogenetics and retrograde tracing approaches, as well as the potential role of these projections in goal-directed behavior. Overall, the manuscript benefits from extensive studies on the functional connectivity between BA and vHPC, and contributes important novel information to the field including solid evidence for the long postulated long-range inhibitory efferents from the BA.</p><p>My enthusiasm for the work is, however, diminished by the preliminary nature of the behavioural experiments and the lack of cogent experimental evidence for some of the claims, including the validity of the ratio used to compare the strength of the functional BA-inputs to different populations of vHPC principal neurons shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.</p><p>1) I am not sure of the validity of the ratio used to compare the strength of the functional BA-inputs to different populations of vHPC principal neurons shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The authors do not provide well-defined and objective criteria. These ratio could be, therefore, strongly biased. This raises questions about the soundness of the claim that feedforward inhibition is markedly skewed towards nAcb-projecting neurons. It also seems that the purported differential impact of feedforward inhibition activated by excitatory BA inputs onto BA-projecting vs nAcb-projecting vHPC neurons largely depends on a single data point. (Figure 4 panel P). The choice of the statistical test (Wilcoxon Rank test), based on the assumption that the recordings can be considered matched samples, has probably favored a type 1 statistical error.</p><p>2) Most of the behavioural experiments appear largely underpowered. If we consider the intrinsic variability of the place preference test (also substantiated by the data presented by the authors in Figure 6 and 7), the number of animals used (and in particular for the test animals, i.e. SalB-treated) is, in my opinion, far too small. It is fair to say that being in most cases paired tests, the n can be smaller. Despite this, an n of 4 is definitely suboptimal, even if the apparent statistical effect is clear (e.g. Figure 6 panel K).</p><p>3) Given the relative complexity of the design of the behavioural experiments (particularly those combining opto- and chemogenetics) involving the use of multiple viral vectors and injection sites, I wonder how many animals had to be excluded and based on which criteria. This information should be provided. Since the injection sites are provided (Figure 6 suppl 2 and Figure 7 suppl 2), I assume that the viral spread was analysed. A representative image of the injection side should be provided alongside with the projection patterns in vHPC for each of the key experiments.</p><p>4) The authors have completely neglected to discuss and consider in their interpretation of their results the fact that vHPC principal neurons often have more than one long-range projection, e.g. mPFC-projecting neurons can also project to the nAcb (Ciocchi et al; Science, 2015). How can they reconcile their finding that BA-inputs target nAcb-projecting neurons but not mPFC-projecting ones with the data published by Ciocchi et al?<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work provides a detailed map of mono-synaptic connections between the BA and the vH. Particularly valuable, they use CRACM to identify the inhibitory and excitatory mono-synaptic connections. They extend their investigation of mono-synaptic connections to the vH output neurons (BA, NAc, and mPFC projecting neurons). Then they build an integrate-and-fire network model, constrained by their experimental data. Finally, they test the model's prediction at the behavioral level.</p><p>Overall, this work is carefully designed and nicely executed. Although, I am not qualified in evaluating their modeling, I liked their approach. It is a well-rounded experimental design, where they use their own set of data to construct a model with predictive power that later put in test. That is, they bridged the gap between slice electrophysiology and behavior with circuit modeling.</p><p>However, some of the main claims require more experimental evidence. This includes increasing the power for the behavioral experiments, evaluating a potential contribution of topographical bias within the BA, verifying that high concentration of the calcium chelator is not having unintended consequences, and a more thorough validation of the effect of SalB on action potentials.</p><p>– In this work CRACM was used to quantify the projection biases between two different regions. The way it is done, however, ignores the topographical biases that exist within the source region. For example, figure 3D-F clearly shows a stark difference between the optically evoked responses in vHmPFC and vHBA neurons. This may indicate, as favored by the authors, a low connectivity between the BA and the vHmPFC, or, alternatively, a topographical bias within the BA, where different parts preferentially target vHmPFC and vHBA neurons.</p><p>– In real time place preference part, some of the manipulations were done with as few as 4 mice (ex. Figure 6K. 7C). The number of mice used in 6I is more reassuring.</p><p>– All the recordings were done with an unusually high concentration of the calcium chelator EGTA (10 mM). EGTA is more mobile compared to the endogenous calcium buffers, and this could enhance the diffusion of calcium and result in unintended consequences. For example, the high concentration of EGTA may reduce the basal level of intracellular calcium concentration which in turn may change the basal synaptic transmission. The authors should run a control showing the concentration of EGTA used here does not affect the basal transmission. This can be done with a 15-minute long paired recording of the optically-evoked responses from the excitatory neurons in the vH, with one cell filled with high EGTA (10 mM) and the other with low EGTA (0.5 mM).</p><p>– SalB injection produces a modest hyperpolarization (2mV) (figure 6F). Whether this is sufficient to block action potential is not convincingly tested. The number of action potentials should be presented at more depolarized states (figure 6E).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74758.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We hope our additional experiments, analysis and discussion itemised below will mitigate their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Circuit mapping is sub-optimal. This key issue has been raised by all the three reviewers and should be carefully addressed. For example, the Authors should provide quantitative EPSCs data based on objective criteria, as explained by comment #1 of reviewer 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments, and are very keen to make sure that our circuit mapping successfully addresses the questions we are asking in the paper. Overall, however, we think there is some confusion that stems from us not adequately explaining the rationale and details of how the experiments were carried out. We apologise for this lack of clarity, and have substantially updated the text throughout he manuscript to more thoroughly explain our experimental setup. We summarise our rationale below:</p><p>The reviewers – and particularly reviewer one – rightly pointed out important limitations to the CRACM technique. These are excellent comments, with which we very much agree. In particular, a key issue with CRACM is the difficulty in reconciling data from different experiments, with variability in e.g. injection and expression levels of ChR2 meaning that light evoked post synaptic responses will be highly variable from slice to slice. This makes a quantitative comparison of input across slices extremely challenging without detailed histology, indirect quantification of axon density and ChR2 expression level, and the use of optical quantal stimulation – which is challenging due to the non-physiological nature of ChR2 currents in presynaptic terminals.</p><p>However, as reviewer one describes, Petreanu et al. 2007 very nicely characterised this technique, and as a result it has become the basis of a large number of studies, including from my lab and many others. Importantly for our study, in Figure 4 of Petreanu 2007, the authors developed a means to circumvent many of the caveats associated with CRACM and allow quantifiable comparisons across cell types. In short, by comparing relative input across neighbouring neurons within the same slice. This method has subsequently become the gold standard in the field, and although it is much harder experimentally – involving recording from 2 neighbouring projection-defined neurons in the same slice and field of view – allows the direct comparison of synaptic input across cell types, without relying on the indirect estimations described above.</p><p>In our study we make sure to use this method throughout our comparisons to mitigate these potential caveats of CRACM. For example, in Figure 4D-F of our original manuscript, for each experiment we recorded one neuron projecting to BA, and one neuron projecting to PFC in the same slice and same field of view. This way the expression and activation of presynaptic ChR2 is identical for both post-synaptic neurons, removing the experimental caveats mentioned by the reviewers. This is why all of our comparisons (and accompanying statistics) are presented as ratios rather than absolute values – the objective measure is the relative input onto each pair of recorded neurons. Overall, our results in Figure 4D-F show that across different experiments, each BA projecting neuron receives a greater proportion of excitatory input than a neighbouring PFC-projecting neuron when the same presynaptic terminals are excited.</p><p>Importantly there are limited instances where this approach is experimentally not possible (e.g. Figure 5A-H). In this case, we have explicitly stated this, and have only inferred binary connectivity, and not any quantitative differences in connectivity across connections. To complement these experiments, we then investigated the potential consequences of differential connectivity in our model (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>Overall, we apologise for the lack of clarity in our original description of our experiments. We have now substantially updated the results starting on p 6, line 36, and p 10, line 15 to make the reasoning behind our approach clear and have added a substantial section to the discussion starting on p19, line 8 outlining the limitations of the CRACM technique, and how these can be mitigated by carrying out experiments in the way they have been carried out in our study. We have also specifically addressed each of the reviewers’ points in detail below. Together, we hope that this clarification of the rationale underpinning our approach will satisfy the reviewers concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Key and novel information on the identity of the GABAergic projections from the BA and their cellular targets in the VH should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>Identity of BA inhibitory projections:</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a very interesting point. Numerous studies (reviewed in McDonald and Mott 2016, and discussed in our original manuscript on p15-16, now p 18 in the new manuscript) have previously carried out extensive anatomical investigation of long-range inhibitory projections into hippocampus. These include from PFC, Entorhinal Cortex, BA, and septum. Interestingly across all of these experiments, a common factor is the molecular identity of the inhibitory projections often involves somatostatin expression. Indeed, it has previously been shown using retrograde tracing that the long-range inhibitory input from amygdala to the hippocampal formation most likely arises from somatostatin positive, and parvalbumin negative neurons.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewers that it would be a helpful addition to show this is also the case in our hands, and so we have repeated these experiments. We injected fluorescently conjugated choleratoxin into the vH and compared overlap of retrogradely labelled neurons in BA with somatostatin immunostaining. We found that a proportion of retrogradely labelled neurons were positive for somatostatin. This is consistent with previous work, and is now presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 and described on p 4, line 35, and discussed on p 18, line 28.</p><p>Identity of vH neurons:</p><p>We apologise that this was not made clearer in our original manuscript. The target area of BA input we focussed on was the CA1 / subiculum border – the area where the vast majority of long-range output projections arise from (as described on p2, p5, p6, and p15 of the original manuscript, with example images and physiological characterisation of the neurons presented in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). We have now substantially updated the text to highlight the identity of our recording sites more clearly on p 5, line 12, and have moved our characterisation of CA1 / subiculum output populations to the main Figure 3. We have also carried out anatomical analysis of axon projection patterns from both excitatory and inhibitory injections in BA, showing innervation of BA input in this region, now presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3, and described on p6, line 16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Divergent VH CA1 projections should be detected, their inputs investigated and added as new experimental and modelling data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. Multiple studies, including detailed studies from our own lab (e.g. Wee and MacAskill, 2020, Naber and Witter 1998) have shown that a small proportion of neurons in ventral hippocampus project to multiple downstream regions. However, in the CA1/subiculum border where we are recording, it is the general consensus that only small percentages (ranging from 2 – 10 %) of neurons are dual projecting. Due to the very sparse nature of these double projecting neurons it is not feasible to carry out the technically challenging paired recording technique to record from these small subpopulations. However, to address the reviewer’s concerns, we have carried out a number of extra experiments, and added substantial extra discussion:</p><p>a) We have performed additional, double retrograde labelling experiments that allows us to quantify the proportion of neurons that project to more than one downstream region at the CA1 / subiculum border where we are recording. Consistent with multiple previous studies we found this to be a small proportion – between 2-20%. This is now presented in Figure 3D and described on p6, line 32.</p><p>b) We have carried out a number of new in silico experiments using our integrate and fire model to investigate the circuit consequences of having these subpopulations follow each combination of potential connectivity rules predicted by our experiments. In particular, we were interested in the possibility that retrogradely labelled neurons recorded in our dataset may in fact project to more than one downstream area. If this was the case, then a proportion of our recordings from e.g. PFC projecting neurons may also project to NAc. In this scenario, increased collateralisation would result in increased overlap in the properties of each population of neurons.</p><p>Therefore, we systematically increased the % of neurons with dual projections from 0% (the same as our original model) to 60 % (where 60% of the neurons in the network had properties from all three populations, and only 40 % had the properties we recorded in our physiology experiments). Interestingly, while we found that altering both local connectivity, and BA input markedly altered the influence of BA input on the network, the switch from BA and NAc projecting activity with increasing long-range inhibition remained intact, even at extreme levels where 40 – 60 % of neurons had synaptic properties defined as if they projected to multiple downstream areas. Therefore, our modelling suggests that the local and long-range connectivity rules are robust to collateralisation, and that this robustness allows for up to ten times higher collateralisation than found in our retrograde labelling experiments. This is now presented in Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 and described on p 12, line 5.</p><p>c) Finally, we very much agree with the reviewers that the contrast between Stephane Ciocchi’s work finding large overlap of projection populations, with the large anatomy literature suggesting these neurons only have very small overlap. We have therefore added a substantial section to the discussion to address this. In particular we have discussed the idea that the dual projection recordings in the Ciocchi paper may be from a specific part of proximal CA1 that has only relatively sparse long range projection neurons (around 5-10% of total neurons). These neurons, specifically in proximal CA1, have previously been shown to have a higher collateralisation (up to 30%, Naber and Witter). In contrast, our study focussed on the area of ventral hippocampus containing the bulk of long-range output neurons, located substantially more distally in CA1, at the border between CA1 and subiculum. We think this may be the cause of the discrepancy. In addition, we have also discussed some practical issues that should be taken into account when comparing retrograde tracing such as efficiency of labelling. Finally, we made sure to point out that a comparison of BA innervation across the proximal – distal axis of CA1 and subiculum would be a very interesting future direction. This is especially interesting considering the increasing evidence for a distinction of function along the proximal distal axis of the hippocampus. This extra discussion can be found starting on p 17, line 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most of the behavioural experiments are underpowered and need to be improved by substantial increase in the sample size that would also make the statistical comparisons more meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out behavioural testing on a second cohort of mice for both KORD experiments in Figures 6 and 7 to increase the n to a minimum of 7 per group. We hope that these additional experiments will satisfy the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should provide high quality evidence of the tracer-virus injection sites, in order to evaluate the potential viral spread, and the fiber projection patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have provided example histology images, axon tracing data for both excitatory and inhibitory input from BA into vH, and multiple example injection sites. This is provided in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3 and 5, Figure 3B, and Figure 7—figure supplement 2. We have also verified this axon tracing using tracing data from the Allen connectivity database, which is provided as Figure 2 —figure supplement 4. We hope this will be suitable to address the reviewers’ concerns. We also hope that this will help address reviewer one’s concern over the exact location of our recordings (point 2 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Additional technical improvements should be made and submitted in a revised version. They include using more physiological intracellular calcium concentration in some in vitro experiments, as well as to provide a better control for the chemogenetic experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>EGTA: Our voltage clamp internal contained QX-314 to block sodium channels, TEA and Cs to block potassium channels, and EGTA to buffer calcium. Our goal with the addition of each of these chemicals was to increase the accuracy of our voltage clamp recordings by removing potentially contaminating currents. Therefore, our internal solution is intentionally non physiological, as this helps with the interpretation of our experiments. 10 mM EGTA is often used in voltage clamp experiments where holding voltage is shifted between -70 and 0 mV as in our study (e.g. Rigby et al. 2015, Bats et al., 2012). In addition, as all of our recordings are investigating the relative input into a pair of neighbouring neurons in the same slice, any potential effect of this extra buffering would be equal for both of the recorded neurons, and so would be internally controlled.</p><p>Combined with our more detailed description of our internally controlled paired recording experimental setup (see point one above), we hope our explanation of the reasoning behind utilising EGTA in our internal will satisfy the reviewers concerns. In addition, we have added a section to the discussion on p 18, line 40 pointing out that an investigation of plasticity in this projection would be an important future direction.</p><p>KORD controls: The extra controls requested by reviewer 3 were present in the original manuscript, in Figure 6, figure supplement 1C – now Figure 7, figure supplement 1C. We have now explicitly referenced these experiments in the manuscript on p 12, line 34.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I found that the quality and the logic of the submitted manuscript (text, figures, data analysis, methods, and discussion) is quite good. One exception is that some key references are not cited (please see below). Regarding the data weaknesses, I have the specific major comments.</p><p>1) CRACM is sub-optimal. The present data interpretation relies on intrinsic assumptions without experimental support. It is important to consider that the first paper that used CRACM (Petreanu et al., Nature Neurosci 2007) contained important controls and methodological considerations that should not be forgotten. For example, the size of evoked EPSC = (a) number of connected axons x (b) amplitude of unitary EPSP. In the absence of known (a) and (b) is really quite hard to come up with a quantitative comparison of EPSC values obtained from the activation of different inputs from different transfected animals, (d) control data to verify the level of ChR-2 expression in the various transfected inputs.</p><p>The Authors should consider of re-working their approach and provide at least: estimate the amplitude of unitary EPSP for each connection examined, laser power versus spiking probably and latency plots for each neuron type transfected with ChR2, EPSC data normalization based on an estimation of the number of presynaptic fibers transfected for each input.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a large section to the manuscript outlining the reasoning behind the design of these experiments, which are summarised in point 1 above. However, to further mitigate the reviewers concerns we have added further explanation and performed new experiments as detailed below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) 'the Authors should consider of re-working their approach and provide laser power versus spiking probably (and latency plots) for each neuron type transfected with ChR2 since this type of measurement will provide a rationale for using a certain light intensity for each set of stimulation’.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate long range input from amygdala into the different projection populations in ventral hippocampus. As this is a long-range projection, this is only possible using ChR2-assisted circuit mapping (or CRACM), which allows the direct stimulation of axons within the slice containing hippocampal neurons, despite the fact that these axons are severed from the soma during slicing. Therefore, while this is an excellent suggestion for local connectivity studies, recording light-evoked spiking in separate slices containing the soma of ChR2 infected cells in the amygdala will not be informative with respect to the ability of light to directly stimulate amygdalar axons in slices of hippocampus. As we described in our main response, instead we only compare pairs of recorded neurons while stimulating the same axon terminals. Thus, postsynaptic responses are internally controlled within each pair. We have added this to the results on p 6, line 36, and p 10, line 15 to make the reasoning behind our approach clear and have added a substantial section to the discussion starting on p19, line 8, discussing the potential caveats with the CRACM approach and how they might eb mitigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) 'This technique may be also give a clue of the light stimulation needed to activate a single presynaptic fiber that would be an ideal protocol.’ [and that the authors should attempt to carry out], 'EPSC data normalization based on an estimation of the number of presynaptic fibers transfected for each input' … ’the size of evoked EPSC = (a) number of connected axons x (b) amplitude of unitary EPSP. In the absence of known (a) and (b) is really quite hard to come up with a quantitative comparison of EPSC values obtained from the activation of different inputs from different transfected animals’.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, the purpose of our study was to investigate long range input from amygdala into ventral hippocampus, and particularly the relative influence of this input on the different projection populations in hippocampus. Therefore, our goal was to use a method that allowed as controlled a comparison as possible of input across two populations of cells. As mentioned above this is very important to us, especially – as pointed out by the reviewer – due to the inherent variability of the CRACM approach due to differences in for example the expression level of ChR2, or the exact location of injection or recording.</p><p>Because of this, and as discussed in detail in above in point 1, in our study we make sure to mitigate the potential caveats of CRACM as much as possible, and for each experiment we recorded one neuron from each population of interest in the same slice and field of view. This way the expression and activation of presynaptic ChR2 is identical for both post-synaptic neurons, removing the experimental caveats mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>In contrast, the technique described by the reviewer aims to ask a very different question, which is to ask what the unitary synaptic properties of the connections from amygdala onto hippocampal neurons are. This is a fascinating area, and one which we have personally investigated in depth in other studies (Macaskill et al. 2012, MacAskill et al. 2014). However, it is a different question to the one addressed in the paper. Crucially, as the reviewer themself points out, it would be extremely difficult to accurately compare total input onto two populations of neurons using this technique, and it would rely on indirect estimations based on histology, cell or axon counting across animals and optical-quantal analysis. This is in contrast to the direct, within-experiment comparison gained with the method we use, and which has been used repeatedly in the field (three examples from the last year: Anastasiades et al. 2021, <italic>Neuron</italic>; Young… and Petreanu 2021, <italic>eLife</italic>; Martinez-Garcia et al. 2020, <italic>Nature</italic>). Overall, we want to highlight that for the question asked in our paper, we think the way the experiment was originally performed in the study was most likely the most appropriate.</p><p>However, despite these concerns, we have carried out extra modelling experiments to further investigate this idea. Using our model we explicitly asked if there were potential functional consequences of the specific mechanism underlying the difference in relative input across the populations. We built different versions of our model where the differences in BA input onto each population are due to either unitary postsynaptic amplitude, or probability of connection. We found that -as anticipated in our simple system – irrespective of the underlying reason for differences in total synaptic input, the functional consequences for the vH circuit remained the same. This is presented in Figure 6 —figure supplement 3, and discussed on p 12, line 5.</p><p>In addition, we have added substantially to our discussion on p 19, line 26, to address the interesting consequences of each of the mechanisms on circuit function. For example, in situations that require temporal or spatial summation of inputs across the dendrites. Together we think this improves the discussion, and we hope it will satisfy the reviewers concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identity of the BA GABAergic projection neuron should be provided as part of this manuscript. To include this neuron type characterization (somastostatin-expressing GABAergic cell?) would render this manuscript significantly stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and as noted above have now carried out extra experiments to address this point. Numerous studies (reviewed in McDonald and Mott 2016, and discussed in our original manuscript on p15-16) have previously shown that the long-range inhibitory input to the hippocampal formation most likely arises from somatostatin positive, and parvalbumin negative neurons from across the amygdala. To confirm this is the case in our hands, we have carried out retrograde anatomy experiments combined with immunostaining for somatostatin, and show that somatostatin positive neurons in amygdala project to hippocampus. This is presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, and on p 4, line 35, and discussed on p 18, line 28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The cellular target identity of the BA projection to the VH also remains unknown. From the present data, it is not clear whether the BA inputs target the CA1 and/or CA3 VH.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that this was not made clearer. The target area of BA input we focussed on was the CA1 / subiculum border – the area where the vast majority of long-range output projections arise from (as described on p2, p5, p6, and p15 of the original manuscript, with example images and physiological characterisation of the neurons presented in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). We have now substantially updated the text to highlight the identity of our recording sites more clearly on p 5, line 12, and have moved our characterisation of CA1 / subiculum output populations to the main Figure 3. We have also carried out anatomical analysis of axon projection patterns from both excitatory and inhibitory injections in BA, showing innervation of BA input in this region, now presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3 and 4, and described on p6, line 16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Ciocchi et al; Science, 2015 reported VH CA1 pyramidal neurons with divergent projections to the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens with specific behavioral roles. The Author should detect these divergent VH CA1 pyramidal neurons and investigate their role in modeling and behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point, and indeed the majority of our manuscript (Figure 3 – Figure 8) is concerned with understanding how BA input differentially impacts each of these unique projection populations, and what the potential behavioural consequences of this targeting are.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer, as well as reviewer 2 and 3 that the function and connectivity of the relatively small proportion of projection neurons with collaterals to more than one downstream region may be distinct and have unique functional roles. As outlined in the response to point 3 we have performed a number of new experiments and added substantial discussion to address this. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) I am not sure of the validity of the ratio used to compare the strength of the functional BA-inputs to different populations of vHPC principal neurons shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The authors do not provide well-defined and objective criteria. These ratio could be, therefore, strongly biased. This raises questions about the soundness of the claim that feedforward inhibition is markedly skewed towards nAcb-projecting neurons. It also seems that the purported differential impact of feedforward inhibition activated by excitatory BA inputs onto BA-projecting vs nAcb-projecting vHPC neurons largely depends on a single data point. (Figure 4 panel P). The choice of the statistical test (Wilcoxon Rank test), based on the assumption that the recordings can be considered matched samples, has probably favored a type 1 statistical error.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and apologise that our rationale for our experiments was not clear in the original submission. As stated in our response to point 1, our data is presented as a ratio because each data point represents the light evoked response in a paired recording between two neurons projecting to distinct downstream regions, while keeping presynaptic stimulation constant. This practically and technically challenging experimental setup was designed to mitigate concerns about variability in ChR2-evoked synaptic responses due to injection site location, recording location, depth in the slice, and ChR2 expression. Therefore, we hope by better explaining our rationale for using paired comparisons this mitigates the reviewer’s concerns. In short, taking Figure 5 as an example, each data point shows that for the response recorded in a vH<sup>BA</sup> neuron, the relative response of a neighbouring VH<sup>NAc</sup> neuron in the same slice to exactly the same stimulus is consistently higher. We have now substantially updated the results starting on p 6, line 36, and p 10, line 15 to make the reasoning behind our approach clear and have added a substantial section to the discussion starting on p19, line 8 outlining the limitations of the CRACM technique, and how these can be mitigated by carrying out experiments in the way they have been carried out in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Most of the behavioural experiments appear largely underpowered. If we consider the intrinsic variability of the place preference test (also substantiated by the data presented by the authors in Figure 6 and 7), the number of animals used (and in particular for the test animals, i.e. SalB-treated) is, in my opinion, far too small. It is fair to say that being in most cases paired tests, the n can be smaller. Despite this, an n of 4 is definitely suboptimal, even if the apparent statistical effect is clear (e.g. Figure 6 panel K).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now carried out a new cohort of mice for each of the KORD experimental groups in Figure 7 and 8, which allowed us to increase the <italic>n</italic> to at least 7 for each condition. We hope this is now satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the relative complexity of the design of the behavioural experiments (particularly those combining opto- and chemogenetics) involving the use of multiple viral vectors and injection sites, I wonder how many animals had to be excluded and based on which criteria. This information should be provided. Since the injection sites are provided (Figure 6 suppl 2 and Figure 7 suppl 2), I assume that the viral spread was analysed. A representative image of the injection side should be provided alongside with the projection patterns in vHPC for each of the key experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and regret not including this information in the original manuscript. Indeed, a number of animals were excluded – including due to mistargeting of the injections or fibres, and an error in administering SalB. This is now explicitly stated with numbers in each case in the methods p 24, line 35.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have completely neglected to discuss and consider in their interpretation of their results the fact that vHPC principal neurons often have more than one long-range projection, e.g. mPFC-projecting neurons can also project to the nAcb (Ciocchi et al; Science, 2015). How can they reconcile their finding that BA-inputs target nAcb-projecting neurons but not mPFC-projecting ones with the data published by Ciocchi et al?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, as well as reviewer 1 and 3 that the function and connectivity of the relatively small proportion of projection neurons with collaterals to more than one downstream region may be distinct and have unique functional roles. As outlined in the response to point 3 we have performed a number of new experiments and added substantial discussion to address this. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>– In this work CRACM was used to quantify the projection biases between two different regions. The way it is done, however, ignores the topographical biases that exist within the source region. For example, figure 3D-F clearly shows a stark difference between the optically evoked responses in vHmPFC and vHBA neurons. This may indicate, as favored by the authors, a low connectivity between the BA and the vHmPFC, or, alternatively, a topographical bias within the BA, where different parts preferentially target vHmPFC and vHBA neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and apologise that our original description of our experimental design was not clear. As described in point 1 above, the aim of our study was to investigate the relative synaptic input from each BA input onto the different vH output populations. Therefore, for each experiment we carried out paired recordings – we recorded from a BA projecting neuron as well as a neighbouring NAc or PFC projecting neuron in the same slice. All of our comparisons are carried out solely across this internally controlled experiment. Therefore, in new Figure 4D-F (previously Figure 3D-F referred to by the reviewer) our results show that there is greater input onto BA- projecting neurons compared to neighbouring PFC -projecting neurons in the same slice, and the same topographical position, with the same viral injection, and stimulating the same axon terminals. We took pains to carry out our experiments in this difficult fashion in order to control for the large variability in the CRACM technique, as described above in detail by reviewer 1, and also by us in the response to point 1. As discussed above we have now substantially updated the results starting on p 6, line 36, and p 10, line 15 to make the reasoning behind our approach clear, and have added a substantial section to the discussion starting on p19, line 8 outlining the limitations of the CRACM technique, and how these can be mitigated by carrying out experiments in the way they have been carried out in our study.</p><p>Therefore, overall, our results therefore show this targeting is present despite the potential topographical variability suggested by the reviewer. We agree that the topographical distribution of connectivity is extremely interesting, and have directly investigated this in previous studies (e.g. Wee and MacAskill 2020). We have now added a section to the discussion on p 17, line 34 where we explicitly state it will be key to investigate how BAvH connectivity varies across vH topography in the future.</p><p>In addition, we agree that a very interesting future direction will be to investigate how unique nuclei in BA connect with each projection population in vH, and how this connectivity varies along each axis of the hippocampus. We have now added a new section to the discussion on p 16, line 22 highlighting this important future direction, where we note this will most likely require the use of intersectional genetic targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In real time place preference part, some of the manipulations were done with as few as 4 mice (ex. Figure 6K. 7C). The number of mice used in 6I is more reassuring.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and have now carried out a new cohort of mice for each of the KORD experimental groups in Figure 7 and 8, which allowed us to increase the <italic>n</italic> to at least 7 for each condition. We hope this is now satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– All the recordings were done with an unusually high concentration of the calcium chelator EGTA (10 mM). EGTA is more mobile compared to the endogenous calcium buffers, and this could enhance the diffusion of calcium and result in unintended consequences. For example, the high concentration of EGTA may reduce the basal level of intracellular calcium concentration which in turn may change the basal synaptic transmission. The authors should run a control showing the concentration of EGTA used here does not affect the basal transmission. This can be done with a 15-minute long paired recording of the optically-evoked responses from the excitatory neurons in the vH, with one cell filled with high EGTA (10 mM) and the other with low EGTA (0.5 mM).</p></disp-quote><p>Our voltage clamp internal contained QX-314 to block sodium channels, TEA and Cs to block potassium channels, and EGTA to buffer calcium. Our goal with the addition of each of these chemicals was to increase the accuracy of our voltage clamp recordings by removing potentially contaminating currents. Therefore, our internal solution is intentionally non physiological, as this helps with the interpretation of our experiments. 10 mM EGTA is often used in voltage clamp experiments where holding voltage is shifted between -70 and 0 mV as in our study (e.g. Rigby et al. 2015, Bats et al., 2012). In addition, as described in detail above, all of our recordings are investigating the relative input into a pair of neighbouring neurons in the same slice, any potential effect of this extra buffering would be equal for both of the recorded neurons, and so would be internally controlled.</p><p>Combined with our more detailed description of our internally controlled paired recording experimental setup (see point 1 above), we hope our explanation of the reasoning behind utilising EGTA in our internal will satisfy the reviewers concerns.</p><p>However, we do agree that future work should investigate the physiological consequences, and potential for plasticity in this pathway. We have now added a new section to the discussion to highlight this important point on p 18, line 40.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– SalB injection produces a modest hyperpolarization (2mV) (figure 6F). Whether this is sufficient to block action potential is not convincingly tested. The number of action potentials should be presented at more depolarized states (figure 6E).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that our previous manuscript did not more clearly describe our control experiments. These experiments were present in the original manuscript, in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1C (now Figure 7 —figure supplement 1C). We have now updated the text to explicitly reference these experiments more robustly on p 12, line 34. We hope that this will satisfy the reviewers concerns.</p></body></sub-article></article>
