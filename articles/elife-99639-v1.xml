To counter this threat, insects employ a variety of nano- and microstructures on their cuticular layer to manipulate and interact with light, enhancing antireflective properties and providing camouflage or reducing detectability by predators. Leafhoppers have a unique extracuticular coating called brochosome, yet its antireflective functions and protein composition remain unclear. Our study demonstrates strong antireflective properties of brochosomes, effectively reducing reflectance on the cuticle surface, especially in the ultraviolet spectrum, to improve evasion from visual predators. Furthermore, we identify four novel structural proteins of the brochosome (BSM) for the first time. Inhibiting their synthesis by RNAi alters brochosome morphology, impacting the optical properties of the cuticle surface. Evolutionary origin analysis of BSM suggests that brochosomes likely originated from a process involving duplication–divergence. Our study reveals that leafhoppers employ a unique camouflage strategy by secreting brochosomes as antireflection nanocoatings, enabling them to evade natural predators and contributing to their evolutionary success.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals have evolved various strategies to hide from or escape predators, one of which is camouflage. This adaptation helps animals blend into their surroundings using specific colors or patterns. However, many predators possess multispectral vision, enabling them to detect different wavelengths of light, which can make camouflage based on visible light ineffective.</p><p>Insects face substantial predation pressure from visual predators such as birds, reptiles and other arthropods. Many insects dwell in environments with low light reflectivity, such as leaves, tree bark, or soil, and any light reflection from their bodies could increase their visibility.</p><p>In response to these selective pressures, many insects have evolved specialized antireflective structures in their cuticle, wings and eyes. For example, leafhoppers have a unique coating on their cuticle known as the brochosome. Brochosomes are hollow, honeycomb-like spheres with a diameter ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 micrometers. They are produced in the excretory system called the Malpighian tubules and are secreted through the hindgut, where they are applied as a coating to the new cuticle after molting.</p><p>Brochosomes consist of lipids and proteins, but their exact composition and role remain unclear. Some researchers believe that brochosomes may serve as a protective barrier or antireflective layer. To investigate the camouflage role of brochosomes, Wu et al. used a combination of imaging and gene and protein analyses to study the brochosome coverage and UV reflectance in 5 to 25-day-old male and female leafhoppers of the Cicadellidae family.</p><p>The results indicated that older individuals had fewer brochosomes than younger ones. The experiments also revealed that brochosomes significantly reduced the reflection of ultraviolet light from the surface of leafhoppers by around 30% and diminished the reflectance of visible and infrared light.</p><p>Next, Wu et al. conducted predation experiments using jumping spiders known to prey on leafhoppers by analyzing the time of the first attack and the feeding behavior of the spider. The findings showed that jumping spiders preferred to attack older individuals with less brochosome coverage. This suggests that brochosomes are particularly beneficial for younger leafhoppers.</p><p>Gene and protein analyses identified four structural brochosome proteins. Experimentally blocking these proteins induced changes to the morphology of the brochosomes and modified the characteristics of the leafhoppers’ cuticle, including an increased diameter and structural deformation of the honeycomb architecture, alongside elevated UV reflectance. Phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding genes revealed that these proteins likely evolved through gene duplication events followed by a gradual accumulation of genetic modifications.</p><p>The study of Wu et al. demonstrates that brochosomes serve as an antireflective camouflage coating in leafhoppers to evade visual predators. The unique structure and composition of the lipids and proteins making up the brochosomes appear to be responsible for the antireflective properties of this coating. Further studies will advance our understanding of insect antipredator adaptations and evolutionary mechanisms underlying ecological niche specialization. Furthermore, they may provide biomimetic insights relevant for developing advanced camouflage technologies by emulating biological nanostructures such as brochosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brochosome</kwd><kwd>leafhopper</kwd><kwd>camouflage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U23A6006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jian-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U20A2036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jian-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32270150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Qianzhuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005315</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023J112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Leafhoppers evade predators using nanostructured brochosomes that reduce ultraviolet reflectance through morphology shaped by four novel structural proteins originating from evolutionary duplication–divergence processes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Predation exerts significant selective pressure on the evolution of various species, driving the development of antipredator strategies across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevens and Ruxton, 2019</xref>). Camouflage is a widely employed strategy, allowing animals to blend into their surroundings by adjusting their coloration and patterns to reduce detection by visual predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skelhorn and Rowe, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the presence of predators with multispectral vision, capable of perceiving nonvisible light spectra like infrared and ultraviolet (UV), can compromise traditional color and pattern-based camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stevens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thery and Gomez, 2010</xref>), paralleling the challenges of military camouflage under nonvisible light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xi et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, achieving alignment between an animal’s surface optical characteristics and its surroundings becomes a crucial requirement in visual camouflage strategies.</p><p>Insects, one of the most diverse animal groups on earth, contend with intense predation pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cinel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheikh et al., 2017</xref>). Many of their predators, including birds, reptiles, and predatory arthropods, rely on visual cues, with some possessing highly developed UV vision, where UV light plays a critical role in locating insect prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim and Ben-Yakir, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stobbe et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the natural backgrounds where insects reside, such as leaves, tree bark, and soil, exhibit minimal light reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endler, 1993</xref>). Consequently, light reflections originating from an insect’s body significantly elevate its risk of exposure to predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tovee, 1995</xref>). To counter this challenge, the various nano- and microstructural features of the insect cuticle have excellent antireflective properties that affect insect body coloration, reduce surface light reflection, and aid camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vukusic and Sambles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). The first instances of antireflective structures were observed in the compound eyes of moths, the corneas of which are covered by hexagonally arranged protrusions that are approximately 200 nm apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernhard, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clapham and Hutley, 1973</xref>). Subsequent research has revealed that antireflective structures are widespread on insect body surfaces, primarily found on compound eyes and wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stavenga et al., 2006</xref>). These nano- and microstructures on the cuticular layer are believed to possess antireflective properties, effectively minimizing light reflections from their bodies and thus preventing detection by predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stavenga et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), one of the largest insect families with over 22,000 species, possess unique extracuticular coating known as brochosome. Brochosomes, typically hollow, honeycomb-like spheres with a diameter ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 µm, are synthesized in the Malpighian tubules, secreted through the hindgut, and applied as a coating on the fresh cuticle following molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rakitov, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). Brochosomes primarily comprise lipids and proteins, with protein content ranging from 45% to 75%, but the exact proteins responsible for brochosome formation remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Some have proposed that brochosomes may serve as a protective layer on the leafhopper’s cuticle surface, with a potential role in enhancing the hydrophobicity of their cuticle surface, providing defense against pathogens and predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rakitov and Gorb, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). Apart from these known function of hydrophobicity and the shedding of brochosomes in helping leafhopper escape spider webs, there is currently no definitive biological evidence supporting other hypothesized functions of brochosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rakitov and Gorb, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rakitov and Gorb, 2013b</xref>). The camouflage role of leafhopper brochosomes was first hypothesized by Swain, who proposed that these structures reduce optical reflections to avoid predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swain, 1936</xref>). Subsequent development of bioinspired synthetic analogues has corroborated their antireflective efficacy, with experimental models demonstrating reduced target visibility under simulated predator vision paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Recent mechanistic investigations have further elucidated a geometry-dependent antireflective mechanism intrinsic to brochosome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). These findings collectively demonstrate that leafhoppers have evolved a unique antireflection strategy, distinct from conventional insect adaptations, to minimize surface reflectivity. Building upon this foundation, we hypothesize that brochosomes serve as an integumentary camouflage coating, operating through optical signature suppression to enhance crypsis against visual predators and ultimately improve ecological fitness.</p><p>In this study, we combined spectrophotometry, electron microscopy, transcriptome analysis, proteome analysis, gene function validation, and leafhopper and jumping spider bioassays to characterize the protein composition and the function of brochosome in leafhopper camouflage. We focused our research on the rice green leafhopper, <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>, a well-known agricultural pest with an extensive research history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hibino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Our results revealed the pronounced effectiveness of brochosome coverage in reducing light reflection on leafhoppers <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, especially within the scope of the UV spectrum. By conducting RNAi experiments, we successfully identified four brochosome structural protein for the first time. The suppression of their synthesis induced changes in brochosome morphology, influencing the optical characteristics of the leafhopper’s cuticle surface. Furthermore, our analysis of the evolutionary origin of brochosomes indicates that they likely originated through a process involving duplication–divergence. Our findings support brochosomes as a unique camouflage coating that enables leafhoppers to evade visual predators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brochosomes are a distinctive coating on the cuticle surface of leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic></title><p>The cuticle surface of rice green leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> is coated with brochosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which are approximately 350 nm in diameter and featuring a hollow sphere with a honeycomb-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

SEM results unveiled a gradual reduction in brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of both sexes as post-eclosion time progressed. Specifically, male coverage decreased from 90% to approximately 40%, whereas female coverage descended from 90% to around 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Microscopic analyses of the Malpighian tubule revealed that, with prolonged post-eclosion time, the distal segment of the tubule underwent gradual atrophy, particularly pronounced at 15 days post-eclosion. Notably, females exhibited a more marked atrophy in the distal segment compared to males. By 25 days post-eclosion, the distal segment of the Malpighian tubule in females became indistinguishable from other segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This denotes a progressive reduction in post-eclosion brochosome synthesis, resulting in a corresponding decrease in brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface. Furthermore, the distribution of brochosomes on the leafhopper cuticle surface may be correlated with its optical characteristics. To substantiate this hypothesis, we analyzed the light reflection characteristics of leafhopper forewings at various post-eclosion time points. The findings revealed a positive correlation between brochosome coverage on the forewings and light reflection values, underscoring the remarkable antireflective attributes of the brochosome coating on leafhopper cuticle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Brochosomal coverage was found to significantly decrease the reflectance of UV light on the leafhopper’s surface, reducing it from approximately 30% to 20%. Additionally, the reflectance of visible and infrared light was also notably diminished, dropping from around 20% to 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). In summary, the presence of brochosomal coverage resulted in an overall reduction of surface light reflection by approximately 30%, highlighting its substantial antireflective properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Preferential capture of leafhoppers with fewer brochosomes by jumping spiders</title><p>Given that UV light serves as a crucial visual cue for arthropod predators, especially common visual hunters like jumping spiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronin and Bok, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morehouse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silberglied, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), the function of the brochosome coating on leafhoppers' cuticle surface could be to avoid predation by reduction of UV light reflectance. This prompted us to investigate the effect of brochosome coatings on reducing predation risk in leafhoppers. Predation experiments were conducted using <italic>Plexippus paykulli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), a common jumping spider in rice fields known to prey on leafhoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We observed the spiders’ feeding behavior, noting the time of the first attack and the targeted leafhopper, using these metrics to evaluate predation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walker and Rypstra, 2002</xref>). In the experimental group comprising females and males at 5 days post-eclosion, <italic>P. paykulli</italic> did not exhibit a clear predation preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, in the experimental group involving females and males at 25 days post-eclosion, there was a higher probability of predation on female <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> compared to male ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For male <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> in both the 5-day and 25-day post-eclosion experimental groups, <italic>P. paykulli</italic> showed a stronger inclination towards preying on individuals that were eclosed for 25 days, resulting in significantly shorter predation times compared to those at 5 days post-eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These patterns were consistently observed for female leafhoppers in both the 5 days and 25 days post-eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The cumulative findings strongly suggest a distinct preference of the jumping spider <italic>P. paykulli</italic> for individuals with lower brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface. Based on these experiments, we proposed the hypothesis that the brochosome coating on the leafhopper cuticle surface may mitigate predation risk by reducing surface light reflection, particularly in the UV spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identifying the major structural proteins of brochosomes</title><p>Despite the initial discovery of brochosomes in the early 1950s and the confirmation in the 1960s that they are protein-lipid particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouranton and Maillet, 1967</xref>), the specific protein composition of brochosomes remains unknown. Recent studies suggested that they are primarily composed of brochosomins (BSM) and brochosome-associated proteins (BSAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). BSM, a novel class of secreted proteins with molecular weights ranging from 21 to 40 kDa, is considered the major structural component of brochosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). Proteomics studies have identified the proteins composing brochosomes, but the specific proteins involved in their formation remain unclear.</p><p>To further elucidate the essential protein components of brochosomes, transcriptomic and proteomic data derived from brochosome of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were comprehensively analyzed. Based on our prior integrated analysis of the brochosome transcriptome and proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2023</xref>), in conjunction with literature search results, we selected 50 candidate genes for functional analysis using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Through RNAi experiments, we successfully identified four genes encoding brochosome structural proteins that led to morphological changes in brochosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). According to the coding sequence (CDS) length of these genes, the four proteins were named as BSM-1 to BSM-4 (GenBank accession numbers PP273097, PP273098, PP273099, PP273100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Homology analysis suggested that BSM-coding genes might be paralogous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although BSM-2 and BSM-3 exhibited low sequence homology, their protein structures were highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To validate the functions of these four BSM-coding genes, we synthesized dsRNA from two nonoverlapping regions of each gene to test for off-target effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). RT-qPCR revealed that both individual and mixed dsRNA injections effectively suppressed the expression of the BSM-coding genes, with mixed injections achieving higher efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–J</xref>). SEM observations showed that nonoverlapping fragments of dsRNA targeting the same gene induced similar morphological changes in brochosomes. These were characterized by increased diameters and deformed honeycomb-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Statistical analysis of SEM data from mixed dsRNA injections indicated a 60–70% reduction in brochosome distribution area and a 20% incidence of morphologically abnormal brochosomes compared to dsGFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, temporal and spatial expression analyses demonstrated that the BSM-coding genes were specifically expressed in the Malpighian tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>) and exhibited relatively stable expression during the early post-eclosion period, followed by a gradual decline after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). By 25 days post-eclosion, the expression of BSM-coding genes declined to around 10% in females and 30–40% in males, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). This phenomenon is consistent with our initial microscopic observations, suggesting that the gradual reduction in brochosome synthesis contributes to the decrease of brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> after adulthood.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of brochosome structural proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphology of brochosomes on the forewing of leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 7 days post-microinjection with dsRNA mix targeting two nonoverlapping regions of each BSM gene.

To investigate the conservation of genes linked to brochosome synthesis in Cicadellidae, we systematically screened these four BSM coding genes across 116 other Hemipteran insect species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Results of homology analysis reveal that BSM coding genes are orphan genes restricted to the clade of Membracoidea. However, there are variations in the species distribution of different BSM coding genes. In Membracoidea species, homologous genes for BSM-3 and BSM-4 are observed, while BSM-2 is identified in Cicadellidae insects, and BSM-1 in Deltocephalinae insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). An intriguing observation is that in the majority of Cicadellidae species with confirmed brochosome distribution, homologous gene distribution for BSM-2 is detectable. In Cicadellidae species without brochosome distribution and in the majority of Membracidae, BSM-2 genes are largely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Since Membracidae evolved from Cicadellidae, we hypothesize that BSM homologous gene duplication/loss may be a key factor in brochosome formation/loss. In conclusion, our data suggest that in Cicadellidae, brochosome is synthesized by a conserved group of BSM coding genes, making it a widely distributed antireflective camouflage coating in Cicadellidae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Leafhoppers exhibit a distinctive grooming behavior, resulting in the deposition of a unique extracuticular coating known as brochosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). However, the precise characteristics and exact adaptive significance of this specialized coating remain largely unknown. Although they are widely believed to confer hydrophobicity, protecting leafhoppers from water and their own excreta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rakitov and Gorb, 2013a</xref>), similar functionalities are attributed to cuticular waxes on the external surfaces of various insects, including leafhoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, the functionalities of brochosomes may extend beyond this conventional understanding. In this study, we demonstrated that brochosomes exhibit robust antireflective properties, decreasing the reflectance of the leafhopper cuticle surface, particularly in the UV spectral range. This reduction may reduce visibility to visual predators, contributing to the evasion and predation avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vukusic and Sambles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, brochosomes function as a natural camouflage coating on the leafhopper cuticle surface, playing a pivotal role in reducing leafhoppers’ visibility to visual predators and offering a distinct advantage for their survival in predation scenarios as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Brochosomes serve as an antireflective camouflage coating on the cuticle surface of leafhoppers.</title><p>Brochosomes effectively reduce the reflection of various wavelengths of light, particularly in the UV region.

Previous studies suggested that arthropods employ various nanostructures formed by proteins, lipids, wax, or adhesive substances on their cuticle surfaces to achieve antireflectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silberglied, 1979</xref>). These nanostructures, initially identified in the compound eyes of moths, have been subsequently found to be widely distributed on the cuticle surfaces of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernhard, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clapham and Hutley, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stavenga et al., 2006</xref>). The nano- and microstructures on insect cuticle surfaces generate a gradual change in refractive index near the surface, leading to antireflectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of reflection reduction depends on the shape of these nanostructures, studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have confirmed that modifying the morphology of nanostructures in compound eyes directly impacts their optical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kryuchkov et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, a thorough examination of the structural protein composition of brochosome, coupled with RNAi-mediated suppression of BSM coding gene expression, yielded brochosomes with regular structure (ds<italic>GFP</italic> treatment) and structurally abnormal brochosomes (ds<italic>BSM</italic> treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). Subsequent in vitro experiments provided further evidence of the correlation between the normal structure of brochosome and its antireflective performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). This correlation is likely attributed to the fact that the diameter of the hollow pits in brochosome structure (approximately 100 nm) is considerably smaller than most spectral wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burks et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). As light passes through these small pits, it undergoes diffraction, while light passing through the ridges of brochosome induces scattering. The interference of diffracted and scattered light between different pits and ridges contributes to the observed extinction features in brochosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). Biomimetic material and mathematical modeling analyses have clarified the relationship between the extinction features of brochosome and the spacing between hollow pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the regular morphology of brochosome is a robust guarantee for its excellent antireflective performance.</p><p>Moreover, we noticed a distinct contrast in the antireflective capabilities when applying brochosomes with regular and irregular structures onto different substrates (quartz glass and brown planthopper wings), especially in the UV region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). This indicates that the reduction in reflected light is not only related to the structure of brochosome but also to other factors. SEM observations revealed that some brochosome is embedded in the grooves of the leafhopper cuticle surface or brown planthopper wings, which is not observed on the smooth surface of quartz glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). When the wavelength of light is higher than the size of the structure and the surface has a gradient refractive index, light interacts entirely with the rough surface, causing the light to gradually bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). Combined with the complex structure formed by brochosomes and nanostructures on the cuticle surface, this result in multiple internal reflections of light within these structures, increasing light absorption and significantly enhancing antireflective performance. Furthermore, the aromatic ring structures, conjugated double bonds, and peptide bonds in the proteins of both the cuticle and brochosomes may contribute to the absorption of UV light, providing another potential reason for their antireflective capabilities in the UV spectral region. Therefore, the antireflective performance of brochosome on the insect cuticle surface might be a result of the combined effect of brochosome and cuticular nanostructures.</p><p>UV light serves as a crucial visual cue for various insect predators, enhancing foraging, navigation, mating behavior, and prey identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronin and Bok, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morehouse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silberglied, 1979</xref>). Predators such as birds, reptiles, and predatory arthropods often rely on UV vision to detect prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Church et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). However, UV reflectance from insect cuticles can disrupt camouflage, increasing the risk of detection and predation, as natural backgrounds like leaves, bark, and soil typically reflect minimal UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tovee, 1995</xref>). To mitigate this risk, insects often possess antireflective cuticular structures that reduce UV and broad-spectrum light reflectance. This strategy is widespread among insects, including cicadas, dragonflies, and butterflies, and has been shown to decrease predator detection rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). For example, the compound eyes of moths feature hexagonal protuberances that reduce UV reflectance, aiding nocturnal concealment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stavenga et al., 2006</xref>). In butterflies, UV reflectance from eyespots on wings can attract predators, but reducing UV reflectance or eyespot size can lower predation risk and enhance camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyytinen et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, the reflection of UV light from the insect cuticle surface increases the risk of predation by disrupting camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tovee, 1995</xref>). In this study, we utilized the jumping spider <italic>P. paykulli</italic> to explore the impact of the brochosome coating on the leafhopper’s camouflage against predation. Hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders, are primary predators of leafhoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oraze and Grigarick, 1989</xref>), and the wavelength of UV light plays a crucial role as a visual cue for jumping spiders in identifying and locating their prey compared to the other wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). Our results revealed that <italic>P. paykulli</italic> displayed a preference for preying on <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> with a lower brochosome coverage on their cuticle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G–J</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H–I</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of brochosome and leafhopper cuticular microstructures exhibits superior antireflective performance in the UV region, effectively reducing UV reflection from leafhopper bodies and consequently diminishing the predator’s ability to identify them. Additionally, spectral measurement data indicated that the wing reflection spectrum of the brown planthopper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) closely resembled the body spectrum of 25-day-old female <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It is possible that, in the same living environment, other Hemipteran insects would be more conspicuous to visual predators than leafhoppers. Brochosome coating could provide an advantage for leafhoppers to evade visual predators, thereby enhancing their survival rates in interspecific competition. This adaptation could potentially favor the survival of Cicadellidae in environments with high predation pressure, allowing them to thrive in a wider range of environments. Additionally, within the leafhopper population, the brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of older individuals was notably lower than that of younger individuals, making elderly leafhoppers more susceptible to be detected and captured by predators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may help eliminate older individuals who have lost their reproductive capacity in the population, thereby ensuring the vitality and reproductive power of the population. Therefore, we consider brochosome, as a form of antireflective camouflage coating on the leafhopper’s cuticle surface, represents a more advanced evolutionary strategy against visual predation.</p><p>We successfully identified four proteins essential for the structure of brochosomes for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These BSM-encoded genes exhibit typical orphan gene characteristics, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Orphan genes originate from processes like de novo evolution, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and duplication–divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Light et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>). To elucidate the evolutionary origin of the four identified BSM genes, we aligned them with all prokaryotic genomes in NCBI and approximately 1000 arthropod genomes. Interestingly, the homologous genes of these BSM genes were exclusively found in leafhopper genomes in the family Cicadellidae, suggesting that the origin of these BSM genes might not be due to de novo evolution or horizontal gene transfer. Combining the species distribution of the four identified BSM genes (as well as their homology) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we hypothesize that the BSMs were potentially originated from a process involving duplication–divergence. In this scenario, a new gene would be created through gene duplication or transposition, undergoing fast adaptive evolution and losing similarity to the original gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Light et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>). For instance, BSM-4 is widely present in Membracoidea species and also has homologous genes in <italic>Clastoptera arizonana</italic> of Cereopoidea, indicating that BSM-4 may have a common ancestral gene in Cicadomorpha. The specialization of the distal segment of the Malpighian tubule is a characteristic shared by the three major lineages of the infraorder Cicadomorpha: Cercopoidea (spittle-bugs), Cicadoidea (cicadas), and Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakitov, 2002</xref>). Cicadas coat the surface of their burrows with secretions from the Malpighian tubules, spittlebug nymphs have their integuments covered with foam synthesized by the Malpighian tubules, and leafhoppers coat their integuments with brochosomes synthesized by the Malpighian tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakitov, 2002</xref>). The different demands for secretions from the Malpighian tubules among these insects may be the main reason for the rapid adaptive evolution of BSM genes.</p><p>Among Auchenorrhyncha insects, most Cicadellidae (leafhoppers) secrete brochosomes, while many Membracidae (treehoppers) exhibit grooming behavior but lack specialized setae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rakitov, 1996</xref>). Considering that Membracidae are derived from Cicadellidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 2001</xref>), the formation of the symbiotic relationship between treehoppers and ants might due to the loss of brochosome synthesis capability. Ants create a protective environment around treehoppers, deterring threats and reducing predation pressure, providing a relatively secure living environment, leading to lower predation pressure compared to leafhoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Claro and Oliveira, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson and Mooney, 2022</xref>). Consequently, the need for the protective disguise represented by brochosomes is likely diminished. We hypothesize that environmental changes drive brochosome evolution, supported by the distribution of BSM-2 and BSM-3 paralogs in Auchenorrhyncha. BSM-3 homologs are widespread in Auchenorrhyncha, while BSM-2 is restricted to brochosome-secreting Cicadellidae and absent in most Membracidae. The high structural homology between BSM-2 and BSM-3, despite low sequence similarity, suggests that BSM-2 arose from BSM-3 duplication. We propose that gene duplication/loss events are the primary factors underlying differences in brochosome synthesis between Cicadellidae and Membracidae. Gene duplication/loss is a common mechanism for functional gain/loss in eukaryotes, promoting protein diversity and redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong and Belov, 2012</xref>). Thus, gene duplication may be a key driver of brochosome formation and functional diversity in leafhoppers.</p><p>In summary, our research has underscored the indispensable role of brochosomes as an essential antireflective camouflage coating for leafhoppers, conferring a significant advantage in evading visually oriented predators. We have identified four key BSM encoding genes, a groundbreaking discovery in brochosome research, which suggests that gene duplication may be involved in the formation of these adaptive structures. Our study not only deepens our understanding of leafhoppers' antipredator strategies but also sheds light on the distinct evolutionary trajectories employed by these insects within their ecological niche. This contributes to the development of biomimicry and the advancement of state-of-the-art camouflage technologies. Furthermore, while our study has provided valuable insights into the structure and function of brochosomes, there are still gaps in our knowledge regarding the evolutionary origins of BSMs. Future research should aim to fill these gaps as a more comprehensive understanding of BSMs and their role in brochosome formation will enhance our appreciation of the complex evolutionary processes that have shaped these unique structures. Additionally, the analysis of BSMs in a broader range of leafhopper species will help elucidate the relationship between BSM composition and the morphological and functional diversity of brochosomes, further informing our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of this insect group.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insect</title><p>The leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> and <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> adults were collected from a rice field in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, China, in September 2020. <italic>P. alienus</italic> adults were collected from a wheat field in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, in May 2020. <italic>E. onukii</italic> adult were collected from a tea garden in Fuzhou, Fijian Province, China, in May 2020.

The full-length sequence of these genes was obtained using by 5’-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3’-RACE using SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ Kit (Clontech, USA).</p><p>To analyze the temporal expression profiles of four brochosome structural protein-coding genes (GenBank accession numbers PP273097, PP273098, PP273099, PP273100), the whole body, salivary gland, midgut, ovary, and testis were dissected from 200 adult insects, total RNA in different tissue were extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The relative expression of these genes in different tissues of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> adults was detected by RT-qPCR assay using a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The detected transcript levels were normalized to the transcript level of the housekeeping gene elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) (GenBank accession number AB836665) and estimated by the 2−△△Ct (cycle threshold) method. Using the same procedure, the expression levels of these brochosome structural protein-coding genes were evaluated in female and male adult leafhoppers at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days post-eclosion.</p><p>To investigate the effects of four BSM-encoding genes on brochosome morphology and distribution, dsRNAs were designed to target two nonoverlapping regions within the sequences of these genes. These dsRNAs were microinjected into the abdomens of leafhoppers both individually and in combination, with dsRNA targeting GFP serving as a negative control. Following a 7-day incubation period post-injection, changes in BSM gene expression were assessed in both control and treated groups via RT-qPCR. The morphology and distribution of brochosomes on the leafhopper cuticle were examined and documented using SEM. Additionally, ImageJ software was employed to quantify the proportion of morphologically abnormal brochosomes and the distribution area of brochosomes on the cuticle surface after injection of the dsRNA mixtures targeting the two nonoverlapping regions of each BSM gene, as well as after dsGFP treatment. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> contains a list of the primers used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Knocking down in vivo expression of BSM-coding genes in <italic>N. cincticeps</italic></title><p>Following the prior procedure, dsRNA produced from four BSM-coding genes was injected into the abdomen of fifth-instar nymphs of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> by microinjection, and a control group injected with ds<italic>GFP</italic> was established.

Subsequently, the forewings of the leafhoppers were meticulously dissected, and the specular reflectance spectra of the forewings (25 × 25 μm) were precisely measured utilizing a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies, Inc). UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra (250–1000 nm) were obtained using a ×10 UV-absorbing glass objective lens, with a minimum of five replicates per sample.

Next, using a pipette, carefully drop the brochosome solution onto quartz slides and brown planthopper wings. Allow the acetone to completely evaporate at room temperature. At the same time, we also set up quartz slides and brown planthopper wings that were treated with acetone alone as negative controls. Prepared quartz slides and brown planthopper wings can be observed under SEM to examine the distribution of brochosomes. Specular reflectance measurements of quartz substrates and brown planthopper wing sections (10 × 10 μm) were performed using a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies, Inc). Reflectance spectra were systematically acquired across the 250–1000 nm spectral range, with a minimum of five replicates per sample.</p><p>To investigate the correlation between BSM proteins and the optical characteristics of brochosomes, the four genes encoding BSM proteins were separately cloned into pET-28a or pGEX-4T2 vectors. Following induction, the expressed proteins were purified from cell lysates via batch affinity chromatography using either glutathione (GSH) agarose or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose, depending on the fusion tag. GST protein was produced following the identical protocol from cells harboring the empty pGEX-4T2 vector. The purified BSM fusion proteins and GST protein were normalized to an equivalent OD280 value. These protein solutions were then meticulously spotted onto quartz slides and permitted to dry completely at ambient temperature. In parallel, quartz slides treated exclusively with PBS served as negative controls.

They hypothesize that brochosomes reduce light reflection on the leafhopper's body surface, aiding in predator avoidance. Their hypothesis is supported by experiments involving jumping spiders. Additionally, the authors employ a variety of techniques including micro-UV-Vis spectroscopy, electron microscopy, transcriptome and proteome analysis, and bioassays. This study is highly interesting, and the experimental data is well-organized and logically presented.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The use of brochosomes as a camouflage coating has been hypothesized since 1936 (R.B. Swain, Entomol. News 47, 264-266, 1936) with evidence demonstrated by similar synthetic brochosome systems in a number of recent studies (S. Yang, et al. Nat. Commun. 8:1285, 2017; L. Wang, et al., PNAS. 121: e2312700121, 2024). However, direct biological evidence or relevant field studies have been lacking to directly support the hypothesis that brochosomes are used for camouflage. This work provides the first biological evidence demonstrating that natural brochosomes can be used as a camouflage coating to reduce the leafhoppers' observability to their predators. The design of the experiments is novel.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The observation that brochosome coatings become sparse after 25 days in both male and female leafhoppers, resulting in increased predation by jumping spiders, is intriguing. However, since leafhoppers consistently secrete and groom brochosomes, it would be beneficial to explore why brochosomes become significantly less dense after 25 days.</p><p>(2) The authors demonstrate that brochosome coatings reduce UV (specular) reflection compared to surfaces without brochosomes, which can be attributed to the rough geometry of brochosomes as discussed in the literature. However, it would be valuable to investigate whether the proteins forming the brochosomes are also UV absorbing.</p><p>(3) The experiments with jumping spiders show that brochosomes help leafhoppers avoid predators to some extent. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the exact mechanism behind this camouflage effect. Specifically, why does reduced UV reflection aid in predator avoidance? If predators are sensitive to UV light, how does the reduced UV reflectance specifically contribute to evasion?</p><p>(4) An important reference regarding the moth-eye effect is missing. Please consider including the following paper: Clapham, P. B., and M. C. Hutley. &quot;Reduction of lens reflection by the 'Moth Eye' principle.&quot; Nature 244: 281-282 (1973).</p><p>(5) The introduction should be revised to accurately reflect the related contributions in literature. Specifically, the novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the camouflage effect of brochosomes using jumping spiders, which is verified for the first time in leafhoppers. However, the proposed use of brochosome powder for camouflage was first described by R.B. Swain (R.B. Swain, Notes on the oviposition and life history of the leafhopper Oncometopta undata Fabr. (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), Entomol. News. 47: 264-266 (1936)). Recently, the antireflective and potential camouflage functions of brochosomes were further studied by Yang et al. based on synthetic brochosomes and simulated vision techniques (S. Yang, et al. &quot;Ultra-antireflective synthetic brochosomes.&quot; Nature Communications 8: 1285 (2017)). Later, Lei et al. demonstrated the antireflective properties of natural brochosomes in 2020 (C.-W. Lei, et al., &quot;Leafhopper wing-inspired broadband omnidirectional antireflective embroidered ball-like structure arrays using a nonlithography-based methodology.&quot; Langmuir 36: 5296-5302 (2020)). Very recently, Wang et al. successfully fabricated synthetic brochosomes with precise geometry akin to those natural ones, and further elucidated the antireflective mechanisms based on the brochosome geometry and their role in reducing the observability of leafhoppers to their predators (L. Wang et al. &quot;Geometric design of antireflective leafhopper brochosomes.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 121: e2312700121 (2024)).</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In this revision, the authors have addressed some of the key concerns I raised in our previous comments. However, a few issues remain unaddressed. Additionally, the new experimental data introduced in the manuscript require further clarification, which I outline below.</p><p>(1) As I pointed out in my previous review comments, &quot;The use of brochosomes as a camouflage coating has been hypothesized since 1936 (R.B. Swain, Entomol. News 47, 264-266, 1936) with evidence demonstrated by similar synthetic brochosome systems in a number of recent studies (S. Yang, et al. Nat. Commun. 8:1285, 2017; L. Wang, et al., PNAS. 121: e2312700121, 2024). However, direct biological evidence or relevant field studies have been lacking to directly support the hypothesis that brochosomes are used for camouflage.&quot; While the authors did cite the original hypothesis proposed by R.B. Swain (1936), they have omitted important references that provide evidence on the use of antireflective properties of brochosomes for camouflage in a synthetic setting (see for example, Fig. 5a of S. Yang, et al. Nat. Commun. 8:1285, 2017). The authors are recommended to revise the Abstract and Introduction accordingly to ensure a fair and accurate representation of the existing literature.</p><p>(2) The antireflection mechanisms of brochosome structures have been discussed in detail, specifically, how their geometries (i.e., brochosome diameter and pore size) contribute to reducing UV reflectance (L. Wang, et al., PNAS. 121: e2312700121, 2024 and P. Banergee, et al., Advanced Photonics Research 4:2200343, 2023). The authors should incorporate these recent findings into their discussion (line 381 - line 383 of the manuscript).</p><p>(3) The authors presented new data brochosomes deposited on a quartz slide and measured their reflectance across UV, visible light, and infrared wavelengths. Since reflectance is highly sensitive to the uniformity of brochosome coverage on the substrate, it is crucial to quantify this coverage across the measurement area for comparison. While the authors include SEM images to illustrate the packing of brochosomes on both the leafhopper wing and the quartz substrate (Fig. S7) at a microscopic scale (~10 um view), it would be beneficial to also provide SEM images at a larger scale (e.g., 100 um - 1 mm) and quantify the density of brochosomes per unit area for comparison.</p><p>(4) For the negative control using acetone to remove the brochosomes the leafhopper wing, have the authors confirmed the absence of brochosomes after treatment? If so, the authors should explicitly indicate this for clarity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99639.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Qianzhuo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Zhuang-Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>Zhenfeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ZheJiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Hong-Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jun-Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chuan-Xi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jian-Ping</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ningbo University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ningbo</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Evading predation is of utmost importance for most animals and camouflage is one of the predominant mechanisms.

This may seem little to have an effect in real life. On the other hand, the in vivo predation tests confirm an influence. Hence, this is not a real weakness of the study - just a note to reconsider the wording for describing the degree of reflectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. Based on your recommendations, we have revised the manuscript accordingly. Although the absolute reduction in light reflection due to Brochosomal coverage is approximately 10%, the relative decrease in light reflection on the leafhopper's surface is nearly 30%. Specifically, in the ultraviolet region, the reflection is reduced from about 30% to 20%, and in the visible light region, it is reduced from 20% to 10%. For detailed revisions, please refer to lines 151-156 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The single gene knockdowns seemed to lead to a very low penetrance of malformed brochosomes (Figure Supplement 3). Judging from the overview slides, less than 1% of brochosomes may have been affected. A quantification of regular versus abnormal particles in both, wildtype and RNAi treatments would have helped to exclude that the shown aberrant brochosomes did not just reflect a putative level of &quot;normal&quot; background defects. Of note, the quadruple knock-down of all BSMs seemed to lead to a high penetrance (Figure 4), which was already reflected in the microtubule production line. While the data shown are convincing, a quantification might strengthen the argument.</p><p>While the RNAi effects seemed to be very specific to brochosomes and therefore very likely specific, an off-target control for RNAi was still missing. Finding the same/similar phenotype with a non-overlapping dsRNA fragment in one off-target experiment is usually considered required and sufficient. Further, the details of the targeted sequence will help future workers on the topic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. Based on your recommendations, we have synthesized dsRNA targeting two non-overlapping regions of the coding sequences for four Brochosomal structural protein genes. These dsRNAs were injected individually and in combination for each gene. Our RNAi experiments for each BSM gene demonstrated that both individual and combined injections significantly suppressed the expression of the target genes, with the combined injection yielding slightly better silencing efficiency. Statistical analysis of the SEM observations revealed that the combined injection of dsRNAs targeting two non-overlapping regions led to a 60-70% reduction in the surface area coverage of Brochosomes. Additionally, approximately 20% of the remaining Brochosomes exhibited significant morphological changes. For detailed revisions, please refer to lines 199-211 of the revised manuscript, as well as Figures 3A and 3C, and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main weakness in the current manuscript may be the phylogenetic analysis and the model of how the genes evolved. Several aspects were not clearly or consistently stated such that I felt unsure about what the authors actually think. For instance: Are all the 4 BSMs related to each other or only BSM2 and 3? If so, not only BSM2 and 3 would be called &quot;paralogs&quot; but also the other BSMs. If they were all related, then a phylogenetic tree including all BSMs should be shown to visualize the relatedness (including the putative ancestral gene if that is the model of the authors). Actually, I was not sure about how the authors think about the emergence of the BSMs. Are they real orphan genes (i.e. not present outside the respective clade) or was there an ancestral gene that was duplicated and diverged to form the BSMs? Where in the phylogeny does the first of the BSMs or ancestral proteins emerge (is the gene found in Clastoptera arizonana the most ancestral one?)? Maybe, the evolution of the BSMs would have to be discussed individually for each gene as they show somewhat different patterns of emergence and loss (BSM-4 present in all species, the others with different degrees of phylogenetic restriction).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your constructive feedback on our phylogenetic analysis and the modeling of gene evolution. We fully agree with your insights and acknowledge that the evolutionary analysis of BSM genes remains somewhat ambiguous. This ambiguity is primarily due to the limited research on the precise structural protein composition of Brochosomes. While proteomics studies have analyzed and discussed the structural proteins of Brochosomes, the accurate composition of these proteins is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified four BSM proteins, but given the intricate structure of Brochosomes as proteinaceous spheres, we believe there may be additional BSM genes that have not yet been identified. Moreover, despite the presence of over ten thousand species within the Cicadomorpha, only three species have genome sequences available, and fewer than a hundred species have transcriptome sequencing data. The scarcity of research on Brochosomes, as well as the limited availability of genomic and transcriptomic data, poses significant challenges for our phylogenetic analysis and understanding of BSM gene evolution.</p><p>Based on your suggestions, we have revised the manuscript accordingly. Specifically, we have updated Figure 5C by including ten additional species from Cereopoidea, Cicadoidea, and Fulgoroidea to better illustrate that BSM genes are true orphan genes. We have also added a phylogenetic tree of BSM genes within Cicadidae in Supplementary Figure 3. Additionally, we have expanded the discussion of BSM gene evolution in the manuscript (lines 503-556). For detailed revisions, please refer to Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 3, and lines 507-585 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to these questions I remained unsure about some details in Figure 5. On what kind of analysis is the phylogeny based? Why are some species not colored, although they are located on the same branch as colored ones? What is the measure for homology values - % identity/similarity? The homology labels for Nephotetix cincticeps and N. virescens seem to be flipped: the latter is displayed with 100% identity for all genes with all proteins while the former should actually show this. As a consequence of these uncertainties, I could not fully follow the respective discussion and model for gene evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful comments and suggestions. We have carefully considered your feedback and have thoroughly revised our manuscript accordingly. Specifically, we have enhanced the description of the phylogenetic analysis process to provide greater clarity and transparency, with the detailed methods now included in lines 789-798. Regarding Figure 5C, we appreciate your attention to the coloring scheme. We would like to clarify that the family Cicadellidae comprises 25 subfamilies, many of which are represented by only one species in our figure. To ensure clarity and meaningful representation, we have chosen to color only those subfamilies with more than three species, thereby avoiding visual clutter and emphasizing the most relevant taxonomic groups. Additionally, we have corrected the inverted homology labels for <italic>Nephotetix cincticeps</italic> and <italic>Nephotetix virescens</italic> to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our data presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The authors successfully tested their hypothesis in a multidisciplinary approach and convincingly assigned a new biological function to the brochosomes system. The results fully support their claims - only the quantification of the penetrance in the RNAi experiments would be helpful to strengthen the point. The author's analysis of the evolution of BSM genes remained a bit vague and I remained unsure about their respective conclusions.</p><p>The work is a very interesting study case of the evolutionary emergence of a new system to evade predators. Based on this study, the function of the BSM genes could now be studied in other species to provide insights into putative ancestral functions. Further, studying the self-assembly of such highly regular complex nano-structures will be strongly fostered by the identification of the four key structural genes.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Main manuscript:</p><p>Please consider the annotated pdf with suggestions for wording and comments at the authors' discretion:</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your detailed suggestions and comments provided in the annotated PDF.

They hypothesize that brochosomes reduce light reflection on the leafhopper's body surface, aiding in predator avoidance. Their hypothesis is supported by experiments involving jumping spiders. Additionally, the authors employ a variety of techniques including micro-UV-Vis spectroscopy, electron microscopy, transcriptome and proteome analysis, and bioassays. This study is highly interesting, and the experimental data is well-organized and logically presented.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The use of brochosomes as a camouflage coating has been hypothesized since 1936 (R.B. Swain, Entomol. News 47, 264-266, 1936) with evidence demonstrated by similar synthetic brochosome systems in a number of recent studies (S. Yang, et al. Nat. Commun. 8:1285, 2017; L. Wang, et al., PNAS. 121: e2312700121, 2024). However, direct biological evidence or relevant field studies have been lacking to directly support the hypothesis that brochosomes are used for camouflage. This work provides the first biological evidence demonstrating that natural brochosomes can be used as a camouflage coating to reduce the leafhoppers' observability of their predators. The design of the experiments is novel.</p></disp-quote><p>We are extremely grateful for your positive feedback and insightful comments on our manuscript. We are delighted that you have recognized the efforts we have put into our research on how brochosomes serve as a camouflage coating to reduce the detectability of leafhoppers to their predators. We have carefully considered your suggestions and have thoroughly revised the manuscript to address the shortcomings of the original version. We hope that the revised version meets with your approval. Below, please find our detailed point-by-point responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The observation that brochosome coatings become sparse after 25 days in both male and female leafhoppers, resulting in increased predation by jumping spiders, is intriguing. However, since leafhoppers consistently secrete and groom brochosomes, it would be beneficial to explore why brochosomes become significantly less dense after 25 days.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions. We appreciate your interest in the reduction of brochosomal density on the surface of leafhoppers after 25 days.We believe that the primary reason for the decreased density of brochosomes on the leafhopper surface after 25 days is the reduced synthesis and secretion of brochosomes. The Malpighian tubules are the main sites for brochosome synthesis. As shown in Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 1, the thick glandular segments of the Malpighian tubules in both male and female leafhoppers begin to atrophy 15 days after reaching adulthood. This indicates a gradual decline in brochosome synthesis and secretion after day 15 of adulthood. Following your suggestion, we have revised the discussion section of the manuscript to elaborate on this observation. The detailed changes can be found in lines 474-491 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors demonstrate that brochosome coatings reduce UV (specular) reflection compared to surfaces without brochosomes, which can be attributed to the rough geometry of brochosomes as discussed in the literature. However, it would be valuable to investigate whether the proteins forming the brochosomes are also UV absorbing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions. Following your advice, we have successfully expressed four BSM genes in a prokaryotic system, purified the corresponding proteins, and applied them to quartz glass surfaces. We then measured the light reflectance of the quartz glass surfaces coated with these purified proteins. The results showed that the purified BSM proteins did not exhibit better antireflective properties compared to the control GST protein. For more details, please refer to Supplementary Figure 8 in the revised manuscript. We believe that the excellent antireflective properties of brochosomes are fundamentally due to their unique geometric shapes. The hollow pores within the brochosomes, with diameters of approximately 100 nm, are significantly smaller than most wavelengths in the visible spectrum. When light passes through these tiny pores, diffraction occurs, while light passing through the ridges of the brochosomes causes scattering. The interference between the diffracted and scattered light from these pores and ridges results in the observed extinction characteristics of brochosomes. We have incorporated these insights into the discussion section of the revised manuscript (lines 416-425 and lines 432-442 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The experiments with jumping spiders show that brochosomes help leafhoppers avoid predators to some extent. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the exact mechanism behind this camouflage effect. Specifically, why does reduced UV reflection aid in predator avoidance? If predators are sensitive to UV light, how does the reduced UV reflectance specifically contribute to evasion?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions. Based on your advice, we have included a detailed discussion on how reducing ultraviolet (UV) reflection can help insects avoid predation. The revised content can be found in lines 445-460 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>“UV light serves as a crucial visual cue for various insect predators, enhancing foraging, navigation, mating behavior, and prey identification (Cronin &amp; Bok, 2016; Morehouse et al., 2017; Silberglied, 1979). Predators such as birds, reptiles, and predatory arthropods often rely on UV vision to detect prey (Church et al., 1998; Li &amp; Lim, 2005; Zou et al., 2011). However, UV reflectance from insect cuticles can disrupt camouflage, increasing the risk of detection and predation, as natural backgrounds like leaves, bark, and soil typically reflect minimal UV light (Endler, 1997; Li &amp; Lim, 2005; Tovee, 1995). To mitigate this risk, insects often possess anti-reflective cuticular structures that reduce UV and broad-spectrum light reflectance. This strategy is widespread among insects, including cicadas, dragonflies, and butterflies, and has been shown to decrease predator detection rates (Hooper et al., 2006; Siddique et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2006). For example, the compound eyes of moths feature hexagonal protuberances that reduce UV reflectance, aiding nocturnal concealment (Blagodatski et al., 2015; Stavenga et al., 2005). In butterflies, UV reflectance from eyespots on wings can attract predators, but reducing UV reflectance or eyespot size can lower predation risk and enhance camouflage (Chan et al., 2019; Lyytinen et al., 2004). Hence, the reflection of ultraviolet light from the insect cuticle surface increases the risk of predation by disrupting camouflage (Tovee, 1995)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) An important reference regarding the moth-eye effect is missing. Please consider including the following paper: Clapham, P. B., and M. C. Hutley. &quot;Reduction of lens reflection by the 'Moth Eye' principle.&quot; Nature 244: 281-282 (1973).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out the omission of the important reference on the “moth eye” effect. We sincerely apologize for the oversight. Based on your suggestion, we have now included the seminal paper by Clapham and Hutley (1973) in the revised manuscript. The reference has been added to both the Introduction and Discussion sections to provide a more comprehensive context for our discussion on anti-reflective structures in insects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The introduction should be revised to accurately reflect the related contributions in literature. Specifically, the novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the camouflage effect of brochosomes using jumping spiders, which is verified for the first time in leafhoppers. However, the proposed use of brochosome powder for camouflage was first described by R.B. Swain (R.B. Swain, Notes on the oviposition and life history of the leafhopper Oncometopta undata Fabr. (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), Entomol. News. 47: 264-266 (1936)). Recently, the antireflective and potential camouflage functions of brochosomes were further studied by Yang et al. based on synthetic brochosomes and simulated vision techniques (S. Yang, et al. &quot;Ultra-antireflective synthetic brochosomes.&quot; Nature Communications 8: 1285 (2017)). Later, Lei et al. demonstrated the antireflective properties of natural brochosomes in 2020 (C.-W. Lei, et al., &quot;Leafhopper wing-inspired broadband omnidirectional antireflective embroidered ball-like structure arrays using a nonlithography-based methodology.&quot; Langmuir 36: 5296-5302 (2020)). Very recently, Wang et al. successfully fabricated synthetic brochosomes with precise geometry akin to those natural ones, and further elucidated the antireflective mechanisms based on the brochosome geometry and their role in reducing the observability of leafhoppers to their predators (L. Wang et al. &quot;Geometric design of antireflective leafhopper brochosomes.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 121: e2312700121 (2024)).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions regarding the revision of the introduction to accurately reflect the relevant contributions in the literature.
