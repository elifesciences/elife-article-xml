Ischemic strokes make up approximately 80% of all stroke cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krishnamurthi et al., 2013</xref>). PSE is a common complication, with studies showing that 3–30% of stroke patients develop epilepsy, which worsens their prognosis and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). PSE can exacerbate cognitive, psychiatric, and physical impairments caused by cerebrovascular disease and related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sahli et al., 2023</xref>). The highest incidence of PSE occurs within the first year after an acute stroke, representing nearly half of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galovic et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, early prediction and intervention for PSE, especially in ischemic strokes, are essential.</p><p>Currently, most studies rely on clinical data to build statistical models using survival analysis, Cox regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), and multiple linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merkler et al., 2018</xref>) to predict PSE. Last year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2023</xref> developed a radiomics-based model that outperformed conventional clinical models in predicting PSE related to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), suggesting that a combined radiomics-clinical model could improve individual risk assessment of PSE after the first ICH, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. However, later research raised concerns about the use of radiomics, indicating the need for further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pszczolkowski and Law, 2023</xref>). Overall, research on PSE prediction remains limited, with most studies focusing on specific risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waafi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzig-Nichtweiß et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitkänen et al., 2016</xref>) and building basic models, rather than proposing more comprehensive and scientifically robust prediction models.</p><p>Machine learning has gained recognition as a powerful tool for developing medical models, due to its ability to process large datasets and handle complex information. It has been increasingly applied in neuroscience and clinical prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Naamani et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daidone et al., 2024</xref>). Previous studies have used machine learning to explore post-stroke cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), predict stroke and myocardial infarction risk in patients with large artery vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2023</xref>), develop post-stroke depression models using liver function tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2023</xref>), and predict hematoma expansion in traumatic brain injury (TBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2024</xref>). Machine learning models can automatically capture both linear and complex nonlinear relationships between variables, providing insights into how different factors contribute to the prediction target—something traditional statistical models struggle with. However, machine learning requires large datasets and is prone to overfitting when sample sizes are small. The quality and quantity of input data are critical for the algorithm to detect patterns and make accurate predictions.</p><p>This study aims to identify key risk factors from features extracted from clinical records and test data of ischemic stroke patients. Using these features, a machine learning-based model will be developed to predict PSE. By leveraging early admission data, the goal is to automatically predict the likelihood of PSE occurrence, guiding clinical decision-making and patient care.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Filling of missing data</title><p>Missing values were imputed using a Random Forest (RF) model, addressing one feature at a time.

Among general characteristics, females had a higher PSE rate. A higher NIHSS was associated with an increased incidence of PSE. Elevated WBC, D-dimer, CRP, AST, CK-MB, HbA1c, bilirubin, TCO2, and LDH levels at admission were linked to a greater likelihood of developing PSE. Conversely, lower levels of HBDH, Plt, and APTT were also associated with a higher risk of PSE. Specific brain regions did not have a significant individual effect on the outcome. Among complications, hypertension was more strongly associated with PSE development, while conditions such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver were less likely to be related. A force plot for the first patient illustrated the influence of different features on the prediction. In this case, a prolonged APTT time contributed the most to PSE, followed by elevated AST levels, while a low NIHSS negatively impacted the final result.

Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sahli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamada et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that age below 65 is a high-risk factor, which aligns with this findings, while other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lidetu and Zewdu, 2023</xref>) indicate that advanced age is the key factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamada et al., 2020</xref> supported the results, showing that female patients have a higher risk of complications, while (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waafi et al., 2023</xref>) reported that male patients are 3.325 times more likely to develop complications, contradicting these results.</p><p>Previous research indicates that patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, depression, or dementia are at higher risk of developing vascular epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitkänen et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, statistical analysis and multiple ML models examined the relationship between comorbidities and complications. Patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes, fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, or large artery stenosis or plaques (CCA and ICA) were found to be less likely to develop epilepsy. According to the TOAST classification, ischemic stroke is divided into five categories: large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small vessel occlusion, other determined etiology, and undetermined etiology. Patients with multiple comorbidities often fall into the large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism categories, which are more clearly defined and easier to treat, resulting in a lower likelihood of epilepsy. In contrast, strokes of undetermined etiology tend to have worse prognoses and a higher likelihood of leading to epilepsy. Among patients with diabetes, higher HbA1c levels indicate poor blood sugar control and a higher risk of complications. Better blood sugar control was associated with a lower overall risk of developing complications.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lekoubou et al., 2023</xref> reported that cortical infarction is more likely to lead to epilepsy in patients hospitalized with anterior circulation ischemic stroke. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2023</xref> also found that factors such as cortical involvement and intracerebral hemorrhage volume increase the likelihood of PSE, aligning with the statistical result findings. Al-Sahli et al. suggested that cortical brain injury and large-area lesions elevate the risk of PSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sahli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamada et al., 2020</xref>). According to the statistical results, both cortical and subcortical involvement were associated with an increased likelihood of PSE, but these regions had a smaller influence compared to other features and were not selected in LASSO regression.</p><p>Previous studies have identified acute infection as a risk factor for ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bova et al., 1996</xref>). CRP, which reflects inflammation levels, is an independent prognostic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Napoli et al., 2001</xref>). Both regression and SHAP analysis of the results indicated that WBC had a significant impact among routine blood test parameters, even surpassing NIHSS in SHAP analysis. A high WBC may indicate severe inflammation or infection, as well as increased blood viscosity, predisposing patients to secondary complications. High RBC and low Plt counts were also associated with an increased risk of complications.</p><p>A large-scale study on Chinese individuals found a negative correlation between plasma HDL and the risk of ischemic stroke, a weak positive correlation between TG levels and stroke risk, and a strong correlation between LDL and apolipoprotein B levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). High HDL levels are linked to better prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandeali and Farmer, 2012</xref>). The data analysis and model interpretation results align with these findings, showing that high LDL, low HDL, and elevated TG levels are more likely to result in PSE. This can be explained by high cholesterol and TG levels increasing blood viscosity and contributing to vascular sclerosis, promoting clot formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitkänen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasparini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira et al., 2020</xref>). Higher D-dimer levels indicate more significant brain tissue damage, increasing the likelihood of PSE. In general, lower APTT and fibrinogen levels are associated with higher PSE risk, while INR, PT, and TT have smaller impacts. Among liver function indicators, AST had the greatest influence on PSE. High AST, low ALT, and low albumin levels also had some impact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2023</xref> reported that liver enzyme subgroups defined by ALT and AST were linked to higher risks of adverse outcomes, consistent with this findings.</p><p>Studies have shown that renal function biomarkers such as urinary microalbumin, cystatin C, and creatinine are associated with higher stroke recurrence rates and poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2023</xref>). In the light of statistical results, low urea levels and high uric acid levels had a negative impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Elevated uric acid at admission was positively associated with PSE, although patients with a prior diagnosis of hyperuricemia were less likely to develop epilepsy. Since uric acid acts as a strong antioxidant and has neuroprotective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2017</xref>), patients with normal liver and kidney function and mild hyperuricemia may exhibit greater resilience in emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaro et al., 2011</xref>). However, excessively high uric acid levels suggest metabolic disorders and poor liver and kidney function, which are linked to a poor prognosis.</p><p>When stroke patients are admitted, cardiac enzyme tests are often performed to rule out myocardial ischemia. However, studies have shown that elevated CK-MB in stroke patients may not be solely heart-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ay et al., 2002</xref>). Cardiac enzymes are important prognostic indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>) and have been incorporated into stroke scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hijazi et al., 2016</xref>). Some studies have reported a higher incidence of abnormal serum cardiac enzyme levels in the acute phase of stroke. Although these abnormalities are not related to stroke type, they are associated with stroke severity, with patients exhibiting consciousness disorders having a significantly higher incidence of abnormal cardiac enzymes than those without such disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng Yuan-Hui and Jian, 2009</xref>). According to the statistical and SHAP results, CK, CK-MB, and IMA in the cardiac enzyme profile demonstrated significant impact and high predictive value, though further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite incorporating extensive clinical, imaging, and laboratory data to build more accurate prediction models using machine learning algorithms, surpassing traditional statistical methods, there were several limitations in the modeling process.</p><p>Although the current study offers valuable insights, the dataset may not be fully representative, and the model’s generalizability requires further evaluation. The data were collected from multiple tertiary hospitals and included over 20,000 cases, but earlier data were lost due to hospital system upgrades. Consequently, the dataset primarily reflects patients diagnosed within the past five years and is predominantly from the Chongqing region, which may limit the model’s applicability to other geographic areas.</p><p>Additionally, the retrospective nature of the study led to the absence of some important predictive indicators. Several potentially valuable features, such as hemorheology, thromboelastography, and hormone levels, were missing and had to be excluded, potentially affecting the model’s accuracy. Including these features could further enhance the model’s predictive power.</p><p>To improve the model, it would be beneficial to incorporate additional data beyond baseline patient characteristics. The current analysis mainly used results from the initial examination upon admission, without fully leveraging information from subsequent exams. Future research could employ recurrent neural networks to extract features from the entire sequence of examinations more comprehensively.</p><p>To strengthen this study further, data standardization should be improved, and the number of cases and key indicators should continue to grow. Additionally, exploring more advanced scientific methods, such as deep learning, and utilizing all available data could enhance prediction accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Research patients</title><p>This study retrospectively included all stroke patients admitted to Chongqing Emergency Center between June 2017 and June 2022 to develop the prediction model.

Indicators with more than 10% missing data were excluded. Remaining indicators with missing values were imputed using the random forest algorithm with default parameters. Features were processed in order of increasing missing data to minimize imputation complexity. During imputation, missing values in other features were temporarily replaced with 0, and predicted values were inserted into the original feature matrix before moving to the next feature. This process continued until all features were complete.</p><p>Distribution of Characteristics: Univariate analysis was performed to compare the distribution of characteristics between PSE-negative and PSE-positive groups.

Total there are 42079 records from the stroke database, 24733 patients were diagnosed as ischemic stroke or lacular stoke with new onset. Then we excluded hemorrage stroke (4565),history of stroke (2154), TIA (3570), unclear cause stroke (561) and records who missed important data (6496). Then we excluded patients whose seizure might be attributed to other potential causes (brain tumor, intracranial vascular malformation, traumatic brain injury,etc) (865). Then we exclude patient who had a seizure history (152) or died in hospital (1444). Then we excluded patients who were lost in follow-up (had no outpatient records and can’t contact by phone) or died within 3 months of the stroke incident (813).

The external validation is certainly very important, but there have been some difficulties in reaching a perfect solution. We have tried using open-source databases like the MIMIC database, but the data there does not fit our needs as closely as the records from our own hospital. The MIMIC database lacks some of the key features we require, and also lacks the detailed patient follow-up information that is crucial for our analysis. Given these limitations, we have decided to collect newer records from the same hospitals here in Chongqing. We believe this will allow us to build a more comprehensive dataset to support robust external validation. While it may not be a perfect solution, gathering this additional data from our local healthcare system is a pragmatic step forward. Looking ahead, we plan to continue expanding this Chongqing-based dataset and report on the results of the greater external validation in the future. We are committed to overcoming the challenges around data availability to strengthen the validity and generalizability of our research findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For greater certainty on all reported results, it would be most appropriate to perform n-fold cross-validation, and report mean scores and confidence intervals across the cross-validation splits</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful advice.

It involved various multi-class indicators such as the affected cortical regions, locations of vascular occlusion, NIHSS scores, etc. Only using the SHAP index to explain the impact of multi-class variables on the dependent variable seems slightly insufficient. It might be worth considering the use of dummy variables to improve the model's accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the detailed feedback on the study methodology. The SHAP analysis is really just a means of interpreting the model, which we compared with the combination of SHAP and traditional statistics, so we think SHAP analysis is reliable in this research. We have used the dummy variables, expecially when dealing with the affected cortical regions, locations of vascular occlusion, for example if frontal region is involved the variable is 1. But they have less impact in the machine learning model</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b-The study used Lasso regression to select 20 features to build the model.

Since we extract information from the database and try to include as many features as possible, the cross-verification curve of lasso regression includes 78 features best, but it will lead to too complex model. We select 10,15,20,25,30 features for modeling according to the experiment. When 20 features are found, the model parameters are good and relatively concise. Improve the number of features contribute little to the model effect, decrease the number of features influence the concise of model ,for example the auc of the model with 15 features will drop under 0.95. So we finally select 20 features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c-The study indicated that the incidence rate of PSE in the enrolled patients is 4.3%, showing a highly imbalanced dataset.
