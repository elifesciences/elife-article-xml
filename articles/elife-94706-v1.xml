expression. A recent report unveiled a type of riboswitch, known as the guanidine-IV riboswitch, which responds to guanidine levels to regulate downstream genetic transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which the riboswitch senses its target ligand and undergoes conformational changes remain elusive. This gap in understanding has impeded the potential applications of this riboswitch. To bridge this knowledge gap, our study investigated the conformational dynamics of the guanidine-IV riboswitch RNA upon ligand binding. We employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to dissect the behaviors of the aptamer, terminator, and full-length riboswitch. Our findings indicated that the aptamer portion exhibited higher sensitivity to guanidine compared to the terminator and full-length constructs. Additionally, we utilized Position-specific Labelling of RNA (PLOR) combined with smFRET to observe, at the single-nucleotide and single-molecule level, the structural transitions experienced by the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription. Notably, we discovered that the influence of guanidine on the riboswitch RNA’s conformations was significantly reduced after the transcription of 88 nucleotides. Furthermore, we proposed a folding model for the guanidine-IV riboswitch in the absence and presence of guanidine, thereby providing insights into its ligand-response mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>riboswitch</kwd><kwd>guanidine</kwd><kwd>smFRET</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A folding-function model for the guanidine-IV riboswitch under both guanidine-free and guanidine-present conditions offers valuable insights into its regulatory mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Riboswitches, located at the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA, are capable of regulating gene expression through structural changes after binding to their specific ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones and Ferré-D’Amaré, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandal and Breaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Serganov and Nudler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sherlock and Breaker, 2020</xref>). A typical riboswitch consists of an aptamer domain and an expression platform. The aptamer domain binds to a specific ligand, leading to structural changes and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kavita and Breaker, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Winkler and Breaker, 2003</xref>). To date, more than 55 classes of riboswitches have been identified that can sense a diverse range of ligands, including small metabolites, anions, cations, amino acids, and nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breaker, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCown et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, riboswitches responding to the same ligands have been found to exhibit distinct consequences and structures. For instance, there are four types of guanidine riboswitches, namely guanidine-I, guanidine-II, guanidine-III, and guanidine-IV riboswitch, which specifically bind to guanidine. Notably, the guanidine-IV riboswitch differs significantly from other guanidine riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia and Ke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, the guanidine-IV riboswitch is able to enhance the transcription of <italic>mepA</italic> by forming an anti-terminator structure upon guanidine binding. This structure plays a crucial role in exporting guanidine and reducing its toxicity in cells, making the guanidine-IV riboswitch a potential target for antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kermani et al., 2018</xref>). Although the atomic-resolution structures of the guanidine-IV riboswitch have not been solved, it is proposed that a kissing loop (KL) forms in the riboswitch in the presence of guanidine. This KL facilitates the dissociation of the terminator and promotes transcriptional read-through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). KL or pseudoknot formation upon ligand binding is a common occurrence in various riboswitches, including adenine, guanine, ZTP, pre-Q1, fluoride, and c-di-AMP riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones and Ferré-D’Amaré, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism by which KL affects gene expression in a transcriptional riboswitch, particularly during transcription, remains elusive.</p><p>The folding of RNA during transcription plays a critical role in its function, especially in riboswitches involved in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated the co-transcriptional folding of various riboswitches using different techniques. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frieda and Block, 2012</xref> employed the optical-trapping assay to examine the co-transcriptional folding of an adenine riboswitch at the single-molecule resolution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmling et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binas et al., 2020</xref>, on the other hand, used NMR to map the transcriptional intermediates of the 2′-deoxyguanosine (2′-dG) and ZMP riboswitches at the single-nucleotide resolution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landgraf et al., 2022</xref> utilized NMR and computational modeling to identify the ligand-sensing transcriptional window for the c-di-GMP and c-GAMP riboswitches. Hua et al. investigated the co-transcriptional folding of the twister ribozyme and the ZTP riboswitch by mimicking the folding process using helicases to dissociate an RNA-DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hua et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou and Woodson, 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uhm et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Widom et al., 2018</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yadav et al., 2022</xref> employed the single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) strategy to study the co-transcriptional folding of the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme, TPP, pre-Q1, and fluoride riboswitches by assembling transcriptional complexes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2023</xref> monitored the folding of a growing SAM-VI riboswitch at the single-molecule resolution by FRET. Despite these previous investigations, there is lack of information regarding the conformational changes and ligand-sensing behavior of the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription. In this study, we used position-specific labeling of RNA (PLOR) to introduce a FRET pair, Cy3 and Cy5, at sites 78 and 35, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, we examined the ligand and Mg<sup>2+</sup> responses of the aptamer domain, terminator/anti-terminator, and full-length guanidine-IV riboswitch using smFRET. Our findings revealed that both guanidine and Mg<sup>2+</sup> facilitated the formation of a KL in the aptamer domain and significantly increased the KL-formed conformation in that domain. Interestingly, unlike the aptamer domain, the addition of guanidine and Mg<sup>2+</sup> only had a minimal effect on the formation of the KL-formed anti-terminator structure in the terminator/anti-terminator or full-length RNA. Additionally, we mimicked the conformational changes and ligand-sensing behavior from the aptamer domain to the terminator sequence of the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription using smFRET and PLOR. The formation of the KL increased as the riboswitch was transcribed up to 88 nucleotides (corresponding to the aptamer), but decreased as the riboswitch was transcribed from 88 to 105 nucleotides (corresponding to the terminator). Based on our data, it became evident that the transcriptional fate did not determined by the terminator sequence, but rather by the aptamer region, which exhibited distinct ligand-sensing abilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The construction and characteristics of the guanidine-IV riboswitch</title><p>The <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> guanidine-IV riboswitch was investigated in this study. The secondary structures of the guanidine-IV riboswitch are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>. In the absence of the guanidinium cation (Gua<sup>+</sup>), the terminator consists of the aptamer domain (in black) and poly-U tail (in red). This terminator is proposed to terminate transcription by dissociating RNA polymerase from the transcription system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in the presence of Gua<sup>+</sup>, the formation of a KL (in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) hinders the formation of the complete terminator stem. This leads to the formation of the anti-terminator conformation, and transcription of the full-length riboswitch comprises the extended nucleotides (in blue), in addition to the terminator/anti-terminator region (in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Consequently, the anti-terminator conformation activates the expression of the downstream genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In our study, we noted that the transcriptional read-through of the guanidine-IV riboswitch during the single-round PLOR reaction was sensitive to Gua<sup>+</sup>, exhibiting an apparent EC50 value of 68.7±7.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chien et al., 2023</xref>). This is comparable to the reported <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of approximately 64 μM that was determined by in-line probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). Higher read-through efficiencies were detected at higher Gua<sup>+</sup> concentrations, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>). In order to probe the structural changes of different domains in the guanidine-IV riboswitch under various conditions, we applied PLOR to introduce Cy3 and Cy5 at sites 78 and 35 in the aptamer (riboG-apt), terminator/anti-terminator (riboG-term), and full-length guanidine-IV riboswitch (riboG). Sites 78 and 35 are close to the KL, making them suitable for monitoring the KL formation at different Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup> concentrations.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the <italic>C. botulinum</italic> guanidine-IV riboswitch.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The secondary structures of the transcriptional termination and read-through states of the guanidine-IV riboswitch.

This technique has been extensively employed to investigate the conformational dynamics of RNA at the single-molecule level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uhm et al., 2018</xref>). When the riboG-apt labeled with dual fluorophore-labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) was examined, a single peak (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.2) was observed in the presence of 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This peak is believed to correspond to the unfolded structure of riboG-apt, where the KL is not formed and thus, the labeled sites are distant from each other. Furthermore, in the presence of 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, three peaks (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) were observed, as revealed by hidden Markov modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests the coexistence of at least three structures when 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> is present, with the peak at an E<sub>FRET</sub> of approximately 0.8 likely representing the KL formation. The peak characterized by an E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.5 emerged at varying collection rates and was indicative of a more compact conformation compared to the unfolded structure, which we referred to as the pre-folded structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Notably, at 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, these three states exhibited high dynamics, with transitions occurring particularly between the pre-folded and the unfolded states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> induces a conformational change in the unfolded riboG-apt, leading to the adoption of more compact pre-folded and folded conformations. The proportion of the folded conformation significantly increased to approximately 90% at 20.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4G</xref>). At high concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, riboG-apt remained flexible and dynamic in its transition between states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, at a higher concentration of 50.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the proportion of the pre-folded and unfolded conformations were more prevalent at 50.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> than at 20.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This suggests that an excess of Mg<sup>2+</sup> may promote the pre-folded and even unfolded conformations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>smFRET studies of post-transcriptional Cy3Cy5-riboG-apt at different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The secondary structures of Cy3Cy5-riboG-apt at the unfolded (left) and the folded state (right).

However, Gua<sup>+</sup> exhibited lower efficacy compared to Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as evidenced by the proportion of the folded conformation being approximately 25% in the presence of 20.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup>. This value is significantly lower than the approximately 90% observed in the presence of 20.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5F</xref>). Our observations also revealed that riboG-apt exhibited pronounced dynamics, frequently transiting among the three states at 10.0–100.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E–H</xref>). The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was critical in facilitating the induction of the folded state by Gua<sup>+</sup>. Notably, riboG-apt showed increased susceptibility to Gua<sup>+</sup> in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Upon the addition of 0.5 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> and 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the KL-folded conformation predominated in riboG-apt. The proportion of the KL-folded conformation increased to over 40%, which was comparable to the effect observed with a 20-fold increase in 0.5 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6E</xref>). Interestingly, at 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Gua<sup>+</sup> bound to riboG-apt with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 286.0±18.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6H</xref>), higher than the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 64 μM that was determined by in-line probing in the presence of 20 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). This difference is likely due to the low concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which has a weak ability to help guanidine induced the KL conformation. In addition, we observed that riboG-apt became more stable as the concentration of Gua<sup>+</sup> increased, particularly in the presence of high Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Surprisingly, the proportion of the folded conformation hardly increased when Mg<sup>2+</sup> exceeded 2.0 mM in the presence of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup>. Taking into account that Gua<sup>+</sup> was present in a positively charged state in the buffer employed for our FRET studies, we conducted additional experiments to investigate the impact of commonly used cations, including Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and urea (a structural analog of guanidine). Interestingly, we observed minimal changes in the folded conformation of riboG-apt upon the addition of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, or urea. These findings suggest that the effects of Gua<sup>+</sup> on the folded conformation are distinct from those of the tested cations. Furthermore, our results indicate that Gua<sup>+</sup> specifically binds to riboG-apt and induces structural changes as a ligand, rather than simply acting as a general cation or chaotrope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>The highly conserved nucleotides surrounding the KL are crucial for its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>). To test our hypothesis that the state with E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 corresponds to the conformation with the KL, we preformed smFRET analysis on several mutations at these crucial nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">10</xref>). Consistent with our expectations, the peaks with E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 was significantly diminished in the riboG-G71C mutant, which features a single nucleotide mutation at site 71 (with 97% nucleotide conservation) in the KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8A and B</xref>). It is worth noting that the C30G and G71C mutant, which were initially expected to restore a base pair in the KL, did not successfully bring about the anticipated peak of E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8C and D</xref>). On the other hand, the riboG-U72C mutant exhibited a lower proportion at the state with E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 than riboG-apt. However, the A29G and U72C mutations restored a base pair in the KL, as well as the formation of the KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). Furthermore, our investigation revealed that the G77C mutant, involving a single nucleotide mutation at a highly conversed site, 77 (with 97% nucleotide conservation), also hindered the formation of the KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). This finding aligns with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>) and the predicted second structure of G77C mutation by Mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zuker, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>smFRET analysis revealed the slight effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup> on riboG-term and full-length riboG</title><p>Unlike riboG-apt, riboG-term labeled with dual fluorophores exhibited the coexistence of three conformations, characterized by E<sub>FRET</sub> values of approximately 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). This coexistence was observed even in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and 2B</xref>). This indicates that monovalent ions in the buffer can facilitate the formation of stable guanidine-IV riboswitch. The sensitivity of RiboG-term to Gua<sup>+</sup> was significantly lower compared to riboG-apt. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the presence of 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the addition of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> only resulted in an increase of approximately 4% the folded conformation for riboG-term, while it was approximately 60% for riboG-apt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). With the increase of either Mg<sup>2+</sup> from 0 to 50.0 mM or Gua<sup>+</sup> from 0 to 100.0 mM, less than 12% of the molecules transited dynamically among the three states of riboG-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). This finding suggests that the unfolded structure of riboG-term without the KL (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.2) is stable, and high concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Gua<sup>+</sup> only slightly affect the KL formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the presence of 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the structural change of riboG-term in response to increasing Gua<sup>+</sup> was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Surprisingly, in the presence of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup>, the conformation dynamics of riboG-term became more evident as Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased. Moreover, at high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, such as 10.0 mM, the abundance of the folded conformation (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8) significantly elevated with increasing Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that Gua<sup>+</sup> enhances the flexibility of riboG-term, potentially triggering its structural changes and facilitating the regulatory function of riboG in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast to riboG-term, both its G71C and C30G-G71C mutants displayed a reduced proportion of the state with E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8. Remarkably, the fractions of E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 remained unaffected by the addition of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> in these mutants. Distinct from riboG-term, no structural transitions between states were observed in the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Regarding the U72C mutant of riboG-term, the mutation at the site 72 had a reduced impact on the KL conformation in the presence of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> and 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. However, the increased proportion of E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8 in the A29G-U72C mutant of riboG-term suggests that these mutations can restore the base-pairing between sites 29 and 72, as well as facilitate the formation of the KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>smFRET studies of post-transcriptional riboG-term at different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The secondary structures of Cy3Cy5-riboG-term at the unfolded (left) and the folded state (right).

To mimic how nascent riboG responds to Gua<sup>+</sup> and its regulatory effects during transcription, we utilized PLOR to control its transcription at a single-nucleotide pace. Simultaneously, we collected smFRET data from active transcription elongation complexes (ECs) containing nascent RNA of different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). PLOR is a liquid–solid hybrid phase transcription process that allows for pausing transcription at specific positions by omitting certain nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). This paused transcription can then be restarted by adding the necessary NTPs. This unique ‘pause–restart’ transcriptional mode enables the evaluation of instant changes in the environment, such as the addition or removal of Gua<sup>+</sup> at specific steps, facilitating the monitoring of nascent RNA under varied conditions. To investigate the range of ligand-responsiveness in riboG, we employed PLOR to generate various transcriptional complexes with different RNA length, this allowed us to assess the impact of Gua<sup>+</sup> on the guanidine-IV riboswitch throughout the transcription process. We monitored the behavior of active transcription complexes containing guanidine-IV riboswitches with varying lengths of 87–105 nucleotides (nt) using smFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>). To distinguish between the different complexes, we named them based on their nucleotide length, for example, the EC-87 for the 87 nt complex. We collected smFRET histograms for EC-87, EC-88, EC-89, EC-91, EC-94, EC-96, and EC-105 in the presence of 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and either 0 or 10.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>). Three distinct peaks (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) were observed, with the high-FRET peak suggesting the presence of a newly folded RNA structure, potentially containing a KL, as the transcript size exceeded 87 nt. In the presence of 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the proportion of the folded structure slightly decreased during transcription from 87 to 88 nt (from approximately 15% to 13%), but then sharply decreased to 3% at 89 nt. The addition of Gua<sup>+</sup> significantly increased the proportion of the folded state for EC-88 compared to EC-87. For longer ECs, such as EC-89, EC-91, and EC-94, the proportion of the folded state remained relatively stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>). At 0.5 and 2.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the proportions of the peaks changed differently, but EC-88 exhibited more dramatic changes than other ECs upon the addition of Gua<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>). These results suggest that the optimal formation of KL occurs during transcription of the 88 nt nascent RNA, and a drastic structural switch takes place between 88 and 89 nt in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, the addition of 1.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup> induced more pronounced changes in the majority of ECs at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>). These findings suggest that the ECs exhibit a greater propensity for structural transitions upon the addition of Gua<sup>+</sup> at high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Furthermore, under conditions of 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 10.0 mM Gua<sup>+</sup>, the proportions of folded structures (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.8) in EC-88 and EC-105 were approximately 36% and 14% lower, respectively, compared to those observed in the isolated post-transcriptional riboG-apt and riboG-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F</xref>). The T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) sequestered about 8 nt of the nascent RNA, preventing the EC-88 construct from forming the P2 stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durniak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang and Sousa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lubkowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tahirov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yin and Steitz, 2002</xref>). Consequently, a pseudoknot structure potentially formed instead of the expected KL.

Specifically, we carefully designed eight PLOR experiments to temporarily pause the transcription at nucleotides 69, 77, 78, 83, 88, 91, 94, and 105, respectively, before transcribing the remaining RNA fragment in the last step, following strategies 1–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and 1C</xref>).

Structurally, it resembles the guanidine-II riboswitch through the formation of loop-loop interactions upon binding to guanidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia and Ke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lenkeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reiss and Strobel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salvail et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gua<sup>+</sup> play critical roles in promoting structural folding and transcriptional anti-termination in the guanidine-IV riboswitch. Based on our findings, we propose a model illustrating the termination/anti-termination process of the guanidine-IV riboswitch as transcription progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the proportion of the anti-terminator induced by Gua<sup>+</sup> increases as transcription progresses up to EC-88. However, after EC-88, a significant decrease is observed up to EC-105. The elongation of transcription from EC-88 to EC-105 leads to impaired pseudoknot or KL formation and an increase in terminator abundance. This incremental switch from the anti-terminator to the terminator from EC-88 to EC-105 is influenced by the elongating P2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The competition between the P2 and KL structures determines the proportions of the terminator and the anti-terminator in the guanidine-IV riboswitch. The stability of the terminator is enhanced by the presence of P2, and the increase in base pairs within P2 strengthens the terminator as transcription proceeds. On the other hand, the stability of the anti-terminator is dependent on the formation of pseudoknot or KL. The elongation of P2 shortens the flexible linker between P1 and P2, which creates steric hindrance for KL after EC-88. Furthermore, the addition of Gua<sup>+</sup> facilitates the functional switch from the terminator to the anti-terminator for constructs ranging from EC-87 to EC-105. Here, we propose a narrow Gua<sup>+</sup>-sensitive transcription window for the guanidine-IV riboswitch, with a dramatic switch observed during the extension from EC-87 to EC-88 upon Gua<sup>+</sup> addition (shown in a green box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is worth noting that the ligand-sensitive sequence for the guanidine-IV riboswitch is located within the aptamer domain, spanning 88 nucleotides.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Folding model of riboG in the absence and presence of guanidine.</title><p>The folding pathways of anti-terminator conformation in the presence of Gua<sup>+</sup> and terminator conformation in the absence of Gua<sup>+</sup> are highlighted in blue and orange, respectively.

The mechanism of anti-termination supports a model in which the formation of a long-range KL prevents the assembly of a rigid terminator. This distinguishes the guanidine-IV riboswitch from typical transcriptional riboswitches that rely on overlapping sequences and base-pair rearrangements for functional change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Strobel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yadav et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, our results reveal the existence of at least three distinct states in the guanidine-IV riboswitch, including a folded state characterized by the presence of a KL that plays a critical role in ligand binding and transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the formation of the long-range KL in the aptamer domain is specifically responsive to guanidine, as other cations such as K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and urea do not produce the same effect. While guanidine contributes to structural switching in the aptamer domain, its impact on the terminator or full-length guanidine-IV riboswitch is comparatively weak. Additionally, our data indicate that guanidine induces less significant changes once the RNA polymerase has transcribed the aptamer domain. It is worth noting that the RNAP utilized in our study is T7 RNAP, which exhibits distinct characteristics compared to bacterial RNAP in terms of transcriptional speed, dynamics, and interactions. However, Xue et al. have reported similarities between T7 and <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP in the folding of nascent RNA. Additionally, Lou and Woodson have provided valuable insights into the co-transcriptional folding of the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme using T7 RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xue et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou and Woodson, 2024</xref>).</p><p>In the transcriptional mimicking assay, the nascent RNA displayed a weaker response to guanidine compared to the post-transcriptional counterparts. The guanidine sensitivity of EC-87 indicates that guanidine regulation for the guanidine-IV riboswitch occurs before transcription of the aptamer domain is completed. Additionally, the sensitivity to guanidine gradually increases in the RNA within ECs until EC-88, after which it decreases. In other words, there exhibits a limited transcriptional window for the guanidine-IV riboswitch to dynamically respond to guanidine, and the inclination to form the terminator increases after transcribing 88 nucleotides, resulting in a decrease in the abundance of the KL-folded conformation. This aligns with previous findings that the transcription decision of a transcriptional riboswitch is made prior to terminator formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sherwood and Henkin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the ligand-sensitive windows of riboswitches during transcription vary. In a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmling et al., 2017</xref> using NMR spectroscopy, they proposed a broad transcriptional window for deoxyguanosine-sensing riboswitches, whereby the ligand binding capability gradually diminishes over several nucleotide lengths. However, more recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binas et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landgraf et al., 2022</xref> on riboswitches sensing ZMP, c-di-GMP, and c-GAMP revealed a narrow window with a sharp transition in binding capability, even with transcript lengths differing by only one or three nucleotides. In line with the findings for the c-GAMP-sensing riboswitch, our study on the guanidine-IV riboswitch also demonstrated a sharp transition in binding capability with just a single nucleotide extension. Our data also suggest that guanidine can induce slight structural changes in the guanidine-IV riboswitch even after the terminator domain has been transcribed and stabilized. Similar observations have been reported for other riboswitches, although the transcriptional window sensitive to the ligand differs among riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA template preparation</title><p>The biotin labeled DNA templates were prepared by PCR as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).

Experiments like this would solidify the structural interpretation of the work, particularly in the context of the full-length riboG RNA or in the cotranscriptional mimic experiments, which appear to have more conformational heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for describing our work “in-depth characterization” of riboG. We agree with the reviewer and we have added two more mutants, G71C and U72C with the mutations located at the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 8A, 8B, 9A, 9B, Figure 3– figure supplement 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B, and Figure 4– figure supplement 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B). Furthermore, we have performed compensatory mutations, C30G-G71C and A29G-U72C that restore base pairing in the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 8C, 8D, 9C, 9D, Figure 3– figure supplement 6C, 6D, 7C, 7D, and Figure 4– figure supplement 6C, 6D, 7C, 7D). We added the experimental results in the revised manuscript accordingly as “The highly conserved nucleotides surrounding the KL are crucial for its formation (Lenkeit et al., 2020). To test our hypothesis that the state with EFRET ~ 0.8 corresponds to the conformation with the KL, we preformed smFRET analysis on several mutations at these crucial nucleotides (Figure 2– figure supplement 8–10). Consistent with our expectations, the peaks with EFRET ~ 0.8 was significantly diminished in the riboG-G71C mutant, which features a single nucleotide mutation at site 71 (with 97% nucleotide conservation) in the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 8A and 8B). It is worth noting that the C30G and G71C mutant, which were initially expected to restore a base pair in the KL, did not successfully bring about the anticipated peak of EFRET ~ 0.8 (Figure 2– figure supplement 8C and 8D). On the other hand, the riboG-U72C mutant exhibited a lower proportion at the state with EFRET ~ 0.8 than riboG-apt. However, the A29G and U72C mutations restored a base pair in the KL, as well as the formation of the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 9). Furthermore, our investigation revealed that the G77C mutant, involving a single nucleotide mutation at a highly conversed site, 77 (with 97% nucleotide conservation), also hindered the formation of the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 10). This finding aligns with previous research (Lenkeit et al., 2020) and the predicted second structure of G77C mutation by Mfold (Zuker, 2003)” (page 7), “In contrast to riboG-term, both its G71C and C30G-G71C mutants displayed a reduced proportion of the state with EFRET ~ 0.8. Remarkably, the fractions of EFRET ~ 0.8 remained unaffected by the addition of 1.0 mM Gua+ in these mutants. Distinct from riboG-term, no structural transitions between states were observed in the two mutants (Figure 3– figure supplement 6). Regarding the U72C mutant of riboG-term, the mutation at the site 72 had a reduced impact on the KL conformation in the presence of 1.0 mM Gua+ and 2.0 mM Mg2+. However, the increased proportion of EFRET ~ 0.8 in the A29G-U72C mutant of riboG-term suggests that these mutations can restore the base-pairing between sites 29 and 72, as well as facilitate the formation of the KL (Figure 3– figure supplement 7)” (page 8), and “Upon comparing the G71C and C30G-G71C mutants of the full-length riboG with their wild-type counterpart, it was observed that the wild-type adopted higher proportions of the state with EFRET ~ 0.8 (Figure 4– figure supplement 6). Regarding the U72C and A29G-U72C mutants of the full-length riboG, their behaviors with regards to the peak with EFRET ~ 0.8 were similar to that of their counterparts in riboG-term (Figure 4– figure supplement 7)” (page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The existence of the pre-folded state (intermediate FRET ~0.5) is not well supported in their data and could be explained by an acquisition artifact. The dwell times are very short often only a single frame indicating that there could be a very fast transition (&lt; 0.1s) from low to high FRET that averages to a FRET efficiency of 0.5. To firmly demonstrate that this intermediate FRET state is metastable and not an artifact, the authors need to perform measurements with a faster frame rate and demonstrate that the state is still present.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the great comment. We added smFRET experiments at higher time resolution, 20 ms, as well as lower time resolution (Figure 2– figure supplement 3). Based on our experimental results, the intermediate state (EFRET ~0.5) exists at the smFRET collected at 20 ms, 100 ms and 200 ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The PLOR method employs a non-biologically relevant polymerase (T7 RNAP) to mimic transcription elongation and folding near the elongation complex. T7 RNAP has a shorter exit channel than bacterial RNAPs and therefore, folding in the exit channel may be different between different RNAPs. Additionally, the nascent RNA may interact with bacterial RNAP differently. For these reasons, it is not clear how well the dynamics observed in the T7 ECs recapitulate riboswitch folding dynamics in bacterial ECs where they would occur in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree with the reviewer that the bacterial and T7 RNAPs may behave differently due to their differences in transcriptional speed, dynamics, interactions, and so on. And we added a statement in the Discussion as “It is worth noting that the RNAP utilized in our study is T7 RNAP, which exhibits distinct characteristics compared to bacterial RNAP in terms of transcriptional speed, dynamics, and interactions.

The reason we chosen the G77C mutation is based on previous report that G77C can disturb the formation of the KL, as we stated in the manuscript as “Furthermore, our investigation revealed that the G77C mutant, involving a single nucleotide mutation at a highly conversed site, 77 (with 97% nucleotide conservation), also hindered the formation of the KL (Figure 2– figure supplement 10).

We have included additional mutations to establish a connection between the high-FRET state to the formation of the KL. The results have been added to the manuscript as “The highly conserved nucleotides surrounding the KL are crucial for its formation (Lenkeit et al., 2020).

It is likely that this state is the result of a camera blurring artifact, in which RNAs undergo a FRET transition between two frames giving an apparent FRET efficiency which is between that of the two transitioning states. This artifact arises when the average dwell times of the true states (Elow and Ehigh) are comparable to the frame duration (within a factor of ~5-10; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01036">https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01036</ext-link>). To confirm the presence of the intermediate state, the authors should perform at least a few experiments with higher time resolution to support the existence of the 0.5 state with a lifetime of 0.1 s. Alternatively, the data should be refit to a two-state HMM and the authors could explain in the text that the density in the FRET histogram between the two states is likely due to transitions that are faster than the time resolution of the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the great comment. Taking the suggestion into consideration, we performed smFRET experiments with a higher time resolution of 20 ms. As a result, we still detected the intermediate state, supporting that it is not an artifact.

Is the cartoon RNAP supposed to indicate the RNA:DNA hybrid or the footprint of T7 RNAP on the RNA? For example, in Figure 8a there are 8 nts (left) and 9 nts (right) covered by RNAP, and only 6nts in Figure 6 - supp 2A. This is particularly misleading for the EC-87 and EC-88 in Figure 6 - supp 2, where it is likely that this stem is not formed at all and the KL strand is single-stranded. The authors should clarify and at least indicate in the figure legend if the RNAP cartoon is part of the model or only a representation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing the issues to our attention. Due to space limitations, we chose to represent the polymerase footprint differently in Figure 8. However, we have included the statement “DNA templates from EC-87 to EC-105 are not displayed in the model” in the legend of Figure 8 to avoid the confusion.</p><p>Moreover, we have corrected the error of 6 nts Figure 6-supplement figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- With a correct 9 bp RNA:DNA hybrid, the EC-88 construct would not be able to form the top part of the P2 stem and the second half of the KL RNA would be single-stranded. In this case, an interaction between the KL nucleotides would resemble a pseudoknot and not a kissing loop interaction. Can the authors explain if this could explain the heterogeneity they observe in the EC-88 construct compared to the riboGapt RNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the comment. We have added the statement in the revised manuscript as “The T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) sequestered about 8 nt of the nascent RNA, preventing the EC-88 construct from forming the P2 stem (Durniak et al., 2008; Huang &amp; Sousa, 2000; Lubkowska et al., 2011; Tahirov et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2022; Yin &amp; Steitz, 2002). Consequently, a pseudoknot structure potentially formed instead of the expected KL. This distinction may account for the observed heterogeneity between EC-88 and riboG-apt” (page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>(1) It appears that the FRET histograms in the PLOR experiments (Figure 6 and related figures) only show the fits presumably to highlight the overlays. However, this makes it impossible to determine the goodness of the fit. The authors should instead show the outline of the raw histogram with the fit, or at least show the raw histograms with fits in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced Figure 6- figure supplements 2-4 to enhance the clarity of the raw and fitted smFRET histograms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should consider including a concluding paragraph to put the results into a larger context. How does the kinetic window compare to other transcriptional riboswitches? Would the authors comment on how the transcription speed compares to the kinetics for the formation of the KL?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have added the comparison of riboG to other transcription riboswitches to the manuscript as “Nevertheless, the ligand-sensitive windows of riboswitches during transcription vary. In a study conducted by Helmling et al. using NMR spectroscopy, they proposed a broad transcriptional window for deoxyguanosine-sensing riboswitches, whereby the ligand binding capability gradually diminishes over several nucleotide lengths (Helmling et al., 2017). However, more recent research by Binas et al. and Landgraf et al. on riboswitches sensing ZMP, c-di-GMP, and c-GAMP revealed a narrow window with a sharp transition in binding capability, even with transcript lengths differing by only one or three nucleotides (Binas et al., 2020; Landgraf et al., 2022). In line with the findings for the c-GAMP-sensing riboswitch, our study on the guanidine-IV riboswitch also demonstrated a sharp transition in binding capability with just a single nucleotide extension” (page 14).</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment in comparing the transcription speed to the kinetics of the KL formation. However, we must acknowledge that we have limited kinetic data in this study to confidently make such a comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Cy3Cy5 RiboG is a confusing name because it implies that the others are not also Cy3Cy5 labeled.

The authors don't seem to address the role of the blue stem-loop following Stems 1 and 2. Is this element needed at all for gene regulation? Does it impact the conformations or folding of the preceding Stems 1 and 2? It seems feasible to disrupt the stem and see whether there is an impact on riboswitch function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The presence of the sequence which formed blue stem-loop indicates the formation of an anti-terminator conformation in riboG during transcription. Our smFRET data shows that the inclusion of the stem-loop sequence induces additional peaks in the full-length riboG compared to the riboGterm. This indicates that the stem-loop influences the folding of the kissing loop (KL) and potentially also affects the stems 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 7 supplement 1, C &amp;D. Maybe I am missing something, but it seems to me in reaction #8 (EC-105, last two lanes), the readthrough percentage is close to 50% based on the gel but plotted in D as 20%. Further, there is a strong effect of guanidine in reaction #8 but that is not reflected in the quantitation in panel D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The observed discrepancy between reaction 8 in (C) and (D) is from the differential handling of the crude product at the last step (step 17) in gel loading for (C), contrasted with the combination of crude products from steps 16 and 17 to calculate the read-through percentage in (D). We have corrected the discrepancy by replacing Figure 7-Supplement figure 1C (now Figure 7C), and revised the legend to include the following clarification: “Taking into consideration that the 17 step-PLOR reaction exhibited a pause within the terminator region, resulting in a significant amount of terminated product at step 16, crude products from steps 16 and 17 were collected for (C) and (D) of the 17 step-PLOR reaction (Lanes 15 and 16 in C)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 7C is a control that shows the quality of the elongation complexes, which probably should be in the supplement.

We made the adjustment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S7D. I would suggest not labelling the RNA polymerase halt/stoppage sites due to NTP deprivation as &quot;pausing sites&quot; because transcriptional pausing has previously been defined as natural sites where the RNA polymerase transiently halts itself, but not due to the lack of the next NTPs. In this case, the elongating complexes were artificially halted, which is technically not &quot;pausing&quot;, as it will not restart/resume on its own without intervention.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the “pausing” to “halting”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 7 is titled &quot;In vitro transcriptional performance of riboG.&quot; But the data is actually not about the performance of the riboswitch, or how well it functions.
