implying that readers might process multiple words per fixation. However, the extent to which parafoveal words are previewed and integrated into the evolving sentence context remains disputed. We investigated parafoveal processing during natural reading by recording brain activity and eye movements using MEG and an eye tracker while participants silently read one-line sentences. The sentences contained an unpredictable target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. To measure parafoveal processing, we flickered the target words at 60 Hz and measured the resulting brain responses (i.e. <italic>Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging, RIFT</italic>) during fixations on the pre-target words. Our results revealed a significantly weaker tagging response for target words that were incongruent with the previous context compared to congruent ones, even within 100ms of fixating the word immediately preceding the target. This reduction in the RIFT response was also found to be predictive of individual reading speed. We conclude that semantic information is not only extracted from the parafovea but can also be integrated with the previous context before the word is fixated. This early and extensive parafoveal processing supports the rapid word processing required for natural reading. Our study suggests that theoretical frameworks of natural reading should incorporate the concept of deep parafoveal processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reading</kwd><kwd>semantic processing</kwd><kwd>MEG</kwd><kwd>frequency tagging</kwd><kwd>parafoveal processing</kwd><kwd>language comprehension</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECF-2023-626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/207550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R018723/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wolfson Research Merit Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

We typically fixate each word for only 225–250ms, but nevertheless manage to encode its visual information, extract its meaning, and integrate it into the larger context, while also doing saccade planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rayner, 2009</xref>). To overcome the tight temporal constraints during reading, we preview the next word in the parafovea before moving our eyes to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reichle and Reingold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schotter, 2018</xref>). Substantial evidence suggests that parafoveal information can be extracted at various linguistic levels, including orthography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drieghe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inhoff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 2006</xref>), phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashby and Rayner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chace et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miellet and Sparrow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pollatsek et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rayner et al., 1995</xref>), lexicality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy and Pynte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kliegl et al., 2006</xref>), syntax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Snell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wen et al., 2019</xref>), and semantics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rayner and Schotter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schotter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schotter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schotter and Jia, 2016</xref>); for a comprehensive review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schotter et al., 2012</xref>. However, for semantics in particular, controversy remains about the extent and type of information extracted from parafoveal processing under various conditions. Moreover, it is unknown when and how the previewed semantic information can be used – i.e., integrated into the evolving sentence context – which is an integral component of the ongoing reading process.</p><p>For some time, it was claimed that parafoveal preview was limited to perceptual features of words and did not extend to semantics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inhoff, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inhoff and Rayner, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rayner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rayner et al., 1986</xref>). However, eye tracking-based evidence for the extraction of parafoveal semantic information began to emerge from studies that used languages other than English, including Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) and German (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hohenstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hohenstein and Kliegl, 2014</xref>), and was eventually extended into English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rayner and Schotter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schotter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schotter and Jia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Veldre and Andrews, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Veldre and Andrews, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Veldre and Andrews, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veldre and Andrews, 2016b</xref>). For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schotter and Jia, 2016</xref>) showed preview benefits on early gaze measures for plausible compared to implausible words, even for plausible words that were unrelated to the target. These results demonstrate that semantic information can indeed be extracted from parafoveal words. However, due to the limitations of the boundary paradigm, which only assesses effects after target words have been fixated, it is challenging to precisely determine when and how parafoveal semantic processing takes place. Furthermore, it is generally hard to distinguish between the effects of cross-saccade integration (e.g. the mismatch between the preview and the word fixated) and the effects of how differing words fit into the context itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Veldre and Andrews, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veldre and Andrews, 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Complementary evidence showing that semantic information can be extracted parafoveally, even in English, comes from electrophysiological studies. Context-based facilitation of semantic processing can be observed as reductions in the amplitude of the N400 component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kutas and Hillyard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kutas and Hillyard, 1980</xref>), a negative-going event-related potential (ERP) response observed between about 300 and 500ms after stimulus onset, which has been linked to semantic access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeLong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Federmeier, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Federmeier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kutas and Federmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lau et al., 2008</xref>). Basic effects of contextual congruency on the N400 – smaller responses to words that do versus do not fit a sentence context (e.g. to ‘butter’ compared to ‘socks’ after ‘He spread the warm bread with …’) – are also observed for parafoveally-presented words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antúnez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">López-Peréz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meade et al., 2021</xref>) and, even when all words are congruent, N400 responses to words in parafoveal preview, like those to foveated words, are graded by increasing context-based predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Payne and Federmeier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stites et al., 2017</xref>). Although many of these effects have been measured in the context of unnatural reading paradigms (e.g. the ‘RSVP flanker paradigm’), similar effects are obtain during natural reading. Using the stimuli and procedures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schotter and Jia, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antúnez et al., 2022</xref> showed that N400 responses, measured relative to the fixation before the target words i.e., before the boundary change while the manipulated words were in parafoveal preview, were sensitive to the contextual plausibility of these previewed words. These studies suggest that semantic information is available from words before they are fixated, even if that information does not always have an impact on eye fixation patterns.</p><p>Thus, both eye tracking and electrophysiological studies have provided evidence suggesting that semantic information is extracted from words in parafoveal preview. However, most of these studies have been limited to measuring parafoveal preview from fixations to an immediately adjacent word, raising questions about exactly how far in advance semantic information might become available from parafoveal preview. Moreover, important questions remain about the extent to which parafoveally extracted semantic information can be functionally integrated into the building sentence-level representation. Although some ERP studies have found that the semantic information extracted from parafoveal preview is carried forward, affecting semantic processing when that same word is later fixated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stites et al., 2017</xref>), other studies have not observed any downstream impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, post-N400 ERP components, linked to more attentionally-demanding processes associated with message-building and revision, do not seem to be elicited during parafoveal preview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milligan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schotter et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, critical questions remain about the time course and mechanisms by which semantic information is extracted and used during reading.</p><p>Answering those questions requires an approach that allows a more continuous and specific assessment of sensitivity to target word semantics during parafoveal processing across multiple fixations, and, in particular, that can speak to how attention is allocated across words during natural reading. We tackle these core issues using a new technique that combines the use of frequency tagging and the measurement of magnetoencephalography (MEG)-based signals.</p><p>Frequency tagging, also known as steady-state visually evoked potentials, involves flickering a visual stimulus at a specific frequency and then measuring the neuronal response associated with processing the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>). It has been widely used to investigate visuospatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulbinaite et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kritzman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>) and has recently been applied to language processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyersmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Montani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). However, the traditional frequency tagging technique flickers visual stimuli at a low-frequency band, usually below 30 Hz, such that the flickering can be visible and may interfere with the ongoing task. To address this limitation, we developed the rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT) technique, which involves flickering visual stimuli at a frequency above 60 Hz, making it invisible and non-disruptive to the ongoing task. Responses to RIFT have been shown to increase with the allocation of attention to the stimulus bearing the visual flicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickwedde et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drijvers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duecker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferrante et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutteling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhigalov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhigalov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2020</xref>). In our previous study, we adapted RIFT to a natural reading task and found temporally-precise evidence for parafoveal processing at the lexical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). The RIFT technique provides a notable advantage by generating a signal — the tagging response signal — specifically yoked to just the tagged word. This ensures a clear separation in processing the tagged word from the ongoing processing of other words, addressing a challenge faced by eye tracking and ERP/FRP approaches. Moreover, RIFT enables us to monitor the entire dynamics of attentional engagement with the tagged word, which may begin a few words before the tagged word is fixated.</p><p>In the current study, RIFT was utilised in a natural reading task to investigate parafoveal semantic integration. We recruited participants (n=34) to silently read one-line sentences while their eye movements and brain activity were recorded simultaneously by an eye-tracker and MEG. The target word in each sentence was always unpredictable (see Behavioural pre-tests in Methods) but was semantically congruent or incongruent with the preceding sentence context (for the characteristics of words, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The target words were tagged by flickering an underlying patch, whose luminance kept changing in a 60 Hz sinusoid throughout the sentence presentation. The patch was perceived as grey, the same color as the background, making it invisible. To ensure that the flicker remained invisible across saccades, we applied a Gaussian transparent mask to smooth out sharp luminance changes around the edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Parafoveal processing of the target word was indexed by the RIFT responses recorded using MEG during fixations of pre-target words.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of pre-target, target, and post-target words.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Pre-target</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Target</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Post-target</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Word frequency</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">124.5 (310.9)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">62.2 (77.0)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3619.8 (6725.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Word Length</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.5 (1.1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.3 (1.1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.4 (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Position in the sentence</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.4 (3.0)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.4 (1.3)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7.4 (1.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note.

The target words could not be predicted based on the sentence context and word-level properties of congruent and incongruent targets were balanced by swapping them between two sentence frames. The target words were tagged by changing the luminance of the underlying patch (with a Gaussian mask) in a 60 Hz sinusoid throughout the sentence presentation (depicted as a bright blob, not shown in the actual experiment). Additionally, we included a small disk at the bottom right of the screen that displayed the tagging signal and was recorded by a photodiode throughout each trial.

The resulting RIFT response curve revealed that significant attention was allocated to the target word as far as three words prior, spanning 15.3±2.7 letters (M ± SD), including the spaces between words. This range is consistent with previous estimations of the perceptual span of 12–15 letters during English reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McConkie and Rayner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rayner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rayner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Underwood and McConkie, 1985</xref>), as reported in the eye movement literature. Moreover, as RIFT directly measures visual attention, the left-skewed RIFT response curve suggests that more visual attention is allocated towards the flickering target words before fixating on them, aligning with the left-to-right order of reading English. The normal size and left skewness of the perceptual span in our study suggest that RIFT did not influence attention distribution during natural reading. Notably, the strongest RIFT responses were observed during fixations on the pre-target word (i.e. word position N-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), highlighting the suitability of RIFT for measuring neuronal activity associated with parafoveal processing during natural reading.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural evidence for semantic parafoveal integration</title><p>Importantly, evidence for parafoveal semantic integration was found using RIFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We found no significant modulation of fixation durations of pre-target words based on the contextual congruity of the target word (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, we observed a significant difference in the amount of covert attention allocated to the target when previewing congruent and incongruent target words (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, we found lower RIFT responses for parafoveal words that were incongruent compared to congruent with the previous context. Because the target words were always of low predictability, their semantic congruence could only be appreciated if they had been integrated (to some extent) with the unfolding context. Thus, the RIFT patterns provide compelling neural evidence that semantic information can not only be extracted but also integrated during parafoveal processing.</p><p>More specifically, we observed that pre-target coherence was weaker in magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and had a later onset latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) in response to a contextually incongruent target word compared to a congruent one. Two possible explanations for these findings can be considered. First, the decreased RIFT responses may be due to changes in the pattern of allocation of attention across the text during reading. When reading in English, attention continuously shifts from left to right. If the semantic information previewed in the parafovea cannot be easily integrated into the context, this pattern may be interrupted, leading to delayed and/or reduced allocation of attention to the parafoveal word, possibly because readers shift more attention to the currently fixated word or to previous words to ensure that they have decoded and understood what they have read thus far. On this view, the RIFT finding may reflect a covert ‘regression’ of attention, similar to overt eye-movement regressions that sometimes occur when readers encounter semantically incongruous words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antúnez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ni et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rayner et al., 2004</xref>) (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Alternatively, the reduction in RIFT responses could arise if readers shift attentional resources away from the text altogether. Previous work has demonstrated that tagging responses decrease as attention shifts from an external task (e.g. counting visual targets) to an internal task (e.g. counting heartbeats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kritzman et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, in a reading scenario, visually perceiving the flickering word constitutes an external task, while the internal task involves the semantic integration of previewed information into the context. If more attentional resources are internally directed when faced with the challenge of integrating a contextually incongruent word, fewer attentional resources would remain for processing the flickering word. This may be the kind of shift reflected in the reduction in RIFT responses. On either account, the reduced forward allocation of attention diminishes parafoveal processing, and, in turn, may tend to slow reading speed, as supported by our correlation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our results also provide information about the time course of semantic integration, as we found evidence that readers appreciated the incongruity – and thus must have begun to integrate the semantics of the parafoveal words with their ongoing message-level representation – by as early as within 100ms after fixating on the pre-target word. The timing of this parafoveal semantic effect appears remarkably early, considering that typical semantic access for a single word occurs no earlier than around 200ms, as demonstrated in the visual word recognition literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carreiras et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, in a Go/NoGo paradigm, the earliest distinguishable brain activity related to category-related semantic information of a word occurs at 160ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amsel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauk et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the RIFT results presented here suggest that natural reading involves parallel processing that spans multiple words. The level of (covert) attention allocated to the target word, as indexed by the significant difference in RIFT responses compared to the baseline interval, was observed even three words in advance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This initial increase in RIFT coincided with the target entering the perceptual span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McConkie and Rayner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rayner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Underwood and McConkie, 1985</xref>), likely aligning with the initial extraction of lower-level perceptual information about the target. The emerging sensitivity of the RIFT signal to target plausibility, detected around 100ms after the fixation on the pre-target word, suggests that readers at that time had accumulated sufficient semantic information about the target words and integrated that information with the evolving context. Therefore, it is plausible that the initial semantic processing of the target word commenced even before the pre-target fixation and was distributed across multiple words. This parallel processing of multiple words facilitates rapid and fluent reading.</p><p>Our findings have significant implications for theories of reading. The occurrence and early onset of semantic integration in parafoveal vision suggest that words are processed in an exceptionally parallel manner, posing a challenge for existing serial processing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reichle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reichle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reichle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reichle et al., 1998</xref>). At the same time, it is important to note that the fact that semantic integration begins in parafoveal vision does not mean that it is necessarily completed before a word is fixated. The fact that we observed semantic congruency effects on the fixation durations of the target words (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggests that additional processing is required to fully integrate the semantics with overt attention in foveal vision. This also aligns with previous studies that found some ERP responses to semantic violations, including the LPC (Late Positive Component), are elicited only during foveal processing, but not during parafoveal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milligan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schotter et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Thus, RIFT measures complement eye tracking (and other) measures, providing unique information revealing multiple mechanisms at work during natural reading. The results of the present study are aligned with the SWIFT model of eye movement control in natural reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engbert et al., 2005</xref>), wherein the activation field linked to a given word is hypothesised to be both temporally and spatially distributed. Indeed, we found that the initial increase in covert attention to the target word occurred as early as three words before, as measured by RIFT responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These covert processes enable the detection of semantic incongruity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, it may occur at the non-labile stage of saccade programming, preventing its manifestation in fixation measures of the currently fixated pre-target word (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, the RIFT technique’s capacity to yoke patterns to a specific word offers a unique opportunity to track the activation field of word processing during natural reading. Additional processes, which do impact overt eye movement patterns, are then brought to bear when the target words are fixated, resulting in increased fixation durations for incongruous words. At that same point (i.e. the target word), however, the RIFT responses showed a null effect of congruency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); it may be that the RIFT technique is better suited to capturing parafoveal compared to foveal attentional processes, in part because there are more motion-sensitive rod cells in the parafoveal than foveal area. Finally, even after readers move away from fixating the word, attention to the target can persist or be reinstated, as evidenced by patterns of regressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, during natural reading, attention is distributed across multiple words. The highly flexible and distributed allocation of attention allows readers to be parallel processors and thereby read fluently and effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engbert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Snell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Snell and Grainger, 2019</xref>). Our natural reading paradigm, where all words are available on the screen and saccadic eye movements are allowed, makes it possible to capture the extensive parallel processing. Moreover, saccades have been found to coordinate our visual and oculomotor systems, further supporting the parallel processing of multiple words during natural reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pan et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Two noteworthy limitations exist in the current study. Firstly, the construction of pretarget–target word pairs consistently follows an adjective-noun phrase structure, potentially leading to semantic violations arising from immediate local incongruence rather than a broader incongruence derived from the entire sentential context. While the context preceding target words was deliberately minimised to ensure a pure effect of bottom-up parafoveal processing rather than the confounding impact of top-down prediction, it is essential to recognize that information from both local and global contexts can exert distinct effects on word processing during natural reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2024</xref>). Future investigations should incorporate more information-rich contexts to explore the extent to which the parafoveal semantic integration effect observed in this study can be generalised. Second, the correlation analysis between the pre-target RIFT effect and individual reading speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) does not establish a causal relationship between parafoveal semantic integration and reading performance. Given that the comprehension questions in the current study were designed primarily to maintain readers’ attention and the behavioural performance reached a ceiling level, employing more intricate comprehension questions in future studies would be ideal to accurately measure reading comprehension and reveal the impact of semantic parafoveal processing on it.</p><p>In summary, our findings show that parafoveal processing is not limited to simply extracting word information, such as lexical features, as demonstrated in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pan et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, the previewed parafoveal information from a given word can begin to be integrated into the unfolding sentence representation well before that word is fixated. Moreover, the impact of that parafoveal integration further interacts with reading comprehension by shaping the time course and distribution of attentional allocation – i.e., by causing readers to move attention away from upcoming words that are semantically incongruous. These results support the idea that words are processed in parallel and suggest that early and deep parafoveal processing may be important for fluent reading.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 36 native English speakers (24 females, 22.5±2.8 years old, mean ± SD) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

None of the target words in this final set were predictable (2.3%±4.8%, mean ± SD), and all the sentence contexts were low constraint (25.2%±11.8%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Plausibility of sentences</title><p>Two groups of participants were instructed to rate how plausible (or acceptable) each sentence was in the sentence set version A or B separately. Plausibility was rated on a seven-point scale with plausibility increasing from point 1–7. Sentences in the experiment were designed to be either highly implausible (the incongruent condition) or highly plausible (the congruent condition). To occupy the full range of the scale, we constructed 70 filler sentences with middle plausibility (e.g. sentence 1 below). In this example, sentences 2 and 3 were the incongruent and congruent sentences from the experiment.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="4"><bold>Implausible</bold></th><th align="right" valign="bottom" colspan="3"><bold>Plausible</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.

The MEG gantry was set at 60 degrees upright and covered the participant’s whole head. We programmed in Psychophysics Toolbox –3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>) to present the one-line sentences on a middle-grey screen (RGB [128 128 128]). All words were displayed in black (RGB [0 0 0]) with an equal-spaced Courier New font. The font size was 20 and the font type was bold so that each letter and space occupied 0.316 visual degrees. The visual angle of the whole sentence was no longer than 27 visual degrees in the horizontal direction. The sentence set was divided into five blocks, each of which took about 7 min. There was a break of at least 1 min between blocks and participants pressed a button to continue the experiment at any time afterwards. Participants were instructed to read each sentence silently at their own pace and to keep their heads and body as stable as possible during the MEG session. Eye movements were acquired during the whole session. In total, the experiment took no longer than 55 min. While the current study was conducted using MEG, these procedures might also work with EEG. If so, this would make our approach accessible to more laboratories as EEG is less expensive. However, there are currently no studies directly comparing the RIFT response in EEG versus MEG. Therefore, it would be of great interest to investigate if the current findings can be replicated using EEG.</p><p>Within a trial, there was first a fixation cross presented at the centre of a middle-grey screen for 1.2–1.6 s. This was followed by a black square with a radius of 1 degree of visual angle. This square was placed at the vertical center, 2 degrees of visual angle away from the left edge of the screen. Participants had to gaze at this black ‘starting square’ for at least 0.2 s to trigger the onset of the sentence presentation. Afterward, the sentence would start from the location of the square (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The sentence was presented with an ‘ending square’ 5 degrees of visual angle below the screen centre. The ‘ending square’ was the same size as the ‘starting square’ but in grey colour (RGB [64 64 64]). A gaze at this ‘ending square’ for at least 0.1 s would end the presentation of the sentence. Then the trial ended with a blank middle-grey screen that lasted for 0.5 s. Randomly, 12% of the trials were followed by a statement about the content of the sentence that was just presented, and participants needed to answer ‘True or False’ by pressing a button. For example, the statement for sentence 2 was ‘Lily has a prediction about the fashion trend in this fall,’ and the correct answer was ‘True.’ The statement for sentence 3 was ‘Little Jimmy didn’t have a box,’ and the correct answer was ‘False.’ All participants read the sentences carefully as shown by the high accuracy of answering (96.3%±4.7%, mean ± SD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RIFT</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Projection of the sentence stimuli</title><p>We projected the sentences from the stimulus computer screen in the experimenter room to the projection screen inside of the MEG room using a PROPixx DLP LED projector (VPixx Technologies Inc, Canada). The refresh rate of the PROPixx projector was up to 1440 Hz, while the refresh rate of the stimulus screen was only 120 Hz (1920×1200 pixels resolution). We displayed the sentence repeatedly in four quadrants of the stimulus computer screen. In each quadrant, the words were coded in three colour channels as RGB. The projector then interpreted these 12 colour channels (three channels×four quadrants) as 12 individual greyscale frames, which were projected onto the projection screen in rapid succession. Therefore, the projection screen refreshed at 12 times the rate of the stimulus computer screen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Flickering of the target word</title><p>We added a square patch underneath the target word to frequency tag the target word. The side length of the square patch was the width of the target word plus the spaces on both sides (2–3° visual angle). We flickered the patch by changing its luminance from black to white at a 60 Hz sinusoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To reduce the visibility of the patch edges across saccades, we applied a Gaussian smoothed transparent mask on top of the square patch. The mask was created by a two-dimensional Gaussian function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are the mesh grid coordinates for the flickering patch, and <italic>σ</italic> is the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> spread of the mask with <italic>σ</italic>=0.02 degrees.</p><p>On average, the patch was perceived as middle-grey, the same colour as the background screen, which made it invisible to participants. The target word was still black, the same colour as the other words on the screen. To record the tagging signal, we attached a custom-made photodiode (Aalto NeuroImaging Centre, Finland) to the disk at the bottom right corner of the screen. The luminance of the disk varied the same as that of the flickering patch underneath the target word. The photodiode was plugged into the MEG system as an external channel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data acquisition</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>MEG</title><p>Brain data were acquired with a 306-sensor TRIUX Elekta Neuromag system, which consisted of 204 orthogonal planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers (Elekta, Finland). After participants signed the consent form, we attached four head-position indicator coils (HPI coils) to their heads: two on the left and right mastoid bone, and two on the forehead with at least 3 cm distance in between. Afterward, we used a Polhemus Fastrack electromagnetic digitizer system (Polhemus Inc, USA) to digitize the locations for three bony fiducial points: the nasion, left, and right preauricular points. Then we digitised the four HPI coils. Furthermore, at least 200 extra points were acquired, which were distributed evenly and covered the whole scalp. These points were used later in the source analysis when spatially co-registering the MEG head model with individual structural MRI images. The sampling rate of the MEG system was 1000 Hz. Data were band-pass filtered prior to sampling from 0.1 to 330 Hz to reduce aliasing effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Eye movements</title><p>We used an EyeLink 1000 Plus eye-tracker (long-range mount, SR Research Ltd, Canada) to track eye movements throughout the whole MEG session. The eye tracker was placed on a wooden table in front of the projection screen. The centre of the eye tracker was at the middle line of the projection screen, and the top of the eye tracker reached the bottom edge of the screen. The distance between the eye-tracker camera and the centre of the participant’s eyes was 90 cm. We recorded the horizontal and vertical positions as well as the pupil size from the left eye, at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Each session began with a nine-point calibration and validation test. The test was accepted if the eye-tracking error was below 1 visual degree both horizontally and vertically. During the session, we performed a one-point drift-checking test every three trials and after the break between blocks. If the drift checking failed or the sentence presentation was unable to be triggered through gazing, a nine-point calibration and validation test was conducted again.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>MRI</title><p>After MEG data acquisition, participants were asked to come to the laboratory another day to have an MRI image acquired. We acquired the T1-weighted structural MRI image using a 3-Tesla Siemens PRISMA scanner (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 2.01 ms, TI = 880 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, FOV = 256×256×208 mm, 1 mm isotropic voxel). For 11 participants who dropped out of the MRI acquisition, the MNI template brain (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was used instead in the source analysis later.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Eye movement data analysis</title><p>We extracted the fixation onset events from the EyeLink output file. The EyeLink parsed fixation events based on the online detection of saccade onset using the following parameters: the motion threshold as 0.1 degrees, the velocity threshold as 30 degrees/s, and the acceleration threshold as 8000 degrees/sec2. These conservative settings were suggested by the EyeLink user manual for reading studies, as they can prevent false saccade reports and reduce the number of micro-saccades, and lengthen fixation durations.</p><p>Only the fixation that first landed on a given word was selected. The first fixation durations were averaged within the incongruent and congruent conditions for pre-target and target words. Pairwise, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test were conducted on the first fixation durations of pre-target and target words separately (conducted in R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>). In addition to the early eye movement measure of the first fixation duration, we also conducted <italic>t</italic>-tests for two later eye movement measures. The likelihood of refixation was measured as the proportion of trials on which there was at least one saccade that regressed back to that word. The total gaze duration was the sum of all fixations on a given word, including those fixations during regression or re-reading.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MEG data analyses</title><p>The data analyses were performed in MATLAB R2020a (Mathworks Inc, USA) by using the FieldTrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) toolbox (version 20200220), following the FLUX MEG analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrante et al., 2022</xref>), and custom-made scripts (see Code availability for the shared link).</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Pre-processing</title><p>We first band-pass filtered the MEG data from 0.5 to 100 Hz using phase-preserving two-pass Butterworth filters. Subsequently, detrending was applied individually to each channel of the continuous raw data to factor out the linear trend. Malfunctioning sensors were removed based on inspecting the data quality during online recording (0–2 sensors per participant). Afterward, the data were decomposed into independent components using an independent component analysis (ICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda and Toyama, 2000</xref>). The number of components was the same as the number of good MEG sensors in the dataset (306 or less). We only removed bad components that related to eye blinks, eye movements, and heartbeat by visually inspecting the components (3.4±0.7 components per participant, M ± SD, range from 2 to 5 components).</p><p>MEG segments were extracted from –0.5–0.5 s intervals aligned with the first fixation onset of the pre-target and target words, respectively (see Eye movement data analysis, above, for information on how fixation onsets were defined). Segments with fixation durations shorter than 0.08 s or longer than 1 s were discarded. We also extracted 1 s long baseline segments, which were aligned with the cross-fixation onset before the sentence presentation. We manually inspected all segments to further identify and remove segments that were contaminated by muscle or movement artefacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Coherence calculation</title><p>We calculated the coherence between the MEG sensors and the photodiode (i.e. the tagging signal) to quantify the tagging responses. The amplitude of the photodiode channel was normalised across each segment. To estimate the coherence spectrum in the frequency domain over time, we filtered the segments using hamming tapered Butterworth bandpass filters (fourth order, phase preserving, two-pass). The frequency of interest was from 40 to 80 Hz in a step of 2 Hz. For each center frequency point, the spectral smoothing was ±5 Hz. For example, the filter frequency range for 60 Hz was from 55 to 65 Hz. We performed a Hilbert transform to obtain the analytic signals for each centre frequency point, which then were used to estimate the coherence (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 2</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>n</italic> is the number of trials.

We used a non-parametric Monte-Carlo method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maris et al., 2007</xref>) to estimate the statistical significance. The pre-target segments were constructed by pooling the target contextual congruity conditions together. Several previous RIFT studies from our lab observed robust tagging responses from the visual cortex for flicker above 50 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drijvers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duecker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhigalov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2020</xref>). Thus, this sensor selection procedure was confined to the MEG sensors in the visual cortex (52 planar sensors). Here, the pre-target segments and baseline segments were treated as two conditions. For each combination of the MEG sensor and photodiode channel, coherence at 60 Hz was estimated over trials for the pre-target and baseline conditions separately.

All trials from the pre-target and baseline conditions were used.</p><p>After obtaining the z statistic value for the empirical coherence difference, we ran a permutation procedure to estimate the statistical significance of this comparison. We randomly shuffled the trial labels between pre-target and baseline conditions 5000 times. During each permutation, coherence was computed for both conditions (with shuffled labels), then entered <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 3</xref> to obtain a z score for the coherence difference. After all randomizations were performed, the resulting z-values established the null distribution. Since a tagging response sensor was supposed to have stronger coherence during the pre-target segments compared with the baseline segments, the statistical test was right-sided. If the z-value of the empirical coherence difference was larger than 99% of z-values in the null distribution, this sensor was selected as the RIFT response sensor (right-sided, p=0.01). For each participant, the coherence values were averaged over all sensors with significant tagging response to obtain an averaged coherence for further analyses. Please note that the tagging response sensors may vary in number across participants (7.9±4.5 sensors per participant, M ± SD). Additionally, they may have a different but overlapping spatial layout, primarily over the visual cortex. For the topography of all tagging response sensors, please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Coherence response curve</title><p>We first extracted MEG segments for the words N-4, N-3, N-2, N+1, N+2, and N+3 following the same procedure described in the pre-processing when extracted MEG segments for the pre-target (N-1) and target words (N). All segments were 1 s long, aligned with the first fixation onset to the word. Then, we calculated the coherence at 60 Hz during these segments for participants who have RIFT response sensors (n=29). Next for each participant, the 60 Hz coherence was first averaged over the RIFT response sensors, then averaged within a time window of [0 0.2] s (the averaged fixation duration for words). We got an averaged of 60 Hz coherence for the word at each position. We also got the 60 Hz coherence for the baseline interval averaged over [0 0.2] s, aligned with the cross-fixation onset. Then a pairwise <italic>t-</italic>test was performed between the baseline coherence and the coherence at each word position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>Coherence comparison between conditions</title><p>The coherence comparison analyses were only conducted for the participants who had sensors with a reliable tagging response (n=29). To avoid any bias from trial numbers, an equal number of trials under the different contextual congruity conditions was entered into the coherence analysis per participant. We randomly discarded the redundant trials from the condition that had more trials for both the pre-target and target segments.</p><p>To compare the pre-target coherence amplitude between conditions, the coherence values at 60 Hz were averaged across the minimum fixation duration of all pre-target words. The time window for averaging was defined for each participant so that the coherence signal from the target fixation was not involved. Similarly, we averaged the 60 Hz coherence for the target segments over the minimum target fixation duration. Then, a two-sided pairwise Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to estimate the statistical significance of the coherence difference as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>To assess the coherence onset latency difference between conditions, we used a leave-one-out Jackknife-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1998</xref>). We extracted the 60 Hz coherence during the 1 s long pre-target segments for each participant. Then, during each iteration of participants, we randomly chose and left out one participant. For the remaining participants, coherences were calculated for the incongruent and congruent target conditions. Then, the coherence was averaged over the remaining participants to estimate the onset latency for both conditions. Here, the onset latency was defined as the time point when the averaged coherence value reached its half-maximum (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).

A standard t table (pairwise, two-tailed) provided the statistical significance for the coherence onset latency difference between the incongruent and congruent target conditions. This procedure was conducted for both the pre-target and target segments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-6"><title>Source analysis for RIFT</title><p>We used a beamforming-based approach, DICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2001</xref>), to estimate the neural sources that generated the responses to RIFT. The DICS technique was applied to the pre-target segments (0–0.5 s aligned with fixation onset to the pre-target word) regardless of the target contextual congruity conditions, with a focus of 60 Hz in the frequency domain. In this source analysis, only participants with robust tagging responses were included (n=29).</p><p>First, we constructed a semi-realistic head model, where spherical harmonic functions were used to fit the brain surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nolte, 2003</xref>). We aligned the individual structural MRI image with the head shape that was digitised during the MEG session. This was done by spatially co-registering the three fiducial anatomical markers (nasion, left and right ear canal) and extra points that covered the whole scalp. For participants whose MRI image was unavailable, the MNI template brain was used instead. The aligned MRI image was segmented into a grid, which was used to prepare the single-shell head model.</p><p>Next, we constructed the individual source model by inverse-warping a 5 mm spaced regular grid in the MNI template space to each participant’s segmented MRI image. We got the regular grid from the Fieldtrip template folder, which was constructed before doing the source analysis. In this way, the beamformer spatial filters were constructed on the regular grid that mapped to the MNI template space. Even though after this warping procedure grid points in the individual native space were no longer evenly spaced, the homologous grid points across participants were located at the same location in the normalised template space. Thus, the reconstructed sources can be directly averaged across participants on the group level.</p><p>Next, the Cross-Spectral Density (CSD) matrix was calculated at 60 Hz for both the pre-target and baseline segments. The CSD matrix was constructed for all possible combinations between the MEG sensors and the photodiode channel. No regularisation was performed to the CSD matrices (lambda = 0).</p><p>Finally, a common spatial filter was computed based on the individual single-shell head model, source model, and CSD matrices. This spatial filter was applied to both the pre-target and baseline CSD matrices for calculating the 60 Hz coherence. This was done by normalizing the magnitude of the summed CSD between the MEG sensor and the photodiode channel by their respective power. After the grand average over participants, the relative change for pre-target coherence was estimated as the following formula, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> .</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the University of Birmingham Ethics Committee(under the approved Programme ERN_18-0226AP27).

(2021). Overall, the manuscript is well-written with a clear structure, and the data analysis and experimental results are presented in a lucid manner.</p><p>The authors have addressed the issues I raised in the previous round of review to my satisfaction. However, I still have two concerns that require the authors' consideration.</p><p>Firstly, the similarity between the RIFT analysis process in this study and traditional ERP analysis could lead readers to equate RIFT with components like N400, potentially influencing their interpretation of the results. Although the author's response has somewhat clarified my queries, I seek confirmation: does RIFT itself signify &quot;visual attention&quot; or the &quot;allocation of attentional resources to the flickering target words&quot; (line 208) in this study? While this may not be pivotal, as it primarily serves as an indicator to evaluate whether contextual congruity can indeed modulate the RIFT response rather than indicating early parafoveal semantic integration, I recommend that the authors explicitly address this point in the manuscript, maybe in the discussion section, to enhance reader comprehension of the article's rationale.</p><p>Secondly, regarding the study's conclusions, there appears to be an overemphasis in stating that &quot;semantic information ... can also be integrated with the sentence context ...&quot; (line 21-22). As raised by Reviewer 2 (Major Point 1) and acknowledged by the authors in the limitations of the revised manuscript (lines 403-412), the RIFT effect observed likely stems from local congruency. Therefore, adjusting the conclusion to &quot;integrated with previous context&quot; may offer a more precise reflection of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments from the Reviewer.</p><p>In response to the first concern, we have rephrased the sentence (Line 207-209 in the revised manuscript) to clarify that RIFT measure visual attention : “Moreover, as RIFT directly measures visual attention, the left-skewed RIFT response curve suggests that more visual attention is allocated towards the flickering target words before fixating on them, aligning with the left-to-right order of reading English.”</p><p>Regarding the second concern, we have addressed the issue by modifying “sentence context” to “previous context” in both the Abstract (Line 18 and Line 22) and the Discussion section (Line 314 and Line 361) of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
