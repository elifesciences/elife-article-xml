In single trials, beta oscillations include bursts of intermittent, transient periods of high-power activity. These burst events have been linked to a range of sensory and motor processes, but their precise spatial, spectral, and temporal structure remains unclear. Specifically, a role for beta burst activity in information coding and communication suggests spatiotemporal patterns, or travelling wave activity, along specific anatomical gradients. We here show in human magnetoencephalography recordings that burst activity in sensorimotor cortex occurs in planar spatiotemporal wave-like patterns that dominate along two axes either parallel or perpendicular to the central sulcus. Moreover, we find that the two propagation directions are characterised by distinct anatomical and physiological features. Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor beta bursts occurring before and after a movement can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral, and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beta burst</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor cortex</kwd><kwd>travelling wave</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013790</institution-id><institution>Brain Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201718-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zich</surname><given-names>Catharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013790</institution-id><institution>Brain Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201617-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zich</surname><given-names>Catharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098369/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinn</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/T001046/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Neill</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N013867/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardell</surname><given-names>Lydia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203147/Z/16/Z and 203139/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardell</surname><given-names>Lydia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This sensorimotor beta activity is traditionally seen to reflect oscillations: sustained rhythmic synchronous spiking activity within neural populations. However, a substantial proportion of sensorimotor beta activity occurs in bursts of intermittent, transient periods of synchronous spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones, 2016</xref>) which relate to both motor, perceptual, and sensory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Enz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Feingold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heideman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sporn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tinkhauser et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wessel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zich et al., 2018</xref>) and pathophysiological movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cagnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tinkhauser et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tinkhauser et al., 2017b</xref>), but their functional role remains unclear.</p><p>Sensorimotor beta burst activity is commonly considered as zero-lagged (or standing wave) activity which is generated by the summation of synchronised layer-specific inputs within cortical columns that result in a cumulative dipole with a stereotypical wavelet shape in the time domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonaiuto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Law et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neymotin et al., 2020</xref>). These time periods of synchronous activity which generate standing wave activity are thought to convey little information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brittain and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carhart-Harris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carhart-Harris et al., 2014</xref>). This view sides with the proposed akinetic role of high sensorimotor beta states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joundi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Khanna and Carmena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pogosyan et al., 2009</xref>). However, burst activity may have heterogeneous and mechanistically distinct components which can be characterised by their distinct spatial, temporal, and spectral structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Law et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zich et al., 2020</xref>) that, in addition to zero-lagged activity, contains spatiotemporal gradients, or travelling wave, components.</p><p>In animals, for example, a high proportion of sensorimotor beta activity occurs as travelling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>), in addition to highly synchronous standing waves. In travelling waves, the relative timing of fluctuations of synchronous spiking activity is not precisely zero-lagged but adopts a phase offset and moves across space. Propagation of neural activity constitutes one mechanism for cortical information transfer and travelling waves have been described over spatial scales that range from the mesoscopic (single cortical areas and millimetres of cortex) to the macroscopic (global patterns of activity over several centimetres) and extend over temporal scales from tens to hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heitmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Characterising travelling wave components within sensorimotor beta burst activity is of relevance as it would provide insights into the putative underlying mechanisms and functional roles of sensorimotor beta activity. For instance, in general terms, spatiotemporal propagation of high-amplitude beta may support information transfer across space and may reflect the spatiotemporal patterns of sequential activation required for movement initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Best et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>). At the macro-scale level, the specific propagation properties, such as propagation direction and speed, may provide further constraints for the putative functional role of burst activity in organising behaviour across different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ding and Ermentrout, 2021</xref>), including the modulation of neural sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2020</xref>) or the sequencing of muscle representations in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riehle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, the precise properties of beta bursts and whether their high-amplitude activity comprise distinct spatiotemporal gradients remain unclear.</p><p>To address this, we here employed high signal-to-noise (SNR) magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy human subjects during simple visually cued motor behaviour. We show that beta burst activity in sensorimotor cortex occurs in planar spatiotemporal wave-like patterns that dominate along two anatomical axes. Crucially, our results show structure beyond the inherent limitations of source reconstruction such as volume conduction or the spatial pattern of beamformer weights. Moreover, we find that the two propagation directions are characterised by distinct anatomical and physiological features. Finally, to further extend our understanding of the functional roles of sensorimotor beta bursts we compare bursts occurring before and after a movement. Our results suggest that sensorimotor beta bursts occurring before and after a movement can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral, and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temporal, spectral, and spatial burst characteristics</title><p>Participants completed three blocks per recording session, and 1–5 sessions on different days.

Topographically, bursts were most likely to occur in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for individual subject maps) and spanned, on average, 10% of the ROI’s surface area (apparent spatial width: <italic>M</italic> = 6 cm<sup>2</sup>; SD = 0.9 cm<sup>2</sup> across individuals). Post hoc analysis revealed no significant differences between beta bursts around index or middle finger movement.</p><p>We performed a range of control analyses to examine whether our results can be explained by trivial properties of the beamformer itself. Firstly, we sought to assess whether differences in the bursts’ apparent spatial width could be explained by differences in SNR across and/or within sessions rather than differences in the spatial distribution of cortical activity. We reasoned that if differences in SNR across sessions would explain bursts’ apparent spatial width, then burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width should be negatively correlated (for a schematic illustration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2ai</xref>). The absence of significant correlations between burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width, both across sessions within subjects and also across sessions and individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2aii</xref>), suggests that the apparent spatial width of bursts is not solely explained by the differences in SNR across sessions and across individuals.</p><p>Further we reasoned that if the apparent spatial width is driven by differences in SNR across bursts within a session, then a positive relationship between burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width within sessions should be present, and there should be no systematic phase differences across different spatial locations within each burst (for a schematic illustration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). While burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width are positively correlated within sessions (Pearson’s <italic>r: M</italic> = 0.749, SD = 0.056 across sessions, all ps&lt;0.001), we consistently observed diverse phase lags across space within these bursts (see ‘Sensorimotor burst activity propagates along one of two axes’), which are unlikely to arise simply from amplitude scaling of a single source.</p><p>Together, these control analyses suggest that differences in bursts’ apparent spatial width is not merely due to differences in SNR across and/or within sessions, but for the most part due to differences in the spatial distribution of cortical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sensorimotor beta burst activity is propagating</title><p>The precise decomposition of beta bursts into their spectral, spatial, and temporal signal domains allowed us to next assess any spatiotemporal gradients within sensorimotor beta bursts.

For example, Takahashi and colleagues reported that beta activity in M1 of a tetraplegic patient propagated along the medial–lateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). And using a multi-thousand channel array placed across the central sulcus beta activity propagated along the anterior–posterior axis across the M1-S1 functional boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tchoe et al., 2022</xref>). In non-human primates, beta activity propagates along the anterior–posterior axis in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Best et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>), and along the medial–lateral axis in the dorsal premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>), indicating regional differences in spatiotemporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Except for the multi-thousand channel array, which can cover an area of roughly 64 cm<sup>2</sup> in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tchoe et al., 2022</xref>), neural activity has been recorded from a single cortical region, limited by the dimension of the electrode array (roughly 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup>). By contrast, we here identified spatiotemporal patterns of beta activity in burst events of an average apparent spatial width of ~6 cm<sup>2</sup> located in M1 and adjacent cortical areas. By leveraging high SNR MEG recordings that permit high sensitivity in all signal domains, we were able to quantify bursts and their spatiotemporal pattern non-invasively over these functionally cogent brain regions at a spatial scale that sits between invasive recordings in animals and previous human M/EEG or intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stolk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). Our results extend previous invasive recordings by showing that bursts activity can travel across sensory and motor cortices and bridge across functionally distinct brain areas.</p><p>The spatial profiles of propagation of beta activity along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral direction are in line with the idea that propagation directions are imposed by the dominant internal connections within anatomical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>). Here, our dominant propagation axes conformed to an anterior–posterior network comprising dorsal premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and primary sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cauller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kurata, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luppino and Rizzolatti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muakkassa and Strick, 1979</xref>) and a medial–lateral network spanning across medial and lateral dorsal premotor cortex, supplementary motor area cortex, and caudal portions of ventral premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ghosh and Gattera, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luppino et al., 1993</xref>). The latter is thought to mirror proximal and distal sites within the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>), with proximal representations (i.e. shoulder and elbow) located more medially and distal representations (i.e. wrist and fingers) located more laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>). This suggests that at a macro-scale level, the direction of wave propagation is dictated by the underlying horizontal connections, though further work across different spatial scales (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sreekumar et al., 2020</xref>) is required to fully unpack the precise relationship between sustained rhythmic synchronous spiking activity within neural populations, mesoscopic and macroscopic traveling wave activity.</p><p>While our results further corroborate the importance of anterior–posterior and medial–lateral propagation axes, the precise mechanism of travelling wave activity remains unclear. One possible mechanism is that excitation from a single generator propagates through a network, guided by conduction delays within corticocortical and the corticothalamic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, travelling wave activity could arise from one generator driving a network through increasing time delay, so-called fictive travelling waves, or coupled generators that exhibit stable phase differences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2022</xref>). Different levels of network interactions may thus generate and sustain propagating waves. Common to all travelling wave activity is the idea that they generate a consistent spatiotemporal frame for further neuronal interactions. In mesoscopic data, it is very challenging to analytically resolve any ambiguity about the mechanism of wave generation. LFP recordings with implanted electrode arrays in non-human primates suggest that coupled oscillators contribute significantly to beta travelling waves over a spatial scale of 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Propagation axes of sensorimotor beta activity are physiologically distinct</title><p>While previous work has investigated individual aspects of neural activity in relation to propagation direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref>), we here consider all signal domains of neural activity. We found that the two propagation axes can be distinguished based on their physiological properties, such as propagation speed, burst occurrence, amplitude, and extent. Specifically, beta activity propagating in the medial–lateral direction is characterised by higher burst amplitude and larger burst extent, that is, bursts are larger in all signal domains. Further, more bursts propagate along the anterior–posterior l direction, which is also characterised by faster propagation speed.</p><p>Propagating wave activity can occur in a wide range of different speeds, with propagation speeds broadly falling into two categories. Speeds for mesoscopic travelling waves occurring within cortical columns and their lateral connections, as identified using local field potential (LFP), multielectrode arrays, or optical imaging, range between 0.1 and 0.8 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). These slower wave speeds are consistent with axonal conduction speeds of unmyelinated horizontal fibres in the superficial layers of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Girard et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, macroscopic travelling waves spanning across several cortical regions, and commonly assessed using mass-neural signal recordings such as M/EEG or ECoG, have been reported at speeds ranging from around 1 to 10 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). The relatively large variability in propagation speed of macroscopic travelling waves is partly due to variability in spatial resolution with low spatial resolution being susceptible to aliasing artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahramisharif et al., 2013</xref>), and some uncertainty in the travelled distance. Regarding the latter, while it has been recommended to study travelling waves on the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hughes, 1995</xref>) it is still unclear whether neural activity truly propagates along the brains cortical surface (as quantified by geodesic distance), or, at least in part, propagate through the brain volume (as quantified by Euclidean distance). Further, propagation distance can be computed on the original, folded cortical surface or on the inflated surface. Our data show that propagation speed derived from the folded surfaces is roughly twice as fast than the propagation speed derived from the inflated surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is in line with the previously reported folding factor of x2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burkitt et al., 2000</xref>). Notwithstanding the uncertainty this introduces in estimating propagation speeds, the range of propagation speeds observed here are compatible with previous reports from human and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>), and are compatible with axonal conduction speeds of myelinated cortical white matter fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Swadlow and Waxman, 2012</xref>), suggesting an active role for macro-scale travelling burst activity in intra-areal communication and information transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pre- and post-movement burst are expressed differently</title><p>The transient bursts of beta activity in our human MEG data lasted, on average, several hundred milliseconds, and span over approximately 3 Hz predominantly in the lower beta frequency range. These temporal and spectral properties are broadly in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cagnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seedat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sporn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tinkhauser et al., 2017a</xref>), with variation in the absolute values being strongly dependent on how bursts are operationalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zich et al., 2020</xref>). We extend these previous reports on the temporal and spectral burst characteristics by additionally characterising spatial burst characteristics. Sensorimotor beta burst activity often spans over several square centimetres with a distinct topographic distribution. The majority of bursts are located on the posterior bank of the precentral gyrus, with a proportion of bursts that spread to adjacent areas. While approaching the spatial limits of human MEG, these data indicate the possibility of locating beta activity within the sensorimotor cortex.</p><p>To further elucidate the functional roles of sensorimotor beta bursts, we next compared pre- and post-movement bursts with regard to both their temporal, spectral, and spatial burst characteristics, and their propagation properties. We confirmed that post-movement, compared to pre-movement, bursts occur more frequently and are stronger (i.e. higher burst amplitude) and larger in all signal domains (i.e. larger burst extent). These observations are largely in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seedat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zich et al., 2018</xref>), whereby we note that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Little et al., 2019</xref>) no difference in temporal burst duration between pre- and post-movement bursts was reported. We believe this discrepancy is because (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Little et al., 2019</xref>) employed different thresholds for pre- and post-movement bursts, whereby here the same threshold was used. Moreover, we find that pre-movement bursts exhibit faster propagation speed than post-movement burst activity. There is no evidence that the difference in propagation speed is mediated through differences in the frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>), or spatial location of bursts, as both metrics are comparable for pre- and post-movement bursts. The functional relevance of this difference in propagation speed merits further consideration in the future, but it indicates that parsing the functional role of beta activity may require its decomposition into its physiologically distinct stationary and propagating components. Finally, we show that pre- and post-movement bursts propagate along the same propagation axis, which is in line with previous reports, observing the same propagation axes during action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>) and rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). This provides further evidence that the propagation of burst activity is constrained by the underlying connectivity.</p><p>Together, our results show that, compared to pre-movement bursts, post-movement bursts are stronger and larger in all signal domains, whereby their spectral and spatial centre, as well as their propagation direction, are comparable. This might indicate that pre- and post-movement bursts share the similar generator processes, which exhibits more and stronger bursts post-movement. Studies using biophysical modelling have proposed that beta bursts are generated by a broad infragranular excitatory synaptic drive temporally aligned with a strong supragranular synaptic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Law et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neymotin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) whereby layer-specific inhibition acts to stabilise beta bursts in the temporal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">West et al., 2023</xref>). The supragranular drive is thought to originate in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mo and Sherman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seedat et al., 2020</xref>), indicating thalamocortical mechanisms. Interestingly, sensorimotor beta bursts have not only been observed during action but also during rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seedat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Echeverria-Altuna et al., 2021</xref>), which raises the question of their functional role. That sensorimotor beta bursts occur across functional states, spatial scales, and species suggests that the functional role of the mere presence of bursts is a very elementary one, such as maintaining the ‘status quo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>) or ‘null space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we believe that specific functional roles can be linked to the manifestation of bursts quantifiable by their temporal, spectral, and spatial bursts characteristics as well as their propagation properties. To give one example, motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease have been linked to prolonged burst duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tinkhauser et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tinkhauser et al., 2017b</xref>). The proposed hierarchical dual-role framework of burst function can be tested using biophysical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neymotin et al., 2020</xref>) and targeted neuromodulatory experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Caveats of spatial and spatiotemporal properties in source space</title><p>Non-invasive techniques have limitations that should be considered when interpreting the spatial domain of bursts and travelling wave activity. LCMV beamformers assume that each source is a single dipole and that there are no other correlated sources in the brain. These limitations make interpretation of spatial structure in LCMV power maps ambiguous. We explore several specific issues: firstly, whether the apparent spatial extent of a source is simply modulated by the SNR of the signal. Secondly, the inherent smoothness of the source reconstruction maps due to the mapping of a few hundred sensors to several thousand voxels. Finally, if a patch of cortex is active rather than a single point source, then these correlated voxels can suppress the signal of interest. Each of these points can be challenging when interpreting the spatial domain of bursts and travelling waves.</p><p>The first issue suggests that differences in the bursts’ apparent spatial width could simply be caused by differences in SNR across and/or within sessions rather than differences in the spatial distribution of cortical activity. We performed one beamformer per session; thus, different SNR levels across sessions would affect the beamformer weights. However, if variation across sessions in beamformer weights would explain variation in bursts’ apparent spatial width, we would expect a negative relationship between burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width across sessions. This is not the case in our data, suggesting that between-session differences in beamformer weights do not cause the observed differences in bursts’ apparent spatial width. Nevertheless, spatial width of burst activity measured with M/EEG or ECoG should be interpreted with caution. Here, due to the strong correlation between the bursts’ apparent spatial width, temporal duration, and frequency spread, we combined these signal properties using PCA and used the resulting cross-modal measure burst extent.</p><p>Secondly, the inherent smoothness of the beamformer solution can lead to 'trivial' structure in the source solution, meaning that single sources can leak across cortex or that multiple sources can become blurred together. Across space in bursts diverse phase lags exists, suggesting that structure is unlikely to have arisen solely from leakage of a single source. The functional role of travelling waves remains unclear. As outlined above, the mechanisms underlying travelling waves remain ambiguous (see ‘Distinct anatomical propagation axes of sensorimotor beta activity’), both at the meso- and macro scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that this phase structure arises from mixing of multiple distinct sources but take a 'gradient' or 'travelling wave’ perspective here to better link with comparative literature. While this concerns travelling wave analyses across a range of spatial scales and recording techniques, source space analysis, as employed here, entails an additional issue – namely whether the propagation directions can be trivially explained by spatial variability in the beamformer weights. Our control analysis showed that the estimated propagation direction correlates significantly with the propagation direction obtained after regressing out the main components of spatial variability in the beamformer weights. This indicates that beamformer weights can contribute to, but do not solely explain, spatiotemporal gradients in human MEG data.</p><p>Finally, patches of high-amplitude, correlated sources can be mutually suppressed by the LCMV beamformer, leading to an apparent loss of signal. Though we cannot remove the possibility these mutual correlations may be suppressing part of the signal, we observe strong task-related activity suggesting that a substantial proportion remains in our analysis.</p><p>Together, we acknowledge that the beamformer weights can affect bursts’ spatial width and propagation direction but believe that our control analyses suggest that the beamformer weights are not driving the observed effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and experimental task</title><p>The study was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (reference number 5833/001) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Finally, one of the main advantages of HMM, that is, the prevention of burst-splits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>) is overcome in the 5D clustering procedure. Together, while HMM and other data-driven approaches are generally advantageous, in this framework a simple amplitude threshold is preferred.</p><p>Following binarisation, data were clustered across time, frequency, and space using a three-stage approach (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Note that data are four-dimensional, that is, time × frequency × space × trial, whereby space is on its own three-dimensional (x, y, z coordinates of surface locations). First, for each trial data were clustered in 2D (i.e. time × frequency). To this end, the binarised data were summed over the spatial domain and time-frequency cells with at least one surface location being ‘on’ were clustered using eight-connectivity (i.e. connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Second, for each time-frequency cell with at least one surface location being ‘on’, spatial locations on the surface mesh were clustered in 3D (i.e. x, y, z coordinates of surface locations). Spatial locations were part of the same cluster if their Euclidean distance was smaller than the maximal distance of two spatial locations (<italic>M</italic> = 2.66 mm; SD = 0.15 mm across individuals). Finally, source clusters were combined across time-frequency cells using eight-connectivity, that is, if two spatial clusters of two adjourning time-frequency cells overlapped in at least one surface location the two spatial clusters were combined. This procedure allows clustering in high-dimensional irregular space and results in 3D (time × frequency × space) bursts. Burst identification was limited to the time of interest (−2 to 2 s relative to the button press), the frequency of interest (13–30 Hz), and ROI (left-hand area). To restrict the burst analysis to an ROI, volume-based ROIs in MNI space were normalised to subject’s native space using the inverse deformation field and transformed to surface-based ROIs. Clusters had to span at least two time points, frequency steps, and spatial locations to be considered further.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-80160-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of 5D clustering.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Burst characteristics</title><p>We divide burst characteristics into first- and second-level burst characteristics. We define first-level burst characteristics as characteristics that are obtained for each burst and each domain separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the first-level characteristics. For the temporal domain, burst temporal on- and offset, temporal duration and centre (i.e. mean of on- and offset) were obtained. Equally, low- and high-frequency boundaries, frequency spread and centre (i.e. mean of low and high boundary) were extracted for the spectral domain. For the spatial domain, we obtained the spatial width (i.e. total surface area defined as the sum of the area of all faces), the size in each dimension (x, y, z) using the minimum bounding rectangle (i.e. bounding box), and the spatial centre. The spatial centre is defined as the projection of the centre of mass onto the surface. The spatial centre can be described using its Cartesian coordinates. An alternative to the description of the spatial centre is provided by the first two components of a PCA of the Cartesian coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The first two PCs describing 98% of variance are retained for further analysis. The first PC (76.3% variance explained) contains a spatial gradient along the anterior/lateral–posterior/medial axis. The second PC (22.3% variance explained) contains a spatial gradient along the anterior/medial–posterior/lateral axis. Thus, the location of an individual burst can be described by the two PC scores, relating to the amount of each PC that it contains. In addition, burst amplitude was obtained, that is, the mean amplitude across all time points, frequencies, and spatial locations of the burst.</p><p>These first-level burst characteristics form the basis for second-level burst characteristics. These can be broadly summarised as (1) combinations and (2) interactions of characteristics within and across domains. Here we extract one of these measures: temporal duration, frequency spread, and apparent spatial width were combined to a single metric, that is, burst extent. The three measures are highly correlated within subjects (<italic>M</italic> = 0.785; SD = 0.021, across the three correlations and eight individuals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>) and were therefore reduced to a single metric using PCA. The first principal component explains 85.6% of the variance and is defined as burst extent (PC 2: 7.5%; PC 3: 6.9%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>). These burst metrics are not exhaustive. Other second-level burst characteristics include the interaction between frequency centre and spatial location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zich et al., 2020</xref>), waveform variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Szul et al., 2022</xref>), and the variability of the first-level burst characteristics, such as the variability in (instantaneous) frequency, within and across bursts. Future work may address the variability and temporal stability of bursts, for example, using methods such as empirical mode decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Propagation direction and speed of neural activity within bursts</title><p>To investigate whether activity within human sensorimotor bursts propagates, we identified the dominant propagation direction and speed for each burst. To this end, data (before time-frequency decomposition, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of each burst were extracted from burst on- to offset for each surface location in the burst. The sign ambiguity in the beamforming process entails that the spatial locations within a burst may have arbitrarily opposite signs. This is not an issue when estimating power, as above, but can impact on the estimation of the propagation direction. Sign ambiguity was resolved using the sign-flipping algorithm described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vidaurre et al., 2018</xref>. For a finer temporal resolution, data were interpolated by a factor of 10.</p><p>For each burst, we estimated the propagation direction and propagation speed. Propagation direction and speed were estimated from critical points in the oscillatory cycle (four critical points per oscillatory cycle, i.e. peak and trough as well as peak-trough and trough-peak midpoint, grey vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and then averaged across critical points within one burst.</p><p>The propagation direction at each critical point was estimated from the relative latency (i.e. absolute latency of that critical point at each surface location relative to absolute latency of that critical point for the average across all surface locations in that burst). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2bi</xref> shows the relative latency for each surface location in the burst for the critical point at 212 ms in the burst. Next, from these relative latencies and their surface locations the propagation direction was estimated. Specifically, propagation direction was estimated using linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2020</xref>), whereby the relative latency at the surface location was predicted from the coordinates of the surface location of the inflated surface. On the inflated surface, a gradient in the z-direction is always depicted by a gradient in x- or y-direction, which is why only two simple linear regressions were estimated, one for the x-and one for the y-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2bii</xref>). Propagation direction along the x-y-direction was obtained by transforming the regression coefficients from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2biii</xref>). For each regression, its associated coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) was calculated and the two R<sup>2</sup>s averaged. This approach results in one propagation direction and one R<sup>2</sup> per critical point.</p><p>Propagation direction across critical points was obtained by clustering (i.e. spectral clustering) the propagation directions across critical points. Three scenarios existed: (1) one cluster was obtained and the variability across directions of critical points was relatively low (standard deviation &lt; π/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2biii</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>); (2) one cluster was obtained and the variability across directions of critical points was relatively high (standard deviation &gt; π/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>); and (3) more than one cluster was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Scenarios 2 and 3 indicate complex propagation patterns, such as random or circular patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>). Based on previous literature, we expect planar traveling waves to be dominant in the primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rule et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). For bursts of scenario 1, propagation directions and R<sup>2</sup> were averaged across critical points (back arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2biii</xref>). To have sufficient confidence in the direction, bursts with an average R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.2 were discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 2020</xref>). Following this procedure, we found that 79.59% (SD = 2.37% across individuals) of the bursts show a spatiotemporal pattern (R<sup>2</sup>: <italic>M</italic> = 0.355, SD = 0.016 across individuals). To combine propagation directions across subjects, propagation directions were spatially normalised to MNI space using the deformation field. Directions are presented as probability distributions. On the average of the probability distributions across subjects, the propagation direction was quantified using a mixture of von Mises functions.</p><p>The propagation speed at each critical point was defined as the distance between the spatial locations with the largest and smallest relative latency (i.e. latency of each surface location relative to the average latency) divided by the difference in their latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahramisharif et al., 2013</xref>). Distance was computed using exact geodesic distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mitchell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2cii</xref>) on the inflated surface. Propagation speed was averaged across critical points. For comparison, we calculated the propagation speed using the original surface. The speed computed using the distance on the original surface (<italic>M</italic> = 4.90 m/s, SD = 0.46 m/s across individuals) is faster than the speed computed using the distance on the inflated surface (<italic>M</italic> = 2.61 m/s, SD = 0.39 m/s across individuals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This difference is well in line with a suggested cortical folding factor of x2.2 to adjust propagation speeds for cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burkitt et al., 2000</xref>). Propagation speed is in the expected range of macroscopic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Accuracy of the propagation direction detection in simulated and real meshes</title><p>Using simulation, we evaluated the accuracy of the propagation direction estimation. To this end, we generated 360 noise-free high-resolution gradients span 1° in steps of 1° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows a subset). To evaluate the effect of mesh type and spatial sampling, we created three 2D mesh types, (1) square mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), (2) circular mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and (3) random mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), whereby each mesh type was sampled at three spatial sampling rates: N/2, N, and N × 2 (N approximates the spatial sampling of the surface mesh, i.e. roughly 27 surface locations per cm<sup>2</sup>). For each gradient and each mesh, the propagation direction was estimated and the estimation error, that is, difference between true and estimated propagation direction, computed. For the random mesh, this procedure was repeated 100 times, each time with a different random mesh.</p><p>As the surface mesh is irregular and each burst is unique in its spatial size and shape, we additionally evaluated the accuracy of the propagation direction estimation for the real bursts. To this end, for each individual burst and each gradient, the propagation direction was estimated, and the estimation error computed as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Control analysis</title><p>The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem in M/EEG means that the source estimation has a degree of smoothness. While this is unavoidable and shared with all inverse problem methods, the smoothness can be problematic when interpreting the spatial domain of burst and their spatiotemporal gradients, travelling waves. We perform a series of control analysis to explore the practical effect of these ambiguities in our data. Our reasoning was that with regards to interpreting the spatial width of burst activity, any differences could be caused by differences in SNR across and/or within sessions rather than differences in the spatial distribution of cortical activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2ai and bi</xref> for a schematic illustrations). To address this, we performed several correlation analyses between burst amplitude and burst apparent spatial width, between and across sessions. Further, we investigated whether the distribution of the propagation direction is biased by a potential bias in the spatial domain, such as the selective cancellation of bursts generated by tangential sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlfors et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eulitz et al., 1997</xref>). We aimed to examine the distribution of propagation directions from beta bursts which form a uniform distribution across space. To retain a nigh SNR, we focussed this analysis to the area of the ROI that has a burst probity higher than 0.44 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We then iteratively removed bursts until the burst distribution across this space was uniform. We found that the distribution of propagation directions using a subset of bursts forming a uniform spatial distribution is comparable to the original set of bursts. This analysis suggests that potential spatial sampling bias does not shape the propagation analysis.</p><p>Regarding the interpretation of travelling waves, there is inherent ambiguity concerning the mechanisms that generate a travelling wave (see ‘Distinct anatomical propagation axes of sensorimotor beta activity’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prechtl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>). While this concerns travelling wave analyses across a range of spatial scales and recording techniques, the source space analysis employed here entails an additional issue – namely whether the propagation directions can be trivially explained by spatial variability in the LCMV weights. To address this issue, we correlated the latency of the critical points across space before and after regressing out the main components of the spatial variability in the LCMV weights. Specifically, we performed PCA on the LCMV weights and retained the components that explained 90% of the variance in the LCMV weights. We then performed, for each critical point of each burst, a multiple regression analysis with the latencies of the critical point across space as dependent variable and the coefficients of the PCs across space as independent variables. We then correlated the latency of the critical points across space with the residuals of the multiple regression. Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> was first averaged across critical points within bursts, and then across bursts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric testing in Matlab2019b. If not stated otherwise, descriptive statistics depict mean and standard deviation of the median across subjects. Burst characteristics with unimodal distributions (e.g. burst amplitude, burst propagation speed) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the medians of the distribution. The test statistic is reported as a value of <italic>T</italic>. Burst characteristics with multimodal distributions (e.g. spatial location) were compared using a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test on the single subject level. The test statistic is reported as the value of <italic>KS</italic> (i.e. mean and range across subjects). Two circular distributions (e.g. propagation direction pre- and post-movement) were compared using two-sample Watson’s U<sup>2</sup> test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Landler et al., 2021</xref>) on the single subject level. The test statistic is reported as the value of <italic>U</italic><sup>2</sup> test (i.e. mean and range across subjects).</p><p>To test whether there is significant spatiotemporal structure in burst activity, we compared the propagation direction of real and surrogate data. Specifically, for a subset of bursts, that is, 100 randomly selected bursts sampled across all subjects, 1000 surrogates were created for each burst from the data after sign ambiguity was resolved (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Surrogate data were obtained by computing the discrete Fourier transform of the data, randomising the phase spectrum while preserving the amplitude spectrum, and then computing the inverse discrete Fourier transform to obtain the surrogated data (method 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hurtado et al., 2004</xref>). For each burst, the magnitude of the propagation direction of the real data was compared to the distribution from 1000 surrogates.</p><p>To quantify the overall propagation direction, a mixture of four von Mises functions was fitted to the average of the subjects’ probability distribution of propagation directions across bursts. This provides an estimate of the angle and length of the von Mises functions. Reliability of von Mises functions was assessed using a split-half reliability. In total, 500 split halves were computed and 4 von Mises functions estimated on each half independently. For both, angle and length, the difference between the two halves was computed. Further, to test whether the von Mises functions were significantly different from zero, non-parametric permutation testing was employed on the length of the von Mises functions. Permutations were carried out by randomising the propagation direction of each burst. In total, 5000 permutations were computed before statistical significance was determined on the length of the von Mises functions while correcting for multiple comparison at p&lt;0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Software</title><p>All analyses are performed using freely available tools in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc (2022a) version 9.12.0, Natick, Massachusetts, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>).

Using high-resolution source reconstruction with Magnetoencephalography in humans, the authors provide compelling evidence demonstrating that β oscillations are organized as travelling waves in two distinct directions relative to the central sulcus. Furthermore, the study convincingly shows that the spatiotemporal organization of β bursts is systematically linked to behavior, specifically motor execution.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatiotemporal organization of human sensorimotor β burst activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Law (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can see from the reviews, there are a number of methodological/technical concerns that need to be addressed, although the reviewers considered the work generally sound in terms of methods. A more critical point is the nature of the conceptual advance in terms of understanding the mechanisms or functions of β bursts and waves. We expect the authors to expand their study in terms of the significance of the findings, by performing new analyses and analyzing new data. Thus, we are happy to invite a revision, but we expect new data and/or analyses that substantially improve the significance of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see from the reviewers, the study received mixed evaluations. We focus here on comments pertaining to the technical aspects (comments 1-9), and the conceptual advance (comment 10).</p><p>1) Could the beamforming weights transform any activity (regardless of its original structure) into a profile that shows travelling waves? The authors do report a high correlation. Please clarify.</p><p>2) It seems that the authors do the analysis in the embedding space created by the 2D visualizer. To what extent does this bias the results? Why was the analysis not done in the 3D space?</p><p>3) Could there be a trivial explanation for the two wave directions that are reported. MEG is of course sensitive mostly to tangential current flow. This tangential current flow comes from the walls of the sulci or cortical tissue that folds around the midline or laterally. If you look at the orientation of the walls of the sulci then this predicts current flow in the anterior to posterior plane. And the medial/lateral axis as well.</p><p>4) Modifying the threshold at which β events are detected could alter their reported properties and expression in space and time. The authors should therefore perform parameter sweeps on e.g. the thresholds for detection of oscillation bursts to determine whether their conclusions on β properties and propagation hold. If this additional analysis does not change their story, it would lend confidence to the results/conclusions.</p><p>5) Determining the generators of β events at different locations is a tricky issue. The authors mentioned a single generator that is responsible for propagating β along the two axes described. However, it is not clear through what mechanism the β events could travel along the neural substrate without additional local generators along the way. Previous work on β events examined how a sequence of synaptic inputs to supra and</p><p>infragranular layers would contribute to a typical β event waveform. Although it is possible other mechanisms exist, how might this work as the β events propagate through space? Some further explanation/investigation on these issues is therefore warranted.</p><p>6) Given that the main angle of this paper is methodological, it would be important to provide the source code on github along with documentation and a standard &quot;notebook&quot;.</p><p>7) The authors should describe in more detail the properties of the β bursts in both directions: Are there any distinguishing features for the β bursts that propagate along each primary direction? How far do each of the traveling waves go in each direction? Is the</p><p>frequency and properties nearly constant as the waves travel or do the dominant frequencies show any shifts the farther the waves get from their generator? If there is a single generator responsible for the β waves that travel in each direction, then through</p><p>what mechanism are the β events created as they propagate further from their source?</p><p>8) Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor β bursts occurring before and after a movement share the same generator but can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.&quot; If β bursts before/after movements have the same generator, what distinguishes the initiation of movement vs lack of movement? As a result of their work here, would the authors hypothesize that β contributes to either generation or suppression of movement?</p><p>9) Spatial cancellation of β occurring simultaneously on both sides of the central sulcus may occur (these events would be near to one another and with opposite orientations, cancelling out the magnetic field, see Ahlfors et al. 2010). This would ultimately lead to fewer detected events on the sulcal walls, compared with the sulcal banks. Ultimately the study may be throwing out a lot of ground-truth events from the walls, and the fact that the authors keep more events from deep in the sulcus will bias the traveling wave analysis that follows.</p><p>In Figure 1, the authors seem to show a higher density of β events relatively deep in the sulcus compared to the sulcal walls. This is certainly an interesting result if true! But even given only the occasional synchronization of mesoscale cortical neighborhoods, it appears that events in the sulcal walls will still be systematically undersampled and those deep in the sulcus oversampled here, by vice or virtue of cortical geometry as it pertains to the magnetic field.</p><p>This spatial sampling bias could impact nearly all aspects of the event propagation analysis that follows, and so must be considered in sufficient detail.</p><p>A &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; is that ground-truth events may be uniformly distributed across much of the region of interest, and where both the reported directionality and relative incidence rates of traveling wave classes are artefactually biased. Treating this potential issue could, for instance, come in the form of (1) developing further controls and/or (2) repeating the analysis after resampling events to reflect a potential worst-case ground-truth scenario.</p><p>10) While the reviewers acknowledged the methodological advance, they were not sufficiently convinced that the present study provides sufficient functional advance. For example, no meaningful difference was found between bursts traveling along the two different principal modes of propagation, and importantly, no relation with behavior (response time) was found. The same stands for pre vs. post motor bursts, except for the expected finding that post-motor bursts are more frequent and tend to be of greater amplitude (yielding the observation of a so-called β rebound, on average across trials).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80160.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see from the reviewers, the study received mixed evaluations.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue, which we investigated in different ways.</p><p>First, as outlined in the paper: To examine whether the two main propagation axes can be trivially explained by spatial variability in the beamformer weights, we correlated the latency of the critical points across space before and after regressing out the main components of the spatial variability in the LCMV weights. Specifically, we performed PCA on the LCMV weights and retained the components that explained 90% of the variance in the LCMV weights. We then performed, for each critical point of each burst, a multiple regression analysis with the latencies of the critical point across space as the dependent variable, and the coefficients of the PCs across space as independent variables. We then correlated the latency of the critical points across space with the residuals of the multiple regression. Pearson’s r was first averaged across critical points within bursts, and then across bursts. We found significant correlations (Pearson’s r: M = 0.61, SD = 0.27 across individuals, all p’s &lt; 0.05). This result suggests that beamformer weights contribute to, but do not solely explain the observed propagation directions.</p><p>Second, the LCMV weights are fixed within a recording session, yet we still observe considerable variability in the propagation direction both within and across bursts. If the directions would be predominantly driven by the LCMV weights, we would expect low moment-to-moment variability in the propagation direction.</p><p>Third, we now conducted the same propagation analysis but for a different frequency range (γ, γ, 60-90Hz) for one exemplar subject. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>. As the filter was applied before the beamformer, we have a separate set of LCMV weights for the β and γ frequency range. We inspected the structure of the PCA components that explained 95% of the variance in the LCMV weights and leadfields for the β and γ frequency range. We found that the structure of these PCs was comparable cross the two frequency ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>). Therefore, we reason that: if the beamformer solely explains the propagation directions, the distribution of propagation directions should be comparable between the β and γ frequency range, given the comparable structure of the PCs. However, we find that, in contrast to the β frequency range, for the γ range no dominant directions were observed and von Mises functions did not converge. This suggests that the LCMV weights do not lead to an unavoidable phase-gradient and appearance of propagation.</p><p>Together we believe this set of analysis indicated that beamformer weights contribute to, but do not solely explain the observed propagation directions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Propagation direction and LCMV weights for the β and γ frequency range.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Propagation direction for the β (β, 13-30Hz) and γ (γ, 60-90) frequency range for one exemplar subject (across all sessions of that subject).

To what extent does this bias the results? Why was the analysis not done in the 3D space?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that most of the analyses were performed in 3D space on the original (i.e., folded) surface. The only exception is the quantification of the propagation direction and propagation speed.</p><p>We estimated the propagation direction on the inflated surface for easier interpretability and consistency with published reports using multi-electrode arrays (Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Best et al., 2016; Rubino et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2011, 2015). One of the challenges of estimating propagation direction in 3D on the original folded surface is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Here, two bursts, one on the crown (a) and one on the bank (b) of the precentral gyrus, are projected onto the original (bottom) and the inflated (top) surface. For the burst on the crown the propagation direction (illustrated by the colour gradient, and black arrow) is primarily along the x- and y-axis for both the original and inflated surface. However, for the burst on the bank of the gyrus, the propagation direction is primarily along the z-axis on the original surface, and along the y-axis of the inflated surface.</p><p>Thus, if the propagation direction is estimated on the original surface, the spatial location and folding need to be taken into consideration. This is especially important here, where we analyse bursts at a relatively small spatial scale, with bursts often spanning a relatively small area of the cortex. In contrast, if propagation is estimated across larger areas spanning across several sulci (as is the case, for example, in many EEG studies) the x- and y-axes will naturally dominate the propagation direction, and this point becomes less critical.</p><p>The spatial folding could be considered by estimating the propagation direction from the original surface as a function of the surface normals. However, we opted for a more intuitive approach that enabled us to easily relate the results from our non-invasive recordings with results from invasive multi-electrode arrays, and provide more intuitive ways for visualization.</p><p>We also note that our results were not simply just projected onto a 2D visualizer. Rather, the inflated cortical surface preserves the spatial relationship among vertices and allows for a direct mapping between the 3D and 2D data projections through a corresponding transformation matrix.</p><p>Regarding propagation speed, we estimated speed using both the distance derived from the original cortical surfaces and the inflated surfaces. Despite absolute differences between the two estimates (i.e., propagation speed derived from the original surfaces is roughly twice as fast as the propagation speed derived from the inflated surface, Figure 2—figure supplement 2), their relative effects (i.e., the difference in propagation speed between the two dominant axes, Figure 4b and the difference in propagation speed between pre- and post-movement bursts Figure 5b) are consistent.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Propagation direction estimated from the original (i.e., folded) and inflated surface.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Burst on the crown of the precentral gyrus visualised on the inflated (top) and original (bottom) surface.

And the medial/lateral axis as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point here, i.e., whether the two propagation directions can be simply explained by cortical folding. While we cannot rule out a contribution of cortical folding, we would like to highlight three aspects suggesting that cortical folding does not solely explain the spatiotemporal features of bursts.</p><p>First, we have now compared the propagation directions of deeper (e.g., bursts located in a sulcus) versus shallower bursts (e.g., bursts located around the gyral crown). Cortical depth was determined using the spatial location PC 3<sup>1</sup> (as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3b</xref>, the propagation direction is comparable for deeper and shallower bursts. Specifically, we found that propagation directions were not significantly different between deeper and shallower bursts (U2 [test statistic for Watson’s U2 test, see Statistical analysis]: M = 0.092 across individuals, range = 0.037 – 0.227; 8/8 p’s &gt; 0.1). Moreover, the directions of activity in deeper bursts (a-p axis: 68/244deg; m-l axis: 141/320deg) did not differ from the directions observed in shallower bursts (a-p axis: 63/250deg; m-l axis: 143/325deg).</p><p>(<sup>1</sup>As a reminder, the spatial centre of bursts was described using principal components (PC). Burst distribution was characterised along the anterior/lateral - posterior/medial axis by PC 1, along the anterior/medial - posterior/lateral axis axis by PC 2, and along the z-orientation by PC 3.)</p><p>Second, and related, the cortical folding and the orientation of the cortical surface normals with regards to the sensors is highly variable both within (i.e., the angle of the central sulcus to a given sensor varies along the central sulcus) and across subjects (i.e., the architecture of the central sulcus is different across individuals, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3a</xref>). This means that the distinction between tangential = wall vs lateral = crown current flow is not clearly borne out neither within nor across subjects. We also note that more bursts were observed in the depth of the central sulcus, a point we revisit in response to reviewer 3.</p><p>Third, recordings from invasive multi-electrode arrays have shown a similar dominance of these two propagation axes. For example, Takahashi and colleagues reported that β activity in M1 of a tetraplegic patient propagated along the medial-lateral axis (Takahashi et al., 2011). In non-human primates, β activity propagates along the anterior-posterior axis in M1 (Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Best et al., 2016; Rubino et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2011, 2015), and along the medial-lateral axis in the dorsal premotor cortex (Rubino et al., 2006), indicating regional differences in spatiotemporal patterns (Rubino et al., 2006; Rule et al., 2018).</p><p>Together, we believe this provides convergent evidence that the two main propagation directions are not simply an artefact of cortical folding.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Cortical folding and propagation direction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Surface plot, on the inflated surface, of cortical depth, i.e. spatial location principal component (PC) 3 (see Figure 4—figure supplement 3, for PC 1 and PC 2).

The authors should therefore perform parameter sweeps on e.g. the thresholds for detection of oscillation bursts to determine whether their conclusions on β properties and propagation hold. If this additional analysis does not change their story, it would lend confidence to the results/conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewing team for this comment. As suggested, we evaluated the effect of different burst thresholds on the burst parameters.</p><p>The threshold in the main analysis was determined empirically from the data, as in previous work (Little et al., 2019). Specifically, trial-wise power was correlated with the burst probability across a range of different threshold values (from median to median plus seven standard deviations (std), in steps of 0.25, see Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The threshold value that retained the highest correlation between trial-wise power and burst probability was used to binarize the data.</p><p>We repeated our original analysis using four additional thresholds, i.e., original threshold 0.5 std, -0.25 std, +0.25 std, +0.5 std. As one would expect, burst threshold is negatively related to the number of bursts (i.e., higher thresholds yield fewer bursts, Figure 6—figure supplement 2a [top]), and positively related to burst amplitude (i.e., higher thresholds yield higher burst amplitudes, Figure 6—figure supplement 2a [bottom]).</p><p>Similarly, the temporal duration of bursts and apparent spatial width are modulated by the burst threshold: lowering the threshold leads to longer temporal duration and larger apparent spatial width while increasing the threshold leads to shorter temporal duration and smaller apparent spatial width Figure 6—figure supplement 2b. Note that for the temporal and spectral burst characteristics, the difference to the original threshold can be numerically zero, i.e., changing the burst threshold did not lead to changes exceeding the temporal and spectral resolution of the applied time-frequency transformation (i.e., 200ms and 1Hz respectively).</p><p>Importantly, across these threshold values, the propagation direction and propagation speed remain comparable Figure 6—figure supplement 2c.</p><p>We refer to this analysis in the manuscript (page 28 line 717).</p><p>“To explore the robustness of the results analyses were repeated using a range of thresholds (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Determining the generators of β events at different locations is a tricky issue. The authors mentioned a single generator that is responsible for propagating β along the two axes described. However, it is not clear through what mechanism the β events could travel along the neural substrate without additional local generators along the way. Previous work on β events examined how a sequence of synaptic inputs to supra and</p><p>infragranular layers would contribute to a typical β event waveform. Although it is possible other mechanisms exist, how might this work as the β events propagate through space? Some further explanation/investigation on these issues is therefore warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this and other comments (i.e., comments 7 and 8) we re-evaluated the use of the term ‘generator’ in this manuscript.</p><p>While the term generator can be used across scales, from micro- to macroscale, ifor the purpose of the present paper, we believe one should differentiate at least two concepts: (a) generator of β bursts, and (b) generator of travelling waves.</p><p>We realised that in the previous version of the manuscript the term ‘generator’ was at times used without context. We removed the term where no longer necessary.</p><p>Further, the previous version of the manuscript discussed putative generators of travelling waves (page 19F.) but not generators of β bursts. We now address this as follows:</p><p>“Studies using biophysical modelling have proposed that β bursts are generated by a broad infragranular excitatory synaptic drive temporally aligned with a strong supragranular synaptic drive (Law et al., 2022; Neymotin et al., 2020; Sherman et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2017) whereby layer specific inhibition acts to stabilise β bursts in the temporal domain (West et al., 2023). The supragranular drive is thought to originate in the thalamus (E. G. Jones, 1998, 2001; Mo and Sherman, 2019; Seedat et al., 2020), indicating thalamocortical mechanisms (page 22f).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that the main angle of this paper is methodological, it would be important to provide the source code on github along with documentation and a standard &quot;notebook&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>All analyses are performed using freely available tools in MATLAB.

How far do each of the traveling waves go in each direction? Is the</p><p>frequency and properties nearly constant as the waves travel or do the dominant frequencies show any shifts the farther the waves get from their generator? If there is a single generator responsible for the β waves that travel in each direction, then through</p><p>what mechanism are the β events created as they propagate further from their source?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our previous work (Zich et al., 2020), we consider first and second level burst characteristics. First level burst characteristics are obtained for each burst and each domain separately (see Figure 1). For the temporal domain, the temporal on- and offset, temporal duration and temporal centre (i.e., mean of on- and offset) of each burst were obtained. Equally, low and high frequency boundaries, frequency spread and frequency centre (i.e., mean of low and high boundary) were extracted for the spectral domain from each burst. For the spatial domain, we obtained the spatial width (i.e., the total surface area defined as the sum of the area of all faces), the size in each dimension (x, y, z) using the minimum bounding rectangle (i.e., bounding box), and the spatial centre.</p><p>These first level burst characteristics form the basis for second level burst characteristics, which can be broadly summarised as (a) combinations and (b) interactions of characteristics within and across domains. For example, we combined temporal duration, frequency spread, and apparent spatial width into a single metric, i.e., burst extent. Further we explored the spatiotemporal interaction in depth.</p><p>One of the critical questions of this paper is whether bursts activity that propagate along the a-p axis or m-l axis differ systematically in any of these first or second level burst characteristics (see page 13f, Figure 4). This is relevant because distinct properties of bursts in different locations or travel directions may be of functional relevance or may be underpinned by distinct mechanisms.</p><p>In addition to this analysis of burst characteristics, the reviewers highlighted further signal properties that could be explored, e.g., variability of signal properties within a burst. We think that these signal properties are beyond the scope of the present paper in that the variability and temporal stability of bursts is an interesting question that warrant detailed exploration. For this reason, we now mention this in the manuscript (page 30), as follows:</p><p>“These burst metrics are not exhaustive. Other 2nd level burst characteristics include the interaction between frequency centre and spatial location (Zich et al., 2020), waveform variability (Szul et al., 2022), and the variability of the 1st level burst characteristics, such as the variability in (instantaneous) frequency, within and across bursts. Future work may address the variability and temporal stability of bursts, for example using methods such as empirical mode decomposition (Huang et al., 1998).”</p><p>Regarding the aspects concerning the ‘generator’ please refer to our answer to point 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor β bursts occurring before and after a movement share the same generator but can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.&quot; If β bursts before/after movements have the same generator, what distinguishes the initiation of movement vs lack of movement? As a result of their work here, would the authors hypothesize that β contributes to either generation or suppression of movement?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this and other comments (i.e., comments 5 and 7) we re-evaluated the use of the term ‘generator’ in this manuscript. Please see comment 5 for more details. The paragraph in the introduction now reads:</p><p>“Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor β bursts occurring before and after a movement can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Spatial cancellation of β occurring simultaneously on both sides of the central sulcus may occur (these events would be near to one another and with opposite orientations, cancelling out the magnetic field, see Ahlfors et al. 2010). This would ultimately lead to fewer detected events on the sulcal walls, compared with the sulcal banks. Ultimately the study may be throwing out a lot of ground-truth events from the walls, and the fact that the authors keep more events from deep in the sulcus will bias the traveling wave analysis that follows.</p><p>In Figure 1, the authors seem to show a higher density of β events relatively deep in the sulcus compared to the sulcal walls. This is certainly an interesting result if true! But even given only the occasional synchronization of mesoscale cortical neighborhoods, it appears that events in the sulcal walls will still be systematically undersampled and those deep in the sulcus oversampled here, by vice or virtue of cortical geometry as it pertains to the magnetic field.</p><p>This spatial sampling bias could impact nearly all aspects of the event propagation analysis that follows, and so must be considered in sufficient detail.</p><p>A &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; is that ground-truth events may be uniformly distributed across much of the region of interest, and where both the reported directionality and relative incidence rates of traveling wave classes are artefactually biased. Treating this potential issue could, for instance, come in the form of (1) developing further controls and/or (2) repeating the analysis after resampling events to reflect a potential worst-case ground-truth scenario.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. As suggested, we performed a set of control analysis to investigate this issue.</p><p>First, in line with our response to comment #3 we compared the propagation directions of deeper (e.g., bursts located in a sulcus) versus shallower bursts (e.g., bursts located around the gyral crown). Cortical depth was determined using the spatial location PC 3<sup>2</sup> (visualised in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3b</xref>, the distribution of propagation direction for deeper and shallower bursts do not significantly differ between deeper and shallower bursts (U2 [test statistic for Watson’s U2 test, see Statistical analysis]: M = 0.092 across individuals, range = 0.037 – 0.227; 8/8 p’s &gt; 0.1). Moreover, the directions of activity in deeper bursts (a-p axis: 68/244deg; m-l axis: 141/320deg) did not differ from the directions observed in shallower bursts (a-p axis: 63/250deg; m-l axis: 143/325deg). This analysis indicates that the propagation direction is not modulated by cortical depth.</p><p>Further, we explicitly investigate the outlined ‘worst-case scenario’. To this end, we repeated our main analysis considering a subset of bursts that yields a uniform distribution across much of the ROI, as suggested by the reviewer. In order to use as many bursts as possible for this analysis, we limited the analysis to the area of the ROI that has a burst probability higher than 0.44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4a</xref>). We then iteratively removed bursts until a uniform distribution of bursts across space was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4b</xref>). Specifically, for each iteration we determined the local maxima of the burst probability map, and removed the burst which spatial centre was closest to the local maxima. Thus, the remaining subset of bursts results in a uniform distribution of burst probability across space. Using only these bursts we generated the polar probability histogram as shown in Figure 4a. We found that the distribution of propagation directions is comparable to the original set of bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4c</xref>). This analysis suggests that potential spatial sampling bias does not bias the propagation analysis.</p><p>Together we believe that even if spatial cancellation occurred the propagation analysis is robust to this. We now include the reasoning and the second control analysis in the manuscript (page 13f and 33f).</p><p>(<sup>2</sup>As a reminder, the spatial centre of bursts was described using principal components (PC).

For example, no meaningful difference was found between bursts traveling along the two different principal modes of propagation, and importantly, no relation with behavior (response time) was found. The same stands for pre vs. post motor bursts, except for the expected finding that post-motor bursts are more frequent and tend to be of greater amplitude (yielding the observation of a so-called β rebound, on average across trials).</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we would like to highlight two important points.</p><p>First, our work constitutes the first non-invasive human confirmation of invasive work in animals (Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2019; Rule et al., 2018; Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Best et al., 2016; Rubino et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2011, 2015) and patients (Takahashi et al., 2011). Thus, these results bridges between recordings limited to the size of multielectrode arrays (roughly 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup>; Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Best et al., 2016; Rubino et al., 2006; Takahashi et al., 2011, 2015) and human EEG recordings spanning across large areas of the cortex and several functionally distinct regions (Alexander et al., 2016; Stolk et al., 2019). The ability to access these neural signatures noninvasively is important for cross-species comparison. This further enables us, to provide an in-depth analysis of the spatiotemporal diversity of human MEG signals and a detailed characterisation of the two propagation directions, which significantly extends previous reports. We note that their functional role remains undetermined also in these animal studies, but being able to identify these signals now in humans can provide a steppingstone for identifying their role.</p><p>Second, and related, the reviewers are correct that we did not observe distinct propagation directions between pre- and post-movement bursts, nor a relationship with reaction time. However, such a null result would be relevant, in our view, towards understanding what the functional relevance of these signals, if any, might be. Recent work in macaques indicates that the spatiotemporal patterns of high-γ activity carry kinematic information about the upcoming movement (Liang et al. 2023). The functional role of β may therefore be more complex and not relate to reaction times or kinematics in a straightforward manner. We believe this is a relevant observation, and in keeping with the continued efforts to identify how sensorimotor β relates to behaviour. It is increasingly clear that spatiotemporal diversity in animal recordings and human E/MEG and intracranial recordings can constitute a substantial proportion of the measured dynamics. As such, our report is relevant in narrowing down what these signals may reflect.</p><p>Together, we think that our work provides new insights into the multidimensional and propagating features of burst activity. This is important for the entire electrophysiology community, as it transforms how we commonly analyse and interpret these important brain signals. We anticipate that our work will guide and inspire future work on the mechanistic underpinnings of these dominant neural signals. We are confident that our article has the scope to reach out to the diverse readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
