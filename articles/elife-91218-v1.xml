In response to stimuli, Naᵥ channels transition from the resting, closed state to an open, conductive state, before rapidly inactivating. Dysregulation of this functional cycle due to mutations causes diseases including epilepsy, pain conditions, and cardiac disorders, making Naᵥ channels a significant pharmacological target. Phosphoinositides are important lipid cofactors for ion channel function. The phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> decreases Naᵥ1.4 activity by increasing the difficulty of channel opening, accelerating fast inactivation and slowing recovery from fast inactivation. Using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds stably to inactivated Naᵥ at a conserved site within the DIV S4–S5 linker, which couples the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) to the pore. As the Naᵥ C-terminal domain is proposed to also bind here during recovery from inactivation, we hypothesize that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> prolongs inactivation by competitively binding to this site. In atomistic simulations, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reduces the mobility of both the DIV S4–S5 linker and the DIII–IV linker, responsible for fast inactivation, slowing the conformational changes required for the channel to recover to the resting state. We further show that in a resting state Naᵥ model, phosphoinositides bind to VSD gating charges, which may anchor them and impede VSD activation. Our results provide a mechanism by which phosphoinositides alter the voltage dependence of activation and the rate of recovery from inactivation, an important step for the development of novel therapies to treat Naᵥ-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>lipid-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010582</institution-id><institution>National Computational Infrastructure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yiechang</given-names></name><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name><name><surname>Champion</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><name><surname>Corry</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015539</institution-id><institution>Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Program Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yiechang</given-names></name><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010582</institution-id><institution>National Computational Infrastructure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI HPC-AI Talent Program Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yiechang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simulations reveal where phosphoinositide lipids bind to voltage-gated sodium channels and how they reduce channel activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium (Naᵥ) channels are critical to the regulation of brain activity, cardiac rhythm, and muscle contraction. Expressed in the membranes of excitable cells, Naᵥ channels respond to membrane depolarization to open a pore that facilitates the selective flow of sodium current into the cell, initiating the action potential. In mammals, the Naᵥ channel family consists of nine subtypes (Naᵥ1.1–1.9), distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu and Catterall, 2003</xref>). The Naᵥ1.4 subtype is predominantly expressed in skeletal myofibers, where it initiates muscle contraction. Genetic mutations in this subtype are associated with various motor dysfunctions, such as both hyperkalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mantegazza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venance et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jurkat-Rott et al., 2000</xref>). Naᵥ1.7 is found in peripheral sensory neurons and is responsible for nociception. Several pain disorders, such as inherited erythromelalgia and small fiber neuropathy arise from gain-of-function Naᵥ1.7 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dib-Hajj et al., 2013</xref>). Both Naᵥ subtypes have been investigated as promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of myopathy and pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dib-Hajj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghovanloo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Structurally, Naᵥ channels consist of four homologous domains (DI–DIV) arranged in a domain-swapped configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Each domain comprises six transmembrane helices (S1–S6). The central pore domain is formed by S5, S6 helices and selectivity filter (SF), while the four peripheral VSDs are formed by S1–S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lera Ruiz and Kraus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). The pore domain also features lateral fenestrations that provide a pathway for the access of small molecules to the pore via the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gamal El-Din et al., 2018</xref>) and have been shown in computational studies to be accessible to lipid tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boiteux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin and Corry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tao and Corry, 2022</xref>). Additionally, the C-terminal domain (CTD) extends from the DIV S6 helix into the cytoplasm, where it is thought to associate with the DIII–IV and DIV S4–S5 linkers in the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clairfeuille et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of Naᵥ and modulation by phosphoinositides.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Naᵥ channel topology featuring transmembrane helices (S1–S6), the selectivity filter (SF), and the DIII–IV linker (containing the IFM motif) located between DIII and DIV.

In the resting state, the pore is closed and VSD S4 helices are in the down, deactivated state. Membrane depolarization triggers the asynchronous transition of VSD I–III S4 helices to the up, activated conformation, causing Naᵥ channels to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2013</xref>). During prolonged depolarization, VSD-IV moves upward, causing the channels to adopt a fast-inactivated state in which a three-residue Ile-Phe-Met (IFM) hydrophobic motif located on the intracellular linker between DIII and DIV (DIII–IV linker) allosterically closes the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). The CTD is proposed to bind at the S4–S5 linker of VSD-IV and sequester the DIII-IV linker during the resting state. During fast inactivation, the CTD dissociates from VSD-IV and releases the DIII–IV linker to allow IFM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clairfeuille et al., 2019</xref>). Upon repolarization, the VSDs deactivate, the IFM motif disassociates, the CTD rebinds to VSD-IV, and the pore returns to the resting state.</p><p>Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are important cellular signaling molecules found on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the mammalian cell membrane. They can exist in seven forms, with phosphorylation possible at one (PIP1), two (PIP2), or all three (PIP3) positions on the inositol ring, at the 3’, 4’, and/or 5’ carbons. PIPs, particularly PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, featuring phosphates at the 4’ and 5’ carbon positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), are known to bind and modulate the activity of numerous ion channel families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hille et al., 2015</xref>). These include voltage-gated ion channels, some of which have been resolved with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). PIP is known to interact with the VSDs of different potassium channels, to stabilize the positive gating charges and support the voltage-sensing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). By also binding at the VSD-pore interface in channels such as Kᵥ7.1, PIP is proposed to facilitate coupling of VSD movement to pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasimova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> also forms specific interactions with VSD-II of Caᵥ2.2 in the down state, making channel activation more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). Although PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is known to bind to numerous voltage-gated ion channels, its effects on channel gating and function are complex and yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Recent experiments show that Naᵥ1.4 channel kinetics and voltage dependence are modulated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gada et al., 2023</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> inhibits Naᵥ1.4 by causing a depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation, accelerating transition to the inactivated state and slowing recovery from inactivation, resulting in reduced peak current and suppression of late current (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While this is likely to occur via a direct interaction with Naᵥ1.4, the structural basis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> modulation remains to be understood.</p><p>Here, we used a combination of coarse-grained and atomistic MD simulations to identify a putative PIP binding site to inactivated Naᵥ1.4 in VSD-IV and the DIII–IV linker. We analyze the atomistic level interactions between the positively charged residues at this site with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4)P, comparing this with structurally resolved PIP binding sites in the related ion channels Caᵥ2.2 and Kᵥ7.1. Consistent with the sequence conservation at the identified site, we find that PIPs also bind to Naᵥ1.7 in coarse-grained simulations, with notable differences dependent on VSD conformation states. This work provides insight into how PIPs can negatively regulate Naᵥ channels, a first step for the potential development of PIP-analogue sodium channel inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate how diverse lipid species interact with Naᵥ1.4, we carried out coarse-grained simulations of Naᵥ1.4 (PDB ID: 6agf, inactivated state) embedded in a complex mammalian membrane for 16 µs in triplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Glycosphingolipid, PIP, and diacylglycerol (DG) were highly enriched around Naᵥ1.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, we observed modest enrichment of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine, and slight depletion of ceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol.

Despite the very low concentration of PIPs (0.5% each of PIP1, PIP2, and PIP3) in the mammalian membrane, they are highly enriched around Naᵥ1.4, particularly near the DIII–IV linker and the VSD-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Contact analysis revealed a putative PIP binding site involving the K1330 residue of the DIII–IV linker and residues R1463, K1466, and R1469 in the DIV S4–S5 linker, which connects the pore and VSD-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Across all three replicates, only residues within this site were occupied by PIPs for more than 80% (quartile 3+1.5×interquartile range) of simulation time on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We note that these residues have higher occupancies for PIP compared to other lipids, including other negatively charged phospholipids (PA, PS, and PI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Simulations in a complex mammalian membrane showed that PIP species bind specifically and selectively to Naᵥ1.4 in the presence of other negatively charged lipids and at low, physiological concentrations. However, the large membrane required, and long PIP binding durations prevented sampling of large numbers of binding and unbinding events. To address this, we carried out additional simulations where Naᵥ1.4 was placed in a smaller POPC membrane with a 5% concentration of each PIP species in the cytoplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Binding of different phosphoinositide (PIP) species in enriched PIP simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enriched PIP simulation system, with Naᵥ1.4 embedded in a POPC membrane (transparent gray) and 5% each of PIP1 (blue), PIP2 (purple), and PIP3 (pink) added to the cytoplasmic leaflet.

That is, PIP1 formed the greatest number of short-term interactions while PIP3 had the fewest. Of the 31 binding events with duration greater than 10 µs, 7 were with PIP1, 15 with PIP2, and 9 with PIP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><p>When we analyzed interactions occurring during 2–80+ µs binding events, we found that the number of interacting basic residues changes depending on the PIP headgroup charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). PIP1 (headgroup charge: –3e) binding is most frequently coordinated by two positive charges in VSD-IV and zero or one residue in the DIII–IV linker. PIP2 (headgroup charge: –5e) binding most frequently involves one or two interactions from the DIII–IV linker and three from VSD-IV for a total of five interactions.

Of these, three are PIP2 binding events which almost span the entire 80 µs of simulation. One 40+ µs binding event each for PIP1 and PIP3 were also observed. The stable PIP1 binding event observed involved interactions with R1460 and R1469 in VSD-IV, as well as fluctuating interactions with the four residues of the DIII–IV linker (K1329, K1330, K1333, K1352). The three long-term PIP2 binding events observed were similar to each other, mainly stabilized by R1460, R1463, and R1469. As with PIP1, the number and identity of interacting DIII–IV linker residues varied across the span of each simulation and between replicates, owing to the flexibility of the linker. Like PIP2, PIP3 binding was characterized by stable interactions with R1460, R1463, and R1469 (VSD-IV) as well as K1329 and K1330 (DIII–IV linker). In silico mutation of the eight residues implicated in PIP binding to leucine (charge neutralization while preserving side chain size) or glutamate (charge reversal) significantly reduced PIP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Coarse-grained simulations enhance sampling by reducing the number of particles, enabling larger time steps and construction of a smoother energy surface. To examine interactions and protein conformational changes in atomistic detail, we backmapped representative snapshots from our PIP-enriched simulations, where we observed stable, long-term binding events between Naᵥ1.4 and PIP1/PIP2. The coarse-grained PIP1 and PIP2 molecules were converted to the atomistic PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, respectively.

In simulations of WT Naᵥ1.4, the IFM has a reduced stability within its binding pocket when PIP is excluded from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To accentuate this effect, we simulated an inactivation-deficient variant of Naᵥ1.4, where the IFM motif is mutated to IQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). We find that the IQM motif has a greater probability of being tightly associated with the receptor pocket in the presence of PIP compared to without it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), supporting our observation that PIP can stabilize the channel in the inactivated state.

CTD binding to DIV S4–S5 and sequestration of the DIII–IV linker is proposed to occur in the resting state. After the pore opens, activation of VSD-IV is thought to cause CTD dissociation, releasing the DIII–IV linker to allow fast inactivation. Residues in ‘switch 1’ of the CTD binding site on the DIV S4–S5 stably bind PIP in our simulations of inactivated Naᵥ1.4 and Naᵥ1.7. We hypothesize that PIP binding at this location makes it more difficult for the CTD to reassociate with VSD-IV, a conformational change which is required during recovery from inactivation.</p><p>More generally, the S4–S5 linkers in all four domains couple the VSD to the pore helices and adopt different orientations depending on VSD activation states. When the VSD is activated (in the open and inactivated states), the S4–S5 linkers lie parallel to the membrane. In the resting state, when the voltage sensor is deactivated, the S4–S5 linkers move downward below the plane of the membrane. We propose that PIP binding at the identified site could additionally stabilize both the DIV S4–S5 linker and DIII–IV linker to favor the inactivated state. Although the recovery from fast inactivation occurs on the order of several milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1977</xref>), and is beyond atomistic simulation timescales, we observed statistically significant reductions in the RMSF of several DIII–IV linker and DIV S4–S5 linker residues when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was bound in 1.5 µs atomistic simulations. Reduction in the mobility of the DIII–IV linker may slow the dissociation of the upstream IFM motif and stabilization of the S4–S5 linker prevents the downward movement required for the channel to transition back to the resting state.</p><p>The PIP binding residues identified here are conserved in Naᵥ1.1–1.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggestive of a shared binding site and mechanism for PIP-mediated modulation across subtypes. Mutations at these conserved residues in other subtypes lead to various gain-of-function diseases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For example, analogous to the Naᵥ1.4 R1469 residue, the R1642C mutation (in Naᵥ1.3) leads to developmental epileptic encephalopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zaman et al., 2018</xref>), and R1644C/H mutations in Naᵥ1.5 (analogous to R1469 in Naᵥ1.4) cause cardiac arrythmias, characterized by accelerated rates of channel recovery from inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frustaci et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with our observations, these diseases with mutations on the DIII–IV linker are likely to reduce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, which could be a contributing factor to instability of inactivated state in these pathogenic variants. These inactivation-deficient variants, as well as the IQM variant that we simulated, further emphasize that interactions between PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with Naᵥ channels could be important for prolonging the fast-inactivated state.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Disease causing point mutations at analogous phosphoinositide (PIP) binding residues in Naᵥ subtypes (described in the UniProt database).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.4 residue #</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Analogous residue #</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Subtype</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Disease information; mechanism</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">K1330</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K1505N</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Long QT3 syndrome; unknown significance</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">R1463</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K1641N</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Benign familial infantile seizure; unknown significance</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">R1469</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R1657C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus; depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation, reduced current, accelerated recovery from slow inactivation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">R1642C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Developmental epileptic encephalopathy; accelerated recovery from inactivation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">R1644C R1644H</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Naᵥ1.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Long QT3 syndrome Brugada syndrome</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The PIP binding site identified here harbors sequence and structural similarity to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding sites found in other cation channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For example, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is resolved at a similar site near the VSD and S4–S5 linker in a recent cryo-EM structure of Kᵥ7.1, where the phosphate headgroup forms analogous contacts to R249 and R243 (PDB ID: 6v01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). Despite differences in the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which negatively regulates Naᵥ1.4 but is required for Kᵥ7.1 pore opening, the binding site appears to be conserved. Based on the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding site, a structurally similar compound was developed as an activator of Kᵥ7 channels and proposed to be a future antiarrhythmic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> also binds to the down, deactivated state of VSD-II in Caᵥ2.2 (PDB ID: 7mix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). In this structure, the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroup interacts with two VSD-II gating charges, R584 and K587. Compared to the positioning of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in our simulations of Naᵥ1.4 with an activated VSD-IV, the headgroup associates further up the S4 helix in Caᵥ2.2 due to the VSD being in a deactivated state. This is also seen in Kᵥ7.1 which contains an extended GGT loop in the S4–S5 linker which prevents PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding in the VSD-down state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandala and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>). In our coarse-grained simulations of the resting Naᵥ1.7 model, we observe a similar state-dependent difference in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interactions with the deactivated states of each VSD. Since activation of VSDs I–III are known to be coupled to channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2013</xref>), we propose that PIP binding at these VSDs impedes their ability to activate and thus increases the voltage threshold required of opening. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding at VSD-IV is prevented by the presence of the CTD (and absence of the DIII–IV linker) in the resting state, thus not affecting the kinetics of inactivation onset.</p><p>The leftward shift in voltage dependence of inactivation is less pronounced when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is converted to PI(4)P rather than completely dephosphorylated to PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gada et al., 2023</xref>). This suggests that PI(4)P may play a compensatory role when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is not present. This is supported by our simulations which show that PI(4)P can also stably occupy the identified binding site, albeit with shorter duration and form less electrostatic interactions compared to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Our atomistic simulations also showed that the 5’-phosphate is more important than the 4’-phosphate for forming interactions with the DIV S4–S5 linker residues of the inactivation switch. These factors suggest that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding is preferred over PI(4)P at this site and can better compete to bind over the CTD, implying that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is more effective at stabilizing the inactivated state and inhibiting recovery to the resting state.</p><p>Simulations using the Martini2.2 forcefield have previously been used to investigate lipid-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>) and successfully predict specific lipid binding sites, including the PIP binding site on K<sub>ir</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stansfeld et al., 2009</xref>). While the Martini2.2 PIP species can be parameterized for a specific sub-species (e.g. PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> vs PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), we instead employed atomistic simulations to complement and strengthen findings from coarse-grained simulations, allowing us to identify the specific contribution of the 4’- and 5’-phosphate groups to binding as well as to investigate the conformational changes associated with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding. Since the precise protonation of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroup in a physiological setting is unclear, we explore one case with the 4’-phosphate protonated. Given that the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroup can adopt slightly different binding orientations and can fluctuate over the course of atomistic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we expect the alternate protonation state to have similar affinity for the binding site.</p><p>In this work we made use of the Martini2.2 model for our coarse-grained simulations, however recently the refined Martini3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Souza et al., 2021</xref>) has become available and will be a useful tool for further interrogating protein-lipid interactions, as a greater number of lipid parameters become available. Our coarse-grained simulations also allow us to investigate the association of other lipid types with Naᵥ1.4. While we focus on PIP here, there are other lipid species that have modulatory effects on Naᵥ channels, such as cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amsalem et al., 2018</xref>), glycolipids, DG, LPC, and PI, and their interactions warrant further investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using multiscale simulations, we show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds stably to inactivated structures of Naᵥ1.4 and Naᵥ1.7 at a conserved site within the DIV S4–S5 linker. As the CTD is proposed to also bind here during recovery from inactivation, we hypothesize that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> competes with the CTD to bind to this site, prolonging inactivation. At this site, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> simultaneously binds to the DIII–IV linker which is responsible for allosterically blocking the pore during fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Its binding reduces the mobility of both the DIV S4–S5 and DIII–IV linkers, potentially slowing the conformational changes required for the channel to recover to the resting state. We also propose that in the resting state, PIPs form additional interactions with S4 gating charges, particularly in VSD-I, anchoring them to the membrane in a way which may make the upward movement required for their activation more difficult. Our results provide insight into how sodium channels are modulated by PIPs, an important step for the development of novel therapies to treat Naᵥ-related diseases.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of phosphoinositide (PIP) effects on the sodium channel functional cycle.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91218-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Coarse-grained simulations</title><p>Coarse-grained simulations of Naᵥ1.4 embedded in a complex mammalian membrane were carried out to investigate lipid-protein interactions.

Recent experimental work by Gada et al. JGP 2023 showed altered Nav1.4 gating when Nav1.4 current was recorded with simultaneous application of PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylate. Here the authors revealed probable molecular mechanism that can explain PI(4,5)P2 modulation of Nav1.4 gating. They found PIP lipids interacting with the gating charges - potentially making it harder to move the voltage sensor domain and altering the channels voltage sensitivity. They also found a stable PIP binding site that reaches the D_IV S4-S5 linker, reducing the mobility of the linker and potentially competing with the C-terminal domain.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Using multiscale simulations with course-grained simulations to capture lipid-protein interactions and the overall protein lipid fingerprint and then all-atom simulations to verify atomistic details for specific lipid-protein interactions is extremely appropriate for the question at hand. Overall, the types of simulation and their length are suitable for the questions the authors pose and a thorough set of analysis was done which illustrates the observed PIP-protein interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the set of current simulations and analysis supports the conclusions drawn nicely, the course-grained simulations have further utility than that utilized by the authors. With the 4to1 heavy atoms bead mapping in Martini 2 some detailed chemical specificity is averaged out but parameters for different PIP family members do exist - including specific PIP(4,5)P2 vs PIP(3,4)P2, and could have been explored at the course-grained level. However, performing more detailed all-atom simulation, as done in this manuscript, is always advisable to extend and/or confirm course-grained results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91218.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yiechang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Australina National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Canberra</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Australian National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Canberra</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Champion</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Australian National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Canberra</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Corry</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Australian National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Canberra</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough reading and helpful comments which has allowed us to further improve the manuscript.

Recent experimental work by Gada et al. JGP 2023 showed altered Nav1.4 gating when Nav1.4 current was recorded with simultaneous application of PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylate. Here the authors revealed probable molecular mechanism that can explain PI(4,5)P2 modulation of Nav1.4 gating. They found PIP lipids interacting with the gating charges - potentially making it harder to move the voltage sensor domain and altering the channels voltage sensitivity. They also found a stable PIP binding site that reaches the D_IV S4-S5 linker, reducing the mobility of the linker and potentially competing with the C-terminal domain.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Using multiscale simulations with course-grained simulations to capture lipid-protein interactions and the overall protein lipid fingerprint and then all-atom simulations to verify atomistic details for specific lipidprotein interactions is extremely appropriate for the question at hand. Overall, the types of simulation and their length are suitable for the questions the authors pose and a thorough set of analysis was done which illustrates the observed PIP-protein interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the set of current simulations and analysis supports the conclusions drawn nicely, there are some limitations imposed by the authors on the course-grained simulations. If those were not imposed, it would have allowed for an even richer set and more thorough exploration of the protein-lipid interactions. The Martini 2 force field indeed cannot change secondary structure but if run with a properly tuned elastic network instead of backbone restraints, the change in protein configuration can be sampled and/or some adaptation of the protein to the specific protein environment can be observed. Additionally, with the 4to1 heavy atoms to a bead mapping some detailed chemical specificity is averaged out but parameters for different PIP family members do exist - including specific PIP(4,5)P2 vs PIP(3,4)P2, and could have been explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their excellent suggestions and have run new simulations with an elastic network instead of backbone restraints which have generated new insights. Indeed, as shown in the new panel Fig 4E, the new data allows us to demonstrate that the presence of PIP in the proposed binding site stabilises binding of the DIII-DIV linker to the inactivation receptor site, strengthening the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that there do exist parameters for different PIP sub-species and have corrected our statement on page 14 line 16 to reflect this. We have not run additional CG simulations with each of these parameters but use the all-atom simulations to examine the interactions of phosphates at specific positions.</p><p>In our atomistic simulations, we backmapped both PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P in the binding site to study their specific interactions. We chose to focus on PI(4,5)P2 given its physiological significance. However, we agree that differences in binding with PI(3,4)P2 would be interesting and warrants future investigation. We also note that the newer Martini3 forcefield would be useful in further work to differentiate between PIP subspecies interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detailed Comments</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough reading and helpful comments which has allowed us to further strengthen the manuscript.

Glycolipids accumulate around Nav1.4 in our complex membrane simulations, however, given reports that carbohydrates tend to interact too strongly in the Martini2.2 forcefield (Grünewald et al. 2022, Schmalhorst et al. 2017) and there are no specific residues on Nav1.4 that interact preferentially with glycolipid species, we chose not to focus on this.

This is likely due to PIP’s ability to accumulate together and the high density of positively charged residues in the region, attracting and supporting multiple PIP bindings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>•What charges were used for the atomistic PIP lipids?

The authors hypothesized that PI(4,5)P2 prolongs inactivation by binding to the same site where the C-terminal tail is proposed to bind during recovery from inactivation. They convincingly showed that PI(4,5)P2 reduces the mobility of both the DIV S4-S5 linker and the DIII-IV linker, thus slowing the conformational changes required for the channel to recover to the resting state. They also conducted MD simulations to show that phosphoinositides bind to VSD gating charges in the resting state of Nav channels. These interactions may anchor VDS at the resting state and impede its activation. Their results provide a mechanism by which phosphoinositides alter the voltage dependence of activation and the recovery rate from inactivation, an important step for developing novel therapies to treat Nav-related diseases. However, the study is incomplete lacks the expected confirmatory studies which are relevant to such proposals.</p><p>The authors identified a novel binding between phosphoinositides and the VSD of Nav and showed that the strength of this interaction is state-dependent. Based on their work, the affinity of PIPs to the inactivated state is higher than the resting state. This work will help pave the way for designing novel therapeutics that may help relieve pain or treat diseases like arrhythmia, which may result from a leftward shift of the channel's activation.

We have ensured that this charge information is stated clearly in the revised manuscript in the methods section on page 16 (line 21). We considered looking at SAPI25, however we expected that it would behave quite similarly, given that the PIP headgroup can adopt slightly different poses and orientations within the binding site across replicates and does fluctuate over simulations (Fig S8). We have noted this in the revised discussion on page 14 line 15-17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I was very intrigued and puzzled by the lower binding of PIP3 vs PIP2 in the Martini simulations. Could it be that PIP3 has a harder time fully entering the binding site, or maybe just sampling? i.e. and its lower number of binding events is a sampling issue.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that PIP3 is less able to access the binding site than PIP2, likely because of its larger size. This might also be why we see PIP1 binding at the location via a more buried route (since it has the smallest headgroup size). However, PIP1 does not have enough negative charge to keep it in the binding site. It seems to be a Goldilocks-like situation where PIP2 has the optimal size and charge to allow access and stable binding at the site. We also see that when PIP3 enters the binding site it leaves before the end of the simulations. While it is hard to prove statistical significance given the number of binding and dissociation events even with the high and equal concentrations of all three PIP species in the enriched PIP membrane CG simulations, the data strongly suggests preferential binding of PIP2 over PIP3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the same L196 sentence as above &quot;However, this loss of resolution prevents distinction between phosphate positions on the inositol group and does not permit analysis of protein conformational changes induced by PIP binding&quot;. The later part is also wrong, there are no conformational changes due to the restraints on the protein backbone, from methods &quot;backbone beads were weakly restrained to their starting coordinates using a force constant of 10 kJ mol−1nm−2&quot;. Martini in general might have a hard time with some conformational changes and definitely cannot sample changes in secondary structure, but conformational changes can, and have on many occasions, been successfully sampled (even full ion channel opening and closing).</p><p>On a similar note, in L179 you mention &quot;owing to the flexibility of the linker.&quot; Hose does this fit with simulation with position restraints on all backbone atoms?</p></disp-quote><p>We applied fairly weak restraints to the backbone only – therefore we still observe some flexibility in the highly flexible loop portion of the linker, where sidechains are able to flip between membrane-facing and cytosol-facing orientations.</p><p>However, after reading the comments from the reviewer we have run additional simulations with an elastic network rather than backbone restraints on the DIII-DIV linker which have given further insight. As seen in Fig 4E and described in the results paragraph on page 9 line 30-37 of the revised manuscript, we can see that the presence of PIP does stabilise the linker in its receptor site. To accentuate this effect, we also ran simulation of the ‘IQM’ mutant known to have a less stable fast inactivated state due to weaker binding to the receptor. Without backbone restraints we can see partial dissociation of the DIII-DIV linker from the receptor that is partially rescued by the presence of PIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I know the paper focuses on PIPs, also very nicely in Fig.2B and Fig. S1-2 the lipid enrichment is shown for other lipids, but why show all lipid classes except cholesterol?

Since we did not directly observe any PIP2 binding events from the other orientation, we did not run any backmapped atomistic simulations with PIP2 at this position. However, the binding site residues that the PIP1/2 headgroup binds to are the same regardless of which side PIP1/2 approaches from. We would expect that PIP2 bound from the alterative position is also stable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two references I want to put for consideration to the authors, for potential inclusion if the authors find their inclusion would strengthen the manuscript.
