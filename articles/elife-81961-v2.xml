The S2S3 linker of the voltage sensor was reported as a site-mediating redox modulation of the channels. Recent structural insights reveal potential interactions between this linker and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop of the third EF-hand of calmodulin (CaM), which embraces an antiparallel fork formed by the C-terminal helices A and B, constituting the calcium responsive domain (CRD). We found that precluding Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the EF3 hand, but not to EF1, EF2, or EF4 hands, abolishes oxidation-induced enhancement of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 currents. Monitoring FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) between helices A and B using purified CRDs tagged with fluorescent proteins, we observed that S2S3 peptides cause a reversal of the signal in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but have no effect in the absence of this cation or if the peptide is oxidized. The capacity of loading EF3 with Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for this reversal of the FRET signal, whereas the consequences of obliterating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF1, EF2, or EF4 are negligible. Furthermore, we show that EF3 is critical for translating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to reorient the AB fork. Our data are consistent with the proposal that oxidation of cysteine residues in the S2S3 loop relieves K<sub>V</sub>7 channels from a constitutive inhibition imposed by interactions between the EF3 hand of CaM which is crucial for this signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group

In addition, ROS are important mediators of normal cellular functions in multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dantzler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miki and Funato, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wani and Murray, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weidinger and Kozlov, 2015</xref>). ROS generation induces oxidative modifications and augmentation of M-currents in neurons, which provides protective effects on oxidative stress-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bierbower et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vigil et al., 2020</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, the substrate of the K<sub>V</sub>7-mediated M-current, are among the most sensitive proteins that respond to ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sahoo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Superoxide anion radicals (O<sub>2</sub>•−), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), peroxynitrite (ONOO−), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are the main ROS produced in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>). These molecules display different reactivity, concentration and lifetime, and most probably play different roles in signal transduction and oxidative stress. Oxidation of cysteine thiol side chains mediated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the most recognized and studied redox reversible post-translational modification. Because of its relative stability and ability to cross the plasma membrane, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been shown to be important in a variety of neurophysiological processes, including neurotransmission, ion channel function, and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamper and Ooi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamsler and Segal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel and Rice, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Augmentation of the M-current can be induced by an external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration as low as 5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>) or even in the nM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaeva et al., 2022</xref>). The M-current flow through channels formed of neuronal K<sub>V</sub>7 subunits (K<sub>V</sub>7.2-K<sub>V</sub>7.5, encoded by KCNQ2-5 genes). These tetrameric channels open at the subthreshold membrane potentials and dampen cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soldovieri et al., 2011</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7 channels have a core architecture similar to other voltage-dependent potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021b</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2013</xref>): they have six helical transmembrane domains (S1–S6) with the voltage sensor formed by S1–S4, followed by a pore domain (S5–S6), which continues into a cytosolic C-terminal region. The C-terminus of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels contains five helical regions: helices A–D and TW helix between hA and hB. The latter region forms the calcium responsive domain (CRD) with helices AB adopting an antiparallel fork disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sachyani et al., 2014</xref>). Four C-helices from each subunit come together to form a stem perpendicular to the membrane. This stem continues with an unstructured linker that connects to helix D, which forms a tetrameric coiled-coil structure that confers subunit specificity during subunit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sachyani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>All K<sub>V</sub>7 channels require the association of calmodulin (CaM) to the CRD to be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gamper and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen and Levitan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yus-Najera et al., 2002</xref>). Helices AB are embraced by CaM forming a compact structure just under the membrane that can move as a rigid body, with a region connecting S6 and helix A acting as a hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). CaM is the main adaptor protein that confers Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity to an ample array of eukaryotic proteins and is composed of two highly homologous lobes joined by a flexible linker. In solution, each lobe operates almost independently of the other and contains two similar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sorensen and Shea, 1998</xref>). This distinct signaling mediated by each CaM lobe was revealed early in <italic>Paramecium</italic> when it was discovered that mutations at the N-lobe affected a Ca<sup>2+</sup> operated Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, whereas mutations at the C-lobe affected a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kung et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>A structure of the non-neuronal K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunit trapped in a non-functional conformation with the voltage-sensor disengaged from the pore suggests that the EF3-hand of CaM may interact with the voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) at a site essential for M-current redox modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaeva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). This 3D configuration has been assumed to confer a preferential use of EF3 during signaling on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tobelaim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Yan, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address the role of CaM on redox modulation of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, finding a critical role of EF3-hand. We show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> interrupts crosstalk between the S2S3 linker and the EF3-hand of CaM in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We have monitored the role of each EF-hand in the gating process of the CRD, characterized by the opening of the AB fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardo-Seisdedos et al., 2018</xref>). By studying purified signaling components in a well-controlled in vitro setting, we avoided unwanted off-target effects arising from interactions with other domains of the channel; we then tested our structural findings in cellulo. The prevailing view is that there is a high degree of cooperativity between the pair of EF-hands within each lobe, such that each lobe operates as a unit regarding Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and signaling and that the 3D arrangement is required for EF-hand specific allosteric signaling of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Yan, 2020</xref>). In contrast, we show an additional level of specialization whereby just one EF-hand is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and the direction of gating can change upon interaction between S2S3 loop domain and solvent-exposed EF-hands. Thus, preferential signaling through EF3 is an intrinsic property not derived from the 3D arrangement revealed by the available K<sub>V</sub>7 structures. The emergence of this novel mode of CaM modulation promises generalization to complexes with the EF-hands interacting with solvent-exposed regions of the target proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CaM plays a critical role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated regulation of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels</title><p>We have previously shown that cysteine residues present in the unusual long linker between S2S3 transmembrane segments of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels are critical for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>).

Thus, under these in vitro conditions, CaM remained firmly attached to the AB fork.

EF3 displacements were observed for D94, N98, Y100, I102, and A104, whereas for EF4, changes in the environment of I131 and E139 are beyond the threshold level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition produces a significant perturbation map, which is in line with the differential relative increase in fluorescence caused by the peptide in the D-CaM assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations to investigate the interactions between the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 S2S3 peptide and int- or holo-CaM in complex with the K<sub>V</sub>7.2 CRD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Consistent with the NMR interaction experiment, the contact map obtained from the simulations shows that the peptide interacts mainly with the EF3 loop and the linker connecting CaM lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, there were no contacts in the region connecting EF3 and EF4, suggesting that the CSPs observed are better interpreted as an allosteric effect, rather than a direct contact with the peptide.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Interaction between the K<sub>V</sub>7 S2S3 peptide and CaM in complex with K<sub>V</sub>7.2 CDR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analysis shows that the magnitude of local residue environmental alterations detected by NMR is larger in the C-lobe, both in the presence and in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Notwithstanding, its function is not limited to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, having important functions in protein trafficking to the plasma membrane, protein folding, and other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Villarroel et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the portfolio of CaM capacities is extended by providing evidence of its essential role in transducing redox signaling in conjunction with K<sub>V</sub>7 channels, which exhibit an exquisite sensitivity to oxidation. Current augmentation can be induced by an external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration as low as 5 μM or nM concentrations when using a faradaic device for delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaeva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>), which is within the range of extracellular peroxide release due to dopamine oxidation in rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kulagina and Michael, 2003</xref>). Such high sensitivity places K<sub>V</sub>7 channels among candidate proteins that are first to respond to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and reveals a prominent role of CaM in redox signaling.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated the significance of cysteine residues in neuronal K<sub>V</sub>7 channels located in the unusually long (compared to other voltage-operated K<sup>+</sup> channels) intracellular linker joining transmembrane segments S2 and S3, which are part of the voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that the ability of the EF3-hand of CaM to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential in this redox-signaling pathway. This is inferred, among others, from the observation that the effect of bath application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is lost in cells overexpressing CaM variants with a disabled EF3-hand or treated with the membrane permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM.</p><p>Earlier, we showed that the redox response depends on the presence of cysteine residues at the S2S3 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>); yet, the number of cysteine residues is not the sole factor defining the efficacy of the response. No evidence for redox regulation was observed for WT K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channels (that have only one cysteine residue at the S2S3 loop); and engineered ‘three Cys K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel’ displayed a weak response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. WT K<sub>V</sub>7.4 (three Cys residues in the S2S3) displayed a strong response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, yet a partial response was still observed for engineered ‘one Cys K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, even with only one cysteine present, the S2S3 linker can mediate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of a ‘responsive’ K<sub>V</sub>7 channel (such as K<sub>V</sub>7.4), while there must be other structural constrains that hinder potentiation of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We suggest that a low channel open probability (p<sub>o</sub>) is an additional requirement for redox sensitivity because no evidence for redox regulation has been observed for K<sub>V</sub>7.3 channels, which present a p<sub>o</sub> close to the unity at saturating voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2004</xref>). These channels have a triple Cys residue motive at the S2S3 loop that only differs at one position when compared to redox-sensitive K<sub>V</sub>7.2 channels (an Arg residue in K<sub>V</sub>7.3 versus a Lys residue in K<sub>V</sub>7.2). We suggest that due to very little room for further increase in p<sub>o</sub>, oxidation has negligible consequences on macroscopic K<sub>V</sub>7.3 currents.</p><p>The redox response is characterized by a remarkable increase/recovery in M-current density on a second to minute time scale, and it can be reversed by reducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullaeva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). This could derive from insertion of new channels, engaging silent channels, higher open probability, or a combination of these. Although the insertion/recruitment of new channels cannot be completely discarded, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> causes an increase in single-channel activity in excised patches where the incorporation of new channels cannot take place. The redox impact on K<sub>V</sub>7 channels is accompanied by a left shift in the current-voltage relationship of macroscopic currents, meaning that channel opening becomes easier at lower voltages or that the probability of opening at a given voltage increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). Large leftward shifts in voltage dependency of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels after over-expression of CaM C-lobe mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sihn et al., 2016</xref>) have been reported, suggesting a critical role for EF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). However, this shift has not always been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archer et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we saw relatively small (~10 mV) but consistent leftward shift in voltage dependence of K<sub>V</sub>7.4 co-expressed with all CaM mutants containing the EF3 mutation, suggesting a degree of tonic channel inhibition conferred via EF3.</p><p>Taking into account the images at atomic resolution of CaM interacting with the voltage sensor of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>), it is tempting to propose that through this interaction, CaM is dragging the voltage sensor, making it more difficult to reach the up position that leads to gate opening in response to depolarizations, or CaM is stabilizing the state where the voltage sensor is disengaged from the pore. In other words, we envisage CaM constitutively and dynamically inhibiting channel activation and that the redox action relieves this inhibition by weakening the dynamic CaM-S2S3 interaction in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. This idea fits with the observation that EF3 is not interacting with S2S3 in the available atomic resolution structures trapped in a partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>) and fully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>) open states. To harmonize with other observations, we propose that this inhibition is counterbalanced by CaM-dependent promotion of surface expression when CaM or CaM1234 are over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etxeberria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomis-Perez et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF3 should help releasing the voltage sensor from CaM. In principle, this should lead to current potentiation, but the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on gating may be conditioned by other circumstances, as discussed next.</p><p>To what extend the observations can be extrapolated to the native channel is a concern raised when using peptides. Our MD simulations reveal that the N-terminal helix present in the channel structure of the S2S3 domain disappears when the peptide is in solution. In contrast, the C-terminal helix is remarkably stable. Nevertheless, the map of interactions between EF3 and CaM highlights the loop connecting these two helices, which overlap with the residues found or assumed to make contacts in the K<sub>V</sub>7/CaM complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). However, conclusions derived from the use of isolated peptides may not translate linearly to the whole channel complex. Interestingly, FRET changes in the isolated recombinant CRD caused by S2S3 peptides depend on the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are reversibly sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and primarily governed by EF3. The left-shift observed on the emission spectrum of D-CaM, a property observed only after loading EF-hands with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alaimo et al., 2013</xref>), is consistent with a functional interaction of the peptides with the EF-hands in the loops coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The dose-response relationship with D-CaM and our MD simulations illustrates that the interaction is weaker when the EF3-hand is loaded with this cation. It is very clear that the influence of S2S3 on the relative orientation of helices A and B is only manifested in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is also a necessary condition for functional effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on K<sub>V</sub>7.4 currents. This is remarkable because S2S3 interacts with apo-CaM causing a shift on the peak emission of D-CaM (i.e. presumably, through EF-hands). The lack of any impact on energy transfer on the CRD reveals that the interaction under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions does not result in a conformational change in the AB fork. The additive increase in the magnitude of D-CaM fluorescent emission and left-shift in peak emission is indicative of the concurrent interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the S2S3 loop with EF3, something that becomes apparent when examining the K<sub>V</sub>7.1/CaM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, we find that EF3 is essential within the isolated recombinant CRD to translate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling into conformational changes, which result in an 18° opening of the AB fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardo-Seisdedos et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, signaling through EF3 is a property inherent to the CRD and does not derive from constrains that the geometry of the voltage sensor-pore imposes. We note that the architecture of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels allows exploiting EF3 signaling in a more efficient way. We call attention on the conditional duality of this signaling system. One branch operates on the voltage sensor (S2S3/EF3), and another branch changes the orientation of helix A, likely affecting S6, and therefore, the main gate formed by the S6 bundle crossing. Whereas we propose that the S2S3/EF3 branch inhibits the current by disengaging the voltage sensor, the consequences of the relative movements of helix A are unclear. Helix A and S6 are connected by a conserved flexible linker whose helical character varies upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, causing a variable S6-hA orientation relative to the gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). The conditional S2S3-dependent reorientation of helix A caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is posited to favor or hinder pore opening depending on the initial orientation of the CRD, which, in turn, depends on PIP<sub>2</sub> occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). This complexity of interactions could explain contrasting effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. Whereas in rat superior cervical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selyanko and Brown, 1996</xref>) and CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gamper and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kosenko and Hoshi, 2013</xref>), this cation inhibits M-currents, a clear current potentiation was observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gómez-Posada et al., 2011</xref>). Further experiments are required to clarify this issue. We note that our data are compatible with the proposed role of S2S3 and EF3 loops in Ca<sup>2+</sup> K<sub>V</sub>7.4 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Yan, 2020</xref>) and highlight an intricate conditional network of signaling processes, in which PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, redox regulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomis-Perez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>An unexpected observation was the reversal in FRET index observed at higher S2S3 peptide concentrations only in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although our data suggest that S2S3 interacts with CaM in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, occupation EF3 by this cation is a requirement to signal the reorganization of the CRD and for the functional redox effect on the channel. FRET changes caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> are opposed in the presence of S2S3 peptides. At the molecular level, we do not know what the reversal of the signal implies because any modification in distance or orientation causes FRET alterations. It seems reasonable to propose that, in this scenario, the movement within the AB helices goes in the opposite direction, leading to a tighter packing of the fork, which is consistent with increased FRET signal. Tighter packing is what is observed when comparing the K<sub>V</sub>7.2 fork in absence of S2S3 - with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup>- with the S2S3 loop interacting with EF3, presumably loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Given the structural similarities between the CaM lobes, it is remarkable that both the CSPs maps and the MD contact maps report mainly signals from the C-lobe. In reference to the MD data, it should be borne in mind that the initial condition corresponds to S2S3 interacting with EF3, which introduces a bias in favor of capturing interactions with the C-lobe. Regarding the NMR data, two observations provide clues that help explaining this apparent selectivity. On one hand, the displacements are, in general, of smaller magnitude in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Incidentally, this goes along with the observation that the relative fluorescence signal from D-CaM with S2S3 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is about half of what is observed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is chelated. On the other hand, under basal conditions, the N-lobe sites are already occupied by this cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardo-Seisdedos et al., 2018</xref>), and therefore, the displacements are expected to be smaller to begin with. Nevertheless, even under high Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (i.e. with the four EF-hands occupied), the overall displacements are observed preferentially at the C-lobe, consistent with an intrinsic preference for this lobe. Regarding the displacements observed at the N-lobe, a similar magnitude under the two experimental conditions explored could be expected since Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupies the two sites at the N-lobe in both situations. However, there are some differences, especially at the initial portion of the N-terminus and at the EF2 binding loop. In addition, there is a notable difference between the MD contact map and the NMR CSPs within the residues connecting EF3 and EF4. We speculate that these differences are a consequence of allosteric EF-hand-coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sorensen and Shea, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Based on docking calculations, the functional existence of significant interactions between a target protein and apo-CaM through the EF-hands of the C-lobe was first proposed for the smoothelin-like 1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequently, direct interactions between apo-EF3 and myosin were observed in X-ray structures, and this interaction was postulated to play an important role in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Münnich et al., 2014</xref>). Recent analysis of surface interaction from cryo-EM structures of ion channels with CaM hints to interactions between EF3 and EF4 with Eag1, TRPV5, and TRPV6 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Núñez et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal bi-directional transduction through direct interaction between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites and CaM target protein could be a widespread mechanism.</p></sec><sec

The CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>) was used to model the protein and ions, and the TIP3P model was chosen for the water. NBFIX corrections for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>). The Particle Mesh Ewald method was used for the treatment of electrostatic interactions, with an upper threshold of 1 Å for grid spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darden and Pedersen, 1993</xref>). Electrostatic and van der Waals forces were calculated in every time step with a 12 Å cut-off distance. A switching distance of 10 Å was chosen to smoothly truncate the non-bonded interactions. Only atoms in a Verlet pair list with a 13.5 Å cut-off distance (reassigned every 20 steps) were considered. The SETTLE algorithm was used to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms to allow the use of a 2 fs time step. The Nose-Hoover-Langevin piston method was employed to control the pressure with a 50 fs period, 25 fs damping constant, and a desired value of 1 atmosphere. The system was coupled to a Langevin thermostat to sustain a temperature of 298°K throughout.</p><p>The VMD software was used for analysis of the trajectories and production of some of the figures. All replicas for each system were merged, and contacts of the Cα of all the residues were computed in the analysis of the contacts between S2S3 and CaM. The contacts were then normalized to the total time and to the value of the residue with maximum contacts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81961-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>S2S3 petides information.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81961-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Details of the molecular dynamics simulations.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81961-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>CM was supported by the Basque Government through a Basque Excellence Research Center (BERC) and JU was partially supported by BERC funds.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Geoffrey S Pitt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model presented in Figure 7 is uninformative in its current form and needs to be redesigned and/or rewritten to more accurately convey information about the authors' findings. It is also important to include the caveat in any proposed model that conclusions are based on the use of isolated peptides in structural biochemical experiments that may not translate linearly to the whole channel complex.</p><p>2) There are apparent discrepancies or discordances in the data that need explanation.</p><p>Reviewer 3: In Figure 1A, endogenous CaM is sufficient to produce a response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on par with CaM WT. However, in B endogenous CaM has a much larger basal current density, nearly identical to that of CaM3, CaM34, and CaM1234. By the proposed mechanism, this enhanced current density would be due to a loss of S2S3/CaM EF3 interaction, yet this would contradict the result in A. How do the authors then explain the loss of current density at baseline through the addition of CaM?</p><p>Reviewers 2 and 3: In Figure 3, the addition of the S2S3 peptide increases and shifts fluorescence, presumably through binding to apoCaM. The addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also increases and shifts fluorescence. These two processes are described as additive. But this doesn't seem to match the overall mechanism where the authors claim Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF3 disrupts the binding between CaM and the S2S3 linker.</p><p>3) The S2S3 and CRDs from different members of the Kv7 family are used interchangeably in the study without appropriate justification. This is problematic because Kv7.1 and Kv7.3, for example, have been shown to be not regulated by oxidation. The rationale for using KCNQ1 S2S3 and the interpretation of results is not justified considering that KCNQ1 S2S3 has fewer Cys residues and was not affected by oxidation. Further, given that the functional data in Figure 1 were obtained for the Kv7.4 channel, it would make the most sense to present experiments using the S2S3 and CRD from Kv7.4 in the main results and move other isoforms to the supplemental data. Some discussion is also warranted as to why some Kv7 family members are not regulated by oxidation if the interactions among S2S3, CaM3, and the CRD are conserved among them all. Moreover, given this circumstance, the final sentence in the abstract – &quot;Our data is consistent with the proposal that oxidation of cysteine residues in the S2S3 loop relieves Kv7 channels from a constitutive inhibition imposed by interactions between the EF3 hand of CaM which is necessary and sufficient for this signaling&quot; – is an overstatement.</p><p>4) Presentation of patch clamp experiments and FRET experiments need to be made clearer. As indicated by reviewer 3, there are aspects of the presentation of these experiments that are either not provided or are poorly described which make it confusing to the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 6, more control experiments are needed: A) different S2S3 concentrations should be used as in Figure 5; B) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and DDT in the absence of S2S3 should be studied.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The one aspect of the paper that could be improved is the Discussion Figure (Figure 7). While the goal is to provide a simplified model, I don't find this figure to really &quot;say&quot; anything. Perhaps it is too simplified. The C-terminus (and the helixA-helixB fork) is missing from the overall channel diagram: providing it in the circle does not offer a clear model of what the authors likely wish to communicate. Further, the experiments (other than the electrophysiology) are focused on isolated peptides of the helixA-helixB fork and the S2-S3 peptide. How this influences the voltage sensor and its connection to the pore is too speculative. At the least, I would recommend a significant re-write/re-design of the model in Figure 7.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The patch clamp experiments are not well explained and seem to have errors in their description. For Figure 1, the authors explicitly state that they are measuring the 'outward steady-state current at -60 mV'. This is confusing as the protocol steps to -60mV from a holding potential of -20 mV, thus the channels will deactivate at -60. More confusing is the fact that the supplementary figures display the same protocol starting at a holding potential of -20mV. This appears to be incorrect based on the exemplars, which actually match the description in the methods which indicates steps from a holding potential of -80 mV. This lack of clear description of the experimental protocols used needs to be addressed.</p><p>2. The authors test the impact of CaM3 and CaM34 on channel function (Figure 1). Yet they do not probe CaM4. Given the nearly identical results for CaM3 and CaM34, it would be worth evaluating CaM4.</p><p>3. Figure 1, why does XE-991 not block the current in all conditions?</p><p>4. The functional data (Figure 1) was obtained for the KV7.4 channel. Subsequent studies utilized KV7.2. It is not clear to me why the authors made this switch as there is no mention of it in the text. This is critical as not all KV7 channels exhibit ROX-mediated regulation, thus it is not clear that the mechanism is entirely conserved across the channel subtypes.</p><p>5. In Figure 1A, endogenous CaM is sufficient to produce a response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on par with CaM WT. However, in B endogenous CaM has a much larger basal current density, nearly identical to that of CaM3, CaM34, and CaM1234. By the proposed mechanism, this enhanced current density would be due to a loss of S2S3/CaM EF3 interaction, yet this would contradict the result in A. How do the authors then explain the loss of current density at baseline through the addition of CaM?</p><p>6. In Figure 3, the addition of the S2S3 peptide increases and shifts fluorescence, presumably through binding to apoCaM. The addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also increases and shifts fluorescence. These two processes are described as additive. But this doesn't seem to match the overall mechanism where the authors claim Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF3 disrupts the binding between CaM and the S2S3 linker.</p><p>7. Please describe the experimental conditions for the FRET experiments in Figures2 and 5. What Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is used in Figure 2? What CaM concentration is used in Figure 5? It would be helpful to have some idea of the molar ratio between CaM and the peptide considering the reduction in FRET that seems to occur at higher concentrations.</p><p>8. In Figure 5, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding still alters FRET in presence of S2S3 with CaM3 – doesn't this by itself show that EF3 is not acting entirely alone making the assertion of necessary and sufficient inaccurate? At most, the authors should say it is an important element, but they have not proven the full statement.</p><p>9. Figure 5 is impossible to interpret as presented. By normalizing the data to zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>, I cannot actually tell what adding the S2S3 peptide did in each case – please put this data on the same scale as Figure 2. Since the data is reported as FRET index, a value which by definition cannot cross zero, the two directions of data are confusing. I'm finding it impossible to correlate the data in Figure 2 with that in Figure 5. In particular, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent reduction in the FRET index as described by the authors for Figure 5 is confusing when looking at Figure 2 – where the FRET index increases in the presence of preserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding of EF3. Either this is a change in the display metric, or there is a discrepancy between the data and the conclusions being drawn.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81961.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model presented in Figure 7 is uninformative in its current form and needs to be redesigned and/or rewritten to more accurately convey information about the authors' findings.

Over-expression of CaM is known to influence trafficking of Kv7 channels, therefore affecting the number of channels at the plasma membrane.</p><p>The data on Figure 1B shows that current density in larger in cells over-expressing CaM variants in which EF3 hand is mutated (CaM3, CaM34, CaM1234) compared to those cells over-expressing variants with the EF3 not mutated (WT, CaM12, -the results with the CaM124 are intermediate-). These results are compatible with WT CaM causing a tonic inhibition of the channel mainly through EF3. Yet, the interpretation requires caution. We have added the following sentence (lines 174-176):</p><p>“Yet, the interpretation of this effect requires caution, since CaM over-expression also affects the number of the channels at the plasma membrane (38, 39).”</p><p>We referred to this issue in the original manuscript (lines 412-414):</p><p>To harmonize with other observations, we propose that this inhibition is counterbalanced by CaM-dependent promotion of surface expression when CaM or CaM1234 are over-expressed (38, 39).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers 2 and 3: In Figure 3, the addition of the S2S3 peptide increases and shifts fluorescence, presumably through binding to apoCaM.

In other words, we propose that binding to S2S3 is less favorable when CaM is interacting with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 shows that a higher S2S3 peptide concentration is required to cause half of the maximal effect on D-CaM fluorescence increase in the presence of saturating free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration compared to the nominal absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>We state that “Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the peptide can interact with CaM SIMULTANEOUSLY” (line 245) which fits nicely with the suggestion that the redox effect requires the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 1). We also stated (lines 303-304) “S2S3 is not canceling the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by competing or displacing this cation from its binding site”. We further suggested (lines 308-310): “Thus, the direction/orientation of the movements in the AB fork when EF3 is loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> is reversed upon interaction with S2S3”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The S2S3 and CRDs from different members of the Kv7 family are used interchangeably in the study without appropriate justification.</p></disp-quote><p>3.1 The results from different S2S3 peptides and from different CRDs are very similar (Figure 3 and Figure 3-suppl 2, Figure 5 and Figure 5-Suppl 1). This is an important finding, and suggests that the underlying mechanism is present in all members of the Kv7 channel family.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is problematic because Kv7.1 and Kv7.3, for example, have been shown to be not regulated by oxidation.</p></disp-quote><p>3.2 We have addressed this issue in the discussion (lines 371-387):</p><p>“Earlier, we showed that the redox response depends on the presence of cysteine residues at the S2S3 loop (10); yet, the number of cysteine residues is not the sole factor defining the efficacy of the response. No evidence for redox regulation was observed for WT K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channels (that have only one cysteine residue at the S2S3 loop); and engineered “three Cys K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel” displayed a weak response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. WT K<sub>V</sub>7.4 (three Cys residues in the S2S3) displayed a strong response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, yet a partial response was still observed for engineered “one Cys K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels” (10). Hence, even with only one cysteine present, the S2S3 linker can mediate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of a ‘responsive’ K<sub>V</sub>7 channel (such as K<sub>V</sub>7.4), while there must be other structural constrains that hinder potentiation of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We suggest that a low channel open probability (p<sub>o</sub>) is an additional requirement for redox sensitivity, because no evidence for redox regulation has been observed for K<sub>V</sub>7.3 channels, which present a p<sub>o</sub> close to the unity at saturating voltages (47). These channels have a triple Cys residue motive at the S2S3 loop that only differs at one position when compared to redox-sensitive K<sub>V</sub>7.2 channels (an Arg residue in K<sub>V</sub>7.3 versus a Lys residue in K<sub>V</sub>7.2).

At the onset of this project only the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 structure was available and only the FRET K<sub>V</sub>7.2/CaM biosensor complex was characterized. This has driven the original strategy. To address this concern we have now replaced the indicated datasets with new data obtained with K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.2 peptides and biosensors. As mentioned above, a partial response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was originally observed for engineered “one Cys K<sub>V</sub>7.4 channels”.

We used two different voltage protocols, one for monitoring of steady-state current activity and another one for studying voltage-dependence. In the first instance, a square voltage pulses from -20 to -60 mV are applied every 2 seconds. Kv7 channels have very negative activation threshold (and they do not inactivate), so even at -60 mV a fraction of channels remains open. Hence, we monitored the residual outward current at -60 mV, as in the cartoon below:</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81961-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The advantage of this method is in that it minimizes contamination of recording with endogenous K<sup>+</sup> channels, as most of the other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels activate at more positive voltages and/or inactivate.On the other hands, the voltage protocol for current-voltage relationships (Suppl.

Given the nearly identical results for CaM3 and CaM34, it would be worth evaluating CaM4.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.2 We actually tested the effects of CaM12, CaM124, CaM3, CaM34 and CaM1234. Given that CaM12 and CaM124 behave similar to WT CaM while CaM3 and CaM34 behave similar to CaM1234 (DN CaM), the conclusion of the negligible contribution of hand 4 seems pretty sound. It is true that other combinations could have been tested as well, but we think that the range of combination that we have tested provides a very conclusive outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 1, why does XE-991 not block the current in all conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>R3.3 XE991 at 10 µM blocked Kv7 currents in all recordings. In some instances the block was somewhat incomplete. It is important to keep in mind that XE991 has an IC<sub>50</sub> for Kv7 channels in the range of 1 µM, hence, at 10 µM some residual current is not unexpected. We generally refrain from using higher concentrations of XE991 to avoid non-specific effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The functional data (Figure 1) was obtained for the KV7.4 channel. Subsequent studies utilized KV7.2. It is not clear to me why the authors made this switch as there is no mention of it in the text. This is critical as not all KV7 channels exhibit ROX-mediated regulation, thus it is not clear that the mechanism is entirely conserved across the channel subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.4 We addressed the issue of differential sensitivity of Kv7 channels to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the sections 3.2 and R1.1 above (and in the discussion, lines 371-387).</p><p>We have performed new experiments with Kv7.2 and Kv7.4 peptides (3 cysteine residues). These new data confirm our conclusions, and are now included in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1A, endogenous CaM is sufficient to produce a response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on par with CaM WT. However, in B endogenous CaM has a much larger basal current density, nearly identical to that of CaM3, CaM34, and CaM1234. By the proposed mechanism, this enhanced current density would be due to a loss of S2S3/CaM EF3 interaction, yet this would contradict the result in A. How do the authors then explain the loss of current density at baseline through the addition of CaM?</p></disp-quote><p>R3.5 We address this question in section 2.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3, the addition of the S2S3 peptide increases and shifts fluorescence, presumably through binding to apoCaM. The addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also increases and shifts fluorescence. These two processes are described as additive. But this doesn't seem to match the overall mechanism where the authors claim Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF3 disrupts the binding between CaM and the S2S3 linker.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.6 We address this question in section 2.3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please describe the experimental conditions for the FRET experiments in Figures2 and 5. What Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is used in Figure 2? What CaM concentration is used in Figure 5? It would be helpful to have some idea of the molar ratio between CaM and the peptide considering the reduction in FRET that seems to occur at higher concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.7 The requested information is included in the Figure legends now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 5, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding still alters FRET in presence of S2S3 with CaM3 – doesn't this by itself show that EF3 is not acting entirely alone making the assertion of necessary and sufficient inaccurate? At most, the authors should say it is an important element, but they have not proven the full statement.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.8 We agree with the referee, and we realize that our statement may be somehow misleading. We acknowledged that EF3 is not acting alone: “Thus, EF3 plays a significant role in transmitting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to the AB fork, and EF4 plays a secondary function” (lines 219-221). To avoid confusions, we have replaced that statement for “critical”, “crucial” or “central”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 5 is impossible to interpret as presented. By normalizing the data to zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>, I cannot actually tell what adding the S2S3 peptide did in each case – please put this data on the same scale as Figure 2. Since the data is reported as FRET index, a value which by definition cannot cross zero, the two directions of data are confusing. I'm finding it impossible to correlate the data in Figure 2 with that in Figure 5. In particular, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent reduction in the FRET index as described by the authors for Figure 5 is confusing when looking at Figure 2 – where the FRET index increases in the presence of preserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding of EF3. Either this is a change in the display metric, or there is a discrepancy between the data and the conclusions being drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>R3.9 We thank the referee for this suggestion. We have plotted the data in a similar fashion than Figure 2. To do so, we have removed the dose-response curves, which are now presented in Supplementary Figure 10.</p></body></sub-article></article>
