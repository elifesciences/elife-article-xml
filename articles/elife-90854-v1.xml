transformation. We have previously identified a specific chemovar of Cannabis that induces apoptosis by preventing Notch1 maturation in leukemia cells. Here, we isolated three cannabinoids from this chemovar that synergistically mimic the effects of the whole extract. Two were previously known, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidivarin (CBDV), whereas the third cannabinoid, which we termed 331-18A, was identified and fully characterized in this study. We demonstrated that these cannabinoids act through cannabinoid receptor type 2 and TRPV1 to activate the integrated stress response pathway by depleting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is followed by increased mRNA and protein expression of ATF4, CHOP, and CHAC1, which is hindered by inhibiting the upstream initiation factor eIF2α. The increased abundance of CHAC1 prevents Notch1 maturation, thereby reducing the levels of the active Notch1 intracellular domain, and consequently decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptosis. Treatment with the three isolated molecules resulted in reduced tumor size and weight in vivo and slowed leukemia progression in mice models. Altogether, this study elucidated the mechanism of action of three distinct cannabinoids in modulating the Notch1 pathway, and constitutes an important step in the establishment of a new therapy for treating <italic>NOTCH1</italic>-mutated diseases and cancers such as T-ALL.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>Notch1</kwd><kwd>T-ALL</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>ISR</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21-112-PG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiri</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012776</institution-id><institution>Gruss-Lipper Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2027093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiri</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004576</institution-id><institution>Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14370001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiri</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cannabinoids cannabidiol, cannabidivarin, and the newly identified 331-18A demonstrate antitumoral effects in Notch1-mutated leukemia, underscoring the potential and complexity of Cannabis as a novel treatment for cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer, characterized by immature T-lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vadillo et al., 2018</xref>). In over 50% of cases, activating mutations in <italic>NOTCH1</italic> were identified, generating much interest in targeting the Notch1 signaling pathway in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sorrentino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrando, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCarter et al., 2018</xref>). The Notch1 protein is a single-pass transmembrane receptor that is expressed on the plasma membrane. It regulates evolutionarily conserved signaling that controls developmental processes, cell fate determination, and tissue homeostasis. It is a member of the Notch receptor family, which consists of four receptors (Notch1-4) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrando, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang-Fang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The Notch1 receptor-signaling pathway is activated through a series of proteolytic cleavages at three different sites (S1–S3). S1 cleavage is carried out by a Furin-like convertase in the trans-Golgi apparatus, resulting in a heterodimeric receptor that is transported to the membrane where it can bind ligands from a neighboring cell. Upon binding of a ligand, cleavage is performed at the next site and the activation of the Notch1 receptor-signaling pathway is initiated, enabling the cleavage of S3 in the transmembrane region that causes the release of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus where it promotes transcription of target genes involved in cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katoh and Katoh, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Aberrant Notch1 activity is associated with many other leukemia types and other cancers, including prostate, lung, ovarian, and renal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinson et al., 2016</xref>). A new and promising emerging field in cancer treatment is medical Cannabis and its unique active compounds, the phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids affect the body by means of the endocannabinoid system (eCBS), a ubiquitous neuromodulatory signaling system that has widespread functions throughout the body. Notable eCBS receptors include cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and CB2, which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), which is an ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Punzo et al., 2018</xref>). The eCBS participates in many physiological activities, including the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laguerre et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Medical Cannabis is already commonly used by cancer patients for its palliative effects, it was shown to stimulate appetite while alleviating symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Guzman, 2015</xref>). However, accumulating evidence demonstrated phytocannabinoids directly affect tumor development in cell lines and animal models by modulating key cell-signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrams, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pagano et al., 2021</xref>). Studies demonstrated that purified phytocannabinoids can inhibit proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis and exert pro-apoptotic effects in a variety of cancer cell types such as lung, breast, prostate, skin, intestine, glioma, lymphoma, pancreas, and uterine cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovalchuk and Kovalchuk, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Reilly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blázquez et al., 2004</xref>). In preclinical models, treatment with phytocannabinoids led to tumor regression of different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McAllister et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinz and Ramer, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Concerning T-ALL, some studies using phytocannabinoids and their respective formulations (such as dronabinol) have shown anti-proliferative as well as pro-apoptotic effects in selected leukemia cell lines and native leukemia blasts cultured ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kampa-Schittenhelm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olivas-Aguirre et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms of phytocannabinoid-mediated antitumor effects are not yet fully understood. Most of the studies that examined the anti-cancer effects of Cannabis have focused mainly on the two major phytocannabinoids (−)-<italic>trans</italic>-Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), but these are just two of more than 140 different phytocannabinoids that have been identified in different Cannabis chemovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanuš et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that different Cannabis extracts with unique phytocannabinoid compositions impaired the survival and proliferation of specific cancer cell lines, suggesting that the effect of a particular Cannabis extract on a specific cancer cell line relies on its chemical composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baram et al., 2019</xref>). Following this framework, we successfully matched a specific CBD-rich Cannabis extract to T-ALL leukemia cells that harbor a <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besser et al., 2023</xref>).

The NMR data of CBD was in close agreement with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchetti et al., 2019</xref>). The spectra of CBD and 331-18A were very similar with the exception of the disappearance of the external double bond (C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>10</sub>) and the appearance of a tertiary alcohol instead. The absolute stereochemistry of 331-18A was confirmed by specific rotation determination with a polarimeter in which 331-18A showed [α]<sup>20</sup><sub>D</sub> −56.85 which is comparable with the [α]<sup>20</sup><sub>D</sub> −64.16 of both the CBD that was isolated from the fraction (C5) and a commercial standard of CBD.

Therefore, as the next step we tested the effect of the three cannabinoids on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We used the Fluo-4 calcium probe to measure the effect of 331-18A, CBDV, and CBD combination on MOLT-4. Each of the molecules separately caused some elevation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but only their combination had an effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the same extent as the whole extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Treatment with the inhibitors by themselves, separately or both together, did not induce MOLT-4 cell death. Upon treatment with the combination of 331-18A, CBDV, and CBD, inhibition of CB2 only partially rescued the cells from treatment-induced apoptosis, reducing the apoptotic rate from 75% of the combination-treated cells to 40%. However, the apoptotic rate was still significantly higher than that of the untreated control. Inhibition of TRPV1 only also partially rescued the cells, to ~50%, but again the apoptotic rate remained significantly increased relative to the untreated control. Inhibition of both CB2 and TRPV1 simultaneously rescued the cells from treatment-induced apoptosis, confirming the effect of the three cannabinoids is mediated through both receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Notch1 downregulation by cannabinoids is mediated through the integrated stress response pathway</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism by which the Notch1 pathway is downregulated following treatment, we used Affymetrix analysis to measure and compare the gene expression profile of MOLT-4 cells after 3 hr of treatment with either vehicle or the whole extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To further verify the role of ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 signaling in mediating the downregulation of the Notch1 pathway, we inhibited the activity of the upstream target eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) in MOLT-4 cells using integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB), which inhibits the activity of eIF2α without affecting its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halliday and Mallucci, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

On top of that, recent studies have demonstrated that phytocannabinoids also possess anti-cancer potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McAllister et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinz and Ramer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo and Marcu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Velasco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guzmán, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we identified three unique phytocannabinoids that together selectively induce apoptosis in Notch1-mutated leukemia cells: CBD, CBDV, and the novel phytocannabinoid 331-18A. CBD and CBDV are well known and commercially available. However, to the best of our knowledge, the third phytocannabinoid 331-18A, denoted in the literature as 6,12-dihydro-6-hydroxy-cannabidiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stoss and Merrath, 1991</xref>), has not been previously identified in natural and/or decarboxylated Cannabis plants. We suggest that the need for all three cannabinoids for the optimal antitumor effect demonstrates the critical importance of elucidating the individual and polypharmacological effects of the entire molecular spectrum of Cannabis.</p><p>Although CBD by itself demonstrated some capacity to induce cell death, it was only when all three cannabinoids were combined that the same extent of response was achieved as treating with the whole extract. The Cannabis plant produces a vast array of over 140 phytocannabinoids and hundreds of other components, but the full extent of their biological effects and interactions is still not completely understood. Nevertheless, mounting evidence suggests that their combined effect as a whole is greater than that of each separate compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Worth, 2019</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasco-Benito et al., 2018</xref>, have shown that a Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC-rich extract was much more potent than pure Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC in producing antitumor responses in both cell culture and animal models of breast cancer. However, they were unable to identify the combinations of compounds that were responsible for this increased potency. In previous publications by our group, we showed that different CBD-rich Cannabis extracts, with equal amounts of CBD but varying concentrations of other minor compounds, led to diverse anticonvulsant effects in a mouse model of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2018</xref>), and selective antitumoral effects in Notch1-mutated in T-ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besser et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting the potential therapeutic effects of other compounds in the extracts in addition to CBD.</p><p>A possible mechanism previously suggested to explain the difference between the effects of purified phytocannabinoids versus full-spectrum extracts is the ‘entourage effect’, where one compound may synergize the activity and efficacy of another on the same target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Worth, 2019</xref>). This ‘entourage effect’ was postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Russo, 2011</xref>, based on a phenomenon observed in the eCBS by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Shabat et al., 1998</xref>. While it is well established for endocannabinoids, only very few studies demonstrated this for phytocannabinoids. We showed here that the presence of small amounts of the minor cannabinoids 331-18A and CBDV enhanced the effect of CBD by itself. Our success in isolating and characterizing a minimal number of cannabinoids that achieve the same antitumor effect as the whole extract is a significant advancement in the field of medical Cannabis and provides solid evidence for the ‘entourage effect’.</p><p>Subsequent reports have expanded the notion of the ‘entourage effect’ to polypharmaceutical and/or polypharmacological effects, where several of the plant metabolites work simultaneously on the same receptors, and/or when the same molecule has several different targets within the same system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mechoulam and Ben-Shabat, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Marzo and Piscitelli, 2015</xref>). CBD has been shown to present complex signaling capabilities of many receptors in the extended eCBS. Specifically, it was shown to have a weak affinity to CB2, and a strong affinity to many of the TRPV family receptors, including TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Petrocellis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that the Notch1-mutated T-ALL cells are affected through the engagement of the eCBS receptor CB2 and the channel TRPV1. More specifically, the known cannabinoids CBD and CBDV affected both, while the novel 331-18A exerted its effect only through CB2. Following the stimulation of the receptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is depleted from the ER and there is an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of eIF2α followed by ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 signaling. Notably, the inhibition of eIF2α upstream to ATF4 rescued T-ALL cells from reduced NICD expression by treatment with 331-18A, CBDV, and CBD combination. The upregulation of CHAC1 inhibits the S1 furin-like cleavage of Notch1 at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2012</xref>), leading to the arrival of immature Notch1 to the plasma membrane as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besser et al., 2023</xref>). This inhibition of the Notch1 pathway ultimately leads to apoptosis in T-ALL cells that rely on mutated Notch1 for propagation (see schematic representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In WT cells, the Notch1 receptor is only activated upon ligand binding. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells that have a Notch1 mutation, the receptor is constitutively active regardless of ligand binding, leading to a positive feedback loop in which the mature receptor is cleaved by a series of sequential cleavage events, causing the release of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus where it promotes transcription of target genes involved in cell growth. The premature Notch1 is cleaved by a furin-like convertase in the trans-Golgi apparatus, resulting in a mature receptor that is transported to the membrane. (<bold>B</bold>) The three phytocannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV), and 331-18A in the whole extract stimulate CB2 and TRPV1 leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ER stress-induced activation of eIF2α followed by ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 signaling. CHAC1 inhibits the furin-like cleavage of Notch1, preventing its maturation and resulting in reduced NICD formation, reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90854-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The potential antitumor effects of cannabinoids through the Notch1 signaling pathway were previously demonstrated in glioma, where THC induced the expression of p8 protein, upstream to ATF3/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carracedo et al., 2006</xref>).

These findings suggest blocking Notch1 maturation through the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 pathway and inhibiting the S1 furin-like cleavage of Notch1 have the potential to affect all types of activation mutations in Notch1, and also all four human homologs of Notch (Notch1-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mungrue et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated the effectiveness of the whole extract and the combination of the cannabinoids in several in vivo models.

As medical Cannabis is already routinely prescribed to cancer patients, tailoring chemovars that contain the appropriate cannabinoids to T-ALL patients can provide them with optimal care that offers anti-cancer properties on top of the palliative ones.

HBSS (Sigma-Aldrich; H8264) was added in a ratio of 1 ml per 100 mg sample. The samples were further homogenized into single-cell suspensions with a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) using a pre-set program for tumor tissues. The single-cell suspensions were stored at –80°C until further extraction. CBD, CBDV, and 331-18A were analyzed using the ESI-LC/MS system by retention time, accurate mass, and spectral matching against our developed ESI-LC/MS/MS library of phytocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2018</xref>). Absolute quantification of the three compounds was performed by the stable isotope dilution method as recently described by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the extraction solution (methanol:acetonitrile:acetic acid in the ratio 50:50:0.1 vol/vol) spiked with 20 ng/mL of CBD-d3 internal standard (Sigma-Aldrich; C-084) was added to the single-cell suspensions in the ratio 3:1 vol/vol, respectively. Samples were thoroughly vortexed and then centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C for protein and cell precipitation. The supernatants were then mixed in a ratio of 1:3 vol/vol sample to 0.1% vol/vol acetic acid in water, and loaded onto Agela Cleanert C8 solid phase extraction cartridges (500 mg of sorbent, 50 μm particle size). Cannabinoids were eluted from the columns using 2 mL of 0.1% vol/vol acetic acid in methanol, evaporated to dryness by SpeedVac, and reconstituted in 100 µL ethanol. Since there was no analytical standard available for 331-18A, this compound was semi-quantified according to the calibration curve of CBD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software version 7.04. Statistical significance was determined by either an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (with unequal variations if an F test ruled out the equal variation assumption) or one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test for multiple groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed with the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test, as appropriate for the dataset.

In that article, the authors showed that Extract #12 reduced NICD expression and viability, which was partially rescued by restoring NICD expression. Here, the authors have identified three compounds of Extract #12 (CBD, 331-18A, and CBDV) that are responsible for the majority of anti-leukemic activity and NICD reduction. Using a pharmacological approach, the authors determined that Extract #12 exerted its anti-leukemic and NICD-reducing affects through the CB2 and TRPV1 receptors. To determine mechanism, the authors performed RNA-seq and observed that Extract #12 induces ER calcium depletion and stress-associated signals -- ATF4, CHOP, and CHAC1. Since CHAC1 was previously shown to be a Notch inhibitor in neural cells, the authors assume that the cannabis compounds repress Notch S1 cleavage through CHAC1 induction. The induction of stress-associated signals, Notch repression, and anti-leukemic effects were reversed by the integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor ISRIB. Interestingly, combining the 3 cannabinoids gave synergistic anti-leukemic effects in vitro and had growth inhibitory effects in vivo.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors show novel mechanistic insights that cannabinoids induce ER calcium release and that the subsequent integrated stress response represses activated NOTCH1 expression and kills T-ALL cells.</p><p>(2) This report adds to the evidence that phytocannabinoids can show a so-called &quot;entourage effect&quot; in which minor cannabinoids enhance the effect of the major cannabinoid CBD.</p><p>(3) This report dissects out the main cannabinoids in the previously described Extract #12 that contribute to T-ALL killing.</p><p>(4) The manuscript is clear and generally well-written.</p><p>(5) The data are mostly high quality and with adequate statistical analyses.</p><p>(6) The data generally support the authors' conclusions. The main exception is the experiments related to Notch.</p><p>(7) The authors' discovery of the role of the integrated stress response might explain previous observations that SERCA inhibitors block Notch S1 cleavage and activation in T-ALL (Roti Cancer Cell 2013). The previous explanation by Roti et al was that calcium depletion causes Notch misfolding, which leads to impaired trafficking and cleavage. Perhaps this explanation is not entirely sufficient?</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Given the authors' previous Cancer Communications paper on the anti-leukemic effects and mechanism of Extract #12, the significance of the original manuscript was reduced. To increase significance, the authors provided a new Fig. S7 in the revision showing that Extract #12 inhibits PDX growth in vivo. This experiment is nicely supportive of the anti-leukemic effects of Extract #12, raising the significance of their previous Cancer Communication paper by using in vivo patient-derived cells. However, this reviewer had suggested testing the combination of 333-18A+CBVD+CBD since the combination is the focus of the current manuscript. For unclear reasons, the combination was not tested.</p><p>(2) It would be important to connect the authors' findings and a wealth of literature on the role of ER calcium/stress on Notch cleavage, folding, trafficking, and activation. The several references suggested by this reviewer were not included in the revised manuscript for unclear reasons. These references are important to show the current status of the field and help readers appreciate what this manuscript brings that is new to T-ALL. In particular, Roti et al (Cancer Cell 2013) showed that SERCA inhibitors like thapsigardin reduce ER calcium levels and block Notch signaling by inhibiting NOTCH1 trafficking and inhibiting Furin-mediated (S1) cleavage of Notch1 in T-ALL. Multiple EGF repeats and all three Lin12/Notch repeats in the extracellular domains of Notch receptors require calcium for proper folding (Aster Biochemistry 1999; Gordon Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; Hambleton Structure 2004; Rand Protein Sci 1997). Thus, Roti et al concluded that ER calcium depletion blocks NOTCH1 S1 cleavage in T-ALL. This effect seems to be conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as Periz and Fortiin (EMBO J, 1999) showed impaired Notch cleavage in Ca2+/ATPase-mutated <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p><p>(3) There is an overreliance of the data on single cell line -- MOLT4. MOLT4 is a good initial choice as it is Notch-mutated, Notch-dependent, and representative of the most common T-ALL subtype -- TAL1. However, there is no confirmatory data in other TAL1-positive T-ALLs or interrogation of other T-ALL subtypes. While this reviewer appreciates that the authors showed that multiple T-ALL cell lines were killed in response to Extract #12 in a previous study, the current manuscript is a separate study that should stand on its own. T-ALLs can be killed by multiple mechanisms. It would be important to show a few pieces of key data illustrating that the mechanism of killing found in MOLT4 applies to other T-ALLs.</p><p>(4) Fig. 6H. The effects of the cannabinoid combination might be statistically significant but seems biologically weak.</p><p>(5) Fig. 3. Based on these data, the authors conclude that the cannabinoid combination induces CHAC1, which represses Notch S1 cleavage in T-ALL cells. The concern is that Notch signaling is highly context dependent. CHAC1 might inhibit Notch in neural cells (Refs. 34-35), but it might not do this in a different context like T-ALL. It would be important to show evidence that CHAC1 represses S1 cleavage in the T-ALL context. More importantly, Fig. 3H clearly shows the cannabinoid combination inducing ATF4 and CHOP protein expression, but the effects on CHAC1 protein do not seem to be satisfactory as a mechanism for Notch inhibition. Perhaps something else is blocking Notch expression?</p><p>In the rebuttal, the two references provided by the authors do not alleviate concern that CHAC1 might not be acting as a Notch cleavage inhibitor in the T-ALL context. The Meng et al paper studied B-ALL not T-ALL and did not evaluate CHAC1 as a possible Notch cleavage inhibitor. Likewise, the Chang et al paper did not evaluate CHAC1 as a possible Notch cleavage inhibitor. Therefore, whether CHAC1 is a Notch cleavage inhibitor in the T-ALL context remains an open question. While the authors are correct that Supplementary Fig. S4G-I show that Extract #12 clearly induces CHAC1 protein expression, Main Fig. 3H shows that the extract combination 333-18A+CBVD+CBD, which is the focus of this manuscript, has unclear effects. If the extract combination has no effect on CHAC1 but has the same effects on Notch1 expression as the full extract, then there is reduced support for the authors' conclusion that the full extract and the 333-18A+CBVD+CBD combination inhibit Notch through CHAC1 induction.</p><p>(6) The authors provide a new figure on page 5 of the rebuttal that was not requested. It is supposed to show that CHAC1 loss protects T-ALL cells from Extract #12-induced cell population decline. Unfortunately, this figure is not conclusive. The empty vector PLKO is not an appropriate negative control. The field uses non-targeting shRNA controls like pLKO-luciferase to control for induction of the RNA interference pathway. Further, the viability data in panel B is normalized such that the effect of shCHAC1 on viability is masked. Showing non-normalized data is important, because if shCHAC1 impairs viability compared to control shRNA, then CHAC1might have effects on non-Notch pathways, which would reinforce the above concern in Point #5 that CHAC1 might not act as a Notch inhibitor in the T-ALL context. Separately, if this experiment had tested whether CHAC1 knockdown increases Notch cleavage and Notch target gene expression like DTX1, HES1 and MYC, then such data would have helped address Point #5.</p><p>(7) Fig. 4B-C/S5D-E. These Western blots of NICD expression are consistent with the cannabinoid combination blocking Furin-mediated NOTCH1 cleavage, which is reversed by ISR inhibition. However, there are many mechanisms that regulate NICD expression. To support their conclusion that the effects are specifically Furin-medated, the authors should probe full length (uncleaved) NOTCH1 in their Western blots. While the authors showed that the full extract (#12) increased uncleaved NOTCH1 expression in their Cancer Communications paper, a major conclusion of the manuscript is that the cannabinoid combination 333-18A+CBVD+CBD reproduces the effect of the full extract (#12). To support this conclusion, the authors should probe key blots for full-length Notch to show that the cannabinoid combination increases uncleaved NOTCH1 just like Extract #12 did in the authors' Cancer Communications paper.</p><p>(8) Fig. S4A-B. While these pharmacologic data are suggestive that Extract #12 reduces NICD expression through the CB2 receptor and TRPV1 channel, the doses used are very high (50uM). To exclude off-target effects, these data should be paired with genetic data to support the authors' conclusions. In the rebuttal, the authors provide dose response cell viability curves of the CB2 and TRPV1 inhibitors. These curves do not exclude the possibility that 50uM has off-target effects. This reviewer notes that Reviewer #1 had similar concerns and that both reviewers requested genetic validation of the pharmacological data. These data were not provided in the revision.</p><p>(9) Since the authors have performed gene expression profiling, an orthogonal test to confirm that Extract #12 acts through the Notch pathway is to perform enrichment analysis using Notch target gene signatures in T-ALL (e.g. Wang PNAS 2013). In contrast to the authors' rebuttal, this reviewer does not see any enrichment analysis (e.g. GSEA plots) performed on the microarray data to show that Extract #12 inhibits the Notch pathway.</p><p>(10) The revised manuscript still retains references that microarray data are &quot;RNA-seq&quot; data, which is inaccurate (see page 10, line 160; Figure 3 legend; page 12, line 169; page 27, line 428; page 36, line 741)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90854.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Besser</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Anat</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Procaccia</surname><given-names>Shiri</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Meiri</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that extends prior work from this group identifying that a chemovar of Cannabis induces apoptosis of T-ALL cells by preventing NOTCH1 cleavage.

In that article, the authors showed that Extract #12 reduced NICD expression and viability, which was partially rescued by restoring NICD expression. Here, the authors have identified three compounds of Extract #12 (CBD, 331-18A, and CBDV) that are responsible for the majority of anti-leukemic activity and NICD reduction. Using a pharmacological approach, the authors determined that Extract #12 exerted its anti-leukemic and NICD-reducing effects through the CB2 and TRPV1 receptors. To determine the mechanism, the authors performed RNA-seq and observed that Extract #12 induces ER calcium depletion and stress-associated signals -- ATF4, CHOP, and CHAC1. Since CHAC1 was previously shown to be a Notch inhibitor in neural cells, the authors assume that the cannabis compounds repress Notch S1 cleavage through CHAC1 induction. The induction of stress-associated signals, Notch repression, and anti-leukemic effects were reversed by the integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor ISRIB.

Following this reviewer’s comment, we added to the discussion a few lines connecting our findings to previous works on ER stress and Notch activation with the appropriate references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There is an overreliance on the data on a single cell line -- MOLT4. MOLT4 is a good initial choice as it is Notch-mutated, Notch-dependent, and representative of the most common T-ALL subtype -- TAL1. However, there is no confirmatory data in other TAL1positive T-ALLs or interrogation of other T-ALL subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, this study followed a previous publication in which 7 different cell lines were assessed (MOLT‐4, CCRF‐CEM, Jurkat, Loucy, HPB-ALL, DND-41and T-ALL1). MOLT-4 cells were used to investigate the mechanism, both MOLT-4 cells and CCRF-CEM cells were utilized to investigate the effect of the cannabinoid combination or the whole extract in-vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig. 6H.

Based on these data, the authors conclude that the cannabinoid combination induces CHAC1, which represses Notch S1 cleavage in T-ALL cells. The concern is that Notch signaling is highly context-dependent. CHAC1 might inhibit Notch in neural cells (Refs. 34-35), but it might not do this in a different context like T-ALL. It would be important to show evidence that CHAC1 represses S1 cleavage in the T-ALL context. More importantly, Fig. 3H clearly shows the cannabinoid combination inducing ATF4 and CHOP protein expression, but the effects on CHAC1 protein do not seem to be satisfactory as a mechanism for Notch inhibition. Perhaps something else is blocking Notch expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. Previous works had shown the upregulation of CHAC1 also in the context of Notch signaling in leukemia, particularly recently also for T-ALL:</p><p>(1) Meng, X., Matlawska-Wasowska, K., Girodon, F., Mazel, T., Willman, C.L., Atlas, S., Chen, I.M., Harvey, R.C., Hunger, S.P., Ness, S.A. and Winter, S.S., 2011.

These Western blots of NICD expression are consistent with the cannabinoid combination blocking Furin-mediated NOTCH1 cleavage, which is reversed by ISR inhibition.

Since cannabinoids seem to kill at least in part through Notch inhibition, the effects would be predicted to be greater in Notch-dependent T-ALL cell lines than Notch-independent cell lines like CCRF-CEM. To show stronger in vivo preclinical efficacy, another suggestion is to combine cannabinoids with tolerable dosing of gammasecretase inhibitors as published by the Michelle Kelliher group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown in our previous publication that both MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cells are dependent on Notch for their propagation, while other cell lines of T-ALL such as Loucy and Jurkat do not. Therefore, we treat CCRF-CEM as Notch-dependent. We discuss the possibility of using the cannabinoid combination with other treatments, specifically chemotherapy, to enhance effectiveness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To increase significance, this reviewer suggests strengthening the mechanism. However, this reviewer understands the challenge of identifying the correct mechanism. Thus, an alternative would be to increase clinical relevance. Some specific suggestions are described below.</p><p>(a) With regard to increasing mechanistic insights, the authors should be aware of some papers that might be helpful. Roti et al (Cancer Cell 2013) showed that SERCA inhibitors like thapsigardin reduce ER calcium levels and block Notch signaling by inhibiting NOTCH1 trafficking and inhibiting Furin-mediated (S1) cleavage of Notch1. Multiple EGF repeats and all three Lin12/Notch repeats in the extracellular domains of Notch receptors require calcium for proper folding (Aster Biochemistry 1999; Gordon Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; Hambleton Structure 2004; Rand Protein Sci 1997). Thus, Roti et al concluded that ER calcium depletion blocks NOTCH1 S1 cleavage. This effect seems to be conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as Periz and Fortiin (EMBO J, 1999) showed impaired Notch cleavage in Ca2+/ATPasemutated <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Besser et al should consider these papers when exploring the mechanism by which the ER calcium release by the cannabinoid combination blocks activated NOTCH1 expression. Similarities and differences should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above and stated also by the reviewer, many papers have shown the cleavage and/or activation of Notch following ER stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) With regard to increasing clinical relevance, the authors should consider testing the effects of the cannabinoid combination on primary samples, PDX models, and/or genetically engineered mouse models. Pan-Notch inhibitors like gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been disappointing in clinical trials because of excessive on-target toxicity, in particular in the intestine. The authors should consider exploring whether the cannabinoids might be superior to GSIs with regard to intestinal toxicity and why that might be (e.g. receptor expression).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and agree that clinical relevance is of outmost importance. As obtaining primary tumor cells from patients is challenging, we assessed the whole cannabis extract in a PDX model. This extract is already being used by patients. We added this result as Supplementary fig. S7, and address it in the main text of the Results and in the Materials and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Since the authors have performed gene expression profiling, another test to confirm that Extract #12 acts through the Notch pathway is to perform enrichment analysis for known Notch target genes in T-ALL (e.g. Wang PNAS 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the analysis and this is how we pinpointed the involvement of ATF4, CHOP and CHAC1 of the integrated stress response pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concern:</p><p>Supplemental Table S4. According to the text (page 10, line 160) and table title, these data are RNA-seq. However, according to the GSE154287 annotation, these data are Affymetrix arrays There are no gene names in the GSE table. Are the IDs probesets rather than genes?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the gene analysis data are Affymetrix arrays and the title was corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
