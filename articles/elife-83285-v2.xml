However, in simple eukaryotes such as the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, RLC phosphorylation appears dispensable for regulating CAR dynamics. We found that redundant phosphorylation at Ser35 of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> RLC homolog Rlc1 by the p21-activated kinases Pak1 and Pak2, modulates myosin II Myo2 activity and becomes essential for cytokinesis and cell growth during respiration. Previously, we showed that the stress-activated protein kinase pathway (SAPK) MAPK Sty1 controls fission yeast CAR integrity by downregulating formin For3 levels (Gómez-Gil et al., 2020). Here, we report that the reduced availability of formin For3-nucleated actin filaments for the CAR is the main reason for the required control of myosin II contractile activity by RLC phosphorylation during respiration-induced oxidative stress. Thus, the restoration of For3 levels by antioxidants overrides the control of myosin II function regulated by RLC phosphorylation, allowing cytokinesis and cell proliferation during respiration. Therefore, fine-tuned interplay between myosin II function through Rlc1 phosphorylation and environmentally controlled actin filament availability is critical for a successful cytokinesis in response to a switch to a respiratory carbohydrate metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>myosin II</kwd><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>p21-activated kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-112569GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cansado</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGC2018-098924-B-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez</surname><given-names>Pilar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Government of Castile and Leon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSI150P20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez</surname><given-names>Pilar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A highly sophisticated and adaptive interplay between modulation of myosin II function by light chain phosphorylation and environmentally controlled formin availability, is critical for a successful cytokinesis during respiratory carbohydrate metabolism in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokinesis enables the physical separation of daughter cells after mitosis has been completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green et al., 2012</xref>).

Phosphorylation of RLC at Ser19 is critical for NMII activation and results in the formation of bipolar filaments with increased actin binding affinity and ATPase motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garrido-Casado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craig et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trybus and Lowey, 1984</xref>). Similar to its deletion or pharmacological inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), NMII is enzymatically inactive in the absence of RLC phosphorylation at Ser19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trybus, 1989</xref>), resulting in defective cytokinesis and an increased multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komatsu et al., 2000</xref>).

The essential formin Cdc12 nucleates and elongates actin filaments at the nodes, whereas Myo2 promotes the fusion of the equatorial nodes to form a mature CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kovar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>). For3, a non-essential diaphanous-like formin that assembles actin cables for cellular transport, also plays an important role in nucleating actin filaments for the CAR during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>). In response to environmental cues and cytoskeletal damage, Sty1, a p38 MAPK ortholog and core effector of the SAPK pathway, blocks cell division by reducing For3 levels and the availability of actin filaments for the CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cdc4 and Rlc1 are the respective fission yeast ELC and RLC shared by Myo2 and Myp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Goff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naqvi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCollum et al., 1995</xref>). Early evidence indicated that the p21/Cdc42-activated kinase (PAK) ortholog Pak1/Shk1/Orb2 phosphorylates Ser35 and Ser36 of Rlc1, which are homologous to RLC Thr18 and Ser19 in NMIIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loo and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>). Phosphorylation of Rlc1 at Ser35 and Ser36 by Pak1 delayed cytokinesis, whereas expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant (<italic>rlc1-S35A S36A</italic>), resulted in premature CAR constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loo and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>). This is consistent with in vitro data showing that Rlc1 phosphorylation reduces the interaction of Myo2 with actin during force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>). This and subsequent work identified Ser35 as the sole target of Pak1 both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>). However, another study described that the average in vitro motility rate of purified Myo2 bound to the Rlc1-<italic>S35A S36A</italic> mutant is reduced by ∼25% compared to that of the myosin bound to wild-type Rlc1, and that phosphorylation at both sites is positive for CAR constriction dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sladewski et al., 2009</xref>). While the essential role of RLC phosphorylation for NMII activity is well established in animal cells, the biological significance of Rlc1 phosphorylation at Ser35 during cytokinesis remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that modulation of Myo2 activity by Rlc1 phosphorylation at Ser35 is essential for fission yeast cytokinesis and proliferation during respiratory growth. This modification is exerted by Pak1 together with Pak2, a second PAK ortholog whose expression increases during respiration. Rlc1 phosphorylation at Ser35 becomes essential due to the reduced availability of For3-nucleated actin filaments caused by SAPK activation during respiration-induced oxidative stress. Thus, formin-dependent actin filament nucleation and myosin II activity are coupled for optimal control of cytokinesis in response to changes in MAPK signaling and carbon source metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylation is essential for <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis and growth during respiration</title><p>To gain further insight into the contribution of RLC phosphorylation to the myosin II-dependent control of cytokinesis in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we expressed a C-terminal GFP-tagged version of Rlc1 under the control of its native promoter in <italic>rlc1∆</italic> cells.

It plays a key positive role as a regulator of myosin II function in cardiac muscle contraction under normal and disease conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). In non-muscle vertebrate cells, RLC phosphorylation at Ser19 is essential for NMII contractile activity during cell migration and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garrido-Casado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komatsu et al., 2000</xref>).

Conversely, in the unicellular amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> RLC phosphorylation at the conserved Ser13 is not essential for myosin II function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostrow et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>The role of RLC phosphorylation on myosin II activity during cytokinesis in the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> has remained elusive. While some studies suggest that lack of Rlc1 phosphorylation at the conserved Ser35 delays CAR constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loo and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>), others indicate the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sladewski et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> uses aerobic fermentation instead of respiration for ATP production when glucose is available, while mitochondrial energy metabolism is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malina et al., 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, all published studies investigating the mechanistic insights of fission yeast cytokinesis have been performed in glucose-fermenting cells. Here, we show that Rlc1 phosphorylation plays a modest role during cytokinesis in the presence of glucose, but becomes essential when <italic>S. pombe</italic> switches to respiratory metabolism. In this metabolic state, lack of Rlc1 phosphorylation at Ser35 results in a significant delay in CAR assembly and constriction, leading to multiseptation and limited growth using the respiratory carbon source glycerol. To allow cytokinesis during respiration, Ser35-phosphorylated Rlc1 targets Myo2, the major myosin II heavy chain involved in fission yeast CAR assembly and constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zambon et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, the cytokinetic defects of cells expressing the hypomorphic allele <italic>myo2-E1,</italic> which exhibits reduced ATPase activity and actin-filament binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), are exacerbated during respiration and resemble those of <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells. Therefore, respiratory carbohydrate metabolism dictates the biological relevance of Rlc1 phosphorylation in modulating Myo2 activity during <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis.</p><p>The p21-activated kinase Pak1 phosphorylates Rlc1 at Ser35 in vivo in a glucose-rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loo and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>). However, evidence from this work supports that Pak2 phosphorylates Rlc1 at this residue together with Pak1 for adequate CAR contractility during respiration. Accordingly, cytokinetic and respiratory growth defects similar to those reported for <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells were observed in the absence of both Pak1 and Pak2 activity. Pak2 expression is induced during respiratory growth by a transcriptional mechanism involving the Ste11 transcription factor. In turn, Ste11 expression is activated by the Rst2 transcription factor, whose activity is repressed by the cAMP-PKA pathway in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunitomo et al., 2000</xref>), making Pak2 available during respiration. In this situation, Pak2 may boost PAK activity by acting on multiple targets, some of them redundantly with Pak1. In addition to Rlc1, phosphoproteomic screens have identified other Pak1 substrates that are functional during cytokinesis and polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magliozzi et al., 2020</xref>). However, since Pak2 only localizes to the CAR during respiratory growth, its functional redundancy with Pak1 might be limited to cytokinesis-associated proteins.</p><p>In animal cells, both de novo actin disposal at the division site and cortical actin transport/flow contribute to CAR assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Wang, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khaliullin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">White and Borisy, 1983</xref>). In fission yeast cells, which lack an actin filament cortex, the CAR is mainly assembled by Myo2 from actin filaments nucleated de novo at the cytokinesis nodes by the essential formin Cdc12, and partly from Cdc12-nucleating actin cables pulled from the non-equatorial zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>). For3, the formin that assembles the actin cables involved in polarized secretion and growth, also contributes to CAR formation in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coffman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>). In turn, the activated SAPK pathway down-regulates CAR assembly and stability in response to stress by reducing For3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madrid et al., 2021</xref>). Like animal cells, fission yeast cells undergo endogenous oxidative stress during respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farrugia and Balzan, 2012</xref>), which leads to Sty1 activation and downregulation of For3 levels and actin filament availability. Hence, in this metabolic context, the regulation of Myo2 function by Rlc1 phosphorylation during cytokinesis becomes critical due to a decrease in For3-nucleated actin filaments. Accordingly, restoring actin filament availability by various strategies, including the expression of a constitutively active For3 version, limiting For3 downregulation in SAPK-less mutants, or attenuating endogenous oxidative stress with antioxidants (GSH), rescued cytokinesis and cell growth during respiration in both <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> and <italic>myo2-E1</italic> mutants. The number of actin filaments at the CAR is reduced by approximately half in <italic>myo2-E1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malla et al., 2022</xref>). Enhanced nucleation of actin filaments by For3 may therefore alleviate their defective actin-binding and motor activity during cytokinesis.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming drives the actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur during cell response to external forces, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shiraishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWane et al., 2021</xref>). However, an open question is how changes in cell metabolism trigger actin cytoskeleton remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWane et al., 2021</xref>). Our observations reveal a sophisticated adaptive interplay between modulation of myosin II function by Rlc1 phosphorylation and environmentally controlled formin availability, which becomes critical for a successful cytokinesis during a respiratory carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide a remarkable example of how carbohydrate metabolism dictates the relative importance of different sources of actin filaments for CAR dynamics during cellular division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Phospho-p38 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 9211, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_331641">AB_331641</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-HA (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 11 583 816 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_514505">AB_514505</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-GFP (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 11 814 460 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_390913">AB_390913</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody (rat monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 12 013 819 001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_390917">AB_390917</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Cdk1/Cdc2 (PSTAIR)(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#: 06–923;

In this way, the conserved G in each motif was replaced by A by using the mutagenic oligonucleotides described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. To generate a strain that produces a Pak2-GFP fusion under the control of Pak1 promoter, the Pak1 5’-UTR sequence was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from the wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> 972h<sup>-</sup> strain, and assembled by Gibson cloning to a PCR-amplified Pak2-GFP fragment and the pJK210 plasmid linearized with <italic>Sma</italic>I.

The next day, cultures were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.01 and incubated to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2. Then, cells were recovered by filtration, washed three times, and shifted to either YES-glucose or YES-glycerol (0.6% yeast extract, 0.08% glucose, 0.86% glycerol, plus supplements), and incubated at 28 °C for 4 or 8 hr before imaging. In experiments performed with the <italic>myo2-E1</italic> mutant, cells harvested from cultures at 28 °C were resuspended in YES-glucose or YES-glycerol, incubated at 30 °C for 2 hr, and then at 28 °C for the remainder of the experiment. In experiments with cells expressing the analog-sensitive Cdc2 (CDK) kinase version <italic>cdc2-asM17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoi et al., 2014</xref>), cells from log-phase liquid cultures in YES-glucose (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5), were treated with 1 µM 3-NM-PP1 (Sigma-Aldrich, 529581) for 3.5 hr, recovered by filtration, washed, and resuspended in YES-glucose medium. In experiments with strains expressing an analog-sensitive Pak1 kinase version <italic>pak1-M460A</italic>, log-phase liquid cultures were split in two and incubated for different times in YES-glucose medium treated with 10 µM 3-BrB-PP1 (Abcam, ab143756), or in medium lacking the analog kinase inhibitor. For nitrogen starvation experiments, strains growing exponentially in Edinburgh Minimal Medium (EMM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>) containing 2% glucose (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5), were recovered by filtration and resuspended in the same medium without ammonium chloride for the indicated times. For the plate assays of growth stress sensitivity, <italic>S. pombe</italic> wild-type and mutant strains were grown in YES-glucose liquid medium to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.2, recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in YES to a density of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml, and appropriate decimal dilutions were spotted on YES-glucose, or YES-glycerol solid plates (2% agar). The plates were incubated for 3  days (YES-glucose) or 5 days (YES-glycerol), at different temperatures (28 °C, 30 °C, 32 °C, and/or 34 °C), depending on the experiment, and then photographed. All the assays were repeated at least three times with similar results. Representative experiments are shown in the corresponding figures. When required, solid and/or liquid media were supplemented with varying amounts of β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich, RPN2106) or reduced glutathione (GSH; Sigma-Aldrich, G6013).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy analysis</title><p>For <italic>time-lapse</italic> imaging of CAR dynamics, 300 µl of cells grown exponentially for 4 hr in YES-glucose or YES-glycerol liquid medium, and prepared as described above, were added to one well of a μ-Slide eight well chamber (Ibidi, 80826) previously coated with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml soybean lectin (Sigma-Aldrich, L2650) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>). GSH was added to the medium as required, to at a final concentration of 0.3 mM. Cells were allowed to sediment in the culture media and adhere to the bottom of the well for 1 min, and images were taken every 2.5 min for 2 hr in YES-glucose cultures or every 5 min for 8 hr in YES-glycerol cultures. Experiments were performed at 28 °C, and single mid-planes were taken from a set of six stacks (0.61 µm each) at the indicated time points. Time-lapse images were acquired using a Leica Stellaris eight confocal microscope with a 63 X/1.40 Plan Apo objective controlled by the LAS X software. The time for node condensation and ring maturation includes the time from SPB separation to the onset of CR constriction. Ring constriction and disassembly time include the time from the first frame of ring constriction to the last frame where the ring is completely constricted and disassembled. The total time for ring assembly and contraction is the sum of these two values. <italic>n</italic> is the total number of cells scored from at least three independent experiments. Ring constriction rates were measured manually as the average circumference ± SD of wild-type and mutant Rlc1-GFP versions at contractile rings in each time frame starting from the first frame of CAR constriction. n=30 cells were measured for each strain and growth condition. Statistical comparison between the two groups was performed by unpaired Student’s <italic>t-test</italic>.</p><p>For actin staining with Alexa-Fluor phalloidin, 5 ml mid-log cultures were grown in YES-glucose (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5) or YES-glycerol (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2) for 12 hr after the media shift. Cells were fixed by immersion for 1 h in 3.7% formaldehyde in PEM buffer (10 mM EGTA; 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>; 100 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 75 mM sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After three washes with PEM, the cell pellets were resuspended in 20 µl of cold 40% methanol solution, stained with 8 µl of 5 mg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A12379), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark on a rotary platform. Images of stained cells were captured from samples spotted on glass slides using a Leica Stellaris eight confocal microscope with a 100 X/1.40 Plan Apo objective (seven stacks of 0.3 µm each). For actin segmentation analysis, the Ilastik routine using the pixel classification tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>) was trained with two representative images, one of the cells growing in YES-glucose medium and one of the cells growing in YES-glycerol. Training involved drawing cables, patches, and backgrounds in three different colors. Once the program was trained, the remaining images from the different experiments were uploaded to Ilastik to perform the segmentation routine. The resulting images were then exported to ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and the segmented cells at G2 were analyzed using the color histogram tool to obtain the specific areas corresponding to cables and patches. Data from n≥40 cells growing in YES-glycerol were obtained for each cell by dividing the cable area by the patch area, and the ratio was normalized with respect to the average obtained from wild-type cells growing in YES-glucose medium. For For3-GFP quantification, Ilastik was trained by drawing For3-GFP dots, GFP background, and image background in three different colors. The ratio of For3-GFP spots to cytosol was calculated by dividing the area of For3-GFP spots by the area of GFP background of at least n≥40 cells in G2 or late M (dividing cells) and normalized to the average of the glucose ratio.</p><p>For cell wall staining, cells were recovered from 1 ml aliquots by centrifugation, stained with 1 µl of 0.5 mg/ml calcofluor white, and images were acquired from samples spotted on glass slides using a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope with a 63 X/1.40 Plan Apo objective (six stacks of 0.61 µm each). The percentage of septated (one septa), multiseptated (two or more septa), and lysed cells was calculated at the indicated time points for each strain and condition from three independent experiments. n≥100 cells were counted from multiple images taken during each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>To determine the level of Rlc1-GFP fusion and/or its phosphorylation status, 10 ml samples of fission yeast cultures were collected and precipitated with TCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grallert and Hagan, 2017</xref>).

For the detection of Pak1-GFP, Pak2-3GFP, For3-3GFP, and For3(DAD)–2GFP fusions, protein extracts obtained after TCA-precipitation (Pak1-GFP and Pak2-3GFP fusions) or under native conditions (For3-3GFP and For3(DAD)–2GFP fusions) were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Hybond-ECL membranes, and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche) and anti-cdc2 (PSTAIR) as a loading control. In all cases, the immunoreactive bands were revealed using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system. Detection of Sty1 phosphorylation and total protein levels in strains expressing a genomic Sty1-HA fusion was performed exactly as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>.

The bands of interest plus background were drawn as rectangles and a profile plot (peak) was generated for each band. To reduce background noise in the bands, each peak above the baseline was manually closed using the straight-line tool. Measurement of the closed peaks was performed using the wand tool. Relative units (R.U.) of For3 levels were estimated by determining the signal ratio of the corresponding anti-GFP (total For3) blot with respect to the anti-cdc2 blot (internal control) at each time point. Quantification data correspond to experiments performed as biological triplicates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas D Pollard (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The referees have all commented that the paper needs a very thorough rewriting to make every section more succinct and less speculative. Please revise according to all the points raised by the three referees. The revisions will make this a much stronger paper.</p><p>In addition, three experiments are required, listed below.</p><p>The referees' comments are pasted below verbatim. Please use their suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential experimental revisions:</p><p>(1) Use available phosphomimetic Rlc1 alleles (e.g., Sladewski et al., MBoC 2009) to provide orthogonal evidence for the authors' conclusions.</p><p>(2) As far as I could tell, all data concerning the interplay between the two pathways (SAPK-For3 and PAK-Rlc1) are based on the rescue of the latter by expression of For3-DAD. In a simple scheme, this would put SAPK-For3 downstream of PAK-Rlc1; however, normal degradation of For3 in Rlc1-S35A cells (Figure 4A) rejects this model. I believe this point deserves to be emphasized in the manuscript. This leaves two other models: two independent pathways (Figure S6), or PAK1-Rlc1 being activated in response to reduced For3. These can be dissected by testing if For3-DAD expression suppresses Rlc1 phosphorylation.</p><p>(3) I strongly suggest that the effects of ROS and antioxidants in sty1∆ be examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(A) CAR assembly and contraction analysis</p><p>The phenotypic demonstration as &quot;CAR assembly and disassembly&quot; should be changed to &quot;CAR assembly and contraction.&quot; Disassembly may give an impression of corruption in CAR.</p><p>Moreover, these two events should be analyzed individually, the ring assembly time and ring contraction rate.</p><p>Like Figure 1C/G/H and Figure 5B/C, the authors should break down all the phenotypic analyses of the CAR to the (1) ring assembly time and (2) ring contraction rate, especially in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p>(B) Schematic representation</p><p>The authors showed a model as a supplemental figure.</p><p>Readers should appreciate this to understand better the relationships between SAPK, Git pathway, Ste11/Rst2 pathway, Cdc42 pathway, and Rlc1 phosphorylation.

Remarkably, the increased Sty1 basal activity of wild-type and rlc1- S35A cells growing with glycerol was largely counteracted in the presence of 0.16 mM of reduced glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant tripeptide, and this was accompanied by a recover in total For3 levels (Figure 6A). As expected, segmentation analysis confirmed that the cable-to-patch ratio was significantly improved in glycerol-growing rlc1-S35A and Myo2-E1 cells supplemented with GSH, compared to those growing without the antioxidant (Figure 6B-C). Furthermore, the delayed CAR constriction and disassembly, and the multiseptation of both rlc1-S35A or Myo2-E1 cells during growth with glycerol, were alleviated in the presence of GSH (Figure 6D-G). Most importantly, the simple addition of GSH allowed rlc1-S35A and Myo2-E1 cells to resume growth and proliferate in the presence of glycerol (Figure 6H). This growth-recovery phenotype was For3-dependent since it was not shown by rlc1-S35A for3Δ cells incubated in the presence of the antioxidant (Figure 6H).

This presentation avoids any possible misunderstanding about the putative mechanism by which Rlc1 phosphorylation affects Myo2 actin affinity and adtivity during CAR assembly and contraction, which, as the reviewer notes, is not addressed in this work. Furthermore, in the modified model, both For3 and F-actin appear “blurred” during respiration due to For3 downregulation induced by Sty1 MAPK activation. This suggests that, under these specific conditions, the limited availability of actin cables imposes a strict control on Myo2 activity by phosphorylated Rlc1, which is required for an optimal modulation of cytokinesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I edited one paragraph starting on line 316 as an example of how the text could be much more concise.

These new experiments include quantifying CAR dynamics and ring constriction rates during growth on glucose (fermentation) and glycerol (respiration). As can be seen in the revised Figure 1C, and confirming previous observations with the <italic>rlc1-S35D S36D</italic> allele by Sladewsky <italic>et al.</italic>, CAR dynamics and ring constriction rates were identical between wild-type and <italic>rlc1-S35D</italic> cells. Similarly, the phosphomimetic <italic>rlc1-S35D</italic> allele did not alter CAR dynamics and constriction rate during glycerol-growth, which were identical to those of wild-type cells (Figures 1D, 1F and 1G).</p><p>We have included explanatory text on this issue in several places within the Results section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Cells expressing a dual phospho-mimicking form of Rlc1 (Rlc1-S35D S36D) exhibit normal CAR dynamics and support cytokinesis like wild-type cells [31]. Similarly, CAR dynamics and ring constriction rates were identical between wild-type and Rlc1(S35D)-GFP cells (Figure 1C).”</p><p>“Strikingly, the unphosphorylated mutants <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> and <italic>rlc1-S35A S36A</italic>, but not <italic>rlc1-S36A</italic> or the phosphomimetic versions <italic>rlc1-S35D</italic> and <italic>rlc1-S35D S36D</italic>, also grew very slowly in this medium (Figure 1D).”</p><p>“Conversely, expression of the phosphomimetic <italic>rlc1-S35D</italic> allele did not alter CAR dynamics and constriction rate when grown with glycerol (Figure 1F-G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As far as I could tell, all data concerning the interplay between the two pathways (SAPK-For3 and PAK-Rlc1) are based on the rescue of the latter by expression of For3-DAD. In a simple scheme, this would put SAPK-For3 downstream of PAK-Rlc1; however, normal degradation of For3 in Rlc1-S35A cells (Figure 4A) rejects this model. I believe this point deserves to be emphasized in the manuscript. This leaves two other models: two independent pathways (Figure S6), or PAK1-Rlc1 being activated in response to reduced For3. These can be dissected by testing if For3-DAD expression suppresses Rlc1 phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have used Phos-tag followed by Western blot analysis to explore whether Rlc1 in vivo phosphorylation at Ser35 is negatively affected by the <italic>for3-DAD</italic> allele. As shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, Rlc1 Ser35 phosphorylation remained unchanged in cells expressing the <italic>for3-DAD</italic> allele compared to those expressing the wild-type allele, either during fermentation or respiration.</p><p>As suggested, we have included a new paragraph in the Results section of the revised manuscript describing the epistatic relationships between the SAPK-For3 and PAK-Rlc1 pathways during respiratory control of fission yeast cytokinesis:</p><p>“SAPK-For3 may act downstream of the PAK-Rlc1 cascade, as the cytokinesis and growth defects of <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> and <italic>pak1-M460G pak2∆</italic> mutants are suppressed by <italic>for3-DAD</italic>. However, normal For3 degradation of For3 during respiration in <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells (Figure 4A) excludes this possibility. Moreover, <italic>for3-DAD</italic> expression did not reduce Rlc1 phosphorylation at Ser35 in the presence of glucose or glycerol (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E), suggesting that Pak1/2-Rlc1 is not activated by changes in For3 levels. Thus, both the SAPK-For3 and PAK-Rlc1 pathways act independently and are critical for the successful completion of cytokinesis during respiration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) As stated in the above section, I strongly suggest that the effects of ROS and antioxidants in sty1∆ be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not analyze CAR dynamics or the effect of antioxidants in a <italic>sty1∆</italic> background, because, unlike mutants lacking the upstream Wis1 (MAPK) or Wak1/Win1 (MAPKKs), <italic>sty1∆</italic> and <italic>atf1∆</italic> mutants (lacking the Sty1 downstream transcription factor Atf1) cannot grow on this carbon source (Reference 45: Zuin A et al. PLoS One. 2008;3(7):e2842). This phenotype is also shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C in the revised manuscript. The respiration-defective phenotype of <italic>sty1∆</italic> cells suggests that Sty1 may acts as a scaffold for recruiting the transcriptional machinery during respiration, independently of its activation status, similar to Hog1, the MAPK ortholog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>In any case, <italic>wis1∆</italic> cells show identical phenotypes to those of the <italic>sty1∆</italic> mutant related to the negative control of For3 function, including the presence of thickened actin cables, increased actin cable-to-patch ratio during growth with glycerol (as shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Most importantly, Wis1 deletion increased the actin cable to patch ratio in <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), suppressed their delayed cytokinesis and reduced constriction rate (Figure 4C-D), multiseptation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), and was able to restore cell growth in glycerol (Figure 4E). All this evidence confirms that the downregulation of For3 during respiration is strictly dependent on Sty1 activation.</p><p>We have included new explanatory text in the Results section of revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“In agreement with previous observations [25], For3 levels increased in glucose-grown wild-type or <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells lacking Sty1 activity by deletion of Wis1, the only MAPKK of the SAPK [44], and also in the presence of glycerol (Figure 4A-B). We could not analyze the cytokinetic and growth defects of <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells during respiration in the absence of Sty1, because, unlike mutants lacking Wis1 or Wak1/Win1 (MAPKKs), <italic>sty1∆</italic> and <italic>atf1∆</italic> cells (lacking the Sty1 downstream transcription factor Atf1) are growth defective on this carbon source (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) [45]. Nevertheless, similar to the <italic>sty1∆</italic> mutant [25], <italic>wis1∆</italic> cells exhibited thickened actin cables and an increased actin cable-to-patch ratio during growth on glycerol (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, Wis1 deletion increased the actin cable- to-patch ratio in <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), suppressed their delayed cytokinesis and reduced constriction rate (Figure 4C-D), multiseptation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), and restored cell growth in glycerol (Figure 4E).”</p><p>In addition, the revised Figure 4A shows a simplified scheme to assist readers unfamiliar with the details of For3 down-regulation by the SAPK pathway. Finally, and as suggested by the reviewer, the revised Figures 6B and 6C now include quantitative data showing that, as expected, CAR dynamics and constriction rates for <italic>wis1∆</italic> cells during respiration were not affected by the presence or absence of antioxidants (GSH). This is described in the Results section to read:</p><p>“Remarkably, 0.16 mM of the antioxidant tripeptide reduced glutathione (GSH) in the growth medium counteracted many effects of oxidative stress in <italic>rlc1-S35A</italic> and <italic>myo2-E1</italic> cells grown in glycerol. Changes included recovery of For3 levels (Figure 6A), the cable-to-patch ratio (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), the timing of CAR assembly/contraction and constriction rate (Figure 6B-C), septation (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B) and growth (Figure 6D). Normal growth depended on For3 (Figure 6D). In contrast, in <italic>wis1∆</italic> cells GSH had no significant effect on the above-mentioned characteristics (Figure 6 B-D). Hence, respiration-induced oxidative stress reduces the nucleation of actin cables by formins and renders the execution of cytokinesis dependent on the phosphorylation of the Myo2 light chain Rlc1.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
