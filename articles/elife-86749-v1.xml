Whether and how microglia surveillance is coupled to brain state switches during natural sleep-wake cycles remains unclear. To address this question, we used miniature two-photon microscopy (mTPM) to acquire time-lapse high-resolution microglia images of the somatosensory cortex, along with EEG/EMG recordings and behavioral video, in freely-behaving mice. We uncovered fast and robust brain state-dependent changes in microglia surveillance, occurring in parallel with sleep dynamics and early-onset phagocytic microglial contraction during sleep deprivation stress. We also detected local norepinephrine fluctuation occurring in a sleep state-dependent manner. We showed that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system, which is crucial to sleep homeostasis, is required for both sleep state-dependent and stress-induced microglial responses and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor signaling plays a significant role in this process. These results provide direct evidence that microglial surveillance is exquisitely tuned to signals and stressors that regulate sleep dynamics and homeostasis so as to adjust its varied roles to complement those of neurons in the brain. In vivo imaging with mTPM in freely behaving animals, as demonstrated here, opens a new avenue for future investigation of microglia dynamics and sleep biology in freely behaving animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia surveillance</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>miniature two-photon microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a highly conserved and essential phenomenon of the brain and serves numerous cognitive as well as metabolic and immunologic functions. Moreover, the sleep-wake transition represents a specific and prominent change in the brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besedovsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). As compared to a wakeful brain, the sleeping brain shows more synchronous neuronal activities, which can be characterized by electroencephalography (EEG). Sleep has two main stages: the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) state, which is thought to promote clearance of metabolic waste partly through increased flow of interstitial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), and the rapid eye movement (REM) state, with EEG patterns similar to wakefulness yet with muscle atonia as well as vivid dreaming in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besedovsky et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, sleep, especially NREM, is directly involved in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fogel and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). However, the underlying biological dynamics and especially the cellular mechanisms of sleep regulation are not entirely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Heller, 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Growing evidence shows that microglia dynamics are coupled to and intertwined with the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deurveilher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hristovska et al., 2022</xref>). Microglia are resident innate immune cells ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system and account for 10–15% of all brain cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). Microglia surveillance refers to dynamic changes in cell morphology that accompany functional remodeling in response to changes in the neural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). It has been shown that microglia ablation disrupts the maintenance of wakefulness and promotes NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corsi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), while enhancing an animal’s fear memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, acute and chronic sleep deprivation (SD) leads to microglia activation amidst a proinflammatory state triggered by elevated circulating levels of cytokines (C-reactive protein, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krueger et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is of critical interest to explore whether microglia surveillance can sense and respond to brain state changes during both natural sleep-wake cycles as well as under SD stress.</p><p>The investigation of microglial surveillance during the sleep-wake cycle demands technologies suitable to track the rapid dynamics of natural microglia behavior in real-time. Though there have been pioneering studies on microglia dynamics in cultured brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honda et al., 2001</xref>), static ex vivo conditions can hardly recapitulate the dynamic microenvironments and neuronal activities in vivo. Based on results obtained from fixed brain slices, it has been shown that chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss causes microglia process changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellesi et al., 2017</xref>), but it is difficult to use this approach to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of microglia accurately and quantitatively. As a major advance, two-photon microscopy has recently been applied to image microglia in head-fixed or anesthetized animals, revealing microglial process motility, chemotaxis and homeostatic translocation, and multifaceted microglia-neuron interactions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eyo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). However, because of mechanical constraints or anesthetics, this technology still precludes experimental paradigms in which the natural sleep-wake cycle is undisturbed. In this regard, the recent advent of mTPM has provided a powerful new tool ideal for fast and high-resolution brain imaging in freely behaving rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zong et al., 2017</xref>). With the aid of mTPM, researchers have mapped the functional network topography of the medial entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Obenhaus et al., 2022</xref>), deciphered the microcircuit dynamics in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during social competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), and unraveled the specific itch signal processing in the primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine whether microglia surveillance undergoes any significant changes during natural sleep-wake cycles, and if so, what is the underlying regulatory mechanism. Using different models of mTPM tailored for high-resolution, multi-plane, or large field-of-view (FOV) imaging, we monitored microglia in the somatosensory cortex of mice during natural sleep-wake cycles or while being subjected to acute SD. We found robust sleep state-dependent and SD-induced changes in microglia surveillance with characteristics differing from those induced by anesthetics. Furthermore, we showed that norepinephrine signals from the axonal projections of the locus coeruleus (LC) underlie the state-dependence of microglia surveillance, and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) signaling plays a significant role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imaging microglia dynamics in freely behaving mice</title><p>To visualize microglial morphology and dynamics during the sleep-wake cycle, microglia were specifically labeled with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed under the control of an endogenous Cx3cr1 promoter (Cx3cr1-GFP).

To provide a volumetric view of the dynamics of microglial morphology, we adapted our latest version of mTPM with an electrical tunable lens (ETL) capable of imaging variable focal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–o</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zong et al., 2021</xref>). Multi-plane reconstruction revealed more extended process lengths and greater branch point numbers as compared to single-plane imaging as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l and n</xref>). The volume of surveillance for individual microglia changed from 1661 ± 264.4 μm<sup>3</sup> in the wake state to 3802 ± 670.5 μm<sup>3</sup> in REM state and 4616 ± 324.6 μm<sup>3</sup> in NREM state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m</xref>). Similar to results obtained with single-plane imaging, the endpoint speed of processes decreased in REM and NREM compared to the wake state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>). While both REM and NREM had the same trends in change as compared to the wake state, significantly greater changes were associated with NREM than REM in terms of cell volume, branch length, branch number, and endpoint speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l–o</xref>). These results demonstrate differential microglial dynamic surveillance as the brain state switches among wakefulness, REM and NREM, and the state-dependent morphological and process-motility changes can be robustly reproduced with either single-plane or volumetric imaging. Intriguingly, microglia can even sense and respond to subtle differences between REM and NREM states. Because more extended microglia are thought to have greater surveillance ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kierdorf and Prinz, 2017</xref>), our results support the notion that microglia during the NREM and REM periods tend to be more active in the opportune clearing of metabolic wastes accumulated during the wake states.</p><p>To this end, it is also instructive to compare and contrast REM/NREM state-dependent characteristics with those induced by anesthesia. In mice under isoflurane (1.2% in air) for 20–30 min, we found that microglial length, area, and number of branching points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) were similarly increased compared with the wake state, as was the case in NREM and REM. However, the endpoint movement of processes exhibited opposite changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), increasing with anesthesia but decreasing in sleep states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and o</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, we induced acute SD in mice by forcing the animals to exercise and interrupting sleep with a rotatory rod, starting at 9:00 AM and lasting for 6 hr (zeitgeber time 2–8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The duration of recovery sleep, especially NREM sleep, increased after SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the wake state, microglia typically exhibited an extended form with ramified, long, thin processes. Overt morphological changes occurred as early as 3 hr after SD, when microglia presented a contracted form bearing short and thick processes. By 6 hr, nearly all microglia cells were converted into a phagocytic form, assuming an amoeboid shape with few processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>). We found that microglial length, area, and number of branching points decreased with the continuous SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–h</xref>). The same changes were observed in 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As the sleep pressure was eased during recovery sleep, morphological changes of microglia were partially reversed over a timescale of several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We, therefore, examined microglia surveillance in β<sub>2</sub>AR KO animals during natural sleep-wake cycles and under SD stress. Similar to LC axon ablation, β<sub>2</sub>AR KO disturbed wake-sleep homeostasis, as manifested by a lengthening of overall sleep duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, the removal of β<sub>2</sub>ARs failed to abolish dynamic changes in microglia when the brain state switched between sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h–n</xref>). Nonetheless, the ability of microglia to subtly distinguish between REM and NREM states was largely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h–n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a partial contribution of β<sub>2</sub>AR signaling to LC-NE modulation of microglia surveillance during sleep-wake cycles. Regarding microglia responses to SD stress, we showed that microglial morphology and motility remained unchanged during the SD protocol in β<sub>2</sub>AR KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), revealing a predominant role for β<sub>2</sub>AR signaling in LC-NE modulation of microglia surveillance under SD stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the development of mTPM imaging and EEG/EMG recording in freely behaving mice, we now provide direct evidence that microglia surveillance in mouse somatosensory cortex is sleep-state dependent during natural sleep-wake cycles and that microglia contract from ramified into phagocytic forms a few hours after the onset of acute SD stress. Combined with pharmacological intervention and the use of NE biosensors and genetically manipulated animals, we showed that the LC-NE pathway mediates these state-dependent changes in microglia surveillance and that β<sub>2</sub>AR signaling is involved in various aspects of the microglial responses, extending recent reports that the same pathway underlies microglia surveillance in the context of neuronal network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>That microglia surveillance is sleep state-dependent substantiates an intimate relationship between rapid, robust state-dependent microglia remodeling and the biology of the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Heller, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that microglia play a central role in the removal of metabolic waste and even cell debris from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huisman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Márquez-Ropero et al., 2020</xref>). Our study shows that microglia in the sleeping brain has a larger area and length, consistent with greater clearance ability in the sleeping state than the waking. Recently, it has been reported that, in head-fixed mice, microglial morphological complexity was decreased in NREM sleep than during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hristovska et al., 2022</xref>). In consideration of the altered durations of both NREM and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hristovska et al., 2022</xref>), the unnatural sleep state would lead to an increase in the microarousal state, and ultimately lead to a change in the structure of the sleep state, which may be the main reason for the difference in microglia behavior from our natural sleep. Furthermore, our results show that microglia surveillance significantly differs between REM and NREM sleep in the somatosensory cortex, likely reflecting metabolic and functional differences between the two states. More specifically, previous reports have proposed differential roles between the NREM and REM sleep for the consolidation of different types of memories. For example, NREM sleep contributes to declarative memories, whereas REM sleep is important for procedural and emotional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besedovsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Memory consolidation is closely related to synaptic plasticity, in which microglia play a very important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corsi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tuan and Lee, 2019</xref>). In this regard, our findings hint at the possibility that not all features of microglia-neuron interactions, including mode of action and localization, are equal in the consolidation of different types of memory.</p><p>It has been shown that a large proportion of Iba1-immunoreactive microglia with larger cell bodies and less ramified processes appear in hippocampal brain slices following 48–72 hr of sleep deprivation and in the frontal cortex after 4.5 days of chronic sleep restriction, whereas acute sleep deprivation for 8 hr had no effect on microglial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellesi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall et al., 2020</xref>). However, these findings have mostly been derived from slice staining. While the present work supports the general conclusion that microglia surveillance is responsive to SD stress, our real-time mTPM imaging in vivo also unmasked a progressive change in microglia surveillance that occurred as early as 3 hr after onset of SD and full conversion of microglia into the phagocytic form after 6 hr SD stress. This apparent disparity between the current and previous reports might reflect the complications arising from ex vivo sample preparation, because microglia surveillance is highly dynamic and sensitive to neural environmental changes, evidenced by its cyclic changes during the sleep-wake switch.</p><p>We have provided two lines of evidence that the LC-NE-β<sub>2</sub>AR axis is involved in microglial surveillance both during the natural sleep-wake cycle and under SD stress. Ablation of LC-NE neuronal projection abolished and knockout of β<sub>2</sub>ARs markedly altered the manifestation of the state-dependence of microglia surveillance, while the latter recapitulated most, but not all, the phenotypes of the former. These findings are well supported by emerging evidence that NE is necessary for microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mori et al., 2002</xref>). First, NE is known to be a key neurotransmitter that regulates sleep dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and the dynamics of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sugama et al., 2019</xref>). Second, it has been shown that β<sub>2</sub>AR expressed at a higher level in microglia than other CNS cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and microglia dynamic surveillance rapidly responds to β<sub>2</sub>AR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gyoneva and Traynelis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the morphology of microglia in the somatosensory cortex is also regulated by neuronal activity, in a microglial β<sub>2</sub>AR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Our results also extend the classic view of NE regulation of sleep and wakefulness by revealing a prominent microglial component in the NE response. It should be noted that the pan-tissue β<sub>2</sub>AR knockout animal model was used in the current study and it warrants future investigation to pinpoint specific roles of microglial β<sub>2</sub>AR in the brain-state dependent microglial responses.</p><p>In addition to NE, other potential modulators also present dynamic during the sleep-wake cycle and may partake in the regulation of microglia dynamic surveillance. It has been reported that LC firing stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rasmussen et al., 1986</xref>), while inhibitory neurons, such as PV neurons and VIP neurons, become relatively active during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brécier et al., 2022</xref>). ATP level in the basal forebrain is shown to be higher in REM sleep than NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, the adenosine level in the somatosensory cortex during REM sleep is higher than in NREM sleep (Response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These considerations may explain the finding that β<sub>2</sub>AR knockout failed to abolish microglial responses to sleep state switch and SD stress altogether. A more complete understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of microglia surveillance will help to delineate more precisely the roles of microglia in physiology and under stress.</p><p>In summary, by real-time in vivo mTPM imaging of microglia surveillance, we uncovered the state-dependence of microglia surveillance during natural sleep-wake cycles and a robust, early-onset response to SD stress. Both types of microglial dynamics are under the regulation of LC-NE with the involvement of β<sub>2</sub>ARs as one of its main effectors. These results highlight that microglia undergo rapid and robust remodeling of both morphology and function to fulfill multimodal roles complementary to those of neurons in the brain. In addition, the methodologies established in the present study may prove to be of broad application for future investigations of microglia dynamics and sleep biology in freely behaving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental protocols were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of PKU-Nanjing Institute of Translational Medicine (Approval ID: IACUC-2021–023).

While numerous studies have suggested that microglia contribute to sleep regulation and are modulated by sleep, there has been little direct evidence that the morphological dynamics of microglia are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle. In this work, Gu et al. applied a recently developed miniature two-photon microscope in conjunction with EEG and EMG recording to monitor microglia surveillance in freely-moving mice over extended period of time. They found that microglia surveillance depends on the brain state in the sleep/wake cycle (wake, non-REM, or REM sleep). Furthermore, they subjected the mouse to acute sleep deprivation, and found that microglia gradually assume an active state in response. Finally, they showed that the state-dependent morphological changes depend on norepinephrine (NE), as chemically ablating noradrenergic inputs from locus coeruleus abolished such changes; this is in agreement with previous publications. The authors also showed that the effect of NE is partially mediated by β2-adrenergic receptors, as shown with β2-adrenergic receptor knock-out mice. Overall, this study is a technical tour de force, and its data add valuable direct evidence to the ongoing investigations of microglial morphological dynamics and its relationship with sleep. Nevertheless, microglial morphodynamics likely reflect the integrated influence of neighboring neuronal activities and neuromodulatory factors; the pan-tissue β2AR knockout mouse model may also broadly affect the animal's physiology and sleep behavior. Therefore, future studies are needed to address the specific role of microglial β2AR on its morphodynamics in sleep.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86749.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The MS describes an approach to monitor microglial structural dynamics and correlate it to ongoing changes in brain state during sleep-wake cycles.

While numerous studies have suggested that microglia contribute to sleep regulation and are modulated by sleep, there has been little direct evidence that the morphological dynamics of microglia are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle. In this work, Gu et al. applied a recently developed miniature two-photon microscope in conjunction with EEG and EMG recording to monitor microglia surveillance in freely-moving mice over extended period of time.

Overall, this study is a technical tour de force, and its data add valuable direct evidence to the ongoing investigations of microglial morphological dynamics and its relationship with sleep. However, there are a number of details that need to be clarified, and some conclusions need to be corroborated by more control experiments or more rigorous statistical analysis. Specifically:</p><p>1. The number of branch points per microglia shown here (e.g., Fig. 2g) is much lower than the values of branch points in the literature, e.g., Liu T et al., Neurobiol. Stress 15: 100342, 2021 (mouse dmPFC, IHC); Liu YU et al., Nat. Neurosci. 22: 1771-81, 2019 (mouse S1, in vivo 2P imaging). The authors need to discuss the possible source of such discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. Two reasons may account for this difference. Firstly, the difference in the definition of branch points in the software. Liu YU et al. used the Sholl analysis of image J software to analyze the number of branch points of microglia. Sholl analysis defines the number of branch points as the number of crossings between branches and concentric circles of increasing radii. We reconstructed microglia morphology using Imaris, a software that defines branching points based on the number of bifurcation points. The number of bifurcations calculated represents the number of microglia branch points. Secondly, this and previous studies found that more branching points present in the state of anesthesia. The morphological characteristics of microglia in head-fixed mice under anesthesia was reported by Liu T et al. and the microglia reconstruction results presented by the authors are indeed more complex than ours.In short, this is an aspect that we have been paying attention to, and the main reasons for this difference may lie in the definition of branch points, analysis methods and related choice of thresholds. True differences in brain states and the heterogeneity of microglia in different brain regions may also contribute to the apparent discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Microglia process end-point speed (Fig. 2h, o): here the authors show that the speed is highest in the wake state and lowest in NREM, which agrees with the measurement on microglia motility during wakefulness vs NREM in a recent publication (Hristovska I et al., Nat. Commun. 13: 6273, 2022). However, Hristovska et al. also reported lower microglia complexity in NREM vs wake state, which seems to be the opposite of the finding in this paper. The authors need to discuss the possible source of such differences.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an important point. Hristovska et al. reported the morphodynamic characteristics of microglia during wakefulness and NREM sleep. It is worth noting that the sleep state of the mice in their experiments was unnatural due to the head fixation and body limitations, the duration of NREM sleep (sleep stability) being quite different from the NREM sleep analyzed under natural sleep. The limitations of this approach are also discussed by Hristovska et al. “Even though sleep episodes were, as anticipated, shorter than those observed in freely moving animals, changes in neuronal activity characteristic of NREM sleep were monitored by EEG recordings, and changes in morphodynamics were observed during single episodes. Several episodes of REM sleep were detected, but they were too short and rare to be analyzed reliably.” The unnatural sleep state would lead to an increase in the microarousal state, and ultimately a change in the structure of the sleep state, which may be the main reason for the difference in microglia behavior from our natural sleep.We have discussed this in the revised manuscript. Please see line 292298.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 3: the authors used single-plane images to analyze the morphological changes over 3 or 6 hours of SD, which raises the concern that the processes imaged at the baseline may drift out of focus, leading to the dramatic reduction in process lengths, surveillance area, and number of branch points. In fact, a previous study (Bellesi M et al., J. Neurosci. 37(21): 5263-73, 2017) shows that after 8 h SD, the number of microglia process endpoints per cell and the summed process length per cell do not change significantly (although there is a trend to decline). The authors may confirm their findings by either 3D imaging in vivo, or 3D imaging in fixed tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Three lines of evidence indicate that microglia morphology changes in Fig 3 are due to SD, rather than variations in the focal plane. First, our single-plane images were quite stable over 3 or 6 hours of SD, though occasional reversible drifts might happen due to sudden motions. Second, per your suggestion, further experiments and analysis of 3D imaging were performed to monitor microglia dynamics during sleep deprivation. The new result is shown in revised Fig. S3 C-D: the length of microglia branches and the number of branching points were significantly reduced after SD, in agreement with the results of single-plane imaging. Furthermore, we detected no significant difference in microglia branching characteristics during 6h sleep deprivation in β<sub>2</sub>AR KO mice (Fig.S4), and this indirectly affirmed that singleplane imaging is stable enough for detecting true changes in branching during SD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4b: the EEG and EMG signals look significantly different from the example given in Fig. 2a. In particular, the EMG signal appears completely flat except for the first segment of wake state; the EEG power spectrum for REM appears dark; and the wake state corresponds to stronger low frequency components (below ~ 4 Hz) compared to NREM, which is the opposite of Fig. 2a. This raises the concern whether the classification of sleep stage is correct here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for insightful comments. We carefully examined the behavioral video of Figure 4b, there were occasionally microarousal events indicated by slow head rotation during NREM sleep, while the companion EMG signals were completely flat, which is atypical during sleep wake cycle. The microarousal events were not excluded from sleep, which makes this set of data unrepresentative and contrary to Fig.4b. In our revised manuscript, we replaced it with more representative data that can clearly and consistently distinguish between different brain states in mice on EMG and EEG. Please see revised Fig.2a, page 34; revised Fig.4b, page 37.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4 NE dynamics.• How long is a single continuous imaging session for NE?• When monitoring microglia surveillance, the authors were able to identify wake or NREM states longer than 15 min, and REM states longer than 5 min. Here the authors selected wake/NREM states longer than 1 min and REM states longer than 30 s. What makes such a big difference in the time duration selected for analysis?• Also, the definition of F0 is a bit unclear. Is the same F0 used throughout the entire imaging session, or is it defined with a moving window?</p></disp-quote><p>A single continuous session of NE imaging usually took about 1 hour. Subsequent analysis was performed on imaging data from each recording that included wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. Because of the different time scales of microglia morphological dynamic (relatively slow) and NE signals (fast), we used different time windows in the previous analysis in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><p>Per your suggestion, we have now set the same time window selection criteria for both microglia morphological and NE dynamic analysis: for wake and NREM sleep durations longer than 1 minute, and REM sleep durations longer than 30 seconds. We updated the Methods and all statistics in related figures, please see line 151-154, 481-485, 490-492; Fig. 2e-g and 2l-n, page 34. F0 definition is now explained in the Methods section. Please see line 521-522.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 5b: how does the microglia morphology in LC axon ablation mice compare with wild type mice under the wake state? The text mentioned &quot;more contracted&quot; morphology but didn't give any quantification. Also, the morphology of microglia in the wake state (Fig. 5b) appears very different from that shown in Fig. S3C1 (baseline). What is the reason?</p></disp-quote><p>The morphology of microglia is indeed heterogeneous and variable, affected by factors including brain state, brain region, microenvironmental changes, along with animal-to-animal difference. We didn’t perform the microglia morphology comparison between the LC axon ablation mice and wild type mice and, in view of this, we removed the description of “more contracted morphology” from the main text. It should also be noted that, as we primarily focused on changes of a microglia in different states over time by selfcomparison, we minimized possible effects of heterogeneity in microglia morphology on our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The relationship between NE level and microglia dynamics. Fig. 4C shows that the extracellular NE level is the highest in the wake state and the lowest in REM. Previous studies (Liu YU et al., Nat. Neurosci. 22(11):1771-1781, 2019; Stowell RD et al., Nat. Neurosci. 22(11): 1782-1792, 2019) suggest that high NE tone corresponds to reduced microglia complexity and surveillance. Hence, it would be expected that microglia process length, branch point number, and area/volume are higher in REM than in NREM. However, Fig. 2l-n show the opposite. How should we understand this ?</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is well-taken. On the one hand, our data clearly showed that NE is critically involved in the brain state-dependent microglia dynamic surveillance, with evidence from the ablation of the LC-NE projection and from the β2AR knockout animal model.</p><p>On the other hand, we also understand that NE is not the sole determinant, so the relationship between the NE level and the complexity and surveillance may not be unique.</p><p>In this regard, other potential modulators also present dynamic during sleepwake cycle and may partake in the regulation of microglia dynamic surveillance. previous studies (Liu YU et al., 2019; Stowell RD et al., 2019) have shown that microglia can be jointly affected by surrounding neuronal activity and NE level during wake. It has been reported that LC firing stops (Aston-Jones et al., 1981; Rasmussen et al., 1986), while inhibitory neurons, such as PV neurons and VIP neurons, become relatively active during REM sleep (Brécier et al., 2022). ATP level in basal forebrain is shown to be higher in REM than NREM (Peng et al., 2023). In addition, our own preliminary result (Author response image 1) also showed a higher adenosine level in REM than NREM in somatosensory cortex. Last but not the least, we found that β2AR knockout failed to abolish microglial responses to sleep state switch and SD stress altogether.</p><p>In brief, microglia are highly sensitive to varied changes in the surrounding environment, and many a modulator may participate in the microglia dynamic during sleep state. This may underlie the microglia complexity difference between REM and NREM. Future investigations are warranted to delineate the signal-integrative role of microglia in physiology and under stress. We have discussed the pertinent points in the revised manuscript.

The binary comparison between brain states is misleading, shouldn't the changes in structural dynamics compared to the baseline of the state onset?

Our results showed that there was no difference in microglial length, area, number of branching points between the two NREM groups (Author response image 4), indicating that the last 30s of each NREM was not affected by its following state and that it’s reasonable to perform binary comparison.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Microglial morphological length, area change, and number of branch points of the last 30s of NREM sleep followed by REM or Wake.</title><p>n = 9 cells from 3 mice for each group.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86749-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Sleep deprivation- again, it is unclear whether these structural changes are reversible. This point is straightforward to address using this methodology by measuring sleep following SD. In addition, the authors chose a method to induce sleep deprivation that is rather harsh. It is unclear if the effect shown is the result of stress or perhaps an excess of motor activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We adopted the method of forced exercise as it has been commonly used for sleep deprivation (Pandi-Perumal et al., 2007; Nollet M et al., 2020), though it does have the potential limitation of excess of motor activity.</p><p>In light of your comments and suggestion, we presented new data demonstrating that sleep duration of the mice, mostly NREM sleep, increased compensatively (ZT9-10) after the 6-hour sleep deprivation (ZT2-8) (revised Fig. S3B). This result shows that sleep deprivation indeed increase sleep pressure in the mice. As the sleep pressure was eased during recovery sleep, morphological changes of microglia were reversed over a timescale of several hours (revised Fig. S3 E-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors perform measurements of norepinephrine with a recently developed GRAB sensor. These experiments are performed to causally link microglia surveillance during sleep to norepinephrine secretion. They perform 2p imaging and collect data points which are single neurons, and it is unclear why the normalization and analysis is performed for bulk fluorescence similar to data obtained with photometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform single-neuron analysis for two reasons. First, our experimental conditions, e.g., the expression of the NE indicator and the control of imaging laser intensity, did not yield sufficient signal-to-noise to clearly discriminate individual neurons with two-photon imaging. Second, NE signal may play a modulatory role, and fluorescence changes appeared to be global, rather than local or cell-specific. Therefore, we analyzed fluorescence changes in different brain states over the whole field-of-view in Fig. 4, rather than at the subregional or single-cell level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The experiments involving b2AR KO mice are difficult to interpret and do not provide substantial mechanistic insight. Since b2AR are expressed throughout numerous cell types in the brain and in the periphery, it is entirely not clear whether the effects on microglia dynamics are direct. The conclusion and the statement regarding the expression of b2AR in microglia is not supported by the references the authors present, which simply demonstrate the existence and function of b2AR in microglia. In addition, these mice show significant changes in sleep pattern and increased REM sleep. This could account for reasons for the changes in microglia structure rather than the interpretation that these are direct effects.</p><p>To summarize, the main conclusions of the paper require further support with analysis of existing data and experimental validation.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have revealed that norepinephrine (NE) has a modulating effect on microglial dynamics through β2AR pathway (Stowell RD et al., 2019; Liu YU et al., 2019). Stowell et al. and Liu et al. use in vivo two-photon imaging to demonstrate that microglia dynamics differ between awake and anesthetized mice and to highlight the roles of NE and β2AR in these states (Gyoneva S et al., 2013; Stowell RD et al., 2019; Liu YU et al., 2019). To evaluate the direct effect of β2AR on microglial dynamics, Stowell et al. administered the β2AR agonist clenbuterol to anesthetized mice and found that this decreased the motility, arbor complexity, and process coverage of microglia in the parenchyma (Stowell RD et al., 2019). Inhibition of β2AR by antagonist ICI-118,551 in awake mice recapitulated the effects of anesthesia by enhancing microglial arborization and surveillance (Stowell RD et al., 2019). In addition, it has been shown microglia expressed higher numbers of β2ARs than any other cells in the brain (Zhang et al., 2014).</p><p>To this end, our current work provided new evidence to support the involvement of the LC-NE-β2AR axis in modulating microglia dynamics both during natural sleep-wake cycle and under SD stress. While we were aware the limitation of using pan-tissue β2AR knockout model that precluded us from pinpointing role of microglial β2AR, it is safe to state that β2-adrenergic receptor signaling plays a significant role in the sleep-state dependent microglia dynamic surveillance, based on the present and previous data.</p><p>We have discussed this in the revised manuscript. Please see line 324-354.
