concentration-dependent manners to instruct cell fate during tissue patterning. The cytoneme morphogen transport model posits that specialized filopodia extend between morphogen-sending and responding cells to ensure that appropriate signaling thresholds are achieved. How morphogens are transported along and deployed from cytonemes, how quickly a cytoneme-delivered, receptor-dependent signal is initiated, and whether these processes are conserved across phyla are not known. Herein, we reveal that the actin motor Myosin 10 promotes vesicular transport of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) morphogen in mouse cell cytonemes, and that SHH morphogen gradient organization is altered in neural tubes of <italic>Myo10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We demonstrate that cytoneme-mediated deposition of SHH onto receiving cells induces a rapid, receptor-dependent signal response that occurs within seconds of ligand delivery. This activity is dependent upon a novel Dispatched (DISP)-BOC/CDON co-receptor complex that functions in ligand-producing cells to promote cytoneme occurrence and facilitate ligand delivery for signal activation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>During development, cells must work together and talk to each other to build the organs and tissues of the growing embryo. To communicate precisely with long-distance targets, cells can project a series of thin finger-like structures known as cytonemes. Cells use these miniature highways to exchange cargo and signals, such as the protein sonic hedgehog (SHH for short). Alterations to the way SHH is exchanged during development predispose to cancer and lead to disorders of the nervous system.</p><p>Yet, the mechanisms by which cytonemes work in mammals remain to be fully elucidated. In particular, it is still unclear how the structures start to form, and how the proteins are loaded and transported from one end to another. A ‘molecular motor’ called myosin 10, which can carry cargo along the internal skeleton of cells, may be involved in these processes.</p><p>To find out, Hall et al. used fluorescent probes to track both myosin 10 and SHH in mouse cells, showing that myosin 10 carries SHH from the core of the signal-producing cell to the tips of cytonemes. There, the protein is passed to the target cell upon contact, triggering a quick response.</p><p>SHH also appeared to be more than just passive cargo, interacting with another group of proteins in the signal-emitting cell before reaching its target. This mechanism then encourages the signalling cells to produce more cytonemes towards their neighbours.</p><p>SHH is crucial during development, but also after birth: in fact, changes to SHH transport in adulthood can also disrupt tissue balance and hinder healing. Understanding how healthy tissues send this signal may reveal why and how disease emerges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cytoneme</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogden</surname><given-names>Stacey K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM134531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheney</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA021765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Camenzind G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012524</institution-id><institution>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogden</surname><given-names>Stacey K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sonic Hedgehog is transported inside cytonemes with co-receptors that promote contact-mediated signal delivery to initiate rapid, receptor-dependent responses in recipient cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hedgehog (HH) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling relay that contributes to embryonic development through influencing cell fate, cell proliferation, cell and tissue polarity, stem cell maintenance, and tissue homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). During development, HH family morphogens, which include HH in flies and Sonic (SHH), Desert (DHH) and Indian (IHH) Hedgehogs in vertebrates, function in concentration-dependent manners to instruct tissue morphogenesis through Patched (PTCH) receptors and Cell Adhesion Molecule-Related/Down-Regulated by Oncogenes (CDON), Brother of CDON (BOC) or Growth Arrest-Specific 1 (GAS1) co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marigo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). Binding of SHH to PTCH receptor complexes allows for activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO), which can signal through both G-protein-dependent and independent effector routes to induce downstream responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arensdorf et al., 2016</xref>). G-protein-dependent noncanonical SMO signals induce transcription-independent responses including cytoskeletal rearrangement for cell migration, lipid metabolic responses, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arensdorf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ho Wei et al., 2018</xref>). The canonical SMO effector route is thought to be largely G-protein-independent, and requires SMO translocation into the primary cilium for activation of GLI transcriptional effectors to induce target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arensdorf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To induce appropriate responses in target cells, HH ligands must deploy from their site of synthesis and transport to short- and long-range target cells. HH family ligands are unique in that they are lipid-modified by a covalently linked cholesterol moiety on their carboxyl termini, and by a long-chain fatty acid such as palmitate on their amino termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Porter et al., 1996</xref>). These modifications result in high affinity of the ligand for producing-cell membranes, necessitating specific deployment and transport mechanisms to assure the formation and fitness of HH morphogen gradients during tissue patterning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2019</xref>). In vertebrates, proteins dedicated to deployment of SHH include the twelve-transmembrane spanning protein Dispatched (DISP) and the secreted glycoprotein SCUBE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). Mechanisms by which DISP and SCUBE2 collaborate to ensure SHH deployment and influence its establishment of its morphogen gradient are not yet clear, but several models have been proposed.</p><p>The cytoneme model posits that long, specialized filopodia extend from producing and receiving cells to facilitate transport and exchange of HHs across developing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>). Cytonemes are thin filopodia, typically smaller than 200 nm in diameter, that can reach up to ~300 μm from the originating cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kornberg, 2014</xref>). Cytonemes functioning during morphogenesis were first recognized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>). Subsequent studies found them to contain signaling molecules including HH, WNT, TGFβ, Notch ligands, and growth factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fairchild and Barna, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kornberg, 2014</xref>). Interrogations of HH-containing cytonemes in fly and chick systems revealed localization of DISP, BOC (BOI in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), CDON (iHOG, <italic>Drosophila</italic>), and PTCH to the cellular structures along with ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodeen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). The cytoneme-specific functionalities of these proteins, and how they facilitate HH ligand movement, have not yet been determined. Although specialized filopodia containing SHH have been observed in vertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>), little is known about their cell biology in mammals. The full cast of proteins dedicated to initiation, growth, and maintenance of cytonemes are not yet known, nor are the mechanisms by which morphogens are loaded into and transported along the cellular structures.</p><p>Herein we interrogate cytoneme-based transport of SHH in mouse cells. By using newly developed imaging protocols and developing a rapid read-out for SHH pathway induction, we reveal that Myosin 10 (MYO10) is required for movement of SHH to cytoneme tips to initiate a signal response in target cells. We find that disruption of MYO10 in vivo leads to neural tube patterning defects consistent with attenuated SHH morphogen gradient function, confirming that cell-based interrogation of cytonemes can predict in vivo relevance. Our studies also reveal that a novel complex between SHH, DISP, and BOC/CDON contributes to SHH cytoneme occurrence and ligand delivery, and that BOC/CDON activity in ligand-producing cells is required for cytoneme-mediated induction of an SHH signal response in target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SHH promotes cytoneme formation</title><p>To interrogate cytoneme-based SHH transport in mammalian systems, NIH3T3 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing SHH plus the membrane marker mCherry-Mem (mCherry fused to the first 20 residues of neuromodulin) were fixed using the MEM-fix technique, and then examined by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodeen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall and Ogden, 2018</xref>).

However, SHH expression raised the cytoneme occurrence rate in both cell types from ~30% to ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and more than doubled the average number of cytonemes per NIH3T3 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To test whether increased cytoneme occurrence rates correlated with SHH expression level, cytonemes were quantified in HEK cells stably transfected with a ponasterone A-inducible SHH expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goetz et al., 2006</xref>). Likely due to a low level of ‘leaky’ SHH expression occurring in the absence of induction, baseline cytoneme occurrence in inducible cells was increased compared to untransfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Addition of increasing concentrations of ponasterone A led to a dose-dependent increase in cytoneme occurrence that correlated with increased SHH protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). These results suggest SHH-producing cells may tune cytoneme occurrence rates proportional to morphogen expression levels.</p><p>To test whether the SHH signal transducing protein SMO contributed to increased cytoneme occurrence rates observed in cultured cells expressing ligand, NIH3T3 cells were treated with the direct SMO agonist SAG and antagonist vismodegib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). SAG failed to significantly alter cytoneme occurrence in the absence or presence of SHH, indicating that direct induction of SMO is not sufficient to induce a cytoneme response. Vismodegib treatment raised baseline cytoneme occurrence and blunted the ability of SHH to increase occurrence rate over the elevated baseline. To clarify whether these changes resulted from loss of SMO induction, cytonemes were quantified in CRISPR generated <italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NIH3T3 cells. <italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed an ~15% increase in occurrence rates in response to SHH expression, indicating that SMO is not required for a cytoneme response. However, the increase in occurrence rate was reduced compared to what was observed in control cells (~28% increase), suggesting active SMO may enhance the ability of SHH to increase cytonemes in cultured cells.</p><p>The ability of SHH to induce cytonemes independent of its canonical signal transducing protein SMO suggests the morphogen may act in a cell autonomous manner to control its own deployment. To determine whether other morphogens or developmental signaling molecules documented to localize to cytonemes might also be able to influence cytonemes, we quantified occurrence rates in NIH3T3 cells expressing the Notch ligand Jagged, BMP2, FGF2, or Wnt3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Like SHH, Jagged and FGF2 triggered an approximate doubling of cytoneme occurrence. Wnt3A also increased occurrence rates, albeit to a lesser extent. BMP2 expression did not alter baseline cytoneme occurrence, indicating that some, but not all developmentally relevant signaling proteins can modulate activity of the specialized filopodia in NIH3T3 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cytonemes deliver an SHH activation signal</title><p>To determine whether SHH-containing cytonemes transmitted an activation signal to receiving cells, we developed a contact-mediated activation assay in which SHH pathway induction in receiving cells could be rapidly detected. The current temporal indicator of pathway induction tracks accumulation of the SHH signal transducing G-protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO) into primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>). However, both active and inactive SMO proteins cycle through the primary cilium, making this assay sub-optimal for tracking SMO activation in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rohatgi et al., 2009</xref>). Active SMO signals through Gαi heterotrimeric G proteins to raise intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which we reasoned would be a rapid and activation-specific read-out for pathway induction resulting from cytoneme-based ligand delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klatt Shaw et al., 2018</xref>). A previous study examining filopodial-based transport of SHH used a truncated SHH-N construct, which is amenable to palmitoylation, but lacks the carboxyl-terminal cholesterol modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). Because cholesterol contributes to both SHH morphogen gradient formation and PTCH binding on receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2006</xref>), we wanted to ensure that we analyzed trafficking of the physiologically relevant dually lipidated molecule. We generated SHH-GFP/mCherry such that both lipid modifications are added to a signaling molecule with an internal GFP or mCherry tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>). Transcriptional reporter assays confirmed functionality of the internally-tagged fluorescent SHH proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,C’</xref>). Once SHH expression constructs were validated, we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by co-culturing R-GECO-expressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter cells with NIH3T3 cells expressing palmitoylated and cholesterol-modified SHH-GFP or GFP control. R-GECO cells in contact with cytonemes, but not cell body, from control or SHH GFP-positive cells were monitored for Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B’</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). To increase the likelihood that signals would result from deposition of SHH via cytonemes, and not from SHH secreted into the media, media wash-out was performed at 15 min intervals for the duration of data acquisition. We counted any R-GECO Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux with a minimum peak fluorescence of 50 to be a positive event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C’</xref>). This flux value was determined by examining the distribution of fluorescence intensity of R-GECO cells in contact with GFP control cells (n = 27 cells). A value of 50 was determined to be within the 90th and 95th percentile of flux value distributions in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating any flux over 50 would likely be significantly above the control intensity range. Consistent with a SHH-induced signal, Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux rates of R-GECO reporter cells in contact with SHH containing cytonemes were more than twice the rate of flux observed in reporter cells contacted by cytonemes from GFP-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,B’, D</xref>). Furthermore, R-GECO cells in continuous contact with SHH-containing cytonemes had a significantly higher total time spent in flux than cells in contact with control cell cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). R-GECO reporter cells typically produced transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses within ~10–20 s of SHH-GFP release from cytonemes docked to their cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’</xref>, red dashes). To determine whether there was a statistically significant correlation between cytoneme-mediated ligand delivery and Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we documented all flux events with a mean intensity of over 50 that occurred within 20 s of SHH deposition (n = 15 cells). A Wilcoxon signed rank test performed against these results confirmed that reporter cells spent a significantly greater amount of time in positive flux within a 20 s window following an SHH deposit than they did outside this response window (p=6.1e-05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As such, a significant correlation between SHH delivery and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was confirmed. Importantly, SHH-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was blocked in <italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic> R-GECO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> columns 5 and 6) or by treatment with the inverse SMO agonist cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> columns 7 and 8), confirming specificity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to SHH pathway activation. To confirm that signal induction resulted from SHH delivered through cytonemes, and not from SHH ligand that may have been secreted into the culture medium from ligand-expressing cells, GFP and SHH-GFP expressing cells were co-cultured with R-GECO reporter cells. Flux was monitored in reporter cells in contact with cytonemes from SHH-GFP or GFP-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Reporter cells in contact with SHH-GFP-expressing cytonemes maintained higher flux rates than reporter cells in contact with GFP-expressing control cells, and exhibited a flux rate similar to what was observed in SHH-GFP/R-GECO culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> column 2 vs. column 4). Reporter cells in contact with GFP-expressing cells in the mixed culture exhibited a flux rate similar to reporter cells cultured with GFP-expressing cells in the absence of SHH-GFP co-culture (column 1 vs. column 3). We conclude secreted SHH does not contribute to the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cells in this assay. Thus, cytonemes can deliver SHH to induce a bona fide SMO activation signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cytoneme-based SHH delivery induces signaling in target cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time lapse images of an SHH-expressing NIH3T3 cell show SHH-GFP as a fluorescent intensity-spectrum in puncta.

SHH was expressed in MYO10 mutant MEFs, and cytoneme to cell body SHH signal intensity ratios were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). MYO10 mutant MEFs exhibited low SHH cytoneme to cell body signal intensity ratios, indicating inefficient cytoneme enrichment of the morphogen in the absence of MYO10. Enrichment of SHH in cytonemes was restored by co-expression of wild type or pleckstrin homology domain-deficient (ΔPH) MYO10, but not by a MYO10 mutant lacking its cargo binding domains (MYO10-HMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>). Comparable effects on SHH cytoneme enrichment were seen in wild type NIH3T3 cells over-expressing these MYO10-GFP variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). Although wild type and MYO10ΔPH did not alter the ratio of SHH or SHH-mCherry in cytonemes, MYO10-HMM over-expression reduced SHH cytoneme localization and attenuated SHH-mCherry FRAP to cytoneme tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). All MYO10 variants showed similar cytoneme FRAP rates, suggesting that failure of SHH to be transported by MYO10-HMM was likely due to compromised cargo binding, and not due to alteration of MYO10-HMM motor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>MYO10 contributes to the formation and maintenance of filopodia, and SHH increases cytoneme occurrence rates in HEK, NIH3T3, and wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, we next tested for a role for MYO10 in SHH-stimulated cytoneme occurrence in wild-type and <italic>Myo10</italic> mutant cells. In NIH3T3 cells, expression of wild-type MYO10 modestly enhanced the ability of SHH to increase cytoneme occurrence rates over baseline. MYO10-HMM over-expression suppressed occurrence rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which we speculate resulted from the mutant protein oligomerizing with endogenous MYO10 to disrupt its ability to bind and transport cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). In <italic>Myo10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs, SHH failed to stimulate cytoneme occurrence.

We next tested the ability of GFP-MYO10-HMM expressing cells to deliver an SHH activation signal. Consistent with our hypothesis, co-expression of GFP-MYO10-HMM with SHH in ligand-producing NIH3T3 cells reduced SHH-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in co-cultured R-GECO reporter cells to significantly lower rates than those observed upon co-culture with ligand-producing cells co-expressing GFP or wild type MYO10-GFP with SHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Combined, these results suggest MYO10 is required for the cytoneme-promoting effects of SHH, and also for cargo domain-mediated transport of SHH to cytoneme tips for delivery to target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Myosin 10 promotes SHH signaling in vivo</title><p><italic>Myo10</italic>-null mice <italic>(Myo10<sup>m1J/m1J</sup>)</italic> are semi-lethal with ~60% of homozygous mutants exhibiting exencephaly and embryonic or perinatal lethality.

DISP-HA and GFP-tagged BOC or CDON were co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells in the absence and presence of SHH, and colocalization between the three proteins was assessed. Confocal microscopy revealed that all three proteins localized to cytonemes, but that DISP did not significantly colocalize with either BOC or CDON along cytoneme membranes in the absence of SHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D,F,G</xref>).

To test for an interaction between the three proteins, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing DISP-FLAG and BOC-EGFP in the absence and presence of SHH. BOC-EGFP was captured on anti-FLAG beads in the absence of SHH, suggesting that DISP and BOC can associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the uncropped blot). Upon ligand expression, SHH incorporated into DISP-FLAG/BOC-EGFP immunocomplexes without significantly altering BOC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Likely consistent with context-dependent functionality, co-localization dynamics between DISP and CDON differed from what was observed for DISP and BOC. CDON colocalized with DISP at SHH-positive puncta in cytonemes, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than did BOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>). However, unlike what was observed for BOC, ligand expression did not increase colocalization between DISP and CDON along the length of cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Biochemical interrogation of DISP-CDON binding by immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that whereas CDON-GFP was captured on FLAG beads by DISP-FLAG in the absence of ligand, its association with DISP-FLAG was reduced upon SHH-DISP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> for the uncropped blot).

To determine the effects of BOC and CDON on cytonemes of SHH-expressing murine cells, the co-receptors were expressed with SHH in MEFs, and cytoneme occurrence rates were determined. The vertebrate-specific SHH co-receptor GAS1, which has not yet been investigated for a role in cytonemes, was also tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). GAS1-expressing cells showed baseline and SHH-induced cytoneme occurrence rates similar to GFP-expressing control cells, indicating that GAS1 over-expression does not actively promote or stabilize cytonemes in the absence or presence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Conversely, both BOC and CDON expression elevated baseline cytoneme occurrence rates near to SHH-stimulated levels, and modestly enhanced the ability of SHH to increase occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).

Unlike <italic>Ptch<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Disp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, which showed cytoneme occurrence increases in response to SHH expression, BCG KO cells failed to increase cytoneme occurrence in response to SHH expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–M</xref>). BCG KO cells were also compromised in their ability to induce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in co-cultured R-GECO reporter cells in the absence of direct cell body contact, indicating that at least one of the co-receptors is required to facilitate SHH-induced cytoneme occurrence and delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–N</xref>).

GAS1 re-expression did not rescue the ability of SHH to promote cytoneme occurrence, further supporting that GAS1 is not a modulator of SHH cytoneme function. Re-expression of BOC rescued SHH-mediated cytoneme occurrence increases in the triple KO cells, and restored the ability of cells to deliver an activation signal from BCG KO cells stably expressing ligand to co-cultured Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,N</xref>). CDON re-expression also restored cytoneme occurrence and receiving-cell signal induction, but not as effectively as BOC.

Using this assay as a probe, we identified roles for the actin motor MYO10 and the adhesion co-receptors BOC and CDON during cytoneme-based SHH transport and delivery. Consistent with its reported role in filopodial outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Myo10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs showed an approximate 10% reduction in basal cytoneme occurrence rates compared to control MEFs, and failed to increase occurrence rates following SHH expression. Thus, MYO10 is likely important for cytoneme biogenesis. Our results suggest that the molecular motor also plays a specific role in cytoneme-based transport of SHH that is facilitated through the MYO10 cargo binding domain. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that SHH and MYO10 traffic along cytonemes at similar velocities, and that cells expressing a MYO10 cargo binding mutant fail to enrich SHH in cytonemes, or to induce a pronounced SHH signal response in co-cultured R-GECO reporter cells.</p><p>In vivo studies of MYO10 mutant mice reveal ventral neural tube patterning defects in animals with exencephaly that are consistent with alteration of the SHH morphogen gradient. These include a reduced zone of SHH activity at the floorplate, compressed <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic> expression domains, and altered notochord regression. In addition we failed to observe SHH expression in the floor plate of a subset of embryos examined. However, floor plate specification was not consistently lost, indicating SHH signaling from the notochord to the floor plate can occur in the absence of MYO10 function. Homozygous mutants that did not show exencephaly survived to adulthood without developing SHH phenotypes. The failure of MYO10 mutants to consistently exhibit embryonic or adult SHH loss-of-function phenotypes is not unprecedented given the variable phenotypic penetrance observed in <italic>Myo10</italic> knockout animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimsath et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that functional compensation by cytoneme-independent mechanisms of SHH distribution likely occur to limit the impact of MYO10 loss on SHH notochord to floor plate signaling and morphogen gradient establishment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2019</xref>). Further, functional redundancy with other actin-based motors may provide some compensation for MYO10 loss. One candidate is MYO5a, which can also localize to filopodia, bind cargo, and traffic toward filopodial tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the observation that the majority of severely affected <italic>Myo10</italic> null embryos show exencephaly may suggest attenuated cytoneme function in these animals. This is because exencephaly can result from attenuated signaling by BMP, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of which has been demonstrated to transport along cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which MYO10 transports SHH to filopodial tips has yet to be determined. Given that SHH localized to vesicles inside cytonemes, we anticipate that MYO10-dependent movement of ligand occurs through motor-driven vesicular transport along actin filaments. The ΔPH mutant, which lacks phospholipid-binding capability, was not compromised for SHH transport or cytoneme occurrence. Thus, we hypothesize that MYO10 might connect to SHH-containing vesicles through its cargo domain via an adaptor protein localized to vesicular membranes such as a tetraspanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreu and Yáñez-Mó, 2014</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, immuno-localization studies revealed co-localization of SHH with CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins in discrete puncta along cytonemes.</p><p>In addition to identifying MYO10 as a functional partner in cytoneme-based SHH transport, our studies also revealed a novel role for co-receptors BOC and CDON in signal producing cell cytonemes. Although the co-receptors have previously been reported to localize to cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>), our study is the first to reveal that they can associate with the SHH deployment protein DISP, and act in producing cells to promote cytoneme formation and stability for SHH delivery. Despite functional redundancy between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>), we found that their associations with DISP-SHH complexes differed. Whereas both BOC and CDON associated with DISP in the absence of SHH, the amount of CDON in association with DISP was reduced upon SHH expression. DISP, CDON and SHH were observed to co-localize to puncta along cytonemes, suggesting the minor fraction still in association with DISP in the presence of ligand may be specific to cytoneme function. However, BOC may be the preferred cytoneme-localized co-receptor because it showed greater colocalization with DISP and facilitated a stronger SHH signal response in signal-receiving cells. Notably, either BOC or CDON was required for SHH to promote cytoneme occurrence because cells lacking all co-receptors failed to initiate cytonemes, or to induce long range signals without re-expression of one of the adhesion co-receptors. Importantly, BOC/CDON/GAS1 mutant cells are not compromised for contact-mediated SHH release because the SHH-expressing BCG KO cells can induce a response when directly abutting a signal-receiving cell. As such, we conclude BOC and CDON contribute to SHH transport from producing cells through promoting cytoneme occurrence and/or stability in the presence of ligand.</p><p>Determining the mechanism(s) by which SHH-containing co-receptor complexes promote cytoneme induction or stability is beyond the scope of the current study. However, the reported ability of BOC to activate the cytoskeletal regulator JNK during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vuong et al., 2017</xref>), suggests that BOC or CDON might connect SHH with actin remodelers for cytoneme movement. Thus, our results suggest the exciting possibility that SHH may ‘reverse-signal’ in an autocrine fashion to promote its own transport. We anticipate that this reverse signal is SMO/GLI independent, and instead, occurs through BOC or CDON co-receptor in complex with SHH. Our observation that SHH expression can increase cytoneme occurrence rates in both <italic>Ptch<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Disp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fibroblasts indicates that trimeric co-receptor complexes are not required for cytoneme initiation or stabilization in either signal sending or receiving cells. Thus, PTCH or DISP association with cytoneme-localized co-receptors likely confers specificity for ligand release or canonical signal induction without directly influencing cytoneme behavior. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DISP is required for HH to promote cytoneme stability, suggesting functionality of cytoneme-localized DISP may differ between fly and vertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodeen et al., 2017</xref>). We do not know how DISP function evolved between the systems, but speculate that the additional SHH-binding proteins such as GAS1 and SCUBE2, which are present in vertebrates and lacking in flies, may account for the discrepancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Creanga et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Future studies will be required to determine how SHH is loaded into cytoneme vesicles along with deployment complex components, and how ligand is transferred from signal producing cytonemes to target cells. The observed accumulation of exSHH puncta along the cell body combined with the paucity of exSHH signal along cytonemes may hint at how ligand enters the specialized filopodia. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate that HH ligands are initially directed to apical membranes where they are re-internalized by DISP prior to release for long range signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D'Angelo et al., 2015</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the exSHH signal could represent prepackaged protein that is poised for vesicular loading with BOC/CDON by DISP. It is possible that SHH may fail to load into or be released from specialized filopodia without deployment complex activity because cytoneme membranes may have a composition unique from that of bulk plasma membrane. Filopodia are documented to enrich for select phosphatidylinositol species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jacquemet et al., 2019</xref>), which may alter the overall membrane composition to prevent diffusion of SHH onto cytoneme membranes without assistance. Due to improved methods for preserving and imaging cytonemes of cultured cells, and for monitoring responses in signal-receiving cells, we are now poised to address these provocative questions. The proven utility of cultured cells for analyzing cytoneme biology reveals that in vitro systems can function as tractable models for interrogating morphogen transport. Furthermore, cultured cells may also allow for investigation of how cytonemes synergize with other morphogen dispersion processes to ensure gradient robustness during tissue development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Immunofluorescence and imaging</title><p>Cell fixation and staining were performed using MEM-fixation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall and Ogden, 2018</xref>).

Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 x g at 4°C for 45 min and analyzed. The supernatant was removed, and protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein from each sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on Criterion gels (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE samples were transferred onto Protran Nitrocellulose (GE) or Immobilon-P PVDF (Millipore) using Tris/Glycine/SDS Buffer (Bio-Rad) at 100V for one hour at 22°C. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Membranes were immunoblotted for 1 hr at 22°C using the following antibodies: rat anti-HA (1:3000; Roche), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000; Life Technologies), rabbit anti-SHH (H-160) (1:1000; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-GFP (1:8000, Rockland), rabbit anti-Kinesin (anti-Kif5B, 1:5000; Abcam), mouse anti-α-Tubulin (DM1A) (1:5000, CST), followed by three 5 min washes in secondary milk (primary milk diluted to 25% with TBS).

Prior to labeling with primary antibody, samples were washed with buffer and excess aldehyde groups neutralized with glycine. Samples were blocked with 1% BSA in 10 mM PBS (BSA/PBS) then a blocking solution matched to the species of the secondary antibody (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) in PBS. Samples were incubated with chicken anti-mCherry (1:1000, Abcam) diluted in BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C. Following primary antibody incubation, samples were washed in BSA/PBS then incubated with a streptavidin conjugated secondary antibody. Samples were rinsed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated nanogold (Nanoprobes) then washed with PBS and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS)). Following fixation, samples were successively rinsed in distilled water and 0.2 M citrate buffer then incubated with HQ Silver Enhancement reagent (Nanoprobes) prepared per manufacturer instructions. Enhancement reaction was halted by rinsing with distilled water. Samples were contrasted successively with 1% osmium tetroxide (EMS) and 1% uranyl acetate (EMS) in water with water washes between contrasting steps. Samples were then dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohols, infiltrated with EmBed 812 (EMS) and polymerized at 80°C overnight. Samples were sectioned on a Leica ultramicrotome (Wetzlar, Austria) at 70 nm and examined in a Tecnai G² F20-TWIN transmission electron microscope. Images were recorded using an AMT side mount camera system.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study addresses a poorly understood question, namely, the role of cytonemes in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) morphogen delivery and signaling in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging and a sensitive Ca reporter of SHH-induced SMO activation, the authors provide strong support for the existence of similar cytonemes as those reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and show that these structures are involved in intercellular transmission of SHH signals. Their studies also provide some insights into the protein composition of the mammalian cytonemes. These findings are of general interest, thus appropriate for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers find the data to be overall convincing and supporting the author's conclusions, they have raised some points that the authors should address in a revision.</p><p>1) The authors show that SHH has a dramatic stimulatory effect on cytoneme occurrence. Is this effect due to SHH signaling through the canonical Patched-Smoothened pathway? This could be tested using a synthetic <italic>Smo</italic> antagonist such as vismodegib (not cyclopamine). Along the same lines, does the Smoothened activator, SAG1, cause a similar increase in cytoneme number?</p><p>2) The neural tube phenotype of MYO10<sup>-/-</sup> embryos is very subtle (if it exists at all). A good comparison is the phenotype of <italic>Disp<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (see Figure 8 in PMID: 12421714), where the SHH ligand fails to exit its site of synthesis in the notochord. <italic>In Disp<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos the floor plate (marked by FoxA2) fails to be specified and so fails to secrete SHH. In contrast, in MYO10<sup>-/-</sup> embryos, floor plate specification seems fine, showing normal SHH transport. Also the embryo sections seem to be from slightly different stages, making it difficult to determine if the slight change in the <italic>nkx.2</italic> and <italic>olig2</italic> domains is due to a decrease in SHH responsive or just due to differences in timing. For example, embryos in B appear to be for an earlier stage (narrower tube) compared to embryos in A. It is critical in these embryos to show (1) antibody stain for SHH to show that its spread is compromised and (2) in situ hybridization for the direct target gene <italic>Gli1</italic> to show reduction in Hh target gene induction. Unlike the progenitor domains, these are the most direct readouts of SHH transport in the tube and the downstream effect on Shh signal reception.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61432.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers find the data to be overall convincing and supporting the author's conclusions, they have raised some points that the authors should address in a revision.</p><p>1) The authors show that SHH has a dramatic stimulatory effect on cytoneme occurrence.

These results are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G. SAG treatment did not significantly increase cytoneme occurrence rates in GFP (white bars) or SHH (gray bars) expressing cells. We tested whether SMO loss would impact cytoneme occurrence by generating SMO-null NIH3T3 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. <italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic> NIH3T3 cells showed increased cytoneme occurrence in response to SHH expression, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than what was observed in wild type NIH3T3 cells. Thus, SMO signaling is not required for cytoneme induction, but may enhance cytoneme occurrence rates under SHH-stimulated conditions. As requested, we also examined the effect of Vismodegib, and found that cytoneme dynamics were altered in both the absence and presence of SHH. Vismodegib-treated cells showed elevated baseline occurrence rates and blunted SHH-stimulated cytoneme occurrence, resulting in a modest ligand-induced occurrence rate change in drug treated cells. Nevertheless, given the ability of SHH to increase cytoneme occurrence in a statistically significant manner in <italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, we are confident that canonical PTCH-SMO signaling is not required for the SHH effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The neural tube phenotype of MYO10<sup>-/-</sup> embryos is very subtle (if it exists at all).

Unlike the progenitor domains, these are the most direct readouts of SHH transport in the tube and the downstream effect on Shh signal reception.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that shifts in progenitor domains in the E10.5 neural tubes shown in the initial submission were difficult to appreciate. To address this concern, we performed several additional crosses to examine stage-matched embryos at E9.5, rather than E10.5. All sections shown were taken from equivalent cardiac level regions of the embryos.</p><p>As suggested, we examined the SHH activity domain surrounding the floor plate and performed in situ hybridization to track <italic>Gli1</italic> expression. We also include new neural tube sections showing shifted <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>-marked progenitor domains. As discussed in the text, the severity of the <italic>Myo10<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> phenotype is variable, likely due to compensation by other factors. So, we examined only <italic>Myo10<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos showing overt exencephaly to control against phenotypic variability.</p><p>We attempted to stain for SHH using available antibodies, but could not obtain quality results due to pronounced signal to noise issues. So, to address the question about SHH spread in the neural tube, we obtained the <italic>SHH::GFP</italic> allele originally published by the McMahon lab (B6.129X1 (Cg)-Shh<sup>tm6Amc</sup>/J), which tags endogenously-expressed bioactive SHH with GFP. We crossed the <italic>SHH::GFP</italic> allele into the <italic>Myo10<sup>m1J/+</sup></italic> background, and analyzed the SHH-GFP signal in E9.5 <italic>Myo10<sup>m1J/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Myo10<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos. Analysis of SHH<sup>GFP/+</sup>; <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos with exencephaly revealed the domain of SHH-GFP signal to be compressed as compared to neural tubes of <italic>Shh<sup>GFP/+</sup>; Myo <sup>m1J/+</sup></italic> controls (Figure 5A-C and quantified in D using 3-5 cardiac region sections from 7 individual animals). In addition, <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos consistently showed defective initiation of notochord regression, indicative of reduced GLI activity (Park et al., 2000). We speculate near-normal floor plate induction in <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos may result from sustained close proximity of the non-regressed notochord to the neural tube, which may allow for SHH to be directly transferred/delivered through cytoneme-independent mechanisms. We briefly discuss this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>As requested, we performed in situ hybridization experiments for the direct SHH target <italic>Gli1</italic> in wild type, <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> E9.5 embryos. <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> animals showed clear reduction in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression. E9.5 <italic>Myo10 <sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> embryos also showed compressed <italic>Olig2</italic> progenitor domains, consistent with reduced SHH target gene induction.</p><p>We think the inclusion of these additional in vivo experiments strengthens our conclusion that <italic>Myo10</italic> contributes to SHH deployment in vivo, and thank the reviewers for these helpful suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
