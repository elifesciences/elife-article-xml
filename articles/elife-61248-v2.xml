Here we show that neuronal activity in the dorsal part of the primate caudate head (dCDh) signals the temporally discounted value needed to compute the motivation for delayed rewards. Macaque monkeys performed an instrumental task, in which visual cues indicated the forthcoming size and delay duration before reward. Single dCDh neurons represented the temporally discounted value without reflecting changes in the animal’s physiological state. Bilateral pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of dCDh markedly distorted the normal task performance based on the integration of reward size and delay, but did not affect the task performance for different reward sizes without delay. These results suggest that dCDh is involved in encoding the integrated multi-dimensional information critical for motivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>temporal discounting</kwd><kwd>delay</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>DREADDs</kwd><kwd>monkey</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18H04037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minamimoto</surname><given-names>Takafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20H05955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minamimoto</surname><given-names>Takafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20dm0107146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minamimoto</surname><given-names>Takafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20dm0207077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takada</surname><given-names>Masahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20dm0307021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Ken-ichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAMH-2619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richmond</surname><given-names>Barry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002917</institution-id><institution>Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-A-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minamimoto</surname><given-names>Takafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dorsal part of the primate caudate head signals integrated multi-dimensional incentive factors essential for computing the motivation for action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motivation for engaging in action depends on the expected value of its outcome, e.g., when and how much money or food will be available as a reward. Intuitively, the larger and earlier the reward is, the greater the motivation will be. When animals and humans suppose the reward to be delayed, their behaviors become slower and less accurate. This decline in motivation is conceptualized as discounting of reward value as a function of time, namely temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berret and Jean, 2016</xref>). Temporal discounting was originally proposed to describe choice preferences for earlier smaller rewards rather than later larger rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazur, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Myerson, 2004</xref>), implying that motivation and decision-making may share common brain processes. Besides temporal discounting, motivational processes also consider internal drive for reward, such as hunger and thirst, integrating these two factors into motivational value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toates, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>One of the major candidates as the neural systems mediating the computation of expected outcome value and transforming it into action is the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daw and Doya, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2006</xref>). Several lines of evidence based on electrophysiological studies have suggested that the caudate nucleus (CD) plays an important role in motivational processing via signaling an expected outcome and monitoring action/outcome leading to future behavioral improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromwell and Schultz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hori et al., 2009</xref>). Especially, the dorsal part of the head of the CD (dCDh) is best situated to participate in temporal discounting processes because it receives strong convergent inputs from various frontal cortical areas including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the supplementary eye field (SEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haber et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haber et al., 2006</xref>), where neuronal activity is related to the expected amount or delay/proximity of rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roesch and Olson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roesch and Olson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsujimoto and Sawaguchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sohn and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">So and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that neurons in this CD sector respond in relation to temporally discounted values during intertemporal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is not yet clear how dCDh contributes to the computation of motivational value with temporal discounting.</p><p>Here, we examined single-unit activity in dCDh of macaque monkeys while they performed a delayed reward task. In the task a visual cue indicated the forthcoming reward size and the delay duration to the reward after simple action. From each animal’s behavior, we were able to infer the value for temporally discounted rewards including their interactions with satiation. We found that a subpopulation of single dCDh neurons increased their activity during the time period from the cue onset to the execution of action. The activity of many neurons was correlated with the temporally discounted value related to the expected value of outcome. However, the activity was not influenced by the level of satiation. To determine whether the value-related activity might be causally related to behavior, pharmacological inactivation (local muscimol injection) and chemogenetic inactivation (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs, DREADDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roth, 2016</xref>) of dCDh were carried out; both of these inactivations produced consistent impairments in motivational behaviors reflected as a distorted integration of reward size and delay, while behaviors based on the integration of reward size and physiological state remained intact.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temporal discounting accounts for monkeys’ behavior</title><p>We studied computation of the motivational value using temporal discounting in macaque monkeys induced delaying reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the basic task, the monkey must release a bar when a red spot turns green. A visual cue appears at the beginning of each trial and remains on throughout. Each of the six cues is linked to one combination of reward size (one small drop; three or four large drops) and delay to reward (one of 0, 3.3, and 6.9 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this and similar tasks, the error rate, i.e., the proportion of trials with an incorrect response (either releasing the bar too early or too late), reflects the monkey’s motivation for action, which can be interpreted as the motivational value or decision utility for whether to act or not, according to its prediction about the forthcoming reward. In our previous studies, the error rate was inversely related to the motivational value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>). In previous behavioral studies, the subjective value of delayed reward was formulated as a hyperbolic discounting model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazur, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Myerson, 2004</xref>),<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>DV</italic> is the value of delayed reward (i.e., temporally discounted value), <italic>R</italic> is the magnitude of reward, <italic>k</italic> is a discount parameter, and <italic>D</italic> is the delay to the reward. Accordingly, to describe error rates in this delayed reward task, we extended the inverse relation, incorporating it into a hyperbolic discounting model as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, with error rates (<italic>E</italic>), reward size (<italic>R</italic>), delay (<italic>D</italic>), and a monkey-specific free-fitting parameter (<italic>a</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>),<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the error rates were higher when a small reward size was expected, and for both reward sizes, the errors increased linearly as the expected delay duration increased. This pattern of the averaged error rates was well described by the inverse relation with hyperbolic delay discounting (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.96, 0.88, and 0.94 for monkeys BI, FG, and ST, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, solid lines). The exponential discounting model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>) also explained the majority of the cases (7/10 monkeys, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, dotted curves for monkeys BI and ST) well. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>), leave-one-out cross-validation analysis confirmed that the hyperbolic model fitted the error rates significantly better than exponential function for all three monkeys as well as for seven additional monkeys (p&lt;0.05; see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task, behavioral performance, and recording sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of events of behavioral tasks.

Nine of 10 monkeys exhibited a pattern in which early errors increased over time, reaching a peak at about 0.7 s or 1.8 s after cue onset, while only one monkey (monkey TM) showed an increase in early errors immediately after cue onset. These results suggest that early errors were not rejection responses, but rather the consequence of insufficient motivation to make the correct response. In addition, the late releases did not always occur immediately after the end of the 1 s response window, suggesting that they were not due to extensions of slow reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results also support the interpretation that errors are caused by insufficient motivation to respond correctly.</p><p>The reaction times also covaried with both reward size and reward delay; reaction times were shorter for larger rewards (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.001, 8/10 monkeys including monkeys BI, FG, and ST) and shorter delays (p&lt;0.001, 9/10 monkeys including monkeys BI, FG, and ST, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the monkeys were not required to fixate during the task, they usually gazed at the cue during the cue period. We did not find any significant effect of forthcoming reward size or delay duration on the duration of gazing at the cue (two-way ANOVA; main effect of reward size, effect size η<sup>2</sup> = 0.004; main effect of delay, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.002; reward size × delay, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results suggest that the monkeys adjusted their motivation of action based on the temporally discounted value, which forms a hyperbolic relationship between expected size and delay of forthcoming reward.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neuronal activity of dCDh reflects temporally discounted value</title><p>We examined the role of the caudate nucleus in the motivational control of action based on the temporally discounted value.

A significant regression coefficient for DV (p&lt;0.05, t-test) was found in 27 of 100 cue-responsive neurons (11, 6, and 10 in monkeys BI, FG, and ST, respectively); 18 and 9 exhibited positive and negative correlations, respectively. The result did not seem to depend on the shape of DV function: a similar number of neurons showed a significant DV relation when estimating using the exponential function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>; n = 25). By contrast, significant DV relation was relatively minor in release-related (5/49) and reward responses (3/49). The DV relation was not likely to be a direct reflection of the eye movement or gaze variables, since the monkeys tended to looked at cue location from cue to go signal regardless of rewarding condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Besides the DV relation, the cue response might solely reflect reward size or delay duration. We compared the effect of size or delay alone on cue response with that of DV using multiple linear regression analysis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>).

Thus, DV-related neurons were not just a selected population from the neurons representing mixtures of these delay and size by chance; rather, the entire neuronal population seemed to represent reward size and delay in an integrated manner.

In the following section, we will focus on this subset of neurons and refer to neurons with and without significant correlation with DV as <italic>DV-coding neurons</italic> (n = 27) and <italic>non-DV-coding neurons</italic> (n = 73), respectively. DV-coding neurons were not confined to specific locations, but were found throughout the dCDh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the time course of DV coding of the cue responses, the effect size of DV (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in a linear regression analysis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>) was calculated (200 ms window, 10 ms steps) for each DV-coding neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). On average, the effect size rose from 100 ms after cue onset, reaching a peak at 750 ms after the cue (red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thereafter, it gradually decreased to the bar release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The effect size did not become 0, indicating that a few neurons (n = 5) also signaled DV around bar release. Thus, DV coding started just after the monkey was informed about the reward size and delay of the forthcoming reward, and it continued until the time point of execution of an action. We postulated that the activity of DV-coding neurons may be related to the process mediating outcome prediction and further the decision to act or not. If this is the case, the DV-coding neurons should behave differentially between correct and error trials. To test this, we performed linear mixed model (LMM) analysis on 22 of 27 DV-coding neurons recorded in a session in which the monkeys made at least three error trials. We found that the majority of DV-coding neurons (17 of 22) were modulated differentially by DV depending on whether the monkey performed correctly or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>), supporting the idea that this population of neurons is involved in motivational processes.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Time course of DV coding.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Time-dependent change of DV coding.

Given that the monkeys tended to look at the cue location during cue period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the activity of non-DV-coding neurons appeared to largely reflect visual response, but was unlikely to be evoked by eye movement.

We also examined trial initiation time (duration between the time the reward was received and the start of the next trial), reflecting satiation effects as a measure of motivation to start time in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). In both control and inactivation sessions, the trial initiation time was significantly longer in the second half of the session (two-way ANOVA, main effect of first vs second, F<sub>(1,54)</sub> = 4.32, p=0.042), where no significant interactive effect of dCDh inactivation was observed (first vs second × treatment, F<sub>(1,54)</sub> = 0.32, p=0.57). These results suggest that dCDh inactivation does not have a strong effect on satiation.</p><p>Was the impairment specifically related to the temporally discounted value? Alternatively, it may reflect the dysfunction of the motivational process in general. Since the temporally discounted value is often referred to as ‘subjective value’, dCDh inactivation could produce a general dysregulation of computation for motivational value – a subjective impact of the upcoming reward on performance. To examine the effects of dCDh inactivation on motivational value without delay, we tested two monkeys in a reward-size task in which the task requirement remained the same as the delayed reward task, but a successful bar release was immediately rewarded with one of four reward sizes (one, two, four, or eight drops) associated with a unique cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). It has been repeatedly shown that the error rates of this task will be well explained by the joint function of reward size and satiation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minamimoto et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of bilateral dCDh did not alter the pattern of the error rate in this task; in both cases they remained to be well explained by the model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and were equally well compared with the baseline data (p&gt;0.15, bootstrap significance test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The inactivation did not change the overall error rates (three-way ANOVA, treatment, F<sub>(1, 243)</sub> = 1.35, p=0.45) or the interactive effect with reward size on the error rates (treatment × size, F<sub>(3, 243)</sub> = 1.69, p=0.17). The lack of change in the error rate pattern in the reward-size task could be attributed to the relative ease of associating cues with outcome compared to the delayed reward task. However, no clear difference was evident between the two tasks in establishing the cue–outcome relationship as judged by the behavior during the training period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that dCDh activity is specifically involved in computing the motivational value based on delay discounting, rather than general motivational processes based on the integration of incentives and drive.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Reward-size task and behavioral performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cue stimuli used in reward-size task uniquely associated with forthcoming reward size (one, two, four, or eight drops).

The behavior showed that the likelihood of carrying out the trials for delayed rewards was well described by a model with hyperbolic discounting and satiation. There were two main findings. First, a substantial number of single dCDh neurons represented the temporally discounted values, combining the information about the reward size and delay in delivery. However, these same neurons did not reflect a decrease in internal physiological drive seen in the behavior as the monkeys became more satiated. Second, bilateral pharmacological or chemogenetic inactivation of dCDh distorted the motivational valuation derived from the integration of reward size and delay duration, whereas the relationship from the integration of reward size and physiological state remained intact. These results suggest a major contribution of dCDh in mediating the integrated external information that is critical for formulating the motivation for action.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the neuronal activity in the CD is involved in translating value into action by signaling multi-dimensional aspects of reward-related information, including presence/absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cromwell and Schultz, 2003</xref>), probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White and Monosov, 2016</xref>), and size of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Neurons in dCDh reflect the action values of a specific movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</xref>) and might contribute to selecting an action that maximizes future rewards. In the present study, we found that the cue responses of a subpopulation of dCDh neurons reflected temporally discounted values that were inferred from the individual behaviors. It could not be a simple reflection of physical features of a visual cue, since the neuronal signal was observed irrespective of the cue sets used for assigning delayed reward, and since the neuronal correlates disappeared when the cue was randomized with respect to the outcome (data not shown). It has also been suggested that the basal ganglia are involved in assessing information processing for the duration of events or actions. Neuronal signals reflecting the duration of past events related to temporal discrimination were found in the anterior striatum including CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiba et al., 2008</xref>). The CD neurons also showed ramping-up activity in response to stimuli that predict timing of action initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki and Tanaka, 2019</xref>). It might not be surprising that the neuronal signal reported here was related not only to the forthcoming reward timing, but also to the reward size, hence representing DV. Although it has been reported eye movement-related activity of CD neurons modulated by forthcoming rewarding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>), the DV signal observed here could not be a direct reflection of eye movements or gaze variables, since the monkeys constantly looked at the cue during the cue period regardless of the rewarding condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The DV signal emerged just after cue onset, gradually increased, and then disappeared before execution of the action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This time course suggests that the neuronal signal does not simply convey the Pavlovian value of the cue, but can be related to the cognitive process mediating the outcome prediction underlying the decision of whether to act or not. This was supported by the results of the error trial analysis, which showed that most of the DV-coding neurons behaved differently between correct and error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared with DV, the effect of the reward size or delay duration on cue responses was relatively weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the signal integration may take place at least partially in some upstream brain area(s). The first plausible source of temporal discounting is a prefronto-striatal projection. Our recordings were carried out from dCDh, the region receiving direct input from the frontal cortical areas including DLPFC, ACC, and SEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calzavara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2014</xref>). DLPFC neurons encode DV as well as reward, delay duration, and target position during an intertemporal choice task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalenscher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), exhibiting strong modulations in response to the delay combined with the amount of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsujimoto and Sawaguchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sohn and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>). The activity in ACC reflects the expected amount of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knutson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>) and the delay/proximity of rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>), as well as delay discounting for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McClure et al., 2007</xref>). Neurons in SEF are also modulated by the amount of reward and delay duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roesch and Olson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roesch and Olson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">So and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>). The second possible source is a nigrostriatal dopaminergic input. When a stimulus signaled the timing of reward delivery, the stimulus response of dopaminergic neurons declined hyperbolically with the delay duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008</xref>). The third possible source is a thalamostriatal input arising from thalamic nuclei, including the centromedian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Neuronal activity in CM reflects the predicted outcome value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minamimoto et al., 2005</xref>), but at this point, there is no evidence that it is involved in delay discounting.</p><p>Independent of temporal discounting, the motivational value of the cue should also decrease according to a shift in the internal physiological drive state. However, the effect of drive has been investigated separately from temporal discounting, and it has generally not been taken into account during studies of choice behavior. In our task, the changing motivational value was well approximated as being exponentially decreased along with reward accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), while the relative effect of reward size and delay on decision appeared to be constant. This was in good agreement with psychological concepts of motivation, in which motivational value arises from a multiplicative interaction between external stimulus and physiological state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toates, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge, 2004</xref>). This also suggests that temporal discounting and reward devaluation may be two independent processes, one exerting a hyperbolic effect of delay duration on the reward size changing in a trial-by-trial manner, and the other slowly decreasing the motivational value of the reward in response to reward accumulation. Our data support the notion that dCDh may be involved in the former process only; DV coding in dCDh was not sensitive to changes in internal drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar insensitivity to satiation has been reported in terms of cue-related activity in the ventral striatum that was correlated with reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roesch et al., 2009</xref>). This leaves an intriguing possibility, namely, that the insensitivity of internal drive may result from the motor output used; different data could be obtained if we tested monkeys with saccadic eye movements, in which neurons in dCDh are known to be involved. Satiety-dependent changes in neuronal activity have been seen in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rolls et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Critchley and Rolls, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouret and Richmond, 2010</xref>), rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD), and ventral pallidum (VP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps satiety-related signals would be represented in a network believed to be critical for guiding a choice of food based on internal drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murray and Rudebeck, 2013</xref>). To formulate the motivational value for action, the physiological state or drive signal from this network may be integrated with temporal discounting in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, brain structures downstream from dCDh.</p><p>The causal contribution of DV coding in dCDh to temporal discounting was examined by pharmacological and chemogenetic inactivations, which are complementary and applicable to silencing primate striatal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). Muscimol inactivation is a standard procedure that has repeatedly been used in monkey studies. It has, however, major drawbacks: (1) the extent of an effective area is difficult to be controlled or identified (although we monitored the location of injection sites by computed tomography [CT]) and (2) when the experiments are repeated, mechanical damage to tissue would accumulate. The chemogenetic tool DREADDs, on the other hand, overcomes these problems; once a silencing DREADDs, hM4Di, is delivered, substantially the same neuronal population can be inactivated non-invasively and the effective region can be confirmed by PET imaging, as demonstrated here, and by traditional post-mortem histochemistry. We found that inactivation of dCDh by either method produced consistent behavioral impairments; inactivation abolished the normal pattern of error rates derived from the integration of reward size and delay duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This impairment cannot be explained simply by changes in the temporal discounting rate or alterations in the evaluation of single incentive factors. Our results are consistent with previous findings that both lesioning and inactivation of the dorsomedial striatum in rats, a homologue of dCDh in primates, reduced the sensitivity of instrumental performance to shifts in the outcome value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, dCDh inactivation did not impair motivation based on reward size alone or according to the integration of reward size and physiological state (i.e., motivational value; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, impairment can be attributed to the loss of DV coding seen in the activity of single dCDh neurons. Similar specific impairments have also been found in monkeys with bilateral ablation of DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>). Given intact motivational evaluation for the reward size alone in these cases, the motivational process appears to gain access to value signals bypassing the DLPFC-CD pathway. A plausible network for the reward size process is prefronto-basal ganglia projections from OFC to rmCD/ventral striatum and/or VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haber et al., 2006</xref>), since ablation or inactivation of these related areas abolished the normal relationship between reward size and error rate in the reward-size task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our findings, together with our previous results, support the concept that incentive motivation is processed through the prefronto-basal ganglia circuit in accordance with certain topographic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>). Our findings additionally provide evidence that defines a specific role of dCDh in incentive motivation, as dCDh signals the integrated multi-dimensional factors and contributes to computation of the motivational value.</p><p>Our findings may also have some clinical relevance. Dysregulation of normal temporal discounting is associated with increased impulsive behavior. Impulsive behavior and preference are often manifested in patients with psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders, and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pulcu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amlung et al., 2019</xref>). Human imaging studies have revealed the structural and functional connectivity between DLPFC and the striatum with the individual differences in temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Bos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Bos et al., 2015</xref>). Since silencing dCDh did not induce impulsivity (steepened temporal discounting or facilitating reaction was not observed), it could be difficult in the present study to address the link between dCDh activity and mechanisms underlying impulsivity. Nevertheless, our findings may provide a framework to elucidate dysregulation of motivational systems in impulsive individuals with psychiatric disorders.</p><p>In summary, our work indicates that dCDh neurons encode, at a single-neuron level, temporally discounted values of forthcoming rewards without reflecting any internal state alteration. These signals are likely to be used in downstream brain structures for formulating motivation of action especially when multi-dimensional factors have to be jointly evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten male rhesus macaque monkeys (5–11 kg) were used in this study.

In each of the trials, the monkey worked for one of six combinations of reward size and delay. Every trial had the same requirement for obtaining the reward: releasing the bar when a colored spot changed from red to green. Trials began when the monkey touched the bar at the front of the chair. A visual cue and a red spot (wait signal) sequentially appeared in the center of the monitor with a 0.1 s interval. After a variable interval, the red target turned green (go signal). If the monkey released the bar between 0.2 and 1 s after this go signal, the trial was considered correct and the spot turned blue (correct signal). A liquid, either small (one drop, ca. 0.1 mL) or large reward (three drops, except for monkey BI, four drops), was delivered immediately (0.3 ± 0.1 s) or with an additional delay of either 3.3 ± 0.6 s or 6.9 ± 1.2 s after correct release of the bar. Each combination of reward size and delay was chosen with equal probability and independently of the preceding reward condition. An inter-trial interval (ITI) of 1 s was enforced before allowing the next trial to begin. We used a fixed ITI instead of adjusted ITIs with post-reward delays (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2013</xref>) because monkeys are insensitive to post-reward delays in our tasks (see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>). Anticipatory bar releases (before or no later than 0.2 s after the appearance of the go signal) and failures to release the bar within 1 s after the appearance of the go signal were counted as errors. In error trials, the trial was terminated immediately, all visual stimuli disappeared and, following ITI, the trial was repeated, that is, the reward size/delay combination remained the same as in the error trial.</p><p>In the behavioral experiment, the visual cue indicated a unique combination of reward size and delay. Two sets of cues were used: a stripe set (for nine monkeys except for BI) and an image set (for monkey BI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Prior to the behavioral experiment, all monkeys had been trained to perform color discrimination trials in a cued multi-trial reward schedule task for more than 3 months followed by learning of each task for 1–3 months.

A guide tube was inserted through the grid hole in the implanted recording chamber into the brain, and the electrodes were advanced through the guide tube by means of a micromanipulator (Narishige MO-97A or Alpha Omega EPS). Spike sorting to isolate single-neuron discharges was performed with a time-window algorithm (TDT-RZ2, Tucker Davis Technologies) or custom-made software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments).

Muscimol (4 µg/1 µL saline) was injected at a rate of 0.2 µL/min by auto-injector (Legato210, KD Scientific Inc) for a total volume of 3 µL in each side. Soon after the injection was completed, the animal was allowed to start performing the tasks, which continued for 100 min. We performed at most one inactivation study per week. For control, we injected saline at other times using the same parameters as those used for muscimol. At the end of each session, a CT scan was conducted to visualize the injection cannulae in relation to the chambers and skull. The CT images were overlaid on MR images by using PMOD and VirtualPlace (Canon Medical Solutions Corp) image analysis software to assist in identifying the injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). We plotted the injection sites based on the estimate of the liquid diffusion range (4 mm diameter) reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoshida et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin and Ghez, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The R statistical computing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">R Development Core Team, 2004</xref>) was used for all data analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>Error rates in task performance were calculated by dividing the total number of errors by the total number of trials for each reward condition and then averaged across all sessions.

We compared the average trial initiation time in the first and second halves of the daily session.</p><p>Significance of deviation from baseline data was examined by means of the parametric bootstrapping method (n = 20,000). We first constructed distribution of the sum of squared residuals (SSR) of the best fit of the model to the averaged resampled error rates (n = 5 or 4 sessions for delayed reward and reward-size task, respectively) from the pooled sample in baseline conditions in each subject. For this analysis, we used normalized error rates by the maximum error rates among reward conditions in each session to remove variance across sessions. p-values for deviation from the distribution were obtained for SSR of the best fit of the model-to-test data (control or inactivation).</p><p>The Brunner–Munzel test was used as non-parametric analysis for median value with Bonferroni correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Neuronal data analysis</title><p>Only neuronal data from correct trials were used for the analyses. For each neuron, we collected data from 20 to 30 correct trials for each combination of reward-size-and-delay duration, a total of 120–180 successful trials. For each neuron, we first determined the start and end of event-related responses by using a series of χ<sup>2</sup> tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravel and Richmond, 2006</xref>). The background window was defined as the activity between 500 and 0 ms before cue onset. The test window spanned 100 ms for cue responses, and it moved in 10 ms increments, from 0 to 1500 ms, after cue appearance. For bar-release responses, the 100 ms test window moved from 300 ms before to 300 ms after bar release. For reward-related responses, the 100 ms test window moved from 0 to 500 ms after reward appearance. For each 100 ms test window, an χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to determine whether the proportions of filled to empty 1 ms bins in the 100 ms test interval were significantly different from the proportion in the 500 ms background window. Start of the response was taken to be the middle of the first of four consecutive 100 ms test intervals showing a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in spike count between the test and background window. End of the response was defined as the middle of the last window showing a significant difference. Duration of the response was defined as the difference between the start and end of the response. The procedure worked well for all tested neurons, yielding latencies that matched those we would have chosen by visual inspection. A neuron was classified as responsive to the three events when a significant response could be detected in at least five consecutive windows.</p><p>To quantify the influence of temporal discounting of reward value on the response, we applied linear regression analysis. For each significant response, firing rates (<italic>Y</italic>) were fitted by the following linear regression model:<disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(7)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>β</italic><sub>V</sub> is the regression coefficient and <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub> is the intercept, and <italic>DV</italic> is the temporally discounted value formulated by a hyperbolic function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazur, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Myerson, 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alicia Izquierdo as the Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Emmanuel Procyk (Reviewer #1); Ilya E Monosov (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision that summarizes the needed changes, to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hori and colleagues tested how neurons in the head of caudate nucleus (dCDh) integrate temporally-discounted reward value (DV) and secondarily, how environmental cues may be encoded by this region in action selection. Authors conducted single-unit recordings and pharmacological/chemogenetic inactivations in dCDh in monkeys performing a cue-based reward task. Inactivation validations were provided by microPET binding for DZ and CT scan for muscimol tracks. Overall, reviewers were favorable about this work, and request no additional experiments. However, they identified a need for broader consideration of alternative explanations and additional analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major theme from reviews centered on the need to elaborate on, and better account for, alternative explanations for the role of dCDh. Indeed, there is a rich literature on the basal ganglia in transforming value to action, credit assignment, controlling eye gaze, keeping time, etc. Thus, authors should more thoroughly consider other functions of the striatum in their revision. Additional analyses are being requested and should be included in new or existing Figures: account for the impact of satiety (time on task) and its characterization following dCDh inactivation, provide more information of error types and timing of errors, conduct an analysis of gaze (and time courses of gaze), average time courses of non-DV neuron activity, and also more information about learning stages, accounting for the order of task. Authors should also provide an analysis demonstrating how DV decoding differs in completed vs. aborted trials because this would test directly the decision to act or not. Similarly, authors should provide reaction time effects during inactivation (to include trial initiation, anticipatory behaviors, etc.). These new analyses are essential to bolster a claim of some specificity of dCDh function. These are elaborated on below:</p><p>1) The dissociation between DV integration and the satiety (time on task) effect is particularly interesting and very relevant, but a more precise characterization of the consequence of dCDh inactivation should also be possible.</p><p>2) A more detailed investigations of errors, and in particular error timings (release time in a trial relative to the different events) could be informed better on the sources of errors. Similarly, the proportion of different error types either (early release vs failure to release). Such timing and proportion analyses might also provide clues on inactivation effects. Theoretically, following the current interpretation, trial aborts should peak at the time of DV encoding.</p><p>3) Anterior dorsal regions of the caudate are known to control gaze. In fact, FEF converges on similar regions in the caudate as dlPFC, and both dlPFC and FEF carry some oculomotor signals (spatial signals for example related to saccades), as does the caudate head itself. The authors state that the differences in &quot;value-related&quot; attributes of cues did not impact gaze, but this is not carefully analyzed. What were the time courses of gaze? Might the caudate impact gaze at different epochs of the trial differentially? In other words, could the complexity of gaze behavior mask the relationship of gaze and neural firing rates? Big picture reasons for these questions: it is important to consider this issue because the key claim is that dCDh neurons are encoding motivational (abstract) variables not motor/gaze variables.</p><p>4) Provide an account for what non-DV neurons are doing and plot average time courses for all groups of neurons. If possible, plot these and DV neurons' activity also aligned on saccades (gaze shifts to the cues).</p><p>5) One may propose an alternative interpretation, that dCDh inactivation perturbs the integration of learned visual cues that have complex associations with reward contingencies, or for which the association is difficult to learn. The authors show interesting control data from a condition with only 4 cues for which there is no effect of inactivation on error rate (according to reward size or time in session). This controls at least for a pure cue recognition/perception deficit. But the learning of the cue-reward size/delay might be a problem. So, could the authors provide information on the learning stages for the different animals, for the main and control tasks, and in what order these tasks have been learned? This actually might be a follow-up point to the previous- error types time distributions and how they inform the causes of errors.</p><p>6) For inactivation/disruption – show reaction time effects. Given the complexity of temporal discounting, provide analyses to show the effects of disruption on other task related behaviors. Consider basic measures such as trial initiation, anticipatory behaviors, etc. This will greatly strengthen claims of the &quot;specificity&quot; of effects.</p><p>7) The authors mentioned that the activity correlating with DV is related to the process mediating outcome prediction and further the decision to act or not. Indeed, it would be interesting to see how the DV decoding behaves in completed versus aborted trials, to check whether there is any part of the variance explained by the decision to quit the current trial, or not.</p><p>A second category of major critiques related to the role of dlPFC, and anatomical placement. All 3 reviewers suggest to downplay the idea that dlPFC is a crucial locus for delay discounting. dlPFC is a heterogenous structure and the over-emphasis in its modulating activity in dCDh (and DV) should be tempered. Relatedly, the tracing experiment for dlPFC projections to caudate (not performed in the monkeys as the inactivation) was deemed redundant and unnecessary, and could be removed. Additionally a note that the location of recorded cells appears more dorsal and medial than the inactivation sites, is worthy of discussion. There are also no data of recordings performed in the presence of inactivation. If authors have these data, it would be good to include them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61248.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>A major theme from reviews centered on the need to elaborate on, and better account for, alternative explanations for the role of dCDh.

In the inactivation condition, the satiation effect was still visible in two of three monkeys but was disrupted in monkey ST. Based on these results, we cannot exclude the possibility that the inactivation of dCDh impaired both of two underlying processes: drive and temporal discounting. However, the results shown in Figure 8 indicate that motivation based on drive and its integration with prediction for reward size was normal in two monkeys including monkey ST, and therefore we conclude that “dCDh activity is specifically involved in the motivational value computation based on delay discounting, rather than general motivational process based on the integration of incentives and drive.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more detailed investigations of errors, and in particular error timings (release time in a trial relative to the different events) could be informed better on the sources of errors.

Theoretically, following the current interpretation, trial aborts should peak at the time of DV encoding.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the proportion and timing of early/late error for all monkeys in Figure 1—figure supplement 1AB. They were not uniform but rather distinctive for each subject. The proportion of early errors differed across monkeys, but it was relatively consistent within each monkey. Most monkeys exhibited a pattern in which early errors increased over time, reaching a peak at about 0.7s or 1.8 s after cue onset; only one monkey (monkey TM) showed an increase in early errors immediately after cue onset. This was indeed comparable to the temporal dynamics of neuronal DV encoding (Figure 5). This suggests that early errors occurred primarily due to insufficient motivation rather than impulsive release of lever. In addition, the late releases did not always occur immediately after the end of the 1s-response window, suggesting that they were not due to extensions of slow reaction. Collectively, these results support the interpretation that errors are caused by insufficient motivation to respond correctly based on DV computation.</p><p>We report these data in the Results as follows:</p><p>“The proportion of early errors differed across monkeys, but was relatively consistent within each monkey (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Nine of ten monkeys exhibited a pattern in which early errors increased over time, reaching a peak at about 0.7s or 1.8 s after cue onset, while only one monkey (monkey TM) showed an increase in early errors immediately after cue onset. These results suggest that early errors were not rejection responses, but rather the consequence of insufficient motivation to make the correct response. In addition, the late releases did not always occur immediately after the end of the 1s-response window, suggesting that they were not due to extensions of slow reaction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). These results also support the interpretation that errors are caused by insufficient motivation to respond correctly.”</p><p>We also conducted analysis on type of error in inactivation session and reported as follows:</p><p>“Type of error (i.e., releasing too early or too late) was unaffected by inactivation (main effect of treatment, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26)</sub> = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Anterior dorsal regions of the caudate are known to control gaze.

Big picture reasons for these questions: it is important to consider this issue because the key claim is that dCDh neurons are encoding motivational (abstract) variables not motor/gaze variables.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we monitored eye movements only during inactivation and control sessions, but not during the recording, we are unable to provide direct evidence for the relationship between firing rate and gaze. Instead, we provided a time course of the probability of eye position within the cue area aligned by CUE and GO onset in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. Although we did not require the monkeys to fixate on the cue, they continued to look at the cue with similar temporal dynamics from onset to go, regardless of the reward condition. In addition, our data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A also shows a similar tendency of eye position during cue period, together supporting that the attribution of cue value does not have a significant or systematic effect on eye position. We propose to interpret our results as follows:</p><p>&quot;The DV relation was not likely to be a direct reflection of the eye movement or gaze variables, since the monkeys tended to look at cue location from cue to go signal regardless of rewarding condition (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide an account for what non-DV neurons are doing and plot average time courses for all groups of neurons. If possible, plot these and DV neurons' activity also aligned on saccades (gaze shifts to the cues).</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we plotted the average time course for non-DV coding neurons (n = 73) and DV-coding neurons (n = 27) (Figure 5EF). In non-DV coding neurons, discharge increased rapidly after CUE onset, then decreasing to the baseline level around the time of release (Figure 5EF, black). By contrast, in DV-coding neurons, discharges increased just before the appearance of cue, reached a peak about 1s after the cue onset, and then decreased after the release (Figure 5EF, red). As mentioned above, since we monitored eye movements only during inactivation experiments, we are not able to provide a plot of neuronal activities aligned on saccades. Because the monkeys tended to look at the cue position before cue onset and after release, the activity of non-DV coding neurons appeared to reflect mainly visual response, but was unlikely to reflect only eye movement. These different response profiles suggest that non-DV neurons might contribute to detection of cue appearance.</p><p>We added the time course plots and the possible contribution of non-DV neurons in the Results as follows:</p><p>“Non-DV coding neurons, on the other hand, did not change the effect size from 0 during the cue period, whereas it increased after the bar release (black curve, Figure 5C and D). Comparing the normalized activity of these two populations, whereas DV coding neurons showed an increase in activity toward the bar release, non-DV coding neurons showed a marked transient response to the cue (Figure 5E and F). Given that the monkeys tended to look at the cue location during cue period (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), the activity of non-DV coding neurons appeared to largely reflect visual response, but was unlikely to be evoked by eye movement. This suggests that non-DV coding neurons might have a role in detecting cue appearance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One may propose an alternative interpretation, that dCDh inactivation perturbs the integration of learned visual cues that have complex associations with reward contingencies, or for which the association is difficult to learn. The authors show interesting control data from a condition with only 4 cues for which there is no effect of inactivation on error rate (according to reward size or time in session). This controls at least for a pure cue recognition/perception deficit. But the learning of the cue-reward size/delay might be a problem. So, could the authors provide information on the learning stages for the different animals, for the main and control tasks, and in what order these tasks have been learned? This actually might be a follow-up point to the previous- error types time distributions and how they inform the causes of errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. The training order for two tasks was balanced between monkeys RI and ST: the delayed reward task was introduced first in monkey RI but the reward size task was first in monkey ST. We added Figure 8—figure supplement 1, displaying the performance of these tasks during the learning stage in the two monkeys. They initially showed error rate patterns independent of outcome value (gray), but following 2 to 2.5 months of training, they showed stable and reasonable patterns (yellow). There was no clear difference between the tasks in the number of days necessary to reach the criterion of ‘learned’ (stable error rate patterns in 5 consecutive days while providing better fit for the model R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9). These results suggest that the delayed reward task was not a particularly difficult task to establish the cue-outcome association compared to the reward size task. We added the above argument by referring to the supplement in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“The lack of change in the error rate pattern in the reward size task could be attributed to the relative ease of associating cues with outcome compared to the delayed reward task. However, no clear difference was evident between the two tasks in establishing the cue-outcome relationship as judged by the behavior during the training period (Figure 8—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For inactivation/disruption – show reaction time effects. Given the complexity of temporal discounting, provide analyses to show the effects of disruption on other task related behaviors. Consider basic measures such as trial initiation, anticipatory behaviors, etc. This will greatly strengthen claims of the &quot;specificity&quot; of effects.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ advice, we provided (a) reaction time data and performed additional analyses on (b) trial initiation and (c) anticipatory behaviors. We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments, as these additional data certainly strengthen our claim that dCDh inactivation is specific to temporal discounting.</p><p>a) Reaction time:</p><p>We provided the results of the effect of dCDh inactivation on reaction time (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). There was no significant effect of treatment on reaction time in two monkeys (two-way ANOVA, effect size of treatment: η<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.01, monkeys BI and RI) but a moderate effect of treatment in monkey ST (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.06). This is reported in Results.</p><p>b) Trial initiation:</p><p>We examined trial initiation time, which was defined as the duration from the reward of the previous trial to the time of lever grip to begin a trial, as a measure of motivation to start a trial. We previously demonstrated that the trial initiation time was significantly extended in the second half compared to the first half in intact monkeys, which suggested a satiation effect on the computation of motivational value (Fujimoto et al., J Neurosci 2019). Here, we measured the trial initiation time in 3 monkeys in the delayed reward task. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect of session period (1st vs 2nd, F(1,54) = 4.32, p = 0.042), but no effect of dCDh inactivation (1st vs 2nd × treatment, F(1,54) = 0.32, p = 0.57) on the trial initiation time, suggesting that there was no impact of inactivation on satiation effect. We added this in the Results section.</p><p>c) Anticipatory behaviors:</p><p>The proportion of early errors among total errors is a measure of anticipatory behavior. We confirmed that the type of error (i.e., releasing too early or too late) was unaffected by inactivation (main effect of treatment, F(1,26) = 1.07, p = 0.31).</p><p>We also measured the number of times the monkeys released the lever during the delay period. Even though the delay time was not shortened, the monkeys touched and released the bar several times during the delay period. This can be considered another measure of monkeys' expectation of a future reward. We confirmed that this anticipatory behavior during delay was unchanged by treatment (two-way ANOVA, treatment, F(1, 143) = 2.90, p = 0.09). The number of releases depended on reward condition (main effect of reward condition, F(5, 143) = 25.22, p &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant interaction with treatment (F(5, 143) = 0.42 , p = 0.83). We added this in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors mentioned that the activity correlating with DV is related to the process mediating outcome prediction and further the decision to act or not. Indeed, it would be interesting to see how the DV decoding behaves in completed versus aborted trials, to check whether there is any part of the variance explained by the decision to quit the current trial, or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important advice from the reviewers. We analyzed the effect of error/correct trials on the activity of DV-coding neurons using linear mixed model analysis, implementing mixed effects of slope and/or intercept to explain the data. This analysis was applied to 22 of the 27 DV neurons recorded in a session in which the monkeys made at least three error trials. As shown in the table (Figure 3—figure supplements 1), the majority of DV neurons (17 of 22) behaved differently between in correct and in aborted trials, supporting our interpretation that the activity of these neurons is related to processes that mediate outcome prediction and the decision to act or not. We reported these in the Results by referring to Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2, as follows:</p><p>“We postulated that the activity of DV-coding neurons may be related to the process mediating outcome prediction and further the decision to act or not. If this is the case, the DV coding neurons should behave differentially between correct and error trials. To test this, we performed linear mixed model (LMM) analysis on 22 of 27 DV-coding neurons recorded in a session in which the monkeys made at least three error trials. We found that the majority of DV-coding neurons (17 of 22) were modulated differentially by DV depending on whether the monkey performed correctly or not (Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2), supporting the idea that this population of neurons is involved in motivational processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second category of major critiques related to the role of dlPFC, and anatomical placement. All 3 reviewers suggest to downplay the idea that dlPFC is a crucial locus for delay discounting. dlPFC is a heterogenous structure and the over-emphasis in its modulating activity in dCDh (and DV) should be tempered. Relatedly, the tracing experiment for dlPFC projections to caudate (not performed in the monkeys as the inactivation) was deemed redundant and unnecessary, and could be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we minimized the idea that dlPFC is a crucial locus for delay discounting. Instead, we stated that the basal ganglia are the major candidate for motivational value computation and that dCDh can be a target region for motivational process with temporal discounting, as it receives convergent inputs from multiple prefrontal areas including DLPFC, ACC, and SEF, where neuronal information about size and timing of reward has been reported.</p><p>We also omitted the tracing results (original Figure1—figure supplement 2). We reorganized the Summary, Introduction and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally a note that the location of recorded cells appears more dorsal and medial than the inactivation sites, is worthy of discussion. There are also no data of recordings performed in the presence of inactivation. If authors have these data, it would be good to include them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the plot of muscimol inactivation sites including the data from two monkeys (Figure 7B) based on the estimated extent of muscimol diffusion, which is 4 mm in diameter according to previous studies (Martin and Ghez, J Neurosci Methods 1999; Yoshida et al., Neurosci Res, 1991). These show that inactivation sites appeared to cover the location of recorded cells (cf. Figure 1D).</p><p>We agree with the importance of showing recording data during inactivation, especially since DREADD inactivation is currently under development in monkeys. However, we did not make recordings during inactivation in this study. We have preliminary data of silencing neuronal activity using a similar experimental condition (i.e., using hM4Di-DREADD and DCZ). But this study focused on the neural mechanisms of time discounting, and did not go so far as to address this issue, and we hope to report this in a future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
