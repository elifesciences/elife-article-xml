In eukaryotes, photosynthesis is achieved by large membrane-embedded super-complexes, containing reaction centers and connected antennae. Here, we report the structure of the higher plant PSI-LHCI super-complex determined at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure includes 16 subunits and more than 200 prosthetic groups, which are mostly light harvesting pigments. The complete structures of the four LhcA subunits of LHCI include 52 chlorophyll a and 9 chlorophyll b molecules, as well as 10 carotenoids and 4 lipids.

With this energy, these organisms use carbon dioxide and water to create organic matter and release oxygen into the atmosphere. Therefore, photosynthesis plays a major role in providing the basis for life on earth.</p><p>During photosynthesis, molecules of pigments known as chlorophyll and carotenoid capture the light energy. These pigments are contained within large groups (or ‘complexes’) of proteins that sit in membrane structures within cells. Two of the protein complexes—called photosystem I and LHCI—interact with each other to form a ‘supercomplex’ that transfers energy to a small protein called ferredoxin. To achieve this, the light energy captured by pigment molecules is transferred to other pigment molecules so that the energy is funneled towards the center of photosystem I.</p><p>Mazor et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to create a very detailed three-dimensional model of photosystem I and LHCI from pea plants. The model shows how the twelve proteins of photosystem I are arranged in relation to the four proteins of the LHCI complex. The super-complex contains more than 200 other molecules, which are mostly chlorophylls and carotenoids. Of these, 61 chlorophyll molecules and ten carotenoid molecules are found in LHCI.</p><p>The model also provides detailed information about how the pigments interact with each other and with the proteins in the supercomplex. Mazor et al.'s detailed model may help us to understand how these interactions allow photosystem I to harvest light energy with almost 100% efficiency, and aid efforts to develop new technologies that harness light.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07433.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07433.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pisum Sativum</italic></kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd><kwd>light adaptation</kwd><kwd>non photochemical quenching</kwd><kwd>light harvesting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mazor</surname><given-names>Yuval</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation (ISF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borovikova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of higher plant PSI-LHCI complex reveals intricate details responsible for light harvesting.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxygenic photosynthesis, in which the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy by plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria, occurs, underpins the survival of virtually all life forms. By producing oxygen and assimilating carbon dioxide into organic matter, this process determines, to a large extent, the composition of our atmosphere and provides essential food and fuel. Light photons are captured by pigments in very large membrane–bound complexes and the excitation energy is utilized to form NADPH and ATP. Two reaction centers, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), drive this electron transport chain. PSII oxidizes water to produce oxygen and reduce membrane-embedded quinones. The reduced quinones are then utilized by the cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f complex to produce a proton gradient across the membrane and to reduce the small copper protein plastocyanin (PC), the electron donor of PSI. After an additional photon is absorbed by any of the 200 antenna pigments of PSI, its energy migrates through this large network of connected pigments and eventually oxidizes P700, a special chlorophyll pair located at the center of PSI. The electron removed from P700 by this oxidation event migrates along an internal electron transport chain and finally reduces ferredoxin (Fd), the final electron acceptor of PSI. Reduced Fd is utilized by several cellular pathways, mainly the reduction of NADP to NADPH. This NADPH and ATP generated by the thylakoid ATP-synthase complex powers the Calvin cycle to produce carbohydrates.</p><p>Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved over 3 billion years ago in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blankenship, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson, 2013</xref>). Later, approximately 1.5 billion years ago, the first photosynthetic eukaryotes appeared, eventually evolving into land plants roughly 0.5 billion years ago. The basic building blocks of photosynthesis are remarkably conserved. The architectures of both photosystems have been determined by numerous techniques, but X-ray crystallography has provided the most detailed structural information for the four large membrane complexes catalyzing oxygenic photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson and Ben-Shem, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson and Yocum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croce and van Amerongen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson and Junge, 2015</xref>).

This PSI preparation was limited to pea plants from the variety Alaska, and good crystals were hard to come by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amunts et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2010</xref>). Therefore, we screened for new robust crystals that are abundant, stable, and much more uniform. The new crystals could be obtained from several pea plants varieties, a large proportion of them diffracted to 3 Å with several yielding higher resolutions. In contrast to the P2<sub>1</sub> symmetry of the previous crystal, the current crystal belonged to higher symmetry space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>. The organization of the PSI unit within the new crystal was also markedly different.

Instead, the evolution of PSI is marked by the loss and gain of whole subunits from the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson and Junge, 2015</xref>). Compared to our previous model (PDB 2WSC), the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between the plant and cyanobacterial core (PDB 1JB0) decreased from 1.1 Å to 0.55 Å. The majority of the changes made in the core subunits involved the configuration of extramembrane loops, which now closely resemble the cyanobacterial configuration. The exceptions to this role are found at the anchor points of LHCI to the core (discussed below) and at the interfaces between plant-specific subunits, such as the PsaH–PsaL interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The dramatic change from trimer to monomeric organization that occurred in eukaryotes, was triggered by the addition of the PsaH subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</xref>). A new configuration for PsaH shows that this subunit binds four other core subunits. Starting from the stromal side of the membrane, the N-terminus is tightly tucked between the N-terminus of PsaD and a eukaryotic-specific loop in the PsaL subunit. PsaH then enters the membrane surrounding PsaL to prevent PSI trimerization and associates with PsaI and PsaB via mostly hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07433.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PsaH connects the state II and the PC binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PsaL is presented in blue, and the path of the PsaH subunit (red) travels through its extended, eukaryotic specific, loop.

Under state II conditions, PSI associates with a mobile pool of the LHCII antennae, which increases its absorbance cross-section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kargul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Bianchi et al., 2010</xref>). Genetic studies suggest that PsaH, PsaL, and PsaK play important roles in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Scheller, 2004</xref>). Electron microscopy studies have identified the binding site of the additional antennae complexes along the PsaL/PsaH-PsaK side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kargul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kouril et al., 2005</xref>). A new chlorophyll bound by PsaH was identified at the current resolution. This new chlorophyll, together with pigments bound by PsaL, probably participates in energy transfer into the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that PsaH is not simply a ‘landing pad’ for LHCII, but is also important for energy transfer into the core during state II. Additional pigments bound by PsaA in close proximity to subunit PsaK (the structure of which is now almost completely defined) provided the first accurate description of this binding site and suggest a mechanism for energy transfer into the core antenna through the PsaK side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>On the luminal side of the membrane, the new position of the N-terminus of PsaH suggests that this subunit also directly contributes to PC binding. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the eukaryotic PSI is the stable complex it forms with its electron donor PC, which results in a thousand-fold acceleration of the electron transfer rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bottin and Mathis, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Three elements make up the PC binding site: the first is a positive patch located along the helix-turn-helix N-terminal domain of PsaF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hippler et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</xref>). The second element is a hydrophobic patch composed of two parallel helices in PsaA and PsaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sommer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhlgert et al., 2012</xref>). The third conserved feature of the PC binding site is a PsaA luminal loop protruding from the generally flat luminal surface of PSI. This loop is found in both plants and cyanobacteria PSI; the only exception being sequences from marine <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> and their phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazor et al., 2012</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, the binding site of the cyanobacterial and plant complexes are similar. However, it is clear that the plant binding site is buried deeper in the complex, this is achieved by the extension of the PsaF N-terminal and by the new position of the N-terminus of PsaH, which forms a loop mirroring the conformation of the conserved luminal PsaA loop, suggesting a direct role for PsaH in PC binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Core antenna, red pigments, and excitation energy transfer</title><p>The PSI core is a highly efficient hub onto which diverse antennae systems connect such as phycobilisomes and IsiA-like assemblies in cyanobacteria and red algae and LHC type antennae in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engelken et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelson and Junge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wahadoszamen et al., 2015</xref>).

The existence of red-absorbing pigments (or ‘red traps’) is a general property of PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morosinotto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wientjes et al., 2012</xref>). These pigments affect the rate of trapping in PSI and can affect the path of excitation migration in the complex. Most of the eukaryotic red pigments have been shown to reside at LHCI. However, red pigments may be lost from the core complex during the isolation of LHCI. The first high-resolution PSI structure from thermophilic cyanobacteria revealed the organization of the core antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>). A stacked chlorophyll trimer supported by an extended loop in PsaB was the best candidate for one of the strong red absorbers in this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>). PsaB sequences from eukaryotes and many cyanobacteria lack this extended loop, resulting in this chlorophyll trimer being lost, as has been shown in the plant and mesophilic PSI structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amunts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazor et al., 2014</xref>). At the current resolution, we observed new core chlorophyll bound between PsaG and Lhca1 and a newly discovered lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This new chlorophyll restores the stacked chlorophyll trimer independent of the shortened PsaB loop and is responsible for one of the connection points between the core complex and the LHCI antenna, with a Mg–Mg distance of 12.5 Å between it and chlorophyll 1010 in Lhca1 (the nomenclature for LHCII is used to describe Lhcas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Standfuss et al., 2005</xref>]). On the stromal side of the membrane, an additional chlorophyll trimer first discovered in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is also responsible for an antenna attachment point with a Mg–Mg distance of 13.7 Å between the core chlorophyll A40 and chlorophyll 1005 in Lhca1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Lhca1 is the main connector for excitation transfer, harboring three chlorophylls that are within 14 Å of reaction center pigments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This close proximity ensures efficient and fast energy transfer. Surprisingly, Lhca3 is also one of the main connection points with two such pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The final excitonic connection between PSI to LHCI is located between chlorophyll J1302 bound by PsaJ and chlorophyll 2010 (A chlorophyll b molecule). The Mg–Mg distance of this pair is quite large (17.6 Å) however, since the gap between LHCI and PSI allows for some movement, this distance can change to provide an efficient link between the core and LHCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To summarize, the extremely fast and efficient energy transfer processes that typify PSI-LHCI occurs through only six pairs of pigment molecules located at three sites. These sites connect to the core antennae at the PsaG and PsaK poles through Lhca1 and Lhca3, with Lhca2 playing a relatively minor role.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The structure of the LHCI complex</title><p>Our structure includes the fully modeled LHCI belt with nearly complete structures of all four Lhca proteins.

On the stromal face of the membrane, the four conserved N-terminal domains connect each Lhca subunit to its neighbor through interaction with an Lhca-specific loop (loop 23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) that follows immediately after the second transmembrane helix and supports a new chlorophyll site (numbered 16) in Lhca4 and Lhca2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Lhca1, which interacts with PsaG in the core complex, completely lacks this loop and instead contains a short, positively charged linker in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). One of the major changes in the structure of LHCI is the reversal in the polarity of PsaG. While PsaG occupies roughly an equivalent position compared to previous PSI-LHCI structures, the first transmembrane helix contacts Lhca1 while the second one contacts PsaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Connections between each Lhca and the core are mediated by small regions immediately preceding the first transmembrane helix and are stabilized by salt bridges between negatively charged residues positioned at the membrane entrance point and a conserved arginine located at a helix turn below them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Additional Lhca–Lhca interactions are provided by a short C-terminal segment on the luminal side that binds helix 2 as it exits the membrane, mainly via hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07433.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lhcas connect to the PSI core through conserved structural elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A view from the stromal side of the membrane of LHCI.

The specific binding sites are identified in the current structure. At the PsaG pole of LHCI, helix C of Lhca1 interact<bold>s</bold> with the first transmembrane helix of PsaG. Additional protein–protein interactions occurred between a stromal loop of PsaB (aa 307–320) and the N-terminus of Lhca1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>The next contact point between LHCI and the core occurs between the N-terminus of Lhca4 and the C-terminus of PsaF, the conformation of which is almost identical to the conformation found in cyanobacteria. This interaction consists of hydrophobic patches surrounding charged residues in the membrane-buried regions of both proteins. This binding site should be shared between Lhca4 and Lhca5 and indeed, arginine 209 of PsaF and glutamate 84 of Lhca4 form electrostatic interactions in the middle of the hydrophobic binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This residue is conserved in Lhca5 as well, but absent from Lhca1-3 sequences, explaining the specificity of the interaction. The PsaF-Lhca4 interaction in the current structure does not include any pigments. Energy transfer from Lhca4 to the core probably occurs through the Lhca1-PsaB pigment cluster or the Lhca2-PsaJ clusters. Lhca2 is connected to the core almost exclusively through interactions with the N-terminus of PsaJ on the stromal side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The main contact point of Lhca3 is in the N-terminus of PsaA, which contacts a small patch just before helix 1 enters the membrane as in all other Lhcas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The structure shows that this site is the main determinant of Lhca binding to the core. In contrast to the previous PSI-LHCI model, Lhca3 follows the general fold of LHCII (rmsd 0.8 Å between the two apoproteins). Departures from the LHCII fold are seen in key contact points where small loops were extended or deleted from the otherwise conserved N-terminus domain to facilitate protein–protein interactions with the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Energy transfer and photo-protection mechanisms in Lhca1/4 Lhca2/3 heterodimers</title><p>All four Lhcas are remarkably similar to each other and to LHCII.

The extended loop 23 supports a new chlorophyll-binding site (numbered 16), common to Lhca4 and Lhca2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and an additional chlorophyll site, coordinated by transmembrane helix two, connects the two partners of each heterodimer.</p><p>Chlorophyll b pigments are bound by the different Lhca proteins to various extents and serve as antennae pigments. Four binding sites for chlorophyll b were detected in the high resolution structure of LHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Standfuss et al., 2005</xref>) as well as in the structure of CP29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). We were able to assign nine chlorophyll b sites in LHCI based on electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). All Lhca proteins contain a glutamine to glutamate change (similarly to CP29) in equivalent positions to position 131 of LHCII, this change makes the binding of Chlorophyll b less likely at three sites (10, 12 and 13). In agreement with this change we find that site 12 is occupied by chlorophyll a in all Lhcas and sites 10 and 13 are occupied differentially. The distribution of chlorophyll b sites in LHCI is markedly uneven, with three sites located in Lhca2 (2010, 2011 and 2013), two sites found at Lhca1 (site 1009 and 1010), three sites at Lhca4 (4010, 4011 and 4013) and a single site on Lhca3 (site 3011). These findings are consistent with mutational data which identified more chlorophyll b sites on Lhca2 then on Lhca3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castelletti et al., 2003</xref>). Site 13 on Lhca1, 2 and 4 is probably a mixed site, which can accommodate both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The high number of chlorophyll b pigments in Lhca2 and the fact that its closest connection to the core is mediated by chlorophyll b (site 2010, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) is consistent with our suggestion that Lhca1 and Lhca3 are the main junctions for excitation energy transfer from LHCI to the PSI core. The dipole orientations of all but two chlorophylls were identified in the current structure. The most significant changes in LHCI compared to LHCII exist in two sites, 2009 and 4009, where 90° rotations are observed. Such a rotation is expected to impact the energy transfer processes within these LHCI subunits but the significance of this change cannot be ascertained from the rotation alone.</p><p>Each of the two Lhca1/4 Lhca2/3 heterodimers contains a blue- and red-absorbing subunit. The structures of Lhca3 and Lhca4 clearly show a coordinating asparagine residue unique to this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnoux et al., 2009</xref>). The configurations of the pigments themselves differed, with the red pigments of Lhca3 and Lhca4 tilted approximately 12° relative to their orientation in LHCII, Lhca1, and Lhca2 due to a second change from a bulky leucine residue at position 64 of LHCII to glycine and alanine in Lhca3 and Lhca4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Additional connections that stabilize LHCI are formed by three luteins at position L3. These luteins bridge the chlorophylls at site 6 in Lhca1, Lhca3, and Lhca4 to PsaG, Lhca2, and Lhca1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthetic eukaryotes respond to high light conditions by decreasing the efficiency of energy transfer from the antennae in a process called NPQ. First discovered in the PSII complex, NPQ was recently reported in PSI.

A new chlorophyll site (numbered 17) coordinated by a histidine residue (histidine 150 in Lhca4 and histidine 170 in lhca3) is located at the heterodimer interface of both Lhca1/4 and Lhca2/3. Site 17 links the putative red chlorophyll pair with site 9 of the adjacent complex. In the Lhca1/4 interface, a new carotenoid site (numbered 4505 or L5) forms co-planar π systems (plane to plane distance 3.7 Å) with the ring of chlorophyll 4017, positioning it in a configuration that should provide efficient photo-protection from chlorophyll triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). We propose that this is also the site of NPQ in LHCI, and this fits well with the experimental observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Standfuss et al., 2005</xref>) that the zeaxanthin responsible for NPQ is located near the red pair in the PSI-LHCI luminal gap region.</p><p>In response to lumen acidification, zeaxanthin is synthesized from violaxanthin by violaxanthin deepoxidase (VDE) as part of the xanthophyll cycle.

At low pH, VDE is activated and binds the luminal side of the membrane, gaining access to its substrate. On the luminal side, a large gap (25 Å) separates LHCI from the core. This gap stems from the fact that most of the connections between LHCI and PSI are located at the stromal side (seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, also compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), leaving the luminal side open.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07433.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The surface electrostatic potential of PSI-LHCI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Luminal view of the electrostatic potential (red for negative and blue for positive charges) generated from PSI-LHCI apoproteins.

Under low light conditions, the relatively high luminal pH will result in strong repulsive forces between these negative patches and the acidic domain of VDE, preventing VDE from binding to PSI. Under high light, acidification of lumen, which is known to trigger VDE activity, will result in partial neutralization of these patches and allow VDE access to the PSI-LHCI gap regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnoux et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Approximately 200 g of leaves were ground for 25 s in a blender with 1000 ml of ice-cold solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 15 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8), 1 mM PMSF, 15 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin A. The slurry was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and chloroplasts pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 g for 9 min. The pellet was suspended in 500 ml of hypotonic medium (10 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8) to disrupt the chloroplasts. Thylakoids were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in 500 ml of buffer containing 10 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8) and 150 mM NaCl. The thylakoid membranes were then pelleted at 8,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in a minimal volume of STN2 buffer (0.4 M sucrose, 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8). The thylakoid concentration was adjusted to 3 mg of chlorophyll per ml and 0.4% n-dodecyl-α-D-maltoside (DDM) added. This concentration of detergent selectively extracts the ATP synthase, b6f, and PSII complexes. After 5 min incubation on ice, the detergent- treated thylakoid membranes were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 200,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of STN2 buffer, adjusted to 3 mg chlorophyll per ml, and stored at −80°C.</p><p>Frozen thylakoid membranes (20–25 ml) containing 3.0 mg of chl/ml were thawed in cold water and solubilized with 1.5% DDM. Insolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (DE-52, Whatman, Inc., 1.5 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with 15 mM Tricine-Tris (pH 8.0) containing 0.25% DDM. The column was washed with the same buffer and PSI eluted with a 0–230 mM tetraethylammonium chloride linear gradient (75 ml in each chamber) in 15 mM Tricine-Tris (pH 8.0) containing 0.25% DDM. Dark green fractions containing PSI were precipitated by 10% PEG6000 (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), followed by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 6 min. The pellet was dissolved in 15 mM Tricine-Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.05% DDM. The green solution was applied to a 10–35% sucrose gradient containing the same buffer and centrifuged using the SW-40 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at 37,000 rpm (170,000 g) for 16 hr. The wide green band containing PSI was collected and loaded onto a second DEAE-cellulose column (0.5 × 4 cm) pre-equilibrated with 15 mM Tricine-Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.05% DDM, mainly to concentrate it for a second sucrose gradient. PSI was eluted with 230 mM tetraethylammonium chloride. The collected dark green fraction was applied to a 10–35% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 57,000 rpm (330,000 g) for 4 hr using an SW-60 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Purified PSI appeared as a dark band in the middle of the tube, but only the central part of the band was collected. The material was precipitated with 15% PEG1500 and 100 mM tetraethylammonium chloride and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 4 min. The pellet was dissolved in a solution containing 2 mM Tricine (pH 8.75) and 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-D-thiomaltoside (DTM, Glycon Biochemicals, Luckenwalde, Germany) and adjusted to a chlorophyll concentration of 2.5 mg/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PSI crystallization and cryogenic protection</title><p>Crystallization was performed manually in 24-well plates using the sitting drop variant of the vapor-diffusion technique at 4°C (Charles Super Company, Natick, MA).

The large size of the crystals helped mitigate the effect of radiation damage, yet only 60°–90° of data were collected from each crystal using constant translation of the crystal in the beam. Images were integrated using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and scaled with XSCALE or AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>). Measurements were carried out at the peak of the iron fluorescence scan. Individual datasets generally had I/SIGMA values of ∼1 at 3.1 Å with CC1/2 values of ∼0.5 calculated by XDS. To obtain a more accurate measure of weak reflections, we combined several datasets measured under similar conditions. This combination was possible because of the consistency of the new crystals. The most effective method for combining datasets was to simply choose the sets with the strongest statistics at lower resolutions, and these crystals were also very similar to each other in terms of their unit cell dimensions. The unified datasets contained 40–100 independent measurements of each reflection with I/SIGMA of ∼1.5 at 2.8 Å and CC1/2 of ∼0.4 at the same resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The CCanomalous calculated by XDS or AIMLESS was ∼0.3 at 6 Å. Some individual datasets had measurable anomalous signals (CCanomalous &gt; 0.3) to 4.5 Å, but the final quality of phases was similar, as judged by the figure of merit for substructures from PHASER runs (typically ∼0.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>]) and visual inspection of the maps.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07433.016</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Data collection and refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07433.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07433.016</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Data collection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Beamline</td><td>BESSY PX14.1</td><td>SLS PXI−X06SA</td><td>ESRF ID 23-2</td></tr><tr><td>Wavelength (Å)</td><td>1.73</td><td>1.74</td><td>0.873</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>40−2.8 (2.85–2.8)</td><td>40−2.8 (2.85−2.8)</td><td>50−3 (3.1−3)</td></tr><tr><td>Space group</td><td>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></td><td>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></td><td>P2<sub>1</sub></td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Unit cell dimensions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>a, b, c (Å)</td><td>188.7, 200.8, 212.4</td><td>188.6, 201.3, 212.7</td><td>120.6, 189.2, 129.7</td></tr><tr><td>α, β, γ</td><td>90, 90, 90</td><td>90, 90, 90</td><td>90, 91.1, 90</td></tr><tr><td>Measured reflections</td><td>7,831,302</td><td>14,841,310</td><td>724,010</td></tr><tr><td>Unique reflections</td><td>198,911</td><td>200,218</td><td>116,039</td></tr><tr><td>Rpim (%)</td><td>0.051 (1.276)</td><td>0.030 (0.180)</td><td>0.099 (0.812)</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;I/σ(I)&gt;</td><td>10.5 (1.2)</td><td>13.4 (1.4)</td><td>5.8 (1.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness (%)</td><td>99.9 (98.4)</td><td>99.9 (98.4)</td><td>99.9 (99.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Redundancy</td><td>39.9 (37)</td><td>74.1 (33.4)</td><td>6.2 (5.4)</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Refinement statistics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>40−2.8</td><td>40−2.8</td><td>50−3</td></tr><tr><td>Rwork/Rfree</td><td>25.6/26.5</td><td>24/25.2</td><td>25.8/29.3</td></tr><tr><td>No. of chains</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>No. of ligands</td><td>214</td><td>214</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Average B-factor (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>98.7</td><td>112</td><td>96.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">R.M.S deviations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bond angles</td><td>1.9</td><td>2</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Bond lengths</td><td>0.004</td><td>0.005</td><td>0.011</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Ramachandran statistics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Favoured region %</td><td>90.2</td><td>90.2</td><td>86.6</td></tr><tr><td>Allowed region %</td><td>7.1</td><td>7.1</td><td>8.7</td></tr><tr><td>Outlier region %</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.7</td><td>4.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data collection, scaling and merging statistics were calculated using XDS, AIMLESS and PHENIX XTRIAGE.

This solution was used to place the three iron-sulfur clusters, which were subsequently used as the initial substructure for locating additional sites. These initial runs located approximately 40 sites of the 100 that were eventually modeled. Phases were improved using DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowtan, 1994</xref>), and the resulting maps showed most of the transmembrane helices of the reaction center with 11 transmembrane helices of LHCI (missing helix 2 of Lhca3). To improve the phases, information from the visible parts of the reaction center was incorporated as a partial MR solution. This model included the 22 transmembrane helices of PsaA and PsaB, the PsaC subunit, and chlorophyll rings, omitting all of the loops from the proteins. From the maps generated in this step, we proceeded to build the model using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and used the modified phases as restraints during refinement in either PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) or REFMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>). At various points during the refinement process, the phases were recalculated with the newly modeled sites using PHASER and including the improved model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Read and McCoy, 2011</xref>). Final runs identified 99 sites, 89 of them present in the model. The final model refined to an R-free of 25.2% with 3% Ramachandran outliers, a considerable decrease from previous values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Werner Kühlbrandt (Reviewing editor); Petra Fromme (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their 2.8 Å structure of pea PSI structure, the authors provide numerous new details of this massive membrane protein supercomplex. In a crystallographic tour de force, the diffraction data, obtained with a new, more highly symmetrical and better ordered crystal form, were phased by the weak Fe, S and P anomalous signal, resulting in a considerably more accurate structure. Overall, the structure is now largely identical to cyanobacterial PSI, although there are significant and important differences, in particular with respect to the functional connections to the 4 Lhca subunits, which are confined to plants.</p><p>New features of the 2.8 Å structure include more than 30 previously unidentified chlorophylls, a doubling in the number of resolved carotenoids, which are functionally important, and 4 lipids.</p><p>A chlorophyll that presumably plays a role in energy transfer from the antenna to the PSI core was newly identified in the plant-specific subunit H, and details of the interaction site with the electron carrier plastocyanin are resolved, as are the contact points with all 4 LHC1 complexes, with details of the pigments involved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be important to know how much of polypeptide sequence was actually traced compared to the previous 3.4 Å structure. How many side chain positions needed to be corrected?</p><p>2) An understanding of the energy transfer requires a consideration and discussion of the orientation of the dipole transition moments. If these are included, the manuscript gains considerably. How many chl orientations were unambiguously defined at 2.8 Å compared to the previous 3.4 Å structure?</p><p>3) How sure is the assignment of chlorophylls to chl a or b? Electron densities and omit maps of typical chls a and b should be shown as a supplementary figure.</p><p>4) The proposed mechanism for non-photochemical quenching in PSI is difficult to follow and should be spelt out more simply and clearly, and a schematic drawing to explain it should be added. What is the experimental evidence that the proposed mechanism is correct?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: explain in more detail how the model differs from the previous PSI structures.</p><p>In the subsection headed “Core antenna, red pigments and excitation energy transfer” and in the fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “Overall view”: is this really a “domain”? It looks like an N-terminal segment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07433.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It would be important to know how much of polypeptide sequence was actually traced compared to the previous 3.4 Å structure.

The complexity of the structure and the fact that the highly complex genome of <italic>Pisum Sativum</italic> is not available makes it difficult to ascertain the sequences of each subunit. However the available transcriptome covers all the sequences of PSI subunits. In case of more than one gene encoding single subunit we chose them according to the electron density.</p><p><italic>2) An understanding of the energy transfer requires a consideration and discussion of the orientation of the dipole transition moments. If these are included, the manuscript gains considerably. How many chl orientations were unambiguously defined at 2.8 Å compared to the previous 3.4 Å structure</italic>?</p><p>We have determined the orientation of all but two chlorophylls in the final model. Among them 5 chlorophylls in the core complex and 15 in the LHCI changed their orientation, compared to the previous PSI-LHCI structure. These facts are incorporated in the text.</p><p><italic>3) How sure is the assignment of chlorophylls to chl a or b? Electron densities and omit maps of typical chls a and b should be shown as a supplementary figure</italic>.</p><p>We have included an example of the electron density maps for chlorophyll b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), including a simulated annealing omit maps that clearly show the presence formyl-7 group of chlorophyll b.</p><p><italic>4) The proposed mechanism for non-photochemical quenching in PSI is difficult to follow and should be spelt out more simply and clearly, and a schematic drawing to explain it should be added. What is the experimental evidence that the proposed mechanism is correct</italic>?</p><p>The experimental evidences are given in references 25 and 44. We do not argue for or against NPQ in PSI. We merely point to the existence of a possible unique site at the luminal gap region of LHCI. In our view this unique site is interesting from the structural and probably functional aspects of LHCI subcomplex. We expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to better visualize the gap and the new pigment site, as well as a simple model to graphically illustrate our intent.</p><p>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>: explain in more detail how the model differs from the previous PSI structures</italic>.</p><p>The improved resolution led to a reversal in polarity of the PsaG subunit and we have added a figure to show this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). The position of PsaK was changed, probably due to different crystal contacts, resembling the cyanobacterial one. It points to the possibility that a Lhcb monomer can bind to PsaA in a similar fashion that Lhca1 binds PsaB. It demonstrates that PsaH binds to four different subunits that may be important attribute for the known stability of plant PSI. The position and orientation of many pigment molecules are now well defined.</p><p><italic>In the subsection headed “Core antenna, red pigments and excitation energy transfer” and in the fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “Overall view</italic>”<italic>: is this really a</italic> “<italic>domain</italic>”<italic>? It looks like an N-terminal segment</italic>.</p><p>We refer to three domains in the text: the helix-turn-helix N-terminal domain of PsaF, the N-terminal domain of Lhca/LHCII and the negatively charged domain of VDE. The N terminal domain of Lhca/LHCII is a highly conserved 30 amino acid stretch that folds similarly in the case of LHCII and in all four Lhcas and appears to be important for subunit interaction in all of these cases.</p></body></sub-article></article>
