contains a lipid-binding Pleckstrin homology and Tec homology (PH-TH) module connected by a proline-rich linker to a ‘Src module’, an SH3-SH2-kinase unit also found in Src-family kinases and Abl. We showed previously that Btk is activated by PH-TH dimerization, which is triggered on membranes by the phosphatidyl inositol phosphate PIP<sub>3</sub>, or in solution by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) (Wang et al., 2015, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06074">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06074</ext-link>). We now report that the ubiquitous adaptor protein growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) binds to and substantially increases the activity of PIP<sub>3</sub>-bound Btk on membranes. Using reconstitution on supported-lipid bilayers, we find that Grb2 can be recruited to membrane-bound Btk through interaction with the proline-rich linker in Btk. This interaction requires intact Grb2, containing both SH3 domains and the SH2 domain, but does not require that the SH2 domain be able to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues – thus Grb2 bound to Btk is free to interact with scaffold proteins via the SH2 domain. We show that the Grb2-Btk interaction recruits Btk to scaffold-mediated signaling clusters in reconstituted membranes. Our findings indicate that PIP<sub>3</sub>-mediated dimerization of Btk does not fully activate Btk, and that Btk adopts an autoinhibited state at the membrane that is released by Grb2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>immune signaling</kwd><kwd>Btk</kwd><kwd>B-cell</kwd><kwd>adaptor</kwd><kwd>Grb2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2429-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisen</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD020062-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iavarone</surname><given-names>Anthony T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 A1091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The adaptor protein Grb2 is able to enhance the activity of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Btk through a novel mechanism, revealing a new role for Grb2 in B-cell signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B-cell signaling relies on the sequential activation of three tyrosine kinases that transduce the stimulation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) into the generation of calcium flux and the initiation of signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiss and Littman, 1994</xref>). The first two kinases in the sequence of activating events are a Src-family kinase, Lyn, and a Syk/ZAP70-family kinase, Syk. The third kinase in this pathway is the Tec-family kinase Btk, which is critical for the development and proliferation of mature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rip et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scharenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukada et al., 1993</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Btk and Grb2 are integral to B-cell signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The B-cell signaling cascade relies on kinases and adaptor molecules.

The PH-TH module is connected through a proline-rich linker to a Src module, comprising an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The Src module of Btk is structurally similar to the corresponding modules of other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, such as c-Src, Lck, and Abl. In the autoinhibited form, the SH3 domain and the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain sandwich the SH2-kinase linker, and the SH2 domain sits adjacent to the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together these contacts prevent the kinase domain from adopting an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). The PH-TH module of Btk is connected to the Src module by a 44-residue linker that contains ten proline residues and two PxxP motifs that are potential SH3-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Little is known about the role of this linker, though other Tec-family kinases also contain at least one PxxP motif in this linker.</p><p>Crystal structures of the Btk PH-TH module, first determined by the late Matti Saraste and colleagues, reveal a dimeric arrangement, which we refer to as the “Saraste dimer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraldi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyvönen and Saraste, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mutagenesis of residues at the Saraste-dimer interface has shown that the PH-TH dimer is critical for Btk activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Btk is activated in vitro by vesicles containing PIP<sub>3</sub>, or in solution by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments on supported-lipid bilayers, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, have shown that PIP<sub>3</sub> in membranes promotes dimerization of the PH-TH module through binding to at least two sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is a ubiquitous adaptor protein that is important for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowenstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olivier et al., 1993</xref>). Grb2 consists of two SH3 domains that flank an SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Grb2 is responsible for bringing signaling enzymes to their substrates and also helps in the formation of signaling clusters at the plasma membrane by virtue of its ability to crosslink scaffold proteins or receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in the MAPK pathway, the SH3 domains of two Grb2 molecules bind to the Ras activator Son of Sevenless (SOS). Grb2 binds to scaffold proteins, such as SLP65 (also known as B cell linker protein, BLNK) in B cells and LAT (Linker for Activation of T cells) in T cells, through interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with phosphotyrosine residues on the scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reif et al., 1994</xref>). In this way, Grb2 recruits SOS to the scaffold proteins or receptors, and the interaction of one SOS molecule with two Grb2 molecules creates a bridge between scaffold proteins. In T cells, a protein closely related to Grb2, GADS (Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc), works together with Grb2 to crosslink scaffolding proteins and enzymes downstream of the TCR (T-cell receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Grb2 is also reported to be capable of dimerization, and dimeric Grb2 hinders basal signaling of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), thereby tuning the activity of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sandouk et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Memory-type B cells expressing membrane-bound IgG (mIgG) as a component of the BCR rely on an immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) motif that is phosphorylated by Syk and recruits Grb2 through binding of its SH2 domain to the resulting phosphotyrosine residues. It was shown, by fusing domains of Grb2 to the IgG tail (in the absence of the ITT motif), that the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 plays a critical role in generating downstream signals. Immunoprecipitation using the isolated N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 showed that this domain interacts with Btk, as well as with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl and the GTPase activator SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engels et al., 2014</xref>). Substitution of the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 by the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, or by the N-terminal SH3 domain of the Grb2 family member GRAP resulted in failure to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. In the mIgG fusion with the N-terminal SH3 domain of GRAP, Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was restored by the substitution of three residues in the GRAP SH3 domain by the corresponding residues in Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engels et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, an interaction between Grb2 and Btk plays a critical role in BCR signaling.</p><p>We now report the discovery, made using in-vitro reconstitution of Btk on PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing membranes, that Btk and Grb2 interact through the proline-rich linker of Btk, and that, through this interaction, Grb2 stimulates the kinase activity of Btk. The activation of Btk by Grb2 relies primarily on the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and does not require that the SH2 domain be able to bind to phosphotyrosine residues – we infer that the SH2 domain is free to interact with phosphotyrosine residues presented by scaffold proteins. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby the binding of one SH3 domain of Grb2 to the proline-rich linker of Btk disrupts Btk autoinhibition. Thus, the interaction between Grb2 and Btk can integrate the localization of Btk with its activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Btk recruits Grb2 to PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing supported-lipid bilayers through the proline-rich region of Btk</title><p>To probe the interaction between Btk and Grb2, we utilized a supported-lipid bilayer system that we had used previously to characterize the interaction of the isolated Btk PH-TH module with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Using this system we discovered, unexpectedly, that Grb2 can be recruited to the membrane via an interaction with membrane-bound full-length Btk. We had shown previously that the PH-TH module of Btk is recruited to membranes containing 4% PIP<sub>3</sub>, and that this recruitment exhibits a sharp dependence on PIP<sub>3</sub> concentration in the membrane.

When Btk and Grb2-647 were added together, Grb2-647 was recruited to the bilayer, as indicated by an increase in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When Grb2-647 was added to the supported-lipid bilayers without Btk there was no change in fluorescence above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These experiments indicate that Grb2 is capable of binding directly to Btk in the absence of other proteins.</p><p>We next addressed the question of which regions of Btk are necessary for the interaction with Grb2. To do this, we tethered various constructs of Btk to membranes containing DGS-NTA(Ni) (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl] (nickel salt)) lipids by using an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag on Btk, rather than relying on the binding of the PH-TH module to PIP<sub>3</sub>. Constructs of N-terminally His-tagged Btk could then be tethered directly to the membrane through the binding of the histidine tag to DGS-NTA(Ni) lipids. This tethering method has been shown to result in limited unbinding of the His-tagged protein over the timescale of our experiments (less than one hour) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nye and Groves, 2008</xref>). This allowed us to study the binding of Grb2 to constructs of Btk that do not contain the PH-TH module (see Materials and Methods for precise definition of the Btk and Grb2 constructs).</p><p>Supported-lipid bilayers containing 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) were prepared and His-tagged Btk constructs were added to these bilayers at different concentrations. Each of the following constructs was tested by adding Grb2-647 and monitoring the change in TIRF intensity at the membrane: full-length Btk, Btk in which the PH-TH module and proline-rich linker are deleted (SH3-SH2-kinase; residues 212–659 of human Btk), SH2-kinase (residues 281–659), the kinase domain alone (residues 402–659), and the proline-rich linker alone (residues 171–214). Grb2-647 is recruited to the bilayer when full-length Btk or the isolated proline-rich linker are tethered to the membrane. The tethering of other constructs to the membrane did not show an intensity change above background upon addition of labeled Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We confirmed that the observed fluorescence change was not due to an irreversible process, such as protein aggregation, by showing that the increase in fluorescence could be reversed rapidly by addition of unlabeled Grb2 at a fivefold higher solution concentration than labeled Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>An alternative, plausible mechanism for Grb2 recruitment to Btk is interaction between the SH2 domain of Grb2 and a phosphotyrosine residue on Btk. However, the Btk constructs used in these experiments were expressed using a bacterial system in which co-expression of a tyrosine phosphatase is expected to maintain the proteins in the unphosphorylated state, despite the presence of the Btk kinase domain in some of the constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeliger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed that full-length Btk was not phosphorylated using western blot analysis with a pan-phosphotyrosine antibody. Additionally, we did not observe any phosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry, ruling out that the interaction depends on an SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that the proline-rich linker of Btk is able to recruit Grb2 to the membrane, without the other domains of Btk being present. No binding is detected to constructs that lack the PH-TH module and the proline-rich linker. We conclude that the proline-rich linker is a principal determinant of the interaction between Btk and Grb2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Grb2 enhances the kinase activity of Btk</title><p>Btk is activated by PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing vesicles, as shown by experiments in which the phosphorylation of full-length Btk was monitored by western blot with pan-phosphotyrosine antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Phosphorylation of this segment by Btk plays a key role in the activation of PLCγ2 in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozdener et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodriguez et al., 2001</xref>). This peptide segment was fused to an N-terminal SUMO protein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (referred to as the PLCγ2-peptide fusion) to allow for visualization on a gel, as the substrate is otherwise too small to analyze by western blot. A protein in which the SUMO tag was cleaved is also included.

We included an additional Grb2 construct, R86K, in which a conserved arginine residue in the SH2 domain that is critical for phosphotyrosine binding is mutated to lysine. Substitution of the corresponding arginine residue by lysine in other SH2 domains attenuates the binding of the SH2 domains to phosphorylated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayer et al., 1992</xref>).

The Grb2 variant in which the ability of the SH2 domain to bind to phosphopeptides is impaired (Grb2 R86K) stimulates the reaction to essentially the same extent as wild-type Grb2, indicating that the phosphopeptide-binding ability of the Grb2 SH2 domain is not required for stimulation of Btk activity by Grb2. This observation suggests that Grb2 bound to Btk will retain the capacity to dock on phosphorylated scaffold proteins via the SH2 domain, as discussed below. Removal of any of the three component domains of Grb2 results in substantial reduction of phosphorylation of the PLCγ2-peptide fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Grb2-Y160E shows a reduction in the PLCγ2-peptide fusion phosphorylation by Btk, compared to the wild-type Grb2.

This indicates that the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is more important for the interaction with Btk, consistent with the earlier finding that fusion of the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 to mIgG is sufficient for promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the activation of Btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engels et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Grb2 does not affect dimerization of Btk on the membrane</title><p>Btk activity is stimulated by homodimerization of the PH-TH modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Given this, it is possible that Grb2 could promote activation by crosslinking two Btk molecules. This would be similar in mechanism to the recent findings that show activation of Btk through dimerization of HIV Nef (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2022</xref>). To check whether Grb2 impacts the dimerization of Btk we measured the diffusion coefficient and the dwell time of Btk on the membrane in the presence or absence of Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Although there is no simple relation connecting two-dimensional diffusion and molecular complex size as there is for three-dimensional diffusion, two-dimensional diffusion on a membrane surface nonetheless changes markedly between monomers and dimers and is a sensitive measurement of dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaizuka and Groves, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knight and Falke, 2009</xref>). If Grb2 increases the population of Btk dimers, we would expect to see a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of individual complexes on the membrane in the presence of Grb2. If Grb2 increases the affinity of Btk for the membrane, this would be manifested as an increase in Btk dwell time, the time that single molecules of Btk stay at the membrane, through a reduction in off-rate.</p><p>To enable site-specific labeling of full-length Btk we used unnatural amino acid incorporation of an azido-phenylalanine (AzF) group on the surface of the kinase domain of Btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 2002</xref>). AzF enables the use of an azide-reactive dye to label the protein and eliminates non-specific labeling at other sites (see Materials and Methods for details). Several sites were tested, and incorporation of AzF at position 403 (Thr 403 in wild-type Btk) showed the best yield of labeled Btk. Thr 403 is a surface-exposed sidechain in the N-lobe of the kinase domain, and we do not anticipate that incorporation of AzF at this position will disturb the structure of Btk. For all data utilizing fluorescent full-length Btk, the construct used is Btk T403AzF labeled with azide reactive Cy5 (Btk-Cy5).</p><p>The surface density of Btk-Cy5 on the membrane was observed to increase when the solution concentration of unlabeled Btk was increased from 0 nM to 20 nM, in the presence of very low concentrations of Btk-Cy5 (500 pM-1 nM). This enables the monitoring of single molecules of Btk-Cy5, which was done either in the presence of Grb2 at 50 nM bulk concentration, or without Grb2. From each sample, step-size distributions were compiled from the single-molecule trajectories to assess the various time-dependent components to Btk diffusion on the membrane. Step-size distributions generally required fitting to three components, while two-component exponential fits were sufficient for fitting dwell time. Both with and without Grb2, the fastest of the three diffusion constants decreases with increasing Btk concentration, indicative of a transition from monomeric to dimeric Btk. The presence of Grb2 does not change the diffusive behavior of Btk at any of the concentrations used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is supported by the same trend observed through dwell time measurement: overall dwell time increases with increasing Btk concentration, but Grb2 has no influence on this change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The decrease in the Btk diffusion constant with increasing solution concentration of Btk is consistent with what is observed for the Btk PH-TH module at these concentrations, confirming that full-length Btk interacts with the membrane in the same way as does the Btk PH-TH module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). These experiments show that Grb2 does not change the dynamics of membrane-bound Btk, either through changes in the dimer population or changes in the membrane affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Grb2 can recruit Btk to clusters of scaffold proteins</title><p>We studied how the ability of Grb2 to bind to Btk might impact the localization of Btk on the membrane, by monitoring the interaction of Btk with the scaffold protein LAT on supported-lipid bilayers. LAT is similar to the B-cell scaffolding protein SLP65/BLNK. Our use of LAT, rather than SLP65/BLNK, was predicated on our extensive prior work with LAT on supported-lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koretzky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>LAT signaling clusters can be generated from minimal components on supported-lipid bilayers. Bilayers containing 4% DGS-NTA(Ni) were prepared with both LAT and the Src-family kinase Hck tethered to the membrane through His-tags. LAT was phosphorylated by Hck, as described previously, before other components were added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>). The diffusion constants for phosphorylated LAT and Hck are similar to those for the lipids under these conditions, indicating lack of clustering on their own. Upon the addition of Grb2 and the proline-rich region of the Ras activator SOS (SOS-PRR), the phosphorylated LAT undergoes a protein-condensation phase transition and forms gel-like domains of protein-rich areas in which LAT no longer diffuses freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>). This phase transition is thought to be analogous to the formation of LAT signaling clusters in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganti et al., 2020</xref>). Using this system, we checked whether Btk could be recruited into the reconstituted LAT clusters through its interaction with Grb2.</p><p>Single molecules of Btk-Cy5 were tracked and used to compile step-size distributions that reflect the diffusive behavior of Btk under a given condition: the shorter the step-sizes, the slower moving the Btk molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). When Btk was incubated with phosphorylated LAT alone the step-size distribution shows a fast diffusing population, similar to that observed for Btk alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Addition of Grb2 shifts the step-size distribution to shorter steps, suggesting two possible situations. One possibility is that Grb2 is able to simultaneously bind Btk and LAT, thus slowing Btk molecules through an additional anchor point to the membrane (via the Grb2-LAT complex). The second possibility is that Grb2 alone has promoted small LAT condensates that are not immediately visible by eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2021</xref>), creating small domains of dense LAT, within which Btk cannot diffuse freely. The addition of SOS-PRR along with Grb2 induces the full phase transition of the phosphorylated LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The step-size distribution shifts even further left under this condition, suggesting that Btk has been trapped within the LAT dense phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that Btk was not able to bind SOS-PRR directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest that Btk is likely to be tethered to the phosphorylated LAT molecules through binding of the SH2 domain of Grb2 to phosphotyrosine residues on LAT and binding of the SH3 domains of Grb2 to Btk. This interaction leads to recruitment of Btk into the LAT condensate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Btk can be recruited to scaffold proteins through interaction with Grb2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of predicted mechanism for Btk recruitment into LAT signaling clusters.

We show that Grb2 can bind to and enhance the kinase activity of Btk in the presence of PIP<sub>3</sub>. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 could bind to Btk through interaction with mIgG tails and SLP65 and thereby potentiate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engels et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosaki and Tsukada, 2000</xref>). Here we show that detectable activation of Btk by Grb2 only occurs when the PH-TH module of Btk engages PIP<sub>3</sub> at the membrane. Thus, Grb2 activation of Btk is layered upon a necessary first step of PIP<sub>3</sub> generation, which requires BCR stimulation. Enhanced activation of Btk results in increased phosphorylation of Btk itself as well as phosphorylation of the PLCγ2-peptide fusion.</p><p>One interesting aspect of our findings is the apparent need for Grb2 dimerization, without any change in the dimerization propensity of Btk upon Grb2 binding. The idea that Grb2 dimers are necessary comes from the observation that the Y160E mutation, a mutation thought to abolish Grb2 dimers, results in much less enhancement of Btk catalytic activity. Additionally, the requirement for all Grb2 domains to be present for full enhancement of catalytic activity of Btk also supports this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The crystal structure of Grb2 (PDB code 1GRI) shows the formation of a Grb2 dimer in which there are extensive interactions between the SH3 domains of one Grb2 molecule and the SH2 domain of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maignan et al., 1995</xref>). Deletion of the SH2 domain would disrupt the dimeric arrangement seen in the crystal structure. One straightforward way that Grb2 dimers could promote Btk activity is through promoting the formation of Btk dimers, thereby promoting trans-autophosphorylation of Btk. Nevertheless, we observe that the population of Btk dimers on PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing bilayers remains the same in the presence of Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It is possible that our diffusion measurements are not sensitive enough to detect Grb2 enhancement of Btk dimerization, and further study is required to understand the role of Grb2 dimerization on the activation of Btk.</p><p>We propose that Grb2 could activate Btk by first binding the proline-rich linker of Btk and subsequently displacing the Btk SH3 domain through binding of the SH2-Kinase linker, then releasing the inhibitory contacts within the Src module of Btk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This speculation is based on how Src-family kinases are activated by binding of the SH2-kinase linker by HIV Nef protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aryal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moarefi et al., 1997</xref>). We demonstrate that Btk kinase activity increases with the addition of Grb2 only with simultaneous availability of PIP<sub>3</sub>, which is an important point because Grb2 is a ubiquitous protein that is highly expressed in many cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). This ensures that the Btk signal remains responsive to activation of the B-cell receptor.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Grb2 enhances Btk activation at the membrane.</title><p>Our data are consistent with a model in which PIP<sub>3</sub> binding at the membrane is not sufficient for full activation, and Btk is still able to maintain some autoinhibition after membrane recruitment. Upon recruitment of Grb2 to the proline-rich linker of Btk, the second Grb2 SH3 domain is able to bind the SH2-kinase linker of Btk and displace Btk’s SH3 domain, resulting in full release of autoinhibition. Here we are showing Grb2 as a monomer, however, as discussed, it is possible that Grb2 is binding Btk as a dimer as well.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82676-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>By looking directly at Btk phosphorylation in the presence of Grb2 in our reconstituted system, we reveal an additional consequence of Grb2 binding – Grb2 binding can recruit Btk to signaling clusters at the membrane. In particular, the increased phosphorylation by Btk that we observe for a segment of PLCγ2 in the presence of Grb2 shows how Grb2 binding of Btk could have a direct impact on the downstream signaling of Btk, subsequently increasing the population of active PLCγ2 molecules at the membrane. In the absence of Grb2, Btk activation is slow, even when PIP<sub>3</sub> levels are high and can promote dimerization. In the presence of Grb2, Btk phosphorylation proceeds much more rapidly. This work illuminates a new level of regulation within Btk, in which optimal signaling may rely on interaction with an adaptor molecule that both stimulates activity and facilitates localization with downstream substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeliger et al., 2005</xref>). Transformed cells were first grown in a 200 mL Terrific broth containing 100 µg/mL kanamycin and streptomycin overnight culture at 37 °C. This was then split into 6 L of Terrific broth containing 100 µg/mL kanamycin and streptomycin and grown to an optical density of 1–1.5 at 37 °C. The cultures were mixed 1:1 with new media and antibiotic at 4 °C and 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and maintained at 4 °C to grow overnight. After overnight expression, the cultures were spun down and resuspended in 15–30 mL of Ni A buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 20 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol). These were then flash frozen and kept at –80 °C until the next step of the purification.</p><p>Cell pellets were thawed and then lysed by homogenization or sonication with addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

The column was then washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni A buffer, followed by four CV Ni B buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 500 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol). The elution fraction was then loaded onto a desalting column equilibrated in Buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5% Glycerol). The protein peak was collected and incubated with His-tagged ULP1 protease overnight at 4 °C.</p><p>After SUMO cleavage, the sample was run over a second HisTrap column, and this time the flow through and wash were collected. In some cases, a gradient of imidazole was applied as the Btk PH domain has some affinity for the Ni column even in the absence of the His tag.

UFC9010 or UFC9030, respectively) to less than 2 mL total volume. This was then loaded onto an HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (Cytiva) column equilibrated in Buffer A for biochemistry or Buffer B (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 5% Glycerol) for imaging studies. Fractions containing the purest target protein were collected and concentrated.

All constructs that did not contain a kinase domain were transformed into BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> without the YopH plasmid, and therefore they were grown with only kanamycin. Expression for these constructs was carried out overnight at 18 °C. Grb2 constructs and PLCγ2-peptide fusion express at much higher levels than the Btk constructs and therefore only 1–2 L were prepared at a given time, and therefore no overnight culture was required prior to protein expression.

Grb2 constructs and SOS-PRR each contain a TEV site and therefore His tagged TEV protease was used to remove the His tag.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein fluorescent labeling by maleimide conjugation</title><p>Grb2 and SOS-PRR were each prepared at a concentration of 50 µM and incubated with 5 mM DTT for 30 min on ice to ensure all accessible cysteines were reduced. AlexaFluor 647 C<sub>2</sub> Maleimide (Thermo Fisher, A20347) or AlexaFluor 555 C<sub>2</sub> Maleimide (Thermo Fisher, A20346) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO and added in equimolar amounts to Grb2 or threefold molar excess to SOS-PRR and incubated at room temperature (approximately 22 °C) for 30 min or at 4 °C overnight, depending on the stability of the protein. The reaction was then quenched with 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes at 4 °C. After quenching, the protein was diluted in 10–15 mL fresh buffer, and then concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (Millipore Sigma), allowing free dye to be removed in the flow through. This process was continued until no more free dye could be easily detected in the flow through. At this point the protein was then purified by gel filtration in Buffer B as described above. Labeling efficiency was calculated based on the absorbances at 280 nm and the peak excitation wavelength for the dye, taking into account dye contribution at 280 nm. A note about Grb2 labeling: the protein tends to aggregate when exposed to an excess of dye, and therefore we favored under labeling by only providing equimolar amount of dye.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Protein fluorescent labeling by azido phenylalanine incorporation</title><p>For site specific labeling of full-length Btk for single-molecule studies, we used unnatural amino acid incorporation of an Azido phenylalanine (AzF) residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bard and Martin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 2002</xref>). An amber codon (UAG) was introduced at the desired labeling position in the plasmid for Btk expression, and it was ensured that the stop codon for this gene was not amber. This plasmid was co-transformed into BL21(DE3) containing a plasmid expressing YopH with the pUltra-pAzFRS plasmid. A 5 mL starter culture was grown overnight in TB at 37 °C from this transformation. This was used to inoculate 1 L TB the following morning which was grown to an optical density between 0.5 and 1 at 37 °C. This culture was spun down and resuspended in 167 mL cold (4 °C) TB containing 2 mM 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine HCl (Amatek Chemical Co., CAS no. 33173-53-4) before induction, this culture was allowed to grow for 1.25 hr at 4 °C. The culture was then induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown overnight at 4 °C. After this, protein purification proceeded as normal until just before the gel filtration step, except that all reducing agents were left out of the buffers. Yield of the protein is drastically reduced, however for our applications a low yield was not a problem as long as labeling was feasible.</p><p>For labeling, the purified protein was concentrated to about 300 µL. 5 mM 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent) was prepared in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mM KCl, 5% glycerol. DTNB was added at 15 X molar excess to the protein solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The protein was then cooled back to 4 °C and 300 µM dibenzocyclooctyl (DBCO)-Cy5 (Click Chemistry Tools, Catalog no. A130) was added from a 30 mM stock in DMSO. This was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched with 5 mM DTT and incubated at 4 °C for 1 hr. At this point the labeled protein was purified by gel filtration, then concentrated to an appropriate concentration, flash frozen and stored at –80 °C.

These components were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then diluted 1:1 in activation buffer (20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM sodium vanadate). These were mixed and the reaction proceeded at room temperature for the designated amount of time, indicated for each blot separately. The reaction was then quenched by mixing 1:1 with Quench buffer (166 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 3 µM bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mM EDTA). These samples were then immediately heated at 90 °C for 15 min, followed by loading onto two 12 or 15% SDS page gels, which were run at 250 V for 35 min. One gel was stained with Coomassie blue, the second was prepared for a western blot transfer.</p><p>Filters were soaked in western blot transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 192 mM glycine) supplemented with 0.1% SDS. The membrane was activated in MeOH for 1 min and then transferred to western blot transfer buffer supplemented with 20% MeOH. The protein was transferred in a semi-dry apparatus to the membrane at 25 V for 1 hr. This membrane was then blocked in 5% Carnation non-fat milk powder for one hour while shaking gently. To probe for phosphotyrosine, the membrane was then transferred to a 1:2000 dilution of Phospho-Tyrosine Mouse mAb (pTyr-100) (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9411) for shaking overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the membrane was washed four times for 10 min each in TBS-T (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). The membrane was then transferred to a secondary antibody solution containing a 1:5000 dilution of Anti-Mouse HRP linked antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 7076) for 1 hr of shaking at room temperature. The membrane was then washed again four times for 10 min each in TBS-T. At this point the blot was imaged with Western Bright ECL HRP Substrate (Advansta, catalog no. K-12045-D20).</p><p>Blots were quantified using Fiji (ImageJ). Each lane of the gel was selected with a rectangle and Fiji Analyze Gels option. The lanes were then plotted and a linear baseline was marked. Any peaks in close proximity were separated with a vertical line. The wand tool was then used to select the peak area. These intensities were then plotted. In the case where a 0 timepoint was recorded, or if a titration of Grb2 was being assessed and a point with no Grb2 was added was recorded, these were used as baseline to define a change in intensity for the remaining samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). It should be noted that this technique is only semi-quantitative as the intensity may not be linear with phospho-tyrosine concentration; these graphs are provided as a tool to compare trends rather than exact values.

For experiments with full-length Btk (no His tag) 4% PIP<sub>3</sub>, 96% DOPC mixtures were prepared. For experiments using His-tagged Btk constructs 4% DGS-NTA(Ni), 96% DOPC mixtures were prepared. And for experiments involving LAT 4% PIP<sub>3</sub>, 4% DGS-NTA(Ni), 92% DOPC bilayers mixtures were prepared. All lipids were stored in solution with chloroform, except PIP<sub>3</sub> which was stored in powder form and dissolved in a solution of 1:2:0.8 Chloroform:Methanol:Water just before use. After mixing, the solution was dried in an etched 50 mL round bottomed flask by rotary evaporation for 15 min and then under nitrogen for 15 min. Dried lipids could then be kept overnight at 4 °C, sealed from air or used immediately.</p><p>The lipids were rehydrated in water to 1 mg/mL lipid concentration by vortexing. Single unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were created by sonication (Analis Ultrasonic Processor 750 watt, 20 kHz) of the lipids at 33% power, 20 s on, 50 s off for 1 min 40 s of active sonication. A solution of 0.25 mg/mL SUVs in 0.5 X TBS was prepared. These were added to a Sticky Slide VI 0.4 (Ibidi GMBH) attached to a Piranha-etched glass slide, 80 µL of SUVs per well. The SUVs were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Each well was then washed with 1 mL of Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS) under vacuum, being careful to avoid introduction of air bubbles to the chamber. When using DGS-NTA(Ni), the wells were then incubated with 100 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min, and again washed with 1 mL HBS. At this point, the wells were blocked with either 1 µg/mL Poly(L-Lysine)-PEG (PLL-PEG) for 1 min, or 1 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) or β-Casein for 10 min. The blocking agent for each experiment was optimized by checking the mobile fraction of surface-bound particles. In the case of full-length Btk on 4% PIP<sub>3</sub> bilayers, 1 µg/mL PLL-PEG yielded the best results. For LAT containing bilayers, 1 mg/mL BSA was used to block. For all other experiments, 1 mg/mL β-Casein yielded the best results.</p><p>For experiments where DGS-NTA(Ni) lipids were used to coordinate His-tagged protein to the bilayers, the protein was added at the desired incubation concentration and left at room temperature for 40 min. The chambers were then washed with 600 µL HBS gently by hand and incubated for 20 more minutes at room temperature. They were then again washed with 600 µL HBS. Finally, they were washed with 100 µL imaging buffer containing 100 µg/mL BSA or β-Casein (depending on the blocking agent that was used initially) and 10 mM BME in HBS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Total internal reflection fluorescence adsorption experiments were carried out and collected on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with 100 x objective and Andor iXon electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Oxford Instruments), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>).

Movies were recorded at exposure time of 20 ms, magnification of ×1.5 on ×100 objective, and laser power of 20 mW. Five or more traces of 500–600 frames were collected at various places across the sample.</p><p>Fluorescent molecules in these movies were tracked using the TrackMate plugin from Fiji (Image J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Particles were identified using the difference of Gaussian detector. Tracking parameters were kept consistent across experiments, 0.5 µm diameter spot size, threshold of 100 (determined by visual inspection), particle links determined using simple linear assignment problem tracker, with linking distance maximum of 1.5 µm, a maximum frame gap of 2, and maximum gap distance of 1.5 µm. An immobile fraction of fluorescent Btk was always observed, and this fraction was included in the analysis and showed minimal change across samples. Tracks were analyzed by calculating a step-size distribution for all tracked particles. In order to ensure that step size was sufficiently long compared to the camera pixel size, we calculated the step-size distribution for four different time delays (every 2 frames, 3 frames, 4 frames, and 5 frames). To prevent over-counting, these data were drawn from skips within the original dataset.

The LC system contained the following modules: G1322A solvent degasser, G1311A quaternary pump, G1316A thermostatted column compartment, and G1329A autosampler unit (Agilent). The LC column compartment was equipped with a Zorbax 300 SB-C8 column (length: 150 mm, inner diameter: 1.0 mm, particle size: 3.5 µm, part number: 863630–906, Agilent). Acetonitrile, formic acid (Optima LC-MS grade, 99.5+%, Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA), and water purified to a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm (at 25 °C) using a Milli-Q Gradient ultrapure water purification system (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to prepare LC mobile phase solvents. Solvent A was 99.9% water/0.1% formic acid and solvent B was 99.9% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (volume/volume). The elution program consisted of isocratic flow at 1% (volume/volume) B for 2 min, a linear gradient to 35% B over 30 min, a linear gradient to 95% B over 1 min, isocratic flow at 95% B for 5 min, a linear gradient to 1% B over 1 min, and isocratic flow at 1% B for 21 min, at a flow rate of 120 µL/min. The column compartment was maintained at 40 °C and the sample injection volume was 10 µL. External mass calibration was performed in the positive ion mode using the Pierce LTQ ESI positive ion calibration solution (catalog number 88322, Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to running samples. Full-scan, high-resolution mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode over the range of mass-to-charge ratio (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>)=340–1800 using the Orbitrap mass analyzer, in profile format, with a mass resolution setting of 60,000 (at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>=400, measured at full width at half-maximum peak height). In the data-dependent mode, the ten most intense ions exceeding an intensity threshold of 10,000 raw ion counts were selected from each full-scan mass spectrum for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis using collision-induced dissociation (CID). MS/MS spectra were acquired using the linear ion trap, in centroid format, with the following parameters: isolation width 3 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> units, normalized collision energy 28%, default charge state 3, activation Q 0.25, and activation time 30 ms. Real-time charge state screening was enabled to exclude unassigned charge states from MS/MS analysis. To avoid the occurrence of redundant MS/MS measurements, real-time dynamic exclusion was enabled to preclude re-selection of previously analyzed precursor ions, with the following parameters: repeat count 2, repeat duration 10 s, exclusion list size 500, exclusion duration 60 s, and exclusion mass width ±10 parts per million. Data acquisition was controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0.7, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw data files were searched against the amino acid sequences of the Btk, Grb2, and His<sub>6</sub>-Sumo-eGFP-Plcg2 proteins using Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.3, SEQUEST algorithm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), for tryptic peptides (i.e. peptides resulting from cleavage C-terminal to arginine and lysine residues, not N-terminal to proline residues) with up to two missed cleavages and carbamidomethylcysteine, dehydrocysteine (i.e. cystine), methionine sulfoxide and phosphotyrosine as dynamic post-translational modifications.

critical immune cell kinase, Btk, by the SH3-SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb2. The authors convincingly demonstrate that Grb2 binding to a Pro-rich region positioned between the Btk PH-TH domains and Src module plays a crucial role in relieving Btk autoinhibition and mediating Btk recruitment into signaling clusters on artificial membranes. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the clusters previously reported in cells, and resolve in part why Btk can be activated via modes distinct from its close relatives, such as Itk kinase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82676.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01b6kha49</institution-id><institution>Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.25.505243">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.25.505243v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Amy Andreotti as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The review process revealed weaknesses in the manuscript. While the reviewers appreciate the novelty and potential importance of the findings, there is a strong consensus that the manuscript as submitted must be revised. The data in this paper are not sufficiently robust and the manuscript is not as well written as would be expected of an <italic>eLife</italic> publication. The concern is that, as presented, the authors provide potentially interesting and novel insights, but the data are not interpreted in a manner that yields a definitive advance in our mechanistic understanding of BTK regulation and the precise role of Grb2. In line with the magnitude of the changes sought, we anticipate the reviewers will be further consulted on the revisions.</p><p>1) All reviewers highlighted that antibodies towards specific pTyr sites would be most appropriate as a read-out of phosphorylation because the pan-pTyr antibody could detect ambiguous/off-target signals. Repeating with specific pTyr antibodies is essential.</p><p>2) The variability between duplicate experiments limits robust interpretation throughout the manuscript; it is essential that further independent repeats are performed to ensure the findings are robust.</p><p>3) Figure 6. Further negative control experiments are required: with labeled Btk lacking its PH-TH-PRR domains, immobilised on the membrane with a His tag, as they have done in other experiments; and with the pTyr-binding deficient SH2 domain mutant of Grb2.</p><p>4) There are suggestions from all 3 reviewers for how the data presentation and writing of the manuscript might be improved. A number of important points relating to data interpretation should also be considered in revision; the novel findings are of interest but data are currently insufficient to support the authors' claims. Extensive editing of the manuscript is required; in its current form, it would not be acceptable for publication.</p><p>5) The authors should resolve the discrepant pTyr data in Figure 3 vs 5 Supp2, and present a more complete picture of the analysis of diffusion constants in Figure 5, including estimations of error.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3. The authors need to perform sufficient replicates to confidently argue that Grb2 directly stimulates Btk activity. Whilst the two replicates of Btk autophosphorylation are relatively convincing, the data supporting stimulated substrate phosphorylation are not.</p><p>Since substrate phosphorylation should be directly influenced by activation loop autophosphorylation of Btk, these two readouts should be mutually consistent.</p><p>Furthermore, an inspection of the change in Btk autophosphorylation in Figure 3 panel C is not consistent with that reported for the same time point (5 min) in panel A, suggesting that the authors suffer from a lack of reproducibility in these experiments.</p><p>Figure 4. Again, insufficient replicates are reported to support the authors' claims. In particular, the assertion that Grb2 increases activity of the SH3-SH2-kinase module is based on a single time point (5 min) with two measurements, as the error bars of the other time points overlap between the conditions with and without Grb2. Furthermore, the authors do not observe any significant difference in substrate phosphorylation, which would be an expected consequence of activation loop autophosphorylation.</p><p>Figure 5. Missing error bars for diffusion coefficient in panel A (presumably these were the averages of multiple particle tracks?). Again, insufficient replicates for B-C. The conceptual problem here: the authors have designed what they say is a rescue experiment to test whether Grb2 can 'rescue' autophosphorylation of a mutant of Btk impaired in its dimerization on the membrane. However, an inspection of their data reveals no visible defect in Btk autophosphorylation between the wt and mutant proteins (Figure 5 Supplement 2). Furthermore, in order to compare wt with mutant Btk, one would need to know whether the level of Btk phosphorylation detected is sub-stoichiometric or not. Otherwise, Btk may already be maximally phosphorylated with just PIP3-liposomes and an effect of Grb2 would not be detectable. The authors should also comment on why Grb2 is phosphorylated in these experiments, but not in those experiments reported in Figure 3. In the text, the authors reference Figure 3 Supplement 2 as evidence for Grb2 phosphorylation, when in fact there is no sign of Grb2 phosphorylation, and a signal for Grb2 phosphorylation is only found in Figure 5 Supplement 2.</p><p>Figure 6. To address the concerns with the interpretation of the data presented in this figure, it is recommended to the authors that they perform a negative control experiment with labeled Btk lacking its PH-TH-PRR domains, immobilised on the membrane with a His tag, as they have done in other experiments. The diffusion properties of Btk SH3-SH2-kinase bound to DGS-NTA(Ni) vs full-length Btk bound to PIP3 should be comparable. This control experiment will address whether the reduction in Btk mobility the authors observe is specific to its Grb2-dependent recruitment into LAT condensates, or, whether the condensates create physical barriers to Btk diffusion on the membrane.</p><p>The text is unnecessarily long and repetitive, as well as confusing in places, and contains a number of factual errors. The cartoon schematics in multiple figures are often not representative of the experiment being performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specifically, I recommend:</p><p>1. In the abstract, the authors have included a citation for another study. This is highly unconventional and I recommend removing it.</p><p>2. In schematics, the component domains are not always labelled. There's a great deal of assumed knowledge in doing so, but this does not allow the work to be interpreted by a generalist audience, such as <italic>eLife</italic>'s readership.</p><p>3. In the introduction, the Saraste dimer is introduced but the orientation/arrangement of domains is not described or depicted in a way that a non-expert would be able to interpret. The dimer is not shown at all in Figure 1 but should be.</p><p>4. Line 110. Crosslinking suggests a covalent linkage. I urge the authors to reconsider their choice of language.</p><p>5. Greater clarity on labelling methods in the Results and Discussion would aid interpretation both where TIRF is first mentioned and later where Amber UAA methods are used. In both instances, it would be helpful to the reader to state clearly that these studies use recombinant proteins and a synthetic membrane as a reductionist approach to studying the system. Greater clarity over the residues captured in the constructs and which component domains are in use, and why, would also be helpful. The reader is instructed to see methods for detail, but the detail is limited to a tabulated list of constructs. The authors do not specify important details in places, such as why general pTyr antibodies are used for the detection of phosphorylation and which sites are actually being detected by this approach.</p><p>6. I encourage the authors to eliminate as much repetition as possible. Some repetition may be important for underscoring important points, however, in many instances, it can leave the reader wondering why the point was restated and whether there is a new idea that they have missed.</p><p>7. It would be helpful for the authors to consider precision during revision. For example, the authors state &quot;much more&quot; rather than detailing quantitatively the increase in the latter two paragraphs of page 12.</p><p>8. Page 16- what is the impact of the UAA introduction on Btk catalytic activity? What sites were tried and excluded because of yield? There is value in presenting those that didn't work as supplemental data and to illustrate why T403 was considered a success by showing the relative yield on a gel. Why is a 3-component model fit chosen? What are the 3 components?</p><p>9. Figure 5 – why are the two pTyr blots not shown as a single blot, rather than as 2 panels from the same blot?</p><p>10. End of page 20 – why has the pTyr SH2 domain mutant Grb2 proteins not been tried in the LAT system? It seems to me that the possibility raised in the conclusion could be easily tested with the tools at the author's disposal.</p><p>11. Figure 6. 3 delay times are presented and it is not clear why they were chosen. The legend says multiple delay times were used, although it would be more precise to state what exactly they were.</p><p>12. Ideas and speculation could be written in a more economical way such that the key messages are more clearly focused.</p><p>13. The authors should revise the methods with consideration to whether sufficient detail is presented for another researcher to repeat the work. Currently, the absence of information on vendor, catalog numbers (e.g. for lipids, AzF, antibodies, ULP1 protease), shaking speed, buffer compositions for chromatographic steps, concentrations of antibiotics, speed of centrifugation steps, what room temperature is, what an &quot;appropriate concentration&quot; means, how immunoblot transfers were performed and what type of membrane, and so on, prevents a reader from being able to replicate the work if desired.</p><p>Authors appear to be compliant as there is no new code or dataset that needs to be deposited in a repository.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82676.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers highlighted that antibodies towards specific pTyr sites would be most appropriate as a read-out of phosphorylation because the pan-pTyr antibody could detect ambiguous/off-target signals.

We have also modified our method for quantifying blots to allow for more careful selection of baseline/background intensity, and this method is detailed in the revised Materials and methods section. In addition, we have chosen to explicitly show which intensities correspond to which replicate. This ensures that any comparison made across conditions can be carefully made within each replicate. Although the absolute intensities vary across replicates, the relative intensities are similar. We have also updated the text to reflect that we are making conclusions based on the observed trends and not the intensity values themselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6. Further negative control experiments are required: with labeled Btk lacking its PH-TH-PRR domains, immobilised on the membrane with a His tag, as they have done in other experiments; and with the pTyr-binding deficient SH2 domain mutant of Grb2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have opted to look at Btk diffusion in the presence or absence of condensed LAT to assess the effect of condensation on Btk diffusion, and we believe the necessary controls have been included to ensure that the change in diffusion is due to condensation and not some other source. Although Btk lacking the PH-TH-PRR domains immobilized via a His tag is a possible additional control, we believe this construct may present additional complications that are beyond the scope of this work. For example, control of the density of His tagged proteins relative to one another on 4% DGS-NTA (Ni) containing supported lipid bilayers has proven to be tricky and sometimes unpredictable. By providing Btk as an additional His tagged protein with LAT and Hck, it may be challenging to ensure that the density of each of these species (and Btk itself) has been maintained. Because the properties of LAT phase transition are highly dependent on LAT density and phosphorylation, we believed this change would make it difficult to compare non-His tagged Btk to His-tagged Btk. However, this could prove a useful tool for future studies after extensive characterization. Prior work has probed the diffusion of LAT itself during condensate formation and it was shown to display very similar overall behavior to what is observed here for Btk across our different conditions <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=14313397&amp;pre=&amp;suf=&amp;sa=0&amp;dbf=0">(Sun et al., 2022).</ext-link> Prior work has shown that Grb2 R86K is unable to induce LAT condensation and therefore we do not think this would be a particularly useful experiment <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=13014056&amp;pre=&amp;suf=&amp;sa=0&amp;dbf=0">(Lin et al., 2022).</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are suggestions from all 3 reviewers for how the data presentation and writing of the manuscript might be improved.

To limit discussion to the most robust results, we have decided to remove the Western blot data concerning the effects of Grb2 on the Src module of Btk (lacking the PH-TH-PRR modules). We found that the change in signal as a result of Grb2 addition is minimal for this construct, and considerably more experimentation would be required to draw reliable conclusions.

Additionally, we have updated our representation of these data by showing each replicate separately. We believe this is a better way to represent the data and makes it easier for the reader to interpret. Alternative detection techniques may be more appropriate, but we opted to focus on PLC<italic>γ</italic>2-peptide fusion phosphorylation as we believe this is the most direct measure of Btk catalytic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. Again, insufficient replicates are reported to support the authors' claims. In particular, the assertion that Grb2 increases activity of the SH3-SH2-kinase module is based on a single time point (5 min) with two measurements, as the error bars of the other time points overlap between the conditions with and without Grb2. Furthermore, the authors do not observe any significant difference in substrate phosphorylation, which would be an expected consequence of activation loop autophosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we agree that these data are inconclusive and have opted to remove it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. Missing error bars for diffusion coefficient in panel A (presumably these were the averages of multiple particle tracks?). Again, insufficient replicates for B-C. The conceptual problem here: the authors have designed what they say is a rescue experiment to test whether Grb2 can 'rescue' autophosphorylation of a mutant of Btk impaired in its dimerization on the membrane. However, an inspection of their data reveals no visible defect in Btk autophosphorylation between the wt and mutant proteins (Figure 5 Supplement 2). Furthermore, in order to compare wt with mutant Btk, one would need to know whether the level of Btk phosphorylation detected is sub-stoichiometric or not. Otherwise, Btk may already be maximally phosphorylated with just PIP3-liposomes and an effect of Grb2 would not be detectable. The authors should also comment on why Grb2 is phosphorylated in these experiments, but not in those experiments reported in Figure 3. In the text, the authors reference Figure 3 Supplement 2 as evidence for Grb2 phosphorylation, when in fact there is no sign of Grb2 phosphorylation, and a signal for Grb2 phosphorylation is only found in Figure 5 Supplement 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Error bars representing standard deviation have been added for all diffusion coefficients, and explanation of how the fits were obtained has been expanded in the Materials and methods.</p><p>The data pertaining to the dimerization-deficient Btk has been removed, we agree that further characterization would be necessary to carefully interpret these data.</p><p>As stated above, the apparent phosphorylation of Grb2 is an artifact of the antibody we were using, Phospho-Tyrosine Mouse mAb (pTyr-100) (Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9411). This is shown in Figure 3 – Supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6. To address the concerns with the interpretation of the data presented in this figure, it is recommended to the authors that they perform a negative control experiment with labeled Btk lacking its PH-TH-PRR domains, immobilised on the membrane with a His tag, as they have done in other experiments. The diffusion properties of Btk SH3-SH2-kinase bound to DGS-NTA(Ni) vs full-length Btk bound to PIP3 should be comparable. This control experiment will address whether the reduction in Btk mobility the authors observe is specific to its Grb2-dependent recruitment into LAT condensates, or, whether the condensates create physical barriers to Btk diffusion on the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in point (3) of the essential revisions above, we do not believe these controls are necessary for the conclusions we are making here, and there are technical reasons that make some of these controls. However, we do believe that further study along these lines would be exciting future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text is unnecessarily long and repetitive, as well as confusing in places, and contains a number of factual errors.

Greater clarity on labelling methods in the Results and Discussion would aid interpretation both where TIRF is first mentioned and later where Amber UAA methods are used.

Greater clarity over the residues captured in the constructs and which component domains are in use, and why, would also be helpful. The reader is instructed to see methods for detail, but the detail is limited to a tabulated list of constructs. The authors do not specify important details in places, such as why general pTyr antibodies are used for the detection of phosphorylation and which sites are actually being detected by this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Materials and methods have been updated in greater detail, and further detail for these sections has been included in the Results and Discussion.

Page 16- what is the impact of the UAA introduction on Btk catalytic activity? What sites were tried and excluded because of yield?

Why is a 3-component model fit chosen? What are the 3 components?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not assess the catalytic activity of the UAA introduction on Btk catalytic activity. T20AzF and H620AzF were also attempted for purification and labeling. Although these variants could be purified, we were concerned that mutation at T20 may have an impact on membrane association (this construct was originally designed for a different purpose), and the H620AzF had more of a tendency to aggregate on supported lipid bilayers.</p><p>Initially 3 components were chosen based on the idea that Btk should have at least two diffusive species (monomer and dimer) and fluorescently labeled Btk tends to aggregate on membranes, resulting in a third population that is essentially immobile. After fitting, our data suggest that the monomer and dimer populations cannot be clearly distinguished by this method, and instead there seem to be two very slow-moving populations, one of which is probably the immobile particles. Three components are the lowest number of distributions necessary to fit the data, however, more sophisticated statistical techniques would be needed to assess whether we are over or underfitting with this number of components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
