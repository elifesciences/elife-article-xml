(<bold>pegRNA</bold>), an extended version of a standard guide RNA (<bold>gRNA</bold>) that both specifies the intended target genomic sequence and encodes the desired genetic edit. Here, we show that sequence complementarity between the 5’ and the 3’ regions of a pegRNA can negatively impact its ability to complex with Cas9, thereby potentially reducing PE efficiency. We demonstrate this limitation can be overcome by a simple pegRNA refolding procedure, which improved ribonucleoprotein-mediated PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos by up to nearly 25-fold. Further gains in PE efficiencies of as much as sixfold could also be achieved by introducing point mutations designed to disrupt internal interactions within the pegRNA. Our work defines simple strategies that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of PE.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene editing</kwd><kwd>protein delivery</kwd><kwd>RNA structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM134069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weiting</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Jing-Ruey Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG009490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petri</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hyunho</given-names></name><name><surname>Joung</surname><given-names>J Keith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201808210354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Junyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>417577129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petri</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005294</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hassenfeld Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Jing-Ruey Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strategic pegRNA designs and other approaches mitigating 5' and 3' interactions within pegRNAs can often lead to substantial improvements in prime editing efficiency.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PE is a versatile gene-editing technology that enables programmable installation of any nucleotide substitution and small insertions/deletions without requiring a DNA donor template or the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2020</xref>). It utilizes a Cas9 nickase (nCas9)-reverse transcriptase (RT) fusion protein called PE2 and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Like a gRNA, the pegRNA directs nCas9 to the target DNA site specified by the 5’ spacer sequence. The non-target DNA strand nicked by nCas9 then anneals to a complementary primer binding site (PBS) at the 3’ end of the pegRNA. Subsequently, the adjacent reverse transcriptase template (RTT) also encoded in the pegRNA is reverse transcribed by the PE2 RT generating a 3’ DNA ‘flap’ that encodes the desired edit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>).

To do this, we compared the mutation frequencies induced by SpCas9 with matched pairs of pegRNAs and standard gRNAs (i.e. lacking the PBS and RTT 3’ extensions) targeting the same spacer sequences. We performed these comparisons in one-cell stage zebrafish embryos by injecting Cas9 protein complexed with equimolar concentrations of either pegRNAs or gRNAs targeting six different endogenous gene loci. To quantify indel frequencies induced at these sites, we extracted genomic DNA from embryos one day following injection and performed targeted amplicon next-generation sequencing (NGS). We found that across all six target spacer sites, lower indel frequencies were observed with pegRNAs than with their matched gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that the presence of the 3’ extension in a pegRNA decreases Cas9-induced gene editing.</p><p>One potential explanation for the lower Cas9 activities we observed with pegRNAs compared with standard gRNAs is that interactions between complementary sequences in the 5' spacer and 3' PBS and RTT might cause misfolding of pegRNAs in a way that decreases their abilities to complex with Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).This possibility seemed likely given that previous work has shown that even shorter length internal interactions between bases in standard gRNAs can stabilize alternative non-functional folding and low SpCas9-induced mutation efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Thyme et al., 2016</xref>). To test our hypothesis, we used a previously described in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Thyme et al., 2016</xref>) that assesses the abilities of various gRNAs (and, in this case, pegRNAs) to complex with Cas9 protein. In this assay, various matched pegRNAs and gRNAs targeted to endogenous zebrafish gene spacer targets compete with a gRNA targeting an <italic>EGFP</italic> reporter gene sequence for complexation with Cas9 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The degree of successful competition by a given gRNA or pegRNA can be assessed by measuring cleavage of an <italic>EGFP</italic> target DNA site substrate included in each reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Using this assay, we compared matched gRNAs and pegRNAs targeted to four different genomic DNA sites, <italic>gpr78a, adgrf3b</italic>, <italic>cacng2b</italic> and <italic>gpr85</italic> and found that in all four cases the gRNAs could efficiently compete with the <italic>EGFP</italic>-targeted gRNA for binding to Cas9 (as judged by reduced cleavage of the <italic>EGFP</italic> DNA target site template), whereas the pegRNAs were substantially and significantly reduced in this capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). To test whether this reduced Cas9-binding capability of the pegRNAs might be caused in part by their 5’ vs 3’ complementarity, we performed additional in vitro experiments with matched pegRNAs in which we introduced three point mutations in the 3’ PBS region of the pegRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>) and found that these mutated pegRNAs showed significant increases in their competitive Cas9-binding activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>).</p><p>Having determined that pegRNAs may suffer from reduced binding to Cas9 protein, we next considered whether refolding the pegRNAs could improve their Cas9 binding capabilities. We considered this hypothesis because it has been previously shown that refolding low-activity gRNAs believed to have alternative folding configurations can significantly improve their abilities to mediate Cas9-induced indels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Thyme et al., 2016</xref>). We found that subjecting pegRNAs to a refolding procedure consisting of heat denaturation followed by slow cooling (Materials and methods) significantly improved their abilities to bind Cas9 in the in vitro DNA cleavage competition assay (although not to levels observed with matched standard gRNAs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). Consistent with this, we also observed that re-folding of pegRNAs prior to formation and injection of pegRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes into zebrafish embryos also increased Cas9-mediated indel frequencies by up to 2.8-fold for four of the seven target sites tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated whether refolding the pegRNAs would also increase PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos. For this experiment we used 17 pegRNAs from our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petri et al., 2022</xref>) that were designed to introduce various types of mutations (base substitutions, insertions, or deletions) and that had exhibited a range of PE efficiencies from barely active to the best performers. We found that refolding prior to embryo injection significantly increased the frequencies of pure PE (defined as the alleles containing only the pegRNA-specified edits without any other mutations) frequencies for nine of these 17 pegRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Significant increases were observed with seven of 12 pegRNAs designed to introduce base substitutions (increases ranging from 2.6- to 24.7-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and 2 of 3 pegRNAs designed to create insertion pegRNAs (increases ranging from 1.7- to 4.6-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We did not observe significant increases in PE efficiencies with the two pegRNAs designed to induce deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), perhaps due relatively lower degree of complementarity between the 5’ spacer and 3’ RTT because of the deletion encoded in the latter region. In general, increases in pure PE frequencies due to re-folding were accompanied by significant increases in non-pure PE frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>) and therefore PE purity values (defined as the percentage of pure PE edits out of total edits) did not show significant differences for most of the pegRNAs we assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). The only exceptions were two <italic>scn2b</italic> substitution pegRNAs that actually showed significantly improved PE purities with re-folding and the <italic>cacng2b</italic> deletion pegRNA that showed significantly reduced PE purity with refolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Improving prime editing efficiencies in zebrafish by pegRNA refolding and mutations in RTT.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Pure PE frequencies of non-refolded and refolded substitution pegRNAs (<bold>a</bold>) and insertion or deletion pegRNAs (<bold>b</bold>) with PE2 in zebrafish.

Specifically, we explored the effects of creating mutations at the +1,+2, or +3 positions of the RTT (+1 defined as the first nucleotide just 5’ to the first nucleotide of the PBS and +2 and+3 being further upstream within the pegRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) on PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos. To do this, we introduced RTT + 1,+2, or +3 mutations into three pegRNAs that each mediated low PE frequencies even after re-folding (0.39–2.33%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and that each encoded a single nucleotide substitution edit (encoded at RTT positions + 5 or+6). Following re-folding, complexation with PE2, and injection into zebrafish embryos, we found that pegRNAs harboring mutations at the RTT + 1 and+2 positions could make PE more efficient than their unmutated pegRNA counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Based on these results, we introduced a mutation at the RTT + 2 position in five additional pegRNAs specifying a single edit and found that the mutation increased mean pure PE frequencies in all five cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Three of the five mutated pegRNAs showed statistically significant increases in pure PE frequencies and two of these three pegRNAs also showed significant increases in non-pure PE frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Overall, a mutation at the RTT + 2 position increased pure PE frequency up to 6.7-fold (mean 2.4-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). PE purity was unchanged except for one pegRNA (<italic>cacng2b</italic>) that showed a modest but statistically significant increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Testing of three re-folded pegRNAs harboring the RTT + 2 mutations showed that they all induced higher indel frequencies with SpCas9 nuclease in zebrafish embryos than matched re-folded pegRNAs without the RTT + 2 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the +2 mutations function to enhance the abilities of these pegRNAs to form functional complexes with Cas9 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work delineates and validates two simple and general strategies for improving the efficiency of PE that can be readily practiced by any investigator. Delivery of PE components as RNP complexes offers multiple potential advantages relative to DNA or RNA delivery (e.g. increased efficiency, reduced off-target effects, and avoiding risk of integration events; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Raguram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kanchiswamy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Svitashev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ponnienselvan et al., 2023</xref>) and we show that combining pegRNA re-folding with the introduction of point mutations at the RTT +1 or+2 position can increase RNP-induced pure PE frequencies by as much as 29-fold in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our previous results showing that RNP-mediated PE functions in both zebrafish embryos and cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petri et al., 2022</xref>) suggest that these simple strategies should likely improve PE in other settings such as human and other cell types as well. The introduction of RTT mutations to reduce pegRNA 5’ and 3’ complementarity can also be used when practicing PE technology using non-RNP-delivery methods such as DNA or RNA transfection, transduction, and/or injection. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2022</xref> have reported that introducing additional mutations in the RTT +1 to+3 positions can also enhance PE efficiency in human cells via DNA transfection. One important consideration in using the RTT mutation strategy is to ensure that the additional change introduced is either silent (if in a coding region) or otherwise benign in its effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Corroborating our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ponnienselvan et al., 2023</xref> recently reported that 3’ truncated pegRNAs are preferentially loaded onto Cas9 and the prime editor protein, potentially due to reduced pegRNA 5’–3’ interactions. Although beyond the scope of this current work, it will be interesting to explore whether pegRNA re-folding and/or RTT mutation might be combined with other previously described strategies for improving PE efficiencies (e.g. adding various structured RNA motifs to the 3’ termini of pegRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nelson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhang et al., 2022</xref> or PE proteins with improved architectures and activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nelson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our findings also have more broad implications for both the design of pegRNAs and the range of genomic spacer sequences that can be targeted by PE for recognition and editing. Previous work has shown that the length and base composition of pegRNA PBS and RTT sequences can influence PE efficiency for any given target spacer site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ponnienselvan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Our work adds another parameter (internal complementarity between the 5’ spacer and 3’ PBS/RTT regions of the pegRNA) to be considered as one designs and tests various combinations to optimize PE activity. Accounting for this additional consideration may impact the nature of spacer sequences that can efficiently be targeted (e.g. higher GC content and/or melting temperature may actually be undesirable) and the length and composition of PBS/RTT sequences that can be used. We envision that the generation of larger datasets of optimized pegRNAs and consideration of all the parameters that can influence pegRNA activities (including internal complementarity) may yield improved rules and software for in silico design in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Production of gRNAs and pegRNAs</title><p>The gRNAs and pegRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) used in this work were synthesized by in vitro transcription.

The authors test how two simple changes impact PE efficiency: first, by refolding the pegRNA before complexing with Cas9 nickase-reverse transcriptase PE2, and second, by introducing mutations to the pegRNA intended to reduce its autoinhibitory activity by disrupting complementarity between the 5' spacer sequence and the 3' PBS-RTT (Primer Binding Site-Reverse Transcriptase Template).</p><p>Strengths: The authors tested multiple loci in the zebrafish genome to determine how pegRNA refolding and point mutations in the RTT would impact overall mutagenesis efficiency and precise PE at the target sites. The impact on efficiency was tested with three types of pegRNAs designed to introduce base substitutions, insertions or deletions. Next-generation sequencing of amplicons from pooled, injected embryos provided robust measurement of mutagenesis and editing. Insertion and deletion pegRNAs were overall more efficient than substitution pegRNAs, which may be useful information in considering experimental design strategy for introducing a specific variant. There is potential for further improvement by combining the authors' methods with previously published strategies to improve pegRNAs through design and chemical modification.</p><p>Weaknesses: The observed increases in the frequency of precise PE were relatively minor and inconsistent across the multiple pegRNAs tested. The substitution pegRNAs showed very low precise PE, at levels less than 1 percent, therefore the fold changes reported were still representative of 10 percent or less of overall edits. Overall mutagenesis frequency, as measured by indel formation, increased along with increased precise PE. The approach produces highly genetically mosaic embryos, therefore the utility for transient studies in injected zebrafish embryos is unclear. Data on improved germline transmission frequency of precise PE alleles would strengthen the study and be of wide interest in the zebrafish community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90948.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Prime editing is a major gene editing technique because it allows for the introduction of all possible substitutions, as well as small insertions and deletions, without causing double strand breaks. However, its efficiency is often limited. In a previous study, the authors showed that prime editing could be performed in zebrafish using recombinant PE2 protein and pegRNAs generated by in vitro transcription, but at many of the sites tested, gene editing efficiency remained relatively low.</p><p>In this current paper, the authors find that when pegRNAs were combined with Cas9, many induced much less indels than their corresponding guide RNAs and propose that this is due to the complementarity between the 5' and 3' regions of pegRNAs. Two methods aiming to reduce the resulting circularization of pegRNAs were next shown to increase the efficiency of prime editing: a slow refolding protocol (which was previously shown to be useful for inefficient guide RNAs), and the introduction of a substitution at position +2 of the reverse transcriptase template sequence. The data obtained and analyzed is solid and convincing.</p><p>These methods are remarkably straightforward and proved beneficial for most of the pegRNAs tested. Consequently, they represent important advances for the prime editing technique.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that despite these advances, prime editing activity remained relatively low for a significant proportion of pegRNAs tested (with less than 2% sequencing reads exhibiting the expected sequence change). This shows that further improvements are still needed for this important gene editing technique.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90948.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Weiting Zhang et al., improved the editing efficiency of prime editor by reducing misfolded pegRNA interactions, and the improvement of efficiency for prime editor helped to expand its application range.
