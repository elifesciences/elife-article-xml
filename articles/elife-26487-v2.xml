essential processes is a successful strategy to combat enemies. Remarkably, the clinically important <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) use this tactic to spread in nature. SaPIs reside passively in the host chromosome, under the control of the SaPI-encoded master repressor, Stl. It has been assumed that SaPI de-repression is effected by specific phage proteins that bind to Stl, initiating the SaPI cycle. Different SaPIs encode different Stl repressors, so each targets a specific phage protein for its de-repression. Broadening this narrow vision, we report here that SaPIs ensure their promiscuous transfer by targeting conserved phage mechanisms. This is accomplished because the SaPI Stl repressors have acquired different domains to interact with unrelated proteins, encoded by different phages, but in all cases performing the same conserved function. This elegant strategy allows intra- and inter-generic SaPI transfer, highlighting these elements as one of nature’s most fascinating subcellular parasites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26487.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many harmful microbes can produce different molecules that make them more effective in causing and spreading diseases. These molecules can also be obtained from ‘mobile genetic elements’ that can be transferred between bacteria within a population. Pathogenicity islands are one such type of mobile genetic element and are very common among bacteria known as staphylococci. They spread toxin-encoding genes between bacteria, including one that can lead to a condition called toxic shock syndrome in humans.</p><p>Pathogenicity islands are normally found within the DNA of the bacteria, where they are deactivated by specific repressor proteins. However, in the presence of another type of mobile genetic element – the bacteriophages – the repressor proteins start to interact with specific proteins encoded by the bacteriophages. This allows the pathogenicity islands to become active and spread to other bacteria.</p><p>Previous research has shown that in the bacterium known as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, different pathogenicity islands have different repressors. Scientists therefore assumed that the repressors are only able to interact with certain bacteriophage proteins. However, since pathogenicity islands are widespread in nature, it could be possible that they use other ways to hijack the bacteriophage machinery to ensure their transfer.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, Bowring et al. studied two types of pathogenicity islands in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and revealed that their two different repressors did not interact with specific bacteriophage proteins as previously hypothesized. Instead, each repressor could interact with multiple bacteriophage proteins that had a variety of different structures, including proteins from completely different bacteriophages.</p><p>Bowring et al. also discovered that each of the analyzed repressor proteins did not actually recognize any specific shared structural features on the bacteriophage proteins, but rather evolved to target proteins that play the same role in various bacteriophages. This suggests the repressors target a specific process rather than a single protein. This strategy allows them to be transferred within the same species, but also between different ones.</p><p>A next step will be to better understand how a repressor can recognize structurally unrelated proteins, and establish what evolutionary forces are driving this phenomenon. A deeper knowledge of how pathogenicity islands spread between staphylococci is vital to understand how these bacteria can become resistant to treatments such as antibiotics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>pathogenicity island</kwd><kwd>SaPIs</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>gene transfer</kwd><kwd>PICIs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201531/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penadés</surname><given-names>José R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N002873/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penades</surname><given-names>Jose R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M003876/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penadés</surname><given-names>José R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2013-42619-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marina</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2016-78571-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marina</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC Advanced Grant 2014</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proposal n° 670932 Dut-signal</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Penades</surname><given-names>Jose R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and genetic analyses reveal the highly evolved and unprecedented biological strategy used by SaPIs to spread in nature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are the prototypical members of an extremely common and recently identified family of mobile genetic elements, the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martínez-Rubio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penadés and Christie, 2015</xref>). The SaPIs are clinically relevant because they carry and disseminate superantigen genes, especially those for toxic shock toxin and enterotoxin B. They are very widespread among the staphylococci and are exclusively responsible for menstrual toxic shock, a rare but important human disease. In the absence of a helper phage they reside passively in the host chromosome, under the control of a global SaPI-coded repressor, Stl, a DNA-binding protein whose sequence is rather poorly conserved among the different members of the SaPI family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Following infection by a helper phage or induction of a helper prophage, they excise, replicate extensively, and are packaged in phage-like particles composed of phage virion proteins, leading to very high frequencies of inter- as well as intrageneric transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penadés and Christie, 2015</xref>). In previous work we demonstrated that SaPI de-repression is effected by specific phage proteins that bind to Stl, disrupting the Stl-DNA complex and thereby initiating the excision-replication-packaging (ERP) cycle of the islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>). Different SaPIs encode different Stl repressors, so each SaPI targets a different phage protein for its de-repression. Thus, the inducers for SaPIbov1, SaPIbov2 and SaPI1 correspond to the phage trimeric dUTPase (Dut), 80α ORF15 and Sri, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>). Since SaPIs require phage proteins to be packaged, this strategy couples the SaPI and phage cycles, but imposes a significant transmission cost on the helper phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, although phages carrying mutations in the genes encoding the aforementioned SaPI inducers can be propagated in the lab, these mutations have a fitness cost when the mutant phages compete with the wild-type phages in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>), which indicates that the phage coded SaPI inducers provide an important function for the phages in nature.</p><p>We recently proposed that phages could easily overcome this SaPI imposed cost using two complementary strategies that result in phages with reduced or null capacity to induce the islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>). On the one hand, phages can encode allelic variants of the SaPI inducers with reduced affinity for the SaPI coded Stl repressor. On the other hand, some phages seem to overcome SaPI induction by replacing the phage-encoded SaPI inducing gene by another one encoding an analogous protein (an unrelated protein that performs the same biological function). Although experiments performed in the laboratory suggest that in response to these strategies SaPIs can antagonistically coevolve by inactivating their Stl repressors, this strategy superimposes a high cost for the bacteria, associated with an uncontrolled SaPI replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>), so it is unlikely that this occurs in nature.</p><p>A recent study, however, questioned the idea that phages could overcome the SaPI tyranny by replacing the SaPI inducing gene by another one encoding a functionally related protein. While all the staphylococcal <italic>S. aureus</italic> phages encode Duts; some encode dimeric and others trimeric Duts, never both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, dimeric and trimeric Duts are completely unrelated both in sequence and structure, representing a nice example of convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penadés et al., 2013</xref>). While the 80α and ϕ11 phage-encoded trimeric Duts were initially described as the SaPIbov1 inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>), the dimeric Dut from phage ϕNM1 also induces SaPIbov1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill and Dokland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). The fact that both dimeric and trimeric Duts induce SaPIbov1 raised the interesting possibility that the Stl repressors could target different phage proteins, significantly increasing the capacity of the SaPIs to be induced and transferred. This result also raised other interesting questions about the SaPIs: is this phenomenon exclusive of SaPIbov1 or are other SaPIs also induced by unrelated proteins? If that was the case for specific SaPIs, are these unrelated proteins always performing the same function for the phages or conversely it is possible that a specific SaPI repressor interacts with proteins performing unrelated functions? And finally, what is the molecular mechanism by which the SaPI-encoded Stl repressors interact with different proteins?</p><p>Here we set out to answer all these questions and have demonstrated that it is more complicated than expected for the phages to overcome the SaPIs superimposed tyranny. Our results provide evidence of inter-species PICI transfer in nature. We have also deciphered the molecular mechanism used by the SaPIs to hijack the helper phage machinery in order to get high intra- and inter-generic transference: instead of interacting with specific partners, SaPIs have evolved a fascinating strategy that promotes their high transfer by pirating conserved phage mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SaPIbov1 Stl repressor interacts with the ϕO11 dimeric Dut protein</title><p>What is the mechanism by which the SaPIbov1 repressor interacts with apparently unrelated proteins? Obviously, and since the trimeric and dimeric Duts perform the same biological function, the most likely scenario would be the existence of a conserved domain in the phage-encoded proteins that would be recognised by the SaPIbov1 coded Stl repressor. The structure of the phage 80α and ϕ11 coded Duts has recently been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leveles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tormo-Más et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in-depth structural, genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the trimeric Dut domains IV, V and VI are involved in SaPIbov1 Stl recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maiques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>). To know whether similar domains are present in the dimeric Duts, we initially addressed the following question: does the SaPIbov1 Stl interact just with the ϕNM1 dimeric Dut or can it interact with other phage coded dimeric Duts? To solve this question, we analysed the ϕO11 dimeric Dut. As occurred with the trimeric Duts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>), the dimeric ϕNM1 and ϕO11 Duts are basically identical except in a divergent central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the ϕO11 dimeric Dut also induces the SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov5 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Note that SaPIbov5 was also included in these studies because it encodes the same Stl repressor as SaPIbov1, with both islands being induced by the same helper phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Viana et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of the ϕO11 dimeric Dut (from the P<italic>cad</italic> promoter in expression vector pCN51) in a SaPIbov1 or SaPIbov5 positive strain demonstrated that this protein is sufficient to induce the SaPI cycles. Thus, when overexpressed, the cloned ϕO11 dimeric <italic>dut</italic> induced SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov5 excision and replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26487.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov5 by the ϕO11 dimeric Dut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SaPIbov1 and SaPIbov5 excision and replication following induction of the cloned ϕO11 <italic>dut</italic> gene.

SaPI de-repression occurs after a direct protein-protein interaction between the cognate phage inducer and the SaPI coded Stl repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>). To test if the mechanism involving the ϕO11 dimeric Dut in SaPIbov1 induction matches with that previously reported for the other SaPIs, we first demonstrated that ϕO11 Dut induces <italic>xis</italic> expression, which normally is repressed by Stl. This was confirmed using plasmid pJP674, which carries a β-lactamase reporter gene fused to <italic>xis</italic>, downstream of <italic>str</italic> and the Stl<sub>SaPIbov1</sub>-repressed <italic>str</italic> promoter, and also encodes Stl<sub>SaPIbov1</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The identity of each of these bands was confirmed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. We conclude from these results that dimeric ϕO11 Dut induces the SaPI cycle using the same mechanism described for the unrelated trimeric Dut proteins. Moreover, and although this is not the scope of this study, these results also involve the dimeric Duts in SaPI signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The SaPIbov1 Stl repressor has different interacting domains</title><p>It is predicted that dimeric and trimeric Duts acquire a completely unrelated fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penadés et al., 2013</xref>). However, since both dimeric and trimeric Duts perform the same enzymatic activity, we hypothesised that these proteins could have conserved domains responsible for the interaction with Stl. To test this hypothesis, and since the structure of the staphylococcal phage-encoded dimeric Duts remains unsolved, the structure of the dimeric ϕO11 Dut in complex with the nonhydrolyzable dUTP analog α,β-imido-dUTP (dUPNPP) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was determined at 2.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The crystal structure showed 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit organized as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The structure shows that ϕO11 is an all-helix protein composed of only seven α-helices (α1, residues 7–23; α2, 29–47; α3 61–82; α4, 86–98; α5, 104–108; α6, 110–121 and α7, 127–141) per protomer.

Nevertheless, the ϕO11 protomer presents the characteristic structural core of dimeric Duts composed of four helices (α1-α3 and α7 in ϕO11) that conforms the active centre where the nucleotide binds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the ϕO11 dimer both active centres are oriented towards the same molecule face, forming a long channel that accommodates two molecules of dUPNPP. The rest of the protomer is placed on the opposite molecule face (residues 83–138), which corresponds to the divergent region in phage-encoded dimeric Duts but also adopts a helical fold (helices α4-α6 in ϕO11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26487.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of ϕO11 dimeric Dut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation the ϕO11 Dut dimer (protomer in blue and yellow).

As could be anticipated by the difference in folding between the trimeric (all-beta) and dimeric (all-alpha) proteins, none of these motifs are present in the ϕO11 Dut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In the trimeric Duts, these three motifs place together surrounding the nucleotide in the active centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), thus we wondered whether the Stl recognition site was generated spatially by the disposition of specific residues provided by these three motifs rather than by the motifs themselves. To check this possibility we spatially compared the active sites of both types of Duts by superimposing the nucleotide-binding sites of the trimeric 80α and dimeric ϕO11 phagic Duts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As was previously observed in the comparison of the active centres from other dimeric and trimeric Duts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harkiolaki et al., 2004</xref>), the way of dUTP recognition and binding is completely different in both Dut types, not only in the orientation of the plane of the uracil moiety, which showed a relative rotation of more than 75°, but also in the disposition of the phosphates. In trimeric Duts, the α-phosphates acquire a <italic>gauche</italic> catalytic-competent geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kovári et al., 2008</xref>) meanwhile a <italic>trans</italic> conformation is observed in the dimeric ϕO11 Dut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the β and γ phosphates differ in their relative disposition, chelating a single divalent metal in the trimerics, versus two in the dimerics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hemsworth et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Therefore, the active centres in both types of enzymes show divergent architecture and, consequently, the spatial disposition of the residues surrounding the nucleotides, including those provided by motif IV, V and VI, is completely different. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the SaPIbov1 Stl repressor has different interacting domains/ways to recognise the unrelated trimeric and dimeric Duts.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26487.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dimeric and trimeric <italic>S. aureus</italic> phagic Duts present completely different folding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of ϕO11 dimeric Dut (protomers coloured in blue and yellow) and 80α trimeric Dut (PDB 3ZEZ; protomers coloured in blue, yellow and pink) showing the difference in folding between dimeric (all-alpha) and trimeric (all-beta) Duts.

Sequence analysis and in silico modelling indicates that SaPIbov1 Stl is mainly an α-helical protein composed of a N-terminal HTH DNA-binding domain (residues 1–80) and C-terminal portion of unknown function that seems to be conformed of two domains connected by a region of low complexity (residues 167–179) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nyíri et al., 2015</xref>]). Thus, we generated Stl deletional variants lacking the N-terminal DNA binding domain (residues 1–86; StlΔ<sup>HTH</sup>) or the most C-terminal subdomain (residues 176–267; StlΔ<sup>Cter</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unfortunately, these mutants couldn’t be analysed in vivo, since the generated Stl mutant repressors had lost the capacity to block the SaPI cycle. To solve that problem, we expressed the different Stl mutants in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and analysed in vitro their capacity to interact with the different Duts. Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain abolished the interaction with the trimeric ϕ11 but not with the dimeric ϕO11 Dut. Conversely, the elimination of the C-terminal subdomain impairs the binding to the dimeric but not to the trimeric Dut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown the interaction with the Stl repressor inhibits the dUTPase activity of both dimeric and trimeric Duts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill and Dokland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szabó et al., 2014</xref>).

The fact that the SaPIbov1 Stl has particular regions for interacting with the trimeric and dimeric Duts supports the idea that the SaPIbov1 Stl repressor has evolved distinct ways to specifically interact with the dimeric or trimeric Duts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26487.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SaPIbov1 Stl has different regions to interact with the trimeric and dimeric Duts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native gel mobility shift assays were used to test the binding capacity of ϕO11 dimeric and ϕ11 trimeric Duts with full-length and truncated versions of Stl.

Since SaPIs severely interfere with helper phage reproduction, a classical strategy used to identify non-essential SaPI inducers is to generate spontaneous phage mutants that are able to form plaques in the presence of the SaPIs. This strategy selects for phage mutants that have lost the ability to mobilise the islands because of mutations they carry in the SaPI inducer genes. These mutations usually generate non-functional proteins that have also lost their capacity to relieve Stl-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>). After many attempts, we obtained only a single spontaneous 80α phage mutant which was able to form plaques on <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain RN4220 containing SaPI2, suggesting that the SaPI2 inducer is absolutely essential for the phage cycle even in laboratory conditions. In this mutant the 3’ region of the 80α ORF16 has been lost. Translation of this mutated gene generates a chimeric protein fused with the single strand binding protein (Ssb; 80α ORF17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since in this mutant phage the <italic>ssb</italic> gene (including its ribosomal binding site) is unaffected and can be transcribed and translated independently of the chimeric structure, this result suggests that ORF16 is the SaPI2 inducer.</p><p>The 80α ORF16 protein belongs to the Sak family of single strand annealing proteins (SSAP, also called recombinases) involved in homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scaltriti et al., 2011</xref>). Although for many of these proteins their role in the phage cycle has not been established yet, we have recently demonstrated that this protein is essential for 80α phage replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neamah et al., 2017</xref>).

Thus, when overexpressed, the cloned <italic>sak</italic> (but not the chimeric Sak-Ssb protein) induced SaPI2 excision and replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As the protein levels produced from these constructs are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), this result clearly shows that although expressed, the chimeric protein has lost its capacity to induce SaPI2. Moreover, and to confirm that the mechanism involving Sak in SaPI2 induction matches with that previously reported for the other SaPIs, we demonstrated that 80α Sak induces expression of the SaPI2 Stl repressed genes.

Interestingly, phages ϕ80 and ϕ52A can also induce the SaPI2 cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ram et al., 2014</xref>), although none of them encodes a 80α Sak protein. To test the possibility that SaPI2 was targeting another protein, we tried to identify the SaPI2 inducer in phages ϕ80 and ϕ52A by generating spontaneous phage mutants that can grow in the presence of the island. After many attempts, we did not get any phage mutants capable of forming plaques in a SaPI2 positive strain, suggesting that the SaPI2 inducers are also essential for the biology of these phages, even in laboratory conditions. In view of this result, and bearing in mind that both the dimeric and trimeric Duts have the same biological (enzymatic) function for the phage, we hypothesised that the ϕ80 or ϕ52A SaPI2 inducers would be functionally related to the 80α Sak protein. Since the <italic>S. aureus</italic> phages display synteny, we speculated that the genes located in the same genome position as the 80α <italic>sak</italic> gene would be essential for the phage, would have a recombinase function, and would encode for the SaPI2 inducer. While phages ϕ80 and ϕ52A do not contain an <italic>orf</italic> homologue to 80α <italic>sak</italic>, all three phages encode identifiable <italic>ssb</italic> genes, which in the case of the 80α phage is located downstream of the <italic>sak</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we analysed the possibility that the genes upstream of <italic>ssb</italic> were the SaPI2 inducers. Both ϕ80 and ϕ52A phages carried an identical gene, named ORF13 in phage ϕ80 and ORF16 in phage ϕ52A, which encodes a non-related protein to the 80α Sak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This protein belongs to a distinct family of SSAPs, Sak4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>). While Sak4 and Sak are not homologous in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), we have recently demonstrated that they are both SSAPs (recombinases) performing a similar function in their cognate phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neamah et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The results above support the hypothesis proposing that unrelated proteins performing the same function for the phages could all act as inducers for a specific SaPI. Thus, expression of the ϕ80 and ϕ52A Sak4 proteins in a SaPI2 positive strain demonstrated that they are sufficient to induce the SaPI2 cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, expression of the s<italic>ak</italic>4 genes strongly increased β-lactamase expression from the Stl-repressed <italic>str</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since expression of the ϕ52A Sak4 protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> generated an insoluble protein which aggregates, we couldn’t co-purify a complex between His<sub>6</sub>-Stl<sub>SaPI2</sub> and untagged ϕ52A Sak4. However, a two-hybrid assay confirmed the strong interaction between both the ϕ52A Sak4 recombinase and the SaPI2 Stl repressor and between the 80α Sak protein and the SaPI2 Stl pair (used here as a control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), confirming that the phage Sak4 protein is a <italic>bona fide</italic> SaPI2 inducer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Unrelated phage-encoded recombinases induce SaPI2</title><p>Since SaPI2 superimposes a high cost for the phage, it could be possible that staphylococcal phages would initially avoid this interference by encoding additional SSAPs, unrelated to Sak or Sak4. In turn, and if the hypothesis we propose here is correct, it could also be possible that the SaPI repressor would evolve to target these new phage encoded recombinase proteins. In silico scrutiny looking at the genes located upstream of the <italic>ssb</italic> genes revealed that staphylococcal phages encode at least 4 distant SSAP families, including Erf, Redβ, and the aforementioned Sak and Sak4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). All the staphylococcal phages encode one SSAP, in accordance with the fact that these proteins are essential for the phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neamah et al., 2017</xref>). To test the possibility that these other unrelated recombinases also induced SaPI2, we characterised in detail those present in phages ϕSLT (ORF 17) and ϕN315 (SA1794), which belong to the Erf and Redβ families of SSAPs, respectively, and have completely different sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We selected phage ϕSLT because it is clinically relevant, encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. Applying the same methodology and strategies previously used to characterise Sak and Sak4, our results confirm that: (i) the expression of the ϕSLT Erf and ϕN315 Redβ proteins is sufficient to induce the SaPI2 cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); (ii) expression of these recombinases prevents Stl from binding to the SaPI2 <italic>stl-str</italic> divergent region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and (iii) the two-hybrid assay confirmed the interaction between the SaPI2 Stl repressor and the Erf and Redβ recombinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, since the existence of different interacting domains in the Stl repressor explains why both the dimeric and trimeric proteins can induce SaPIbov1, we wondered if a similar mechanism was employed by the SaPI2 island. Structure-based modelling of Sak, Sak4, Erf and Redβ suggested they are unrelated, although Sak, Erf and Redβ can be connected through remote homology relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that Sak, Erf and Redβ belong to a large superfamily adopting a shortcut Rad52-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>). However, structural models produced with I-Tasser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) servers for Sak (phage 80α), Erf (ϕSLT) and Redβ (ϕN315) only proposed the Rad52 fold for Sak, whereas for Erf and Redβ alternating foldings, non-related with Rad52 recombinases, were proposed with low confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4A and B</xref>). By contrast, remote homologs to Sak4 are predicted to adopt a shortcut Rad51/RecA fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>) and models obtained from I-Tasser and Phyre2 servers proposed this fold for the ϕ52A Sak4 recombinase with good confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4A and B</xref>).

However, and in the case of the inter-generic transfer of the elements, to be completely effective this strategy requires that the phages infecting the new SaPI-recipient species encode the conserved SaPI inducers. To test this, we analysed the presence of SaPIbov1 or SaPI2 inducing genes in a subset of staphylococcal phages infecting species other than <italic>S. aureus</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, we were able to identify homologs to the previously characterised SaPIbov1 or SaPI2 inducer in all the analysed phages, although with different degrees of identity among the members of the distinct families. Next, and to support the idea that once the inter-species transfer occurs the PICI can be maintained in the new recipient species, we tested whether the Dut encoded in the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> phage IPLA6, or the recombinase encoded in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> phage PH15, were capable of inducing the cycle of the different PICI elements encoding SaPIbov1 or SaPI2 Stl homologs. That was the case, and the behaviour of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> IPLA6 trimeric Dut was identical to that observed for the trimeric ϕ11 Dut (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), while the functioning of the ϕPH15 Sak recombinase was indistinguishable from that observed with the homologue <italic>S. aureus</italic> 80α coded Sak (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In summary, our results confirm the idea that the PICIs have established a fascinating parasitic strategy that may allow their promiscuous transfer and widespread maintenance in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Inter-species PICI transfer occurs in nature</title><p>The fact that some islands present in different species encode identical proteins (including not just the Stl repressors as demonstrated here but also other PICI proteins) strongly supports the idea that some ancestral elements were horizontally transferred among species. In the different species these elements probably evolved independently, trying to adapt to the new cognate host. Our previous results, however, suggest that by pirating conserved phage mechanisms this inter-species transit probably occurs constantly in nature. To test that possibility, we scrutinised the genome databases looking for identical PICIs present in different staphylococcal species. We initiated this analysis by comparing the genomes of those PICIs encoding identical Stl proteins. Highlighting the versatility of these elements and the successful strategy they use to spread in nature, our analysis revealed that the ScCIM23864:W1 (<italic>S. caprae</italic>) and SlCIFDAARGOS_141 (<italic>S. lugdunensis</italic>) elements are identical (just 3 mismatches over 13,847 nt; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The manner by which related SaPIs have acquired the ability to exploit conserved phage processes by targeting structurally unrelated proteins as antirepressors represents a remarkable evolutionary adaptation. Our results suggest that the most likely scenario explaining why the SaPI/PICI Stl repressors can interact with different phage coded inducers is the existence of different interacting domains in the SaPI Stl repressors. The presence of these different domains highlights the co-evolutionary and constant battle established between the helper phages, trying to avoid PICIs induction, and the parasitic PICIs, trying to interact with non-inducing phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frígols et al., 2015</xref>). This mechanism could also be responsible, at least in part, for the widespread distribution of PICIs in nature. Note that we have recently demonstrated the existence of these elements in many Gram-positive cocci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martínez-Rubio et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesised that at the beginning of the SaPI-phage war, a single phage protein may have been originally targeted; to escape from SaPI de-repression, because SaPIs interfere with phage maturation, substitution of the gene encoding this protein to one expressing a non-related, but functionally similar protein could have had a selective advantage for the phage. A second stage in SaPI evolution could have involved divergence of the SaPI repressor, enabling it to complex with structurally non-related phage proteins. The fact that the Stl repressors interact with structurally unrelated proteins performing the same function makes this strategy unique in nature and extremely effective. Note that in terms of increasing their transferability, a more simple strategy for the SaPIs could have been to select for Stl repressors that can interact with proteins performing different functions for the phage. However, since phages have mosaicism, encoding multiple versions of unrelated proteins performing the same function (as also demonstrated here), this strategy would select for phages insensitive to the SaPIs that encode the correct combination of non-inducing proteins. By contrast, and since the processes targeted by the SaPIs are extremely well conserved in the staphylococcal phages, the fact that the SaPIs target different versions of proteins involved in the same biological processes limits the capacity of the phages to overcome SaPI parasitism, ensuring the transferability of these elements. Thus, our results show that SaPI-phage interactions represent a remarkable microcosm within the bacterial intracellular universe, highlighting SaPIs as one of the most fascinating and effective subcellular parasites.</p><p>However, our results raise an interesting question. Why do some repressors interact just with one inducer, limiting their capacity to be transferred, while others seem to have a broader spectrum of inducers? Our hypothesis is that although all the analysed phages encode putative SaPI inducers, these are different in sequence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), so the repressors present in the different PICIs have evolved to increase their interaction with the specific inducers encoded in the cognate phages infecting these bacterial species. This also would explain the divergence in sequence observed in related Stl repressors.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pirating conserved phage mechanisms promotes promiscuous staphylococcal pathogenicity island transfer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation was overseen by Gisela Storz as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Bowring et al. explores the mechanism of induction of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Pathogenicity Islands (SaPIs). These are mobile genetic elements that carry virulence genes and, whereas they spend most of their time integrated into the staphylococcal chromosome, they can be induced during phage infection (known as the helper phage) and then propagate throughout the bacterial population. The induction and spread of SaPIs is a fascinating phenomenon. Usually helper phages produce a protein that interferes with the SaPI repressor, an event that leads to the activation of the SaPI and its excision from the chromosome previous packaging and spread. Through genetic and structural analysis, this paper reveals that a given SaPI repressor can be activated by many different phage proteins and/or domains within a phage protein. The work reveals the genetic plasticity of SaPI induction, which can be activated and spread upon multiple phage signals.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While all three reviewers thought your work is sound, there was less agreement on whether the findings were of sufficient general interest for <italic>eLife</italic>. A part of the problem is probably how the paper is written. The revised version must adequately address the following:</p><p>– The manuscript is unnecessarily difficult to read and tends to jump from one topic to another without sufficient transitions and connections. Related to this, the &quot;big picture&quot; is missing from the paper.</p><p>– There are many instances where the authors overstate just how &quot;remarkable&quot; the findings are (remarkably is used ~10 times in the manuscript, elegant/extremely sophisticated and the like are also overused), overall the language should be toned down. Some examples:</p><p>– &quot;[…] by targeting structurally unrelated proteins as antirepressors represents a remarkable evolutionary adaptation.&quot; Why is this so remarkable? It seems more like the classical evolutionary arms race: the SaPI evolves induction through the interaction of its repressor with a phage inducer protein. This process is detrimental to phage replication and therefore the phage evolves modifications in the inducer to escape SaPI inhibition. In turn the SaPI evolves a new interaction to re-gain activation. And so on.</p><p>– &quot;Remarkably, all of the staph phages encode one SSAP&quot; This is not especially remarkable given that the authors indicate it is essential for replication.</p><p>– The beginning of the Discussion regarding the historical battle of Thermopylae is grandiose, and should be removed.</p><p>– The paper starts with the SaPI2 Stl repressor, suggesting that it can interact (via different domains) with structurally different recombinases. The data for this repressor-inducer is less complete and as it stands, is not sufficiently convincing. At a minimum, the authors should test truncated SaPI2 Stl repressor with the different recombinases in shift assays as they do for the Duts/SaPIbov1 Stl (even without the structural data, which they state they have not been able to get, this data is necessary to justify their conclusions). Otherwise, it seems to make more sense to reorganize the paper with the Dut story first.</p><p>2) In addition, the following controls need to be provided:</p><p>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The uninduced controls (T=0 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) should be shown for this blot (or at least an empty vector control if leaky expression).

Expression from the reporter does not show that sak4 expression prevents Stl binding from that region.

Sometimes, a very nice analogy can provide a good guide for understanding a process. In this case, we really think the Thermopylae battle is a nice example to explain, to non-expert readers, how the SaPIs work. It is obvious from the reviewers’ comments that we probably did not explain this very well in the initial version of the manuscript. Hopefully we have now. But the analogy between the two stories is very clear and we really believe that this analogy helps in highlighting the strategy that the SaPIs use to be widespread in nature. For this reason, we would like to maintain this comparison in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The paper starts with the SaPI2 Stl repressor, suggesting that it can interact (via different domains) with structurally different recombinases.

Unfortunately, as indicated in the text, apart from Sak the rest of the recombinases are insoluble, as is the Stl when purified alone. For this reason we have addressed the question using the Duts.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have reorganised the manuscript, starting with the Duts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, the following controls need to be provided:</p><p>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The uninduced controls (T=0 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) should be shown for this blot (or at least an empty vector control if leaky expression).

In addition to that, the different recombinases have been 3xflag-tagged, so a western-blot could be performed showing all the proteins are expressed.</p><p>In addition to chromosomal and phage DNA, the bulk DNA contains replicating (concatemeric) SaPI DNA. Since SaPI2 induction by the recombinases is quite effective, and since the exposure of the Southern blot is short, this explains why the negative controls do not show any signal in the bulk DNA. The composition of the bulk DNA has now been specified in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors use their blaZ reporter plasmid as a proxy for SaPI induction, however, the interpretation of these specific results is not justified by the experiment (i.e. &quot;Moreover, expression of the sak4 genes prevented Stl from binding to the SaPI2 stl-str divergent region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)&quot;.
