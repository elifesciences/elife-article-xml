Single-neuron genomics enables direct measurement of somatic mutation rates in human brain and promises to answer this question. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al., 2015</xref>) reported high rates of somatic LINE-1 element (L1) retrotransposition in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that would have major implications for normal brain function, and suggested that these events preferentially impact genes important for neuronal function. We identify aspects of the single-cell sequencing approach, bioinformatic analysis, and validation methods that led to thousands of artifacts being interpreted as somatic mutation events. Our reanalysis supports a mutation frequency of approximately 0.2 events per cell, which is about fifty-fold lower than reported, confirming that L1 elements mobilize in some human neurons but indicating that L1 mosaicism is not ubiquitous. Through consideration of the challenges identified, we provide a foundation and framework for designing single-cell genomics studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12966.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12966.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain harbors perhaps the most diverse collection of cells among any organ in the body, consisting of neurons and other cells with many different shapes and behaviors. The mechanisms that create this diversity have been a long-standing area of investigation. While neurons can become more diverse through changes in the activity of genes during development and in response to experiences, it has been speculated that genetic differences among neurons may also play a role.</p><p>The complete set of genes found in an individual is known as its genome. It is often assumed that each cell in an individual's brain has an identical genome. However, mutations accumulate in cells during the lifetime of an individual such that every brain cell may in fact contain a unique set of genetic mutations. The extent and types of such genetic mutations have only recently become accessible using techniques that can examine the genomes of single-cells. Some of these genetic differences may result from the activity of short sections of DNA called retrotransposons, which can copy themselves and move to a different place in the genome. This can introduce genetic mutations that alter how the cell works.</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that retrotransposon-related mutations are present in human brain cells. Indeed, in 2015 a group of researchers suggested that every neuron in two brain regions called the cortex and the hippocampus contains as many as 16 retrotransposon-related mutations on average, which suggests that retrotransposons may play an essential role in the healthy brain. However, these findings contrasted with previous studies that had shown much fewer mutations.</p><p>Now, Evrony, Lee et al. have analyzed the data from the 2015 study that led the previous researchers to interpret some artifacts as retrotransposon mutations. Reanalysing the data confirmed that these mutations do indeed occur; however, they are around 50 times less common than had been suggested by the earlier study.</p><p>This suggests that retrotranspons are more likely to be occasional sources of rare variation or disease, rather than essential contributors to normal brain activity in humans. Further work is needed to examine the rate of these and other types of mutations in different cell types and brain regions, and at different developmental stages. However, to ensure that these studies are robust and reliable, Evrony, Lee et al. also outline a framework to aid the design and analysis of future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12966.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12966.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>single-cell genomics</kwd><kwd>somatic mutation</kwd><kwd>mosaicism</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd><kwd>LINE-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evrony</surname><given-names>Gilad D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eunjung</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS079277 and R01 NS032457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evrony</surname><given-names>Gilad D</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evrony</surname><given-names>Gilad D</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006823</institution-id><institution>Boston Children's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evrony</surname><given-names>Gilad D</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louis Lange III Scholarship in Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evrony</surname><given-names>Gilad D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eleanor and Miles Shore Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eunjung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>William Randolph Hearst Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Eunjung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

The immune system, with its systematic genomic rearrangements such as V(D)J recombination, and the ordered generation of random somatic mutation coupled with a selection process, have suggested appealing analogies for generating the cellular diversity of the nervous system, and have led to searches for analogous genomic diversity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muotri and Gage, 2006</xref>). LINE-1 (L1) elements are endogenous retrotransposons that transcribe an RNA copy that is reverse-transcribed into a DNA copy that can then insert into a novel site in the genome, creating mutations capable of disrupting or modifying the expression of genes in which they insert or neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodier and Kazazian, 2008</xref>). Evolutionarily, transposon mobilization is an essential cause of the generation of species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</xref>), so interest in possible L1 activity during brain development was spurred by the discovery that these elements can mobilize in neuronal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muotri et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The importance of any mutation process, such as retrotransposon mobilization, in generating neuronal diversity is constrained by the rate at which mutation takes place, since if a given type of mutation occurs infrequently, it is unlikely to be a useful generator of diversity. Single-cell sequencing is a powerful technology that has revealed and quantified previously unknown mechanisms of somatic mutation in the human brain, providing a first proof of principle for the systematic measurement of somatic mutation rates in any normal human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McConnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lodato et al., 2015</xref>). Single-cell sequencing can therefore determine the extent to which somatic mutations diversify the genomes of cells in the brain, which is foundational to understanding their potential functional impact in normal brains and possible roles in neuropsychiatric diseases of unknown etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poduri et al., 2013</xref>). L1 mobilization has been observed at low rates using indirect genetic techniques such as a transgenic L1 reporter in rodent brain in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muotri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2010</xref>) and human progenitor cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>), while studies profiling human brain bulk DNA suggested much higher rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bundo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>). Single-cell sequencing has been proposed as the definitive method to resolve these disparate estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erwin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodier, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A recent single-cell sequencing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al., 2015</xref>) reported high rates of somatic L1 retrotransposition in the hippocampus (13.7 per neuron on average) and cerebral cortex (16.3 per neuron), and suggested that L1 retrotransposition was &quot;ubiquitous&quot;. Such a high rate of retrotransposition could present it as a possibly essential event in neurogenesis and would have major implications for brain function. Here we describe experimental artifacts that elevated the study's apparent rate of somatic retrotransposition by &gt;50-fold. Reanalysis of their data while filtering these artifacts generates a consensus that retrotransposition does occur in developing brain but at a much lower rate consistent with prior single-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>), thereby constraining the range of possible functional roles for retrotransposition in the brain. Our discussion of the challenges in single-cell sequencing may provide a useful framework for the design and analysis of single-cell genomics studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell L1 PCR validation</title><p>Upton et al. isolated single neuronal cells from postmortem human brains and amplified their genomes using the MALBAC method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zong et al., 2012</xref>). They then profiled human-specific L1 elements (L1Hs) using their RC-seq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al., 2015</xref>) that captures and amplifies both the 5' and 3' ends of L1Hs elements via oligonucleotide hybridization and PCR, hence providing sequence data that identify L1Hs insertion sites in the genome.</p><p>Although whole genome amplification methods have remarkable abilities to amplify picogram quantities of DNA from a single cell into microgram quantities, chimeric DNA molecules falsely linking unrelated DNA fragments are well known to arise during single-cell genome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macaulay and Voet, 2014</xref>). Chimera artifacts also arise during ligation and PCR steps of sequencing library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kircher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quail et al., 2008</xref>), processes integral to the RC-seq method. Chimeric sequences can create a DNA fragment connecting a LINE element to an unrelated portion of the genome, creating the appearance of biological LINE mobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Sequence analysis of Upton et al.'s putative PCR-validated candidates (Table S2 of Upton et al.) demonstrates that more than half of them (7 of 13) are chimera artifacts that could not have been generated by the process of L1 mobilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Some chimeras originated immediately downstream of germline L1Hs/L1Pa elements that are incapable of retrotransposition, because the L1 elements are truncated, are from an old, inactive L1 subfamily, or contain numerous inactivating mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In other cases, L1 5' and 3' junction chimeras originating from distinct L1 elements were misinterpreted as two ends of the same L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Some candidates lack poly-A tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), a key feature of retrotransposon insertions. Although the remaining 6/13 PCR-validated insertions lack clear evidence of being chimeras, the possibility cannot be excluded based on the limited PCR validation performed, and they are likely also chimeras because each is supported by only 1 or 2 sequencing reads (see below). The presence of chimeric artifacts among a set of insertions passing limited PCR validation supports the importance of additional careful analysis of candidate L1 sequences to help define more accurate rates of retrotransposition.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chimera artifacts in RC-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full-length (FL) PCR using primers flanking the insertion site is necessary for definitive validation of somatic insertions in single cells in the setting of chimeras. One breakpoint per chimera DNA molecule refers to the breakpoint of the candidate insertion being analyzed since a DNA molecule can in principle have multiple different chimera events each involving different loci (which would be unlikely to create a structure that would validate by FL-PCR).

Full-length cloning validation, in which the entire L1 insertion is amplified in a single DNA molecule spanning both breakpoints (using primers based in the genomic sequence flanking the L1), is therefore the only way to confirm that both breakpoints are present in the same DNA molecule as a bona fide insertion, as opposed to two different chimeric molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, Upton et al. did not perform full-length cloning validation on any insertion. Two independent chimeras can even occur by chance in two different DNA molecules/copies whose non-L1 sequences overlap the same genomic locus, giving the false appearance of a target site duplication (TSD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In single-cell sequencing, especially when read count is not used to filter candidates (see below), full-length cloning of at least some candidate insertions is important to exclude chimera artifacts.</p><p>Instead of full-length cloning validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>), Upton et al. carried out multiple 5' junction PCR reactions per candidate using primers spaced every 500 bp along the ~6000 bp L1. Multiple PCR reactions, each with an L1 primer matching hundreds to thousands of genomic loci, introduces additional mechanisms for generating false-positives. Some candidates required nested PCR with 62 PCR cycles, an extremely high level of amplification, suggesting that the targets are chimeras present at very low level in the single-cell amplified DNA.</p><p>The MALBAC method employed by Upton et al. for single-cell genome amplification probably precludes definitive full-length cloning validation of some insertions, suggesting it is not an ideal method for studying retrotransposition. MALBAC produces short amplicons (0.5–1.5kb) compared to multiple displacement amplification (MDA) (10–50 kb amplicons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dean et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zong et al., 2012</xref>), so insertions longer than ~1.5 kb (~15–30% of somatic L1 insertions in human cancer studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>]) would not be efficiently validated in MALBAC single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1A and C</xref>).</p><p>The many chimeras among ‘validated’ somatic insertions come about because Upton et al. relied solely on computational analysis of contig sequences (assembled from short sequencing reads) to filter chimeras and labeled most remaining candidates as putative somatic insertions. However, sequence analysis of short contigs that do not span the full length of insertions can identify chimeras but cannot rule them out. For example, 5' junction chimeras originating from inside an L1 element or 3' junction chimeras originating from within the poly-A tail cannot be distinguished from true insertion breakpoints by sequence analysis alone and require further experiments (i.e., full-length cloning) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, even some chimeras that can be identified computationally were not filtered: one recurrent type of chimera artifact accounts for 16% of their candidates detected only at a 5' junction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; see example candidate chr11:112602973). Further analyses, as well as long-read sequencing (e.g., PacBio), may reveal additional ways to remove chimeras computationally by sequence analysis alone; but with short-read sequencing, even ideal sequence-based filtering algorithms cannot filter chimeras originating from within L1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>L1 and chimera read count distributions</title><p>A core principle of next-generation sequencing analysis is the use of read counts to distinguish true mutations from artifacts that inevitably arise during DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robasky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sims et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple reads supporting a mutation serves the same role as replication does in any scientific experiment, increasing the confidence that the finding is not an artifact. This is especially important in single-cell sequencing where chimeric DNA artifacts are more prevalent than in standard sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macaulay and Voet, 2014</xref>). Essentially all major mutation-detection algorithms use the signal strength (read count and often other parameters) of known true mutations and false-positive events to predict the likelihood that individual candidate mutations are real and to determine a signal cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cibulskis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mills et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). However, Upton et al. did not employ a read count filter or signal model and therefore considered candidate insertions supported by only a single read as equivalent to the smaller number of candidates with higher read support. As a result, 97% (4634/4759) of their single-cell insertion calls were supported by a single Illumina sequencing read and 99.6% by 1 or 2 reads; 94% of their &gt;320,000 candidates from 'bulk' DNA were also supported by only 1 read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RC-seq read count distributions and junction detection rates of somatic insertion candidates are inconsistent with known true germline insertions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RC-seq read count distributions of bulk and single-cell germline known non-reference (KNR) insertion and somatic candidate calls (see 'Materials and methods').

This proposal can be tested using the read count distribution of a 'gold standard' mutation set. In single-cell samples, somatic insertions should appear at the same signal level distribution as germline known non-reference L1 insertions (KNR), which are population-polymorphic L1 insertions absent from the reference human genome but identified in prior L1 studies. Germline KNR insertions share the same sequence characteristics as somatic insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>) and bear no distinguishing feature that would lead to different read counts. Therefore, KNR insertions can be used to directly test Upton et al.'s model that true insertions preferentially appear at lower read counts than chimeras.</p><p>Using RC-seq single-cell germline KNR insertion data provided by the authors upon request, we found that KNR insertions were detected by much higher read counts than candidate somatic insertions. In single-cell RC-seq samples, 53%, 24% and 20% of the 4049 calls of high-confidence gold-standard KNR insertions were detected with ≥3, ≥20 and ≥40 reads per sample, respectively; only 32% were detected with only 1 read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, 97% (4634/4759) of single-cell somatic insertion candidates were detected with only 1 read and only 0.4% (20/4759) with ≥3 reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The strikingly higher read depths of gold-standard germline KNR L1 insertions relative to somatic insertion candidates in the same experiment is consistent with the vast majority of claimed somatic insertions not corresponding to bona fide insertions.</p><p>Analysis of RC-seq L1 junction detection rates provides additional evidence that nearly all somatic candidates are false-positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). 11% of single-cell KNR insertion calls were detected at both L1 (5' and 3') junctions, whereas &gt;250-fold less— only 0.04% (2/4682)— of single-cell somatic insertion candidates were detected at both junctions. Sequence analysis shows 8 of the 12 hippocampal single-cell somatic candidates detected at both junctions (including candidates in which each junction was detected in a different sample) are chimera artifacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The remainder cannot be excluded as chimeras without full-length PCR validation. Furthermore, RC-seq bulk somatic candidates have a non-canonical distribution of large TSD sizes, inconsistent with nearly all prior L1 research (Appendix 1).

Only 20 somatic insertion candidates supported by &gt;2 reads were detected across all 170 cells, and 12 of these were chimeras upon further sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

However, pooling of MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. achieves high quality and uniformity (low MAPD and MDAD scores) better than single-cell samples from other studies, indicating the low quality of individual single cells from Upton et al. is due to stochastic noise in each single cell likely from factors preceding MALBAC amplification such as poor tissue quality. The higher sequencing depth of MDA single neurons from Evrony et al. and MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. relative to MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. has minimal effect on MAPD/MDAD statistics since Poisson error of read counts in low-resolution 500 kb bins is well below the noise levels due to single-cell amplification even at low sequencing depths. This is confirmed by MAPD/MDAD statistics after subsampling high-coverage samples to lower read depths and by prior analyses in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al. (2015)</xref>.

These genome-wide copy number plots were used to calculate MAPD and MDAD statistics shown in panel A. MAPD and MDAD dispersion statistics are shown for each sample. Orange lines denote ± 1 copy. Purple points are off scale. Note the high quality of MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. at this resolution that achieve uniformity similar to the MDA 100-neuron sample. In contrast, the highest quality MALBAC hippocampus single neuron from Upton et al. (neuron 45–15) has uniformity similar to an average MDA single neuron and an average quality MALBAC neuron from Upton et al. (neuron 42–1) has significantly less uniformity. Although pooling of all Upton et al. normal hippocampus single neurons has uniformity similar to the highest quality MALBAC single cell from Zong et al., this reflects only systematic MALBAC noise since stochastic single-cell noise is mostly removed by pooling. On the other hand, individual MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. achieve high quality with both stochastic single-cell noise and MALBAC noise. This reflects the fact that the low quality of MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. is due to high stochastic noise present in each individual single cell that was likely present prior to MALBAC amplification. The bottom right corner of each plot shows the total sequencing depth of the sample. Plots after subsampling to lower sequencing depth shows that total sequencing depth has only a small effect on low-resolution coverage plots and statistics. Therefore, differences in sequencing depth between samples do not alter the conclusions regarding the quality of single cells from each study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12966.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12966.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12966-fig4-figsupp1-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig4s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.011</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>MDA and MALBAC genome coverage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of genome covered at nucleotide resolution at ≥1x and ≥10x read depth at different subsampled read depths.

Note the slightly improved coverage at ≥10x read depth of pooled MALBAC single neurons from Upton et al. relative to MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. However, this is a comparison between a pooled sample, which cancels stochastic noise present in individual single cells, versus single cells analyzed individually that were not pooled and still contain stochastic noise present in each cell. This suggests that the MALBAC implementation in Upton et al. was commensurate or slightly better than that in Zong et al., but individual cells in Upton et al. are still of significantly lower quality than individual cells in Zong et al.

We could find no precedent or chemical explanation for why PCR or next-generation sequencing would preferentially amplify chimeras, since there are no sequence features distinguishing chimeras from true insertions in small DNA fragments that would cause preferential overamplification of the former in single-cell RC-seq. In fact, prior single-neuron sequencing studies and chimera rates of Illumina libraries and MALBAC show directly that chimeras are not preferentially amplified relative to true genomic sequence fragments and true insertions (Appendix 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, the use of read counts for mutation analysis is integral to one of the prime purposes of single-cell sequencing, a technology whose development was motivated by two goals: (a) tracking which somatic mutations are present together in the same cells to enable lineage tracing; and (b) achieving higher signal to noise ratios for somatic mutations, i.e. true mutation to false-positive read count ratios. In single-cell sequencing, somatic mutations appear on average at the same signal level as germline heterozygous mutations (i.e. 50% of reads at the locus), while the fraction of false variant reads at a locus (e.g. sequencing errors, library PCR mutations, chimeras) is the same on average regardless of the number of cells sequenced. Accordingly, decreasing the number of cells pooled for sequencing increases the signal to noise ratio of somatic mutations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for a simplified mathematical framework for single-cell sequencing). Therefore, calling mutations supported by only a single sequencing read is counter to a key feature and objective of single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, although Upton et al. present qPCR experiments as additional evidence for their findings, it is important that the originators of that qPCR method consider single-cell analysis as definitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erwin et al., 2014</xref>), and qPCR results are affected by target L1 specificity (Appendix 4).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A mathematical framework for single-cell sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In bulk sequencing, a somatic mutation present in <italic>k</italic> out of <italic>n</italic> cells pooled together for sequencing (i.e. mosaicism of <italic>k/n),</italic> with read coverage <italic>D</italic> at the mutation locus, will be detected on average in <italic>k/n</italic>·<italic>D</italic>/2 reads with a variance depending on sampling error; i.e. the number of reads detecting the mutation correlates linearly with the percent mosaicism. In contrast, germline heterozygous and homozygous variants are present in <italic>D/</italic>2 and <italic>D</italic> reads, respectively. Due to sequencing artifacts and sequencing errors, a mutation must be detected above a threshold number of reads, <italic>T</italic>, which also depends on the sequencing depth, <italic>D</italic>, since errors occur at rates, <italic>e</italic>, that are a constant fraction on average of the total number of reads (<italic>T</italic>=<italic>z</italic>·<italic>e</italic>·<italic>D; z</italic> is a constant chosen based on desired detection sensitivity and specificity). The fraction of error reads, <italic>e</italic>, is a constant on average that is independent of total sequencing depth, <italic>D</italic>, because library artifacts and sequencing errors occur at rates that are independent of total sequencing depth. The threshold, <italic>T</italic>, can be reduced with methods reducing sequencing error, but errors are still present in any current sequencing technology. Combining equations simplifies to k/n ≥ 2·z·e. This means that the mosaicism of a somatic mutation must be at least twice the sequencing error rate (or more, depending on the confidence factor) for detection to be possible in bulk DNA sequencing, regardless of sequencing depth. Below a certain level of mosaicism that depends on the sequencing error rate, detection is unlikely. Note: for simplicity, the height of the histograms (# of mutations) is scaled to the same height, and the equations do not include variance terms. (<bold>B</bold>) In single-cell sequencing, somatic mutations are present at the same signal level on average as germline heterozygous variants (i.e. D/2, since k/n = 1), enabling detection of low mosaicism mutations that would otherwise be below detection thresholds of bulk sequencing due to sequencing error. Due to whole genome amplification, single-cell sequencing also leads to greater variance in mutation and error signal level distributions (non-uniform amplification and dropout) and entails additional artifacts not present in bulk sequencing, which increases the noise level, <italic>e'</italic>, but still a lower level on average than true heterozygous mutations. However, the signal distribution of artifacts may still overlap that of true mutations, necessitating careful bioinformatics and modeling of error and true mutation signals along with rigorous validation. Note, for simplicity, the equations here do not include variance terms and bioinformatic modeling usually includes additional parameters other than read count illustrated here. Single-cell sequencing does not achieve increased sensitivity for somatic mutations without cost, because to detect a given mutation with <italic>k/n</italic> mosaicism, more than <italic>n/k</italic> single cells may need to be sequenced. The benefit of single-cell sequencing is not to reduce sequencing costs, but rather its ability to overcome limitations due to sequencing error rates on the minimum mosaicism detectable and maintaining information as to which somatic mutations are found within the same cell, which enables lineage tracing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12966.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12966.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12966-fig5-v3"/></fig></p><p>Finally, we emphasize that the bioinformatic and validation approach led to the inflated somatic insertion rate, but not the RC-seq L1 hybridization capture method itself.

Our findings suggest the following elements may aid future single-cell genomics studies: a) choosing a single-cell amplification method suitable for the studied mutation type; b) objective metrics evaluating genome amplification coverage, uniformity, dropout, and chimera rates at spatial scales and genomic elements relevant to the mutation type; c) use of gold-standard germline mutations and chimera rates to build a signal model for calling mutations; and d) stringent validation experiments. Retrotransposons offer unique advantages as a starting point for developing single-cell genomics methods due to their characteristic sequence signatures allowing definitive validation even when present in only one cell. The lessons learned from the study of somatic retrotransposition are therefore broadly applicable for the nascent field of single-cell genomics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources</title><p>Sequencing data of single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiments from Upton et al. were obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive with accession PRJEB5239.

In any case, the key comparison for evaluating RC-seq somatic candidate veracity is between single-cell KNR insertions and single-cell somatic candidates, not between single-cell KNR insertions and bulk KNR insertions. The latter comparison is useful for assessing the quality of single cells versus bulk samples and the effect of MALBAC amplification.</p><p>Note that germline KNR insertion dropouts in single cells (read counts of 0 for germline KNR insertions in single cells of an individual known to have the KNR insertion based on bulk samples) are not included in the read count histograms since single-cell dropout rates affect both KNR insertions and somatic insertions. While for KNR insertions the true state (presence/absence) in each cell is known, the true state is unknown for somatic insertions. Therefore, in order to compare germline KNR insertion and somatic candidate read count distributions, KNR dropout calls must be excluded.</p><p>Also, note that the read count distribution of gold-standard KNR insertions in single-cell RC-seq is bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with a population of high read count calls and a population of low read count calls. Although KNR insertions appear at lower read depth in single cell RC-seq relative to bulk RC-seq samples and show a bimodal distribution with ~1/3 of calls detected by only one read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), this does not affect the conclusion that the vast majority of single-cell RC-seq somatic insertion candidates are false-positives: only 20 of the 4759 somatic candidates were detected with &gt; 2 reads across all 170 single cells and half of true somatic insertions are expected to be detected at this level based on KNR insertion read counts. However, it does predict that ~1/3 of true somatic insertions would be detected with 1 read. This bimodal distribution of KNR read counts in single-cell RC-seq is due to, both: a) high variability (non-uniformity) in single-cell MALBAC genome amplification at the length scale of L1 insertions (data not shown; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al. (2015)</xref>: Note S1, 'Coverage variability analyses' section, Figure S6, and Figure S7, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al. (2015)</xref> for details of non-uniformity at small length scales &lt; 30 kb inherent to MALBAC); and b) allelic dropout stemming from low-quality of Upton et al. single neurons. The MAPD (median absolute pairwise deviation) metric reflects uniformity of genome coverage at large genomic scales (~500 kb bins), with lower MAPD scores indicating better uniformity. Upton et al. single neurons have mean MAPD scores of 0.53 ± 0.16 (SD), compared to MAPD 0.18 ± 0.06 for MALBAC-amplified single cells from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zong et al. (2012)</xref> and MAPD 0.33 ± 0.06 for MDA-amplified single neurons from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the lower overall read counts of KNR insertions in single cells relative to bulk samples is also partly due to ~3fold lower total reads per sample on average for single-cell samples versus bulk samples. This highlights a further issue when read count filters are not used, in that there is no normalization for different total reads per sample.</p><p>Somatic insertions are present in a single copy in the genome (i.e. heterozygous or hemizygous) in cells harboring the mutation. Most germline KNR insertions (~75%) are present in a single copy per cell as well, since most are in the heterozygous state in individuals of the population. This supports the use of KNR insertions as a reference for the expected read count distribution (and signal distribution of other parameters) of somatic insertions. The evidence that most KNR insertions that are present in an individual are heterozygous is based on measured allele frequencies and genotypes of KNR insertions in prior population studies of L1 polymorphism: a) In the 1000 Genomes project studying mobile element polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>), genotyping of a large number of L1 KNR insertions (see Table S4 in that study) found an average heterozygosity of 0.85 in individuals harboring the insertions (i.e. number of individuals heterozygous/(number heterozygous + number homozygous) for each KNR insertion, averaged across all KNR insertions). The average allele frequency of these insertions was 0.26; b) In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iskow et al. (2010)</xref>, the average allele frequencies of KNR insertions found by dideoxy sequencing was 0.22 (table S1 in that study) and &lt; 0.2 for insertions found by 454 sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> in that study), corresponding to a heterozygosity rate for KNR insertions of at least 0.88 in individuals harboring each insertion (i.e., allele frequency p = 0.22; heterozygosity in individuals with the insertion = 2pq/(p<sup>2</sup>+2pq)) assuming insertions are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Prior studies have shown L1 insertion genotypes are almost always consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Myers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleme et al., 2006</xref>); c) Ewing and Kazazian (2011) also analyzed the 1000 genomes data and found a KNR insertion allele frequency &lt; 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> in that study), corresponding to an average heterozygosity &gt;0.89 for KNR insertions present in an individual; d) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al. (2010)</xref> estimate an allele frequency of chromosome X KNR insertions of 0.58 and an allele frequency of 0.38 for a set of KNR insertions identified by whole-genome profiling, corresponding to an average heterozygosity of 0.59 and 0.77, respectively in individuals harboring the insertions; d) 75% (105/140) of the KNR insertions detected in individual 1465 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al. (2015)</xref> (gold-standard KNR insertions detected in both bulk samples of the individual) are heterozygous or hemizygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>); e) in dbRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), the average heterozygosity of polymorphic insertions among individuals with the insertion is 0.46 (with an average allele frequency of 0.59). This shows that most KNR insertions in an individual are heterozygous and present in a single copy per cell. We also plotted the RC-seq read count histograms of a pure set of single-copy KNR insertions– those found on chromosome X in male samples– and found a similar distribution of read counts as the full KNR set, with most insertions still detected by multiple reads in single cells: 65%, 12%, and 11% were detected with ≥3, ≥20 and ≥40 reads per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>RC-seq somatic candidate read count histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>):</italic> Single-cell RC-seq somatic candidate read counts were obtained from the 'Somatic L1' sheet of Table S2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al.

Junction detection rates of both bulk and single-cell germline KNR insertions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> are for the same high-confidence KNR insertion set defined for the single-cell KNR read count histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (see 'Read count histograms' in the prior section of the 'Materials and methods'). The numerator and denominator units of bulk and single-cell RC-seq KNR junction detection rates are KNR insertion <italic>calls</italic>, not KNR insertions; i.e. for a hypothetical KNR insertion detected in samples A, B, and C, each of these 3 <italic>calls</italic> is counted separately because the detection of a KNR insertion in each sample is independent of other samples.</p><p>Single-cell RC-seq somatic candidate junction detection data were obtained from the 'Somatic L1' sheet of Table S2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al. (2015)</xref>. 5'-only detected candidates are those with a negative alignment in the 'Sense L1' column but no antisense read or a negative alignment in the 'Antisense L1' column but no sense read. 3'-only detected candidates are those with a positive alignment in the 'Sense L1' column but no antisense read or a positive alignment in the 'Antisense L1' column but no sense read. Candidates detected at both 5' and 3' junctions are those with both sense and antisense reads. Note that the 'single-cell somatic candidate' junction data available in Table S2 of Upton et al. annotates junction detection per candidate (regardless of the number of cells in which the candidate was detected), in contrast to the 'single-cell KNR insertion' junction data that annotates junction detection for each individual sample in which the insertion was detected. Since 'single-cell somatic candidate' junction detection data is only available annotated per candidate rather than per cell, somatic candidates detected in multiple cells may skew the true junction detection rates and preclude comparison to 'single-cell KNR insertion' rates. Therefore, to allow comparison between 'single-cell somatic candidate' and 'single-cell KNR insertion' junction detection rates, the 'single-cell somatic candidate' junction detection rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> are for candidates detected in only one cell and excludes those detected in multiple cells. Nevertheless, even when including candidates found in more than one cell (i.e. considering both junctions as detected even when each was detected in a different single cell), only 0.4% (21/4728) of single-cell somatic candidates were detected at both junctions– still &gt;25-fold less than the rate for single-cell KNR insertions (11%) and similar to the single-cell somatic candidate rate of 0.04% (2/4682) calculated when excluding candidates found in multiple cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RC-seq somatic retrotransposon insertion rate calculation</title><p>Briefly, somatic insertion rates were calculated by first counting the number of somatic candidates detected with &gt; 2 reads. Sequences of candidates were then manually examined and definite chimeras were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In each cell, the remaining number of candidates was adjusted for that cell's sensitivity for gold-standard KNR insertions. Insertion rates per cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) are an average of the rates across all single cells of that type. Below is a full explanation of the insertion rate calculations:</p><p>RC-seq somatic retrotransposon insertion rates were calculated using RC-seq read counts of the gold-standard germline KNR insertion set to guide read count filtering. A read count threshold was chosen that would optimize the number of true (germline KNR and somatic) insertions above the threshold (sensitivity) while minimizing the number of false-positive calls (specificity). Sensitivity for true insertions at any given read count threshold was estimated <italic>per single cell</italic> using the single-cell RC-seq KNR insertion read count data provided by Geoffrey Faulkner. Sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of high-confidence germline KNR insertions present in the individual (i.e. insertions detected with ≥ 40 reads in both bulk samples of the individual, and identified in prior non RC-seq L1 profiling studies with a prior study annotated in the 'Database?' column of Upton et al. tables), that were detected in the single cell above the read count threshold. Specificity at any given read count was estimated using the read count distribution of all single-cell somatic candidate calls ('Somatic L1' sheet of Table S2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al. (2015)</xref>) since nearly all are false-positives. As discussed in the main text and in the following paragraph, the latter assumption is valid because of the discrepancy between the read count distributions of KNR insertions versus somatic candidates.</p><p>As discussed above in the 'Read count histograms' section, the single-cell RC-seq KNR insertion read count distribution is bimodal due to non-uniformity of MALBAC amplification, with high and low read-count sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Finite mixture modeling can estimate the proportion of the read count distribution that belongs to each sub-population. Finite mixture modeling estimates the high and low read count sub-populations comprise 1/3 and 2/3 of the single-cell KNR insertion distribution, respectively. In contrast, the read count distribution of single-cell somatic candidates is unimodal, concentrated at low signal with nearly all (99.6%) candidates having ≤ 2 reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Intuitively, the absence of a high-signal component in the somatic candidate read count distribution indicates nearly all somatic candidates are false-positives. Therefore, the somatic candidate read count distribution can be treated essentially as a false-positive distribution for the purposes of deciding on an optimal read count threshold. More formally, any single-cell somatic candidate distribution is a mixture of two subpopulations: false-positive candidates (e.g. chimeras) and true somatic insertions. A finite mixture model can estimate the proportion of somatic candidates that derives from a true somatic insertion subpopulation, using a model of the high read-count component of the true-positive KNR insertion distribution as a guide. This analysis estimates a negligible fraction (&lt; 0.5%) of single-cell somatic candidates are true somatic insertions. Consequently, we can consider the read count distributions of KNR insertions and somatic candidates as reflecting true and false-positives, respectively. This then allows calculation of estimated sensitivity loss and specificity gain at increasing read count thresholds.</p><p>Increasing the read count threshold from &gt;0 to &gt;1 read reduces the per-cell sensitivity for true (KNR) insertion calls from an average of 45% to 31% (a 32% reduction) while reducing the estimated number of false-positive calls by ~97%. Further increasing the threshold to &gt; 2 reads reduces the sensitivity for true insertion calls to 24% (a further 23% reduction) and reduces false-positive calls by an estimated additional ~84% relative to the &gt; 1 read threshold– still a large improvement in specificity with a relatively modest reduction in sensitivity. Increasing the read count threshold further to &gt; 3 reads leads to diminishing returns in terms of improved specificity– 18% reduction in sensitivity with 35% reduction in false-positive calls relative to the &gt; 2 read threshold– reflecting the fact that nearly all somatic candidate (mostly false-positive) calls are at read counts of 1 and 2. Therefore a read count threshold of &gt; 2 reads was chosen, which maintains detection of 53% of KNR insertion calls across all single cells and a per-cell KNR detection sensitivity of 24%, while excluding an estimated 99.6% of false-positive calls.</p><p>Once the &gt; 2 reads count threshold was chosen, for each single cell the number of somatic insertion candidates detected with &gt; 2 reads was counted. Candidate sequences were then manually examined and candidates that were definite chimeras were excluded (see 'RC-seq | Somatic L1 &gt; 2 reads' sheet in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for sequence analyses of all candidates). For each cell, the remaining number of somatic candidates in the cell was then corrected for the sensitivity for gold-standard KNR insertions achieved in that same cell, i.e. dividing the number of somatic candidates by the fraction of KNR insertions detected in the cell above the chosen threshold, using the gold-standard KNR insertion reference of the individual from whom the single-cell derived, as described above. This final number was the estimated pre-PCR validation somatic insertion rate for the cell, since Upton et al. did not attempt PCR validation for these somatic candidates. Insertion rates per cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) are an average of the rates across all single cells of that type.</p><p>Further justification for the &gt; 2 reads threshold is shown by estimates of the pre-PCR validation somatic insertion rate at read thresholds of &gt;1, &gt; 3, and &gt; 4 reads. At a read threshold of &gt;1 read, the estimated pre-PCR validation rate across all cells is 2.4 ± 3.3 (SD) per cell prior to manual examination of candidates for chimeras. Adjusting for the chimera rate of 12/20 seen at the &gt; 2 read threshold (since the chimera rate at a &gt;1 read threshold could only be greater), gives a rate of 1.1 ± 1.4 insertions per cell. At read thresholds of &gt; 3 and &gt; 4 reads, the estimated pre-PCR validation rates across all cells are 0.38 ± 1.35 and 0.44 ± 1.69 (SD), respectively, per cell prior to manual examination of candidates for chimeras. Adjusting for chimera rates of 8/13 and 7/12, respectively, seen in manual examination of the candidates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) yields pre-PCR validation rate estimates of 0.15 ± 0.52 and 0.18 ± 0.70, respectively, for the &gt; 3 and &gt; 4 read thresholds. These are similar to the estimate of 0.19 ± 0.97 at a &gt; 2 read threshold. In summary, the pre-PCR validation rates across all single cells at &gt;1, &gt; 2, &gt; 3, and &gt; 4 read thresholds (after excluding chimeras) are 1.1, 0.19, 0.15, and 0.18, respectively. This shows stability of the rate estimate at thresholds of &gt; 2 reads or more, a result of the fact that the vast majority of chimeras appear with 1 or 2 reads, while most true insertions appear at higher read counts. The stability of the rate estimate above thresholds of &gt; 2 reads supports the use of the &gt; 2 read threshold, which optimizes sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, the somatic rate calculated at the &gt; 1 read threshold is higher than the rates calculated at &gt; 2, &gt; 3, and &gt; 4 reads and a significant overestimate of the true rate for two reasons: a) the &gt; 1 read threshold begins to overlap the false-positive chimera distribution, so most candidates at the &gt; 1 read threshold are chimeras. This is confirmed by the read count histogram analyses of KNR insertions and somatic candidates discussed above– namely that there is no discernible population of high read count candidates in the read count distribution of somatic candidates as there is in the KNR insertion read count distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), so the population of somatic candidates at read counts of 1 and 2 are nearly all false-positives; b) this is a pre-PCR validation rate. The somatic insertion rate estimate obtained at a &gt; 1 read threshold is therefore an overestimate that would be confirmed as such after proper PCR validation, while the rate obtained at a &gt; 2 read threshold is a more accurate pre-PCR validation rate estimate.</p><p>The somatic L1 retrotransposition rate for single neurons from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al.

The 2 remaining cells in which L1 #1 was detected (neurons 2 and 77) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>) were excluded from the rate estimate, because they were a priori chosen for whole-genome sequencing as positive controls known to harbor somatic L1 insertions previously detected by the L1-IP method in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al.

Therefore, the calculated rate reflects the 2 of the 14 single neurons (neurons 6 and 18) that harbor the same L1 #2 clonal insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). The L1 somatic insertion rate estimate of each neuron was corrected for the neuron's sensitivity for KNR insertions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>L1-IP 3' PCR validation</title><p>3' junction PCR validation of 48 L1-IP candidates with low read counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet 'L1-IP | low-read-count') was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al.

candidates</title><boxed-text><sec id="s22" sec-type="appendix"><p>The distribution of TSD sizes of RC-seq bulk hippocampus somatic candidates contains many large TSDs, a finding inconsistent with nearly all prior L1 research. Of the RC-seq bulk somatic candidates detected at both 5' and 3' junctions, 44%, 37%, and 30% of candidates were detected with TSDs ≥ 30, ≥ 40, and ≥ 50 bp in size, respectively. In contrast, prior L1 research has shown TSD sizes &lt; 30 bp for nearly all insertions.

Each can be assessed at different genomic scales (i.e. resolutions) or sequence elements, for example, in large 500 kb bins, at base-pair resolution, stratified by GC-content, at retrotransposon elements, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Breadth and uniformity of genome amplification are related and can vary significantly depending on the genomic scale or sequence element evaluated. For instance, if a hypothetical single-cell genome amplification method amplifies only one small 1 kb region every 500 kb across the genome while the remaining genome is unamplified (i.e. extreme non-uniformity), then a low-resolution analysis of breadth of amplification will show 100% genome coverage at 500 kb bins even though at base-pair resolution only 0.2% (1/500) of the genome is amplified. Such a single-cell method would be suitable for analysis of copy number variants larger than 500 kb, but would not be suitable for smaller mutations. Single-cell amplification breadth and uniformity of coverage must therefore be evaluated at genomic size scales and sequence elements relevant to the type(s) of mutation(s) being studied. We profiled the MALBAC-amplified single neurons from Upton, et al. using previously developed single-cell quality metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and compared them to MDA-amplified single neurons and MALBAC-amplified single cells from prior studies.</p></sec><sec id="s24" sec-type="appendix"><title>I. Single-cell quality control performed by Upton, et al.</title><p>Upton, et al. initially evaluated single-cell quality and MALBAC amplification by low-coverage sequencing at a resolution of 600 kb bins, estimating 8% allelic dropout and 0.8% locus dropout. However, a scale of 600 kb bins is larger than the size of retrotransposon insertions (&lt; 6 kb) or the DNA fragments used to detect them (&lt; 300 bp). Upton, et al. then evaluated single-cell quality at higher resolution by detection of reference L1-Ta insertions, a genomic scale that is relevant to retrotransposon analysis. Single-cell 5' junction PCR of a set of germline heterozygous L1 insertions detected 50% of junctions. Therefore, Upton, et al.'s MALBAC single cells have greater dropout of L1 element junctions (50%) than the dropout measured at 600 kb bins (0.8%), indicating non-uniformity of genome coverage at small genome scales relative to large genomic scales. This illustrates the importance of analyzing genome amplification uniformity. In contrast, prior MDA single-neuron studies analyzed amplification uniformity and yielded consistent estimates of 8–10% allelic and ~2% locus dropout across the full range of genomic scales, including 500 kb bins, microsatellites (&lt;400 bp), single nucleotide variants, genome-wide base-pair resolution, and direct measurement of L1 dropout by PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s25" sec-type="appendix"><title>II.

The similarity of the peaks and troughs in hippocampus and cortex single neurons indicates systematic non-uniformity. Remarkably, MALBAC single cells from Zong, et al. have peaks and troughs of coverage in similar locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating the non-uniformity is due to MALBAC amplification.

These comparisons indicate similar performance of MALBAC amplification in the two studies but do not mean that individual single cells in the two studies achieved similar genome coverage, because the breadth of genome coverage for pooled Upton, et al. single neurons is likely an overestimate of coverage in individual single cells due to pooling canceling stochastic noise/dropout of individual cells.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Low-resolution genome coverage</title><p>We evaluated uniformity of genome coverage/amplification in individual Upton, et al. single neurons at larger genomic scales of ~500 kb bins (low-resolution view) using median absolute pairwise deviation (MAPD) and median absolute deviation from the median (MDAD) scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). Lower scores indicate more uniform coverage. This analysis was performed for individual single hippocampal neurons without pooling, since the low-coverage WGS is sufficient for low-resolution analysis of individual cells. Upton, et al. MALBAC-amplified single neurons have both greater variability among cells and significantly lower average quality of genome coverage/uniformity (MAPD 0.53 ± 0.16) than both MALBAC-amplified single cells from Zong, et al.

Therefore, the low quality of Upton, et al. single neurons is not due to systematic noise but rather due to stochastic non-uniformity present in each individual neuron, likely preceding MALBAC amplification, that cancels after pooling. This suggests low quality of single cells prior to MALBAC amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Power spectral density and Lorenz curve analysis of genome coverage</title><p>The above analyses evaluated single-cell genome coverage uniformity at two specific genomic scales/resolutions– single base pairs (high resolution) and 500 kb bins (low resolution).

The latter is likely due to pooling of Upton et al. single neurons removing their stochastic noise whereas Lorenz curves of individual MALBAC cells from Zong et al. also reflect stochastic single cell noise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s29" sec-type="appendix"><title>IV. Conclusions</title><p>Our analyses of Upton, et al. single cells confirm the better uniformity of MDA at small genomic scales (&lt;50 kb) suitable for study of small mutations, for example SNVs and retrotransposons, whereas MALBAC has better uniformity at larger genomic scales suitable for study of large copy number variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). DOP-PCR methods not presented here have better uniformity than either method at large genomic scales but lower uniformity at smaller genomic scales, making it suitable mostly for large (&gt;50 kb) copy number variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navin and Hicks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Navin et al., 2011</xref>). Because each single-cell amplification method has advantages in different domains, the choice of method depends on the type of mutation being studied– there is no current method ideally suited for all types of mutations. Rigorous evaluation of dropout and uniformity at the size scale of the somatic mutation being studied is imperative prior to undertaking costly downstream single-cell sequencing and somatic mutation analyses.</p><p>Our low-coverage analyses of Upton, et al. single neurons also revealed lower quality and greater variability among individual cells compared to prior single-cell studies. Quantitative quality control metrics of single cells prior to costly higher coverage or targeted sequencing can reveal differences in quality between tissues and helps exclude low quality tissues and single cells that would otherwise produce high false-positive or false-negative rates.</p><p>Note that at small genomic scales, MALBAC single cells from Zong, et al. have significantly better reproducibility, though not uniformity, than MDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>); the loci at which peaks of coverage are found and the shapes of the peaks are highly reproducible between single cells. This suggests one potential advantage for MALBAC over MDA amplification for studying small-scale mutations such as single nucleotide variants if one were interested only in the areas of the genome reproducibly amplified to high coverage by MALBAC (i.e. at the loci with peaks of coverage). In applications seeking to ensure capture and genotyping of the same loci across all profiled single cells, MALBAC's better reproducibility between samples may be advantageous relative to MDA despite MALBAC's lower breadth of coverage and greater non-uniformity at small genomic scales.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app3"><title>Appendix 3: Single-neuron sequencing does not preferentially amplify chimeras</title><boxed-text><sec id="s30" sec-type="appendix"><p>Upton, et al. state that in single-neuron RC-seq, as opposed to bulk RC-seq, chimeras are preferentially amplified to higher read counts than true insertions. They further assert the same is true generally of single-neuron sequencing, including prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). However, analysis of Upton, et al.'s single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data shows directly that the authors' single-cell MALBAC amplification and WGS library preparation methods do not preferentially create and amplify chimeras relative to true genomic fragments. Chimera rates are reflected in the fraction of discordant read pairs (DNA fragments whose sequencing reads from each end of the fragment align distantly in the genome or in wrong orientation to each other) and clipped reads (partially aligning reads, which includes reads with chimera breakpoints occurring within a read rather than between read pairs of a DNA fragment). Discordant and clipped reads in Upton, et al. single cells comprise on average only 0.9 ± 0.5% (SD) and 4.2 ± 1.7% of all reads, respectively. Similar fractions of discordant and clipped reads, 2.3 ± 1.4% and 1.4 ± 0.3%, respectively, were seen in MALBAC single cells from a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zong et al., 2012</xref>) (analysis performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al. (2015)</xref>). If it were true, as Upton, et al. assert, that chimeras amplify to higher levels than true genomic fragments, then these rates would have been significantly greater. The low discordant and clipped read rates in Upton, et al. single cells confirm that chimeras are a small minority of their samples' DNA fragments, and that their MALBAC and WGS library preparation methods do not preferentially amplify chimeras more than true genomic fragments to any significant degree.</p><p>Extensive quantitative analyses of chimeras in prior single-cell studies show that chimeras occur at significantly lower rates than non-chimeric fragments also in the MDA method more commonly used for single-cell amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). Only 0.4% of DNA fragments in MDA-amplified single cells are MDA chimeras, reflecting an MDA chimera rate of ~1.2 per 100 kb of amplified DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). An additional 2-3% of fragments in single-neuron WGS samples are chimeras created during sequencing library preparation, reflected in 1.9 ± 0.5% and 0.8 ± 0.2%, discordant and clipped reads, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>), which could be mitigated by alternative library preparation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quail et al., 2008</xref>). Single-neuron WGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>) has no additional steps in which chimeras could form other than MDA and WGS library preparation. This study further presented MDA chimera spatial distributions that elucidate their mechanisms of formation and aid computational filtering. The above analyses and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lasken and Stockwell, 2007</xref>) have therefore shown unequivocally that chimeras are a minority of reads in single-cell sequencing methods generally (i.e. the number of bases amplified between chimera events is on average much larger than the size of sequenced DNA fragments).</p><p>Additionally, both Upton, et al. and prior single-neuron sequencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>) show unequivocally that true L1 insertions appear at higher read counts than chimera calls. In prior studies, the score distributions (reflecting read counts) of gold-standard KNR insertions in single cells have a unimodal distribution at high scores (i.e. at high read counts), clearly separable from the remaining calls concentrated at lower scores (reflecting chimeras) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>, Figure S4B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The KNR read count distributions of both Upton, et al. and these prior studies show the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), contradicting Upton, et al.'s suggestion that chimeras appear at higher read counts than true insertions. Therefore, in these methods and in single-cell sequencing generally, insertion calls supported by single reads would have negligible probability of being true insertions.</p><p>Upton, et al. further support their claim that single-neuron sequencing preferentially amplifies chimeras by remarking on the low PCR validation rate among high-scoring final L1-IP candidates of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al. (2012)</xref> (low specificity) as an indication that many true candidates at low scores are being missed (low sensitivity). This confuses specificity with sensitivity: low specificity among candidate mutations does not imply low sensitivity for true mutations. L1-IP's sensitivity is high, in fact significantly higher than RC-seq, as measured using the gold-standard KNR insertion reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as single-copy (heterozygous and hemizygous) KNR and human genome reference insertions, the most stringent performance measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). L1-IP's specificity performance is due to the very small fraction of chimeras that are at higher scores outnumbering the very small number of true somatic insertions, highlighting the challenge of chimeras in single-cell retrotransposon analysis in the setting of low retrotransposition rates. Notably, the challenge of computational specificity was readily overcome with a definitive 3' PCR validation approach with near-perfect sensitivity and high specificity, followed by full-length validation with perfect specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>). We emphasize that as in any signal-noise problem where true events are distributed at higher signal than false events, lowering a threshold to include more true events at lower scores would only decrease specificity by including a relatively greater number of false-positive calls– i.e. the proportion of chimeras among candidates called with a lower threshold can only be greater than the proportion among candidates called with a higher threshold. Additional PCR validation illustrates this: 24 randomly selected L1-IP candidates supported by one read and 24 candidates randomly selected without any read count filter all failed PCR validation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet &quot;L1-IP | low-read-count&quot;), illustrating the need for signal modeling based on read counts and other parameters using a gold-standard true mutation reference.</p><p>A subsequent single-neuron WGS method was motivated precisely to increase computational specificity by its ability to detect most insertions at both 5’ and 3’ junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, the four highest scoring candidates found by this method were bona fide somatic insertions, i.e. greatly improved specificity while retaining high sensitivity. For this reason single-cell whole-genome sequencing coupled with full-length validation is the definitive, (albeit a costly) method for the study of somatic retrotransposition. It is also able to profile multiple retrotransposon types (Alu, L1, SVA) as well as other types of somatic mutation (structural variants, single-nucleotide variants) in one experiment. Targeted methods such as L1-IP and RC-seq if used with an appropriate single-cell amplification method such as MDA, careful signal modeling based on true insertions, and rigorous PCR validation, are cost-effective alternatives for high-throughput studies focused on one type of retrotransposon across many cells.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app4"><title>Appendix 4: L1 qPCR copy number assay</title><boxed-text><sec id="s31" sec-type="appendix"><p>Upton et al.

In other words, DNA polymerase depends on the 5' end of the primer only to the extent that it aids in hybridization and stability of the 3' end. In this case, the 3'-most 20 bp of the forward primer match equally well to the L1Hs and L1Pa consensus sequences. Therefore, in order for the PCR reaction to specifically and preferentially amplify L1Hs and not L1Pa elements, the stringency of the PCR reaction would need to be calibrated to allow amplification only when at least the 3'-most <italic>21bp</italic> match to the template while not allowing amplification when only the 3'-most <italic>20bp</italic> match to the template (i.e. a single base mismatch stringency for the 3<sup>rd</sup> base from the 5' end of the 23 bp forward primer). Such a calibration was not performed by Upton et al. and achieving such a precise PCR stringency/specificity is unlikely using this primer design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bru et al., 2008</xref>). A prior study recognized the need for L1Hs specificity in this assay and sequenced amplicons from the qPCR reaction, finding that most amplicons corresponded to L1Hs rather than L1Pa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>; table S3). However, this result may be because the primers are incorporated into the amplicons during PCR such that the diagnostic base discriminating between L1Hs and L1Pa would be lost and replaced by the primer sequence.</p><p>Therefore, the absolute number of non-L1Hs elements amplified by the assay depends on whether the PCR reaction can discriminate templates matching the 3<sup>rd</sup> base of the forward primer (i.e. matching the L1Hs-specific nucleotide). If the PCR reaction only amplifies templates matching this diagnostic base, 214 L1 elements are predicted to be amplified per the UCSC In-Silico PCR tool, most of which (88%) are L1Hs and the remainder L1Pa2-4. However, without the specificity provided by the 3<sup>rd</sup> base of the forward primer, 5,166 L1 elements are predicted to be amplified from the human genome, i.e. ~24 times as many L1 elements, of which only 527 (10%) are L1Hs, and the remainder are 1136 (22%) L1Pa2, 2047 (40%) L1Pa3, 1203 (23%) L1Pa4, 178 (3%) L1Pa5, and other older L1 elements. Moreover, the ORF2 #1 Taqman probe matches the majority (71%) of these elements with no mismatches and nearly all (95%) with 1 mismatch. As a result, most of the L1 elements amplified and quantified by the qPCR assay may be older inactive L1Pa elements rather than retrotranspositionally active L1Hs elements.</p><p>Because qPCR measures relative changes in copy number, targeting of mostly inactive L1Pa elements would in turn cause a decrease in sensitivity for detection of L1Hs copy number changes. Additionally, any purported <italic>relative</italic> increase in copy number indicated by the assay would mean more dramatic <italic>absolute</italic> increases in L1 copy number, because relative copy number increases are measured relative to the <italic>total</italic> number of L1 elements amplified by the assay. For example, without specificity for L1Hs elements, even a modest 5% relative copy number increase in this assay would correspond to ~258 (5% * 5,166) additional L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell. And the 30-40% relative copy number differences shown by the assay in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Upton et al., 2015</xref>) would reflect differences of ~1550–2070 L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell. qPCR estimates of hundreds to thousands of additional L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell are biologically unlikely due to the immense mutational burden implied and are inconsistent with even the highest prior estimates of somatic retrotransposition. Furthermore, bulk tissue is profiled by this assay, so the above rate would be revised even further upwards for neurons if retrotransposition were occurring at higher rates in neurons than other cell types.</p><p>In light of the above, the qPCR and RC-seq results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D–E</xref> of Upton, et al. (2015) are inconsistent. Comparing individuals CTRL-36 and CTRL-55 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows ~45 and ~15 somatic insertions, respectively, per individual by RC-seq, while the L1 qPCR assay shows a difference of ~30% in L1 copy number between the individuals. However, a 30% <italic>relative</italic> difference in L1 copy number measured by the qPCR assay would be equivalent to an implausible <italic>absolute</italic> difference at least one order of magnitude larger than that measured by RC-seq; i.e. &gt;300 and perhaps up to ~1500 somatic insertions depending on the number of L1 elements amplified by qPCR.</p><p>There are inevitable random and frequent systematic sources of error inherent to qPCR, including sample preparation, pipetting, and instrumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Jimenez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weaver et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whale et al., 2012</xref>). Robust detection of small (&lt; 10%) relative copy number differences is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weaver et al., 2010</xref>). Even with sufficient replicates to eliminate random error, systematic error sources may remain. One systematic error may be differential extraction of normalizer genes’ DNA (alpha-satellite DNA) relative to L1 DNA from tissue samples; similar biases have been observed in a mitochondrial DNA qPCR assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the large L1 copy number differences suggested by Upton et al.'s qPCR data are unlikely to be explained by non-retrotransposition mediated processes such as structural variation or aneuploidy, as this is inconsistent with recent studies showing that large genome-wide copy number variation and aneuploidy are infrequent enough to account for such large L1 copy number changes, at least in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McConnell et al., 2013</xref>). Even if an improved L1 qPCR assay addressing the above issues were designed, it would still be unable to differentiate changes in L1 copy number due to retrotransposition from those not due to retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff9"><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard University</institution>, <country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

The arguments depend on the estimated rate of transposition events. Technically challenging single neuron genomics experiments have given discrepant estimates of &lt;1 new L1 insertion per neuron (Evrony et al. 2012; 2015) versus 13-16 insertions per neuron (Upton et al., 2015). Here, Evrony et al. present a thorough critique of the data analysis and conclusions of the Upton paper, arguing that the Upton analysis overestimated the rate by &gt;50x, and that the actual rate is about 0.2 insertions per neuron, thus resolving the discrepancy with previous results.</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor unanimously agree that your manuscript makes a convincing case. The burden of proof is high to publish such a direct and strongly-worded refutation of another group's results, but we agree that your manuscript meets that bar, and that this important and careful critique is strongly deserving of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after minor revision.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>We would like you to address the following two points in a revision:</p><p>1) The paper's main point should be made more succinctly. The most convincing section of the analysis is the clear difference between the read count data supporting &quot;known germline insertions&quot; (KNR) and novel insertion candidates. In general, the rest of the manuscript, and particularly the appendices, feels somewhat bloated. Specifically: a) the section toward the end of the manuscript on MALBEC vs. MDA could be significantly shortened and b) the &quot;framework for single-cell genomics&quot; in the final section of the manuscript seems like an attempt to spin a larger story out of a single case of an apparently flawed data analysis. This single case does not necessarily reflect a larger problem in the field that justifies a broad call for standardization, and the call for &quot;shared standards&quot; feels premature, given the rapid changes in the field. The paper would be stronger if this section were deleted or condensed to at most a few sentences.</p><p>2) You should soften the tone of the paper so that it's less likely to be perceived as combative. Your points are overwhelmingly and substantively supported. They will stand strongly on their own without rhetoric.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12966.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Required revisions: We would like you to address the following two points in a revision: 1) The paper's main point should be made more succinctly.
