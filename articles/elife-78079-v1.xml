differentiate and migrate radially. Analyses of cerebral organoids thus far have been performed in sectioned tissue or in superficial layers due to their high scattering properties. Here, we demonstrate label-free three-photon imaging of whole, uncleared intact organoids (~2 mm depth) to assess early events of early human brain development. Optimizing a custom-made three-photon microscope to image intact cerebral organoids generated from Rett Syndrome patients, we show defects in the ventricular zone volumetric structure of mutant organoids compared to isogenic control organoids. Long-term imaging live organoids reveals that shorter migration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migrating neurons are associated with more tortuous trajectories. Our label-free imaging system constitutes a particularly useful platform for tracking normal and abnormal development in individual organoids, as well as for screening therapeutic molecules via intact organoid imaging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>label-free imaging</kwd><kwd>multiphoton imaging</kwd><kwd>cerebral organoids</kwd><kwd>rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>deep tissue imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EB027706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildirim</surname><given-names>Murat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH085802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sur</surname><given-names>Mriganka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS090473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sur</surname><given-names>Mriganka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-EB015871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>So</surname><given-names>Peter TC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EF1451125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sur</surname><given-names>Mriganka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Guo-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Li-Huei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Label-free three-photon imaging of whole, uncleared intact organoids generated from Rett syndrome patients show shorter migration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migrating neurons with more tortuous trajectories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cerebral organoids derived from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells are unique in their ability to recapitulate early events of embryonic brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>). These spheroid structures contain progenitor-rich zones around ventricle-like cavities akin to ventricular zones (VZ) from which neuronal progenitors migrate radially to generate the cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">PaÅca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mariani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kadoshima et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, they have been used to model neurogenesis-relevant human pathologies such as microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), licencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>), heterotopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>), Zika virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dang et al., 2016</xref>), and idiopathic autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mariani et al., 2015</xref>). Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a pleiotropic regulator of gene expression and impacts multiple components of brain development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ip et al., 2018</xref>). Structural deficits described in postmortem RTT human brains include reduced cortical thickness, cell size and dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauman et al., 1995</xref>) and reduced cerebral volume in MR imaging of RTT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter et al., 2008</xref>). These deficits are paralleled by reductions in dendritic arborization, soma size and spine density described in RTT mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kishi and Macklis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shahbazian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smrt et al., 2007</xref>). 2D human stem cell models of RTT, generated by reprogramming of patient cells or genome editing, have revealed deficits in human RTT neurons including aberrant transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trujillo et al., 2021</xref>), impaired neuronal maturation and electrophysiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farra et al., 2012</xref>), and up- or down-regulation of key signaling pathways and activity-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Using fixed tissue slices from 3D cerebral organoids, we have recently demonstrated impaired proliferation of the progenitor pool and delayed maturation and presumed migration of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellios et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with human postmortem deficits. However, the use of fixed tissues did not allow cell tracking and analysis of parameters such as speed and trajectory of neuronal displacement; thus the dynamics and cellular mechanisms of the presumptive migration deficit remain to be characterized. Significantly, live cell time-lapse imaging of radial migration of MECP2-deficient neurons from the VZ to CP inside intact live 3D organoids has not been performed so far.</p><p>The majority of analyses of cerebral organoids have been performed in sectioned tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karzbrun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miura et al., 2020</xref>), although recent progress has been made in studying migration using labeled neurons in organoid models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajaj et al., 2021</xref>), including assembloid preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). However, labeled live cell imaging generally requires phototoxic dyes and limited incubation conditions, and results as well in labeling mostly peripheral neurons and cells which are not ideal for long-term imaging and for finding ventricular like zones in 3D intact organoids. Even with viral labeling, subtle damage to neuronal integrity can be sometimes detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>). Optically, cerebral organoids appear opaque due to the optical density of neuronal tissues and the large number of apoptotic cells in the center of 3D intact conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>). Thus, label-free and high-resolution deep-tissue imaging are ideally required to perform intact organoid imaging.</p><p>Third-harmonic generation (THG) is an intrinsic signal which results from tripling of the frequency of the excitation wavelength. THG signal is either generated at structural interfaces such as local transitions of the refractive index or inside the materials whose third order nonlinear susceptibility Ï<sup>3</sup> is higher. Thus, THG excitation of biological tissues occurs predominantly at interfaces that are formed between aqueous interstitial fluids and lipid-rich structures, such as cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rehberg et al., 2011</xref>) and lipid bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DÃ©barre et al., 2006</xref>). Both standard three-photon fluorescence microscopy and THG microscopy rely on three-photon interaction between ultrashort pulses and tissues. Three-photon fluorescence microscopy and THG microscopy has been recently used to perform structural and functional brain imaging in anesthetized and awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>). These studies are based on utilizing a green (GCaMP) genetically engineered calcium indicator (exogenous fluorophores) with their excitation wavelength (1300 nm) which provides peak absorption cross-sections for this indicator. In these three-photon fluorescence microscopy studies, three photons with enough peak power at these excitation wavelengths excite electrons from ground state to excitation states of this indicator. Then, these electrons release their energy while they return to their ground states. During this relaxation, they release emitted photons which have a large 1/e<sup>2</sup> bandwidth of fluorescence emission (70 nm for GCaMP6s/f). Therefore, an exogenous label is required to perform three-photon fluorescence structural or functional brain imaging. On the other hand, THG microscopy does not need any label for structural three-photon brain imaging. In addition, three photons with enough peak power at the excitation wavelengths excite electrons from ground state to virtual state so that these electrons do not lose any energy when they come back to the ground state. Therefore, they release emitted photons which have a small 1/e<sup>2</sup> bandwidth of emission (~20 nm). Therefore, the emission spectrum of THG imaging occurs at exactly 1/3 of the excitation wavelength.</p><p>Overall, three-photon fluorescence microscopy is valuable for performing structural and functional brain imaging with fluorescent dyes for which the excitation wavelengths are limited by the peak absorption cross-sections of these fluorophores. However, three-photon fluorescence imaging is prone to phototoxicity and photobleaching particularly with high peak intensity pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, THG microscopy provides label-free structural brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yildirim et al., 2020</xref>) without problems of phototoxicity and photobleaching - which are its strengths for long-term live cell imaging of cerebral organoids. Optimized designs using high power lasers and high sensitivity photomultipliers have enabled the application of THG microscopy to 3D tissue microscopy by improving the imaging depth in tissues with varying scattering coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DÃ©barre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yildirim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yelin and Silberberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gualda et al., 2008</xref>).

We demonstrate that high resolution label-free THG signal can be collected from intact cerebral organoids. Comparing organoids from RTT patients and isogenic controls, we show that the ventricular zone in mutant organoids has larger volume, larger surface area, and lower ventricular thickness compared to isogenic control organoids. Finally, label-free live cell imaging provides a unique way of observing neuronal migration inside the VZ/SVZ and CP of developing organoids without any phototoxicitiy or photobleaching, and reveals that the smaller ventricular thickness in mutant organoids is associated with shorter migration distances, more tortuous trajectories, and slower migration speeds of radially migrating neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimized system for label-free THG imaging of intact cerebral organoids</title><p>We developed a three-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>) and modified it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>, see Materials and methods) to perform label free THG imaging of intact, uncleared, fixed and live organoids. Since low average laser power is essential for live cell imaging, we focused on optimizing laser and microscopy parameters to reduce the average power requirement for intact organoid imaging. First, we utilized moderate repetition rate (&lt;1 MHz) to maximize the energy per pulse and reduce the average laser power requirement for THG imaging. Second, we minimized the pulse width on the sample by building an external pulse compressor. The pulse width on the sample was reduced to 27 fs in the deepest part of the organoids (see Materials and methods) enabling us to further reduce the average power requirement by two- to threefold compared to other three-photon studies in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weisenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

Nuclear stain was used as a control to localize the high cell density VZ from the low cell density CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Strikingly, THG imaging provided a clean delineation between VZ and CP as THG signal intensity was lower in the former area than the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>). The intrinsic THG signal mostly arose distinctly from cell membranes. Consequently, the THG signal nicely revealed the typical radially elongated and bipolar radial glia cell morphology as well as the round-shaped somata of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>). Additionally, neurons in the CP and newborn neurons inside the VZ showed high intensity somatic signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>).

Especially for live cell imaging, the one photon imaging depth is limited to 20 Âµm, with improvement to 40 Âµm with tunable refractive-index matching medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boothe et al., 2017</xref>). Two photon imaging depth is limited to a couple of hundred micrometers with live cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mansour et al., 2018</xref>). To image intact and uncleared organoids, we thus developed custom three-photon microscopy to perform both fluorescence and label free (THG) three-photon imaging. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that three-photon fluorescence and THG microscopy is capable of high spatial resolution imaging deep within intact human cerebral organoids, enabling 3D imaging of intact cerebral organoids as well as long-term live cell time-lapse imaging of radially migrating neurons in intact cerebral organoids. Since we used moderate repetition rate of the laser (800 kHz), uniquely reduced the pulse width &lt;30 fs in the deepest parts of the organoid for the first time (see Materials and methods), and optimized the intermediate optics in the excitation and emission paths, the average power on the surface of the organoids did not exceed 5 mW, which induced no noticeable tissue damage such as cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6</xref>). No specific processing of the fixed organoids, such as clearing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>) was necessary; however, incubation in index matching solution improved the imaging depth if necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Most of the THG signal we observed in RTT-WT and RTT-MT organoids arose from cellular membranes or showed a high-intensity somatic profile observed mostly in the CP region. It was shown previously that the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsai et al., 2011</xref>) and several organelles in the cell cytoplasm could generate a THG signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yelin and Silberberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barzda et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we propose that the bright somatic signal is the result of the high concentration of organelles in the neuronal soma. THG imaging of intact fixed organoids provided clear demarcation between VZ and CP structures, likely due to differences in cell composition, morphology and density in these regions. This clear label-free demarcation of VZ and CP further allowed us to characterize VZ 3D structures in RTT-WT and RTT-MT organoids. We characterized the extinction lengths of RTT-WT and RTT-MT organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâE</xref>) and found that average extinction length of WT organoids is significantly higher than that of MT organoids. We suggest that higher surface area with lower radial thickness in MT organoids resulted in irregular shapes of ventricular zones. In addition, the number of ventricular zones in MT organoids is significantly higher than in WT organoids. Therefore, higher number of irregular shaped ventricular zones may induce more scattering in MT organoids which results in their lower extinction lengths. Moreover, a bright THG signal arose from neuronal soma, allowing live cell tracking of migrating neurons in the VZ. To check the source of THG signal in the VZ, we labeled migrating neurons with GFP through electroporation. We showed that more than 85% of the GFP positive cells had also significant THG signal, suggesting that label-free THG imaging of live cerebral organoids can reveal the migration trajectories and deficits at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplements 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). In addition, we also performed DCX staining to the same field of view that we imaged with our system. This staining also shows that THG signal is mostly overlapped with DCX signal which indicates that THG signal is mostly populated in the cortical plate but not in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our findings of 3D morphological alterations in RTT-MT organoids including an increase in total ventricular zone volume, a significant increase in ventricular zone surface area, and a significant decrease in mean ventricle thickness, enable noninvasive and comprehensive quantification of organoids consistent with enhanced proliferation of the progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellios et al., 2011</xref>). As VZ expansion is uniquely different in human versus mouse neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>), it is likely that this phenotype would go unobserved in mouse (or other lissencephalic) models of RTT. Moreover, we and others previously suggested with endpoint experiments that the putative migration of young neurons through the VZ is impaired in mice after in utero electroporation of Mecp2-sh RNA as well as in human RTT cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mellios et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedogni et al., 2016</xref>). However, the dynamics of the migration deficit were never previously characterized. Thus, here we performed label-free live cell tracking in intact and uncleared human cerebral organoids at different depths and locations to explore the dynamics of neuronal radial migration in RTT-WT and RTT-MT organoids. RTT-MT neurons demonstrated reduced migration speed and less straight trajectories and consequently a lowered displacement than RTT-WT cells in cerebral organoids at 5 weeks. Furthermore, these trends in migration speed were independent of the imaging depth or the imaging location in both MT and WT organoids. Although there was a range of radial thickness in MT organoids, lower migration speed and tortuous migration patterns were common. Altered cytoskeleton dynamics have been previously suggested in rat, mouse and human models of Rett syndrome and could contribute to migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaufmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DelÃ©pine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DelÃ©pine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cortelazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacherjee et al., 2017</xref>). Non-cell autonomous effects could also contribute to the neuronal radial migration deficit, such as impaired cell-to-cell communication, adhesion and radial glia dysfunction. Further studies are required to study the mechanisms responsible for the migration deficit as well as to rescue the phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in ventricular wall thickness result not only from the decreased neurogenesis and increased proliferation of the progenitor pool but also from the abnormally slow displacement and tortuous trajectory of the neurons. Importantly, our findings directly demonstrate dynamic deficits in migration at very early stages of prenatal development which provide insight into previously described deficits in human RTT brains, including reduced cortical thickness, cell size and dendritic arborization, and reduced cerebral volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our study demonstrates the promise of three-photon and label-free THG imaging for monitoring spatiotemporal dynamics in intact and uncleared human cerebral organoids. We believe that our optimized three-photon microscopy system is straightforward to use, and can provide a new platform for monitoring structural and functional abnormalities in fixed and live organoids derived from patients with neurogenetic disorders as well as for therapeutic drug screening. In addition, we can study phenotypes in calcium activity in neurons especially VZ calcium dynamics such as waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weissman et al., 2004</xref>) as well as their migration deficits in cerebral organoids. In addition, we can capture structural phenotypes in myelinated axons and endothelial cells (microvasculature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yildirim et al., 2020</xref>). We believe that imaging myelinated axons as well as endothelial cells can be used for studying brain disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimerâs disease with cerebral organoids since there is a significant loss of myelin as well as reduction of blood flow in these diseases, respectively. Finally, it should be possible to perform structural and functional three-photon and THG imaging for revealing structural and functional phenotypes for cancer applications such as glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Custom microscope for three-photon and THG imaging</title><p>To obtain an excitation wavelength of 1300 nm required for label-free THG imaging deep within intact organoids, ultrashort laser pulses (300 fs, 400 kHz,16W) at 1045 nm from a pump laser (Spirit, Spectra Physics) were sent to a noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA, Spectra Physics). In order to shorten the pulse width on the sample to maximize the generated THG signal, we built a two-prism based external compressor to prechirp the pulse before sending it to the microscope. The internal compressor in NOPA could compress the Gaussian pulse width to 22 fs (which was the transform limited pulse width for 110 nm spectral full width half maximum bandwidth). Due to the dispersion in the microscope, the Gaussian pulse width on the sample was ~250 fs. After dispersing the pulse with 65 cm long prism-pair, and silicon broadband window (Thorlabs, WG81050) the pulse width on the sample was reduced to 27 fs in the deepest part of the organoids (pulse widths &lt;30 fs obtained, to our knowledge, for the first time). To measure the pulse width inside the organoids, we placed a live organoid (&lt;1 mm thickness) on the external sensor of the autocorrelator (CARPE). Then, we measured the pulse width of the laser after it exits from the thick organoid. In addition, we built a delay line to double the repetition rate thereby increasing the frame rate of THG imaging. Subsequently, the frame rate at 512 Ã 512 pixel resolution was increased up to 2 Hz. Power control was performed with a combination of half-wave plate (AHWP05M-1600, Thorlabs) and low-GDD ultrafast beamsplitter (UFBS2080, Thorlabs) with 100:1 extinction ratio. The laser beams were scanned by a pair of galvonometric mirrors (6215 H, Cambridge Technologies) to image the laser spot on the back aperture of the objective using a pair of custom-designed scan and tube lenses. A pair of collection lenses for three photon-multiplying tubes (PMT) collected the emitted signal from the cerebral organoids. To maximize the signal detected in PMTs, optics in both excitation and emission paths were optimized considering the objective lens using Zemax software. Fluorescent signals from immunostaining labels (7AAD) were detected using GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (H7422A-40, Hamamatsu, Japan) and a bandpass filter (Semrock, 650/70 nm), and THG signal was detected using bialkali (BA) photomultiplier tube (R7600U-200) and a narrow-bandwidth bandpass filter (430/20 nm). A custom designed objective lens (25 x, 1.05 N.A., Olympus) was used. Automated image acquisition, control of scanners, and sample stage were carried out using ScanImage (Vidrio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). Imaged cells were located at a depth of 0â2000 Î¼m below the surface of cerebral organoids. The images were taken with 2 Âµm and 5 Âµm axial increments in fixed and live organoids, respectively. In live cell imaging, we acquired 50â100 z-stack images to make a volumetric acquisition. This volumetric imaging took approximately 3â6 min and we repeated it every 20 min. Laser power ranged from 0.5 to 5 mW at the sample depending on depth and fluorescence expression levels. Both fixed and live organoids were placed on a two-axis motorized stage (MMBP, Scientifica) and the objective lens was placed on a single-axis motorized stage (MMBP, Scientifica) to move it in the axial direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Methods for fixed and live organoid imaging</title><p>For fixed organoid imaging, five-week-old cerebral organoids were placed into an imaging chamber gasket (C18161, ThermoFisher) filled with index-matching medium Hprotos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murray et al., 2015</xref>).

To perform whole fixed organoid imaging, automatic serial imaging of multiple sites was performed via determining the coordinates of four corners of the entire field of view. A Matlab-based algorithm moved the stage in the required x and y axis locations to image the full field of view and then moved the focal plane in the z direction.</p><p>For live organoid imaging, we increased the imaging field of view from 250 Âµm to 320 Âµm.

All iPSC lines were primarily and routinely quality-controlled by karyotyping (G-band), mycoplasma testing and pluripotency testing (initially by teratoma test then routinely by immunostaining for pluripotency markers such as Sox2 and Oct4). We examined allele-specific transcription of the MECP2 gene in all the iPSC lines by performing RNA extraction, reverse transcription, PCR and Sanger sequencing of the amplified fragments. In all lines we were able to detect transcription of either the wildtype or the mutant alleles of the MECP2 gene, but not both, confirming the clonality and X inactivation status. We confirmed that the X inactivation profile is maintained at all stages of the organoid differentiation. Cell culture quality check and authentication were performed every ten iPSC passages. iPSC colonies were grown in iPSC media, consisting of 20% Knock-out Serum Replacement (KOSR) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.5% L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 ÂµM 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad), DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF (Stemgent).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Label-free three-photon imaging of intact human cerebral organoids: tracking early events in brain development and deficits in Rett Syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anita Bhattacharyya (Reviewer #1); Simon R Schultz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The prior literature in this area of research is not put in perspective well to reflect the current approaches in organoid imaging. There is a significant body of literature describing migration imaging using brain organoid models, including ones that use intact (not sliced) assembloid preparations not cited in the paper, as opposed to what's been suggested by the authors (Lines 60 and 61; Lines 258 and 259). These studies use viral labeling to visualize the cells of interest during long-term (days-long) migration imaging without seemingly affecting organoid health, again as opposed to what's been suggested (Line 66). Please revise to reflect more accurately what's been achievable by the current state of the art. This surely does not take away from the novelty of the 3P/THG method but better clarifies the limitations being addressed. Please see references in Reviewer 3's comments below.</p><p>2) A major issue in the field of stem cell modeling of disease is how well the model recapitulates the disease. Please comment on how the phenotypes (less migration) in organoids inform our understanding of RTT. How does phenotype relate to patient neuropathology?</p><p>3) Is the RTT migration phenotype caused solely by the more tortuous VZ region they need to navigate? Once they reach THG-high regions (cortical plate), does the phenotype recover? If not, does this indicate additional cell-intrinsic deficits?</p><p>4) Please tone down the narrative in the introduction in which the dichotomy between intact 3D and sliced 2D structures is highlighted. While these are certainly different, both are still 3D and will benefit from deep tissue imaging techniques.</p><p>5) For clarity of the manuscript to a wide audience, please include some discussion contrasting THG with standard three-photon excitation.</p><p>6) An expanded discussion could serve readers well to envision the true potential of the 3P/THG system. Do the authors envision additional features can be extracted in older (e.g. myelinated axons) or novel (e.g. organoids with endothelia) organoids using their models? Is THG-coupled calcium imaging possible, for example where one can couple VZ calcium dynamics, such as waves (Weissman et al., 2004), to neuronal dynamics? Can other disorders that cause structural abnormalities like cancers, tuberous sclerosis, or heterotopias be modeled using organoids and differentiated from one another using the 3P/THG signal?</p><p>7) On L343 &quot;incubation in index matching solution improved the imaging depth&quot; does not seem to be described in the Methods, please describe. Please also clarify whether this was quantified through attenuation length, maximum depth at which cells could be observed, or another measure.</p><p>8) Some explanations are proposed for the result that WT and MT organoids show a different attenuation length. Were any measurements made to validate these explanations? The stated structural differences would appear to be measureable from 3D organoid stacks, and thus may provide support to the conjecture.</p><p>9) To better understand how the two different RTT iPSC isogenic pairs are measured and presented throughout the results, please use different colors or shapes to indicate data from the two lines so that it is clear that two lines were assessed and the data combined. Please also include more information in the results or legends for clarification of the data being presented (different lines, differences between lines, number of experimental batches, etc).</p><p>10) Please report actual p values, degrees of freedom (when relevant) and n for each t-test, and define the error bars (SEM, 90% CI, etc).</p><p>11) In Figure 6, it looks like the data is pooled from organoids that were imaged for different periods of time. If so, it is misleading to report statistical differences between WT and MT groups. Please clarify.</p><p>Note: Several validation studies were suggested in the reviews. The translation of THG signal to its cellular correlates is important and likely to present ongoing issues if this becomes a more commonplace imaging practice. However, given the strength of the technical advance and that this is the first proof-of-principle demonstration, we are not requiring further validation experiments at this time. If you already have data to address the issues, we highly encourage you to incorporate them into your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Two major issues remain:</p><p>Throughout the results, it is not clear how the two different RTT iPSC isogenic pairs are measured and presented. Although some information is in Supplementary figures, the data would be better presented with the two lines separated by color/shape to make it clear that two lines were assessed and the data combined. Information in the figure legend or results should provide additional clarification. Were all data from different lines combined? Are there differences between lines? How many experimental batches were done?</p><p>A major issue in the field of stem cell modeling of disease is how well the model recapitulates the disease. The authors should comment on how the phenotypes (less migration) in organoids inform our understanding of RTT. How does phenotype relate to patient neuropathology?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think the Intro slightly over-eggs some things in making the justification for the work. Firstly it is noted that sectioning induces unwanted tissue damage and cell loss. Yes, but this neglects that sectioning is intrinsically part of some cerebral organoid protocols, in order to mature them: as increasing numbers of neurons are produced, they are progressively pushed inside and undergo necrosis. The way of getting around this (and maturing 3D organoid structures over much longer timeframes) has been to slice the organoids and then maintain organotypic organoid slice cultures over long time periods. Thus the dichotomy made between intact 3D structures and sliced 2D structures in prior work is not really valid â there is much ongoing work on engineered cerebral organoids that occupy a middle ground.</p><p>For clarity of the manuscript to a wide audience, I think it would help a lot to contrast THG with standard three-photon excitation. Some readers may be confused (and not all 3P is THG). Several sentences around lines 68-69 might suffice. Citations [41-43] are made about THG in the brain, but really only [42] is about THG, the others relate to 3PEF.</p><p>Figure 2 â scale bars are missing lengths.</p><p>Figure 3 â You use both attenuation length and extinction length â are you referring to the same thing? Perhaps keep terminology consistent.</p><p>Figure 3 â please report the p-value and n for the t-test, it is not acceptable in this day and age to just say p&lt;0.05. (Actually, I think it would be more useful to report effect size.) In the main text also: L219 is that an S.E.M. or 90% confidence interval? L220 state the test, n, df (if relevant), and actually produced a p-value. Given that from the figure, n=4, I'm not convinced that this is sufficiently powered, it seems to be in the danger zone, so should be reported and described carefully. Statistical reporting from L229 seems much better.</p><p>L260 what is DIV? Also, do you mean 1 frame being captured every 20 minutes or a sequence of frames?</p><p>Figure 6 â I am slightly puzzled by the displacement statistics shown here. It looks like the data pooled is from organoids that are imaged for different periods of time, in which case it is misleading to report statistical differences between WT and MT groups. I imagine the &quot;straightness&quot; measure would also be biased by the inclusion of samples recorded from different imaging durations.</p><p>L343 &quot;incubation in index matching solution improved the imaging depth&quot;. I could not find this in the Methods, can you please detail? Also, did you quantify this through attenuation length, maximum depth at which cells could be observed, or another measure?</p><p>L355 you propose some explanations for the result that WT and MT organoids show a different attenuation length. Did you make any measurements to validate these explanations? The stated structural differences would appear to be measurable from 3D organoid stacks, and thus may provide support to the conjecture.</p><p>L413 exits rather than exists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have three broad critiques in regard to the cited literature, validation experiments, and additional applications:</p><p>1) Prior literature: Authors should revise the text to better reflect the current approaches in organoid imaging. There is a significant body of literature describing migration imaging using brain organoid models (e.g. Birey et al., 2017; Bagley et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017; Klaus et al., 2019; Bajaj et al., 2021; Birey et al., 2022), including ones that use intact (not sliced) assembloid preparations not cited in the paper (Xiang et al., 2017; Birey et al., 2017, 2022), as opposed to what's been suggested by the authors (Lines 60 and 61; Lines 258 and 259). These studies use viral labeling to visualize the cells of interest during long-term (days-long) migration imaging without seemingly affecting organoid health, again as opposed to what's been suggested (Line 66). Authors should revise to reflect more accurately what's been achievable by the current state of the art. This surely does not take away from the novelty of the 3P/THG method but better clarifies the limitations being addressed.</p><p>2) Validation experiments: In early characterization experiments, authors convincingly show that THG signal is higher in regions populated with neurons compared to denser VZ-like regions populated with progenitors. As it is important to translate the THG single as accurately as possible, similar validation experiments are needed to better link THG dynamics to specific cellular events in the following phenotyping experiments. For example, the authors show a higher surface area and about a 2-fold increase in the number of ventricles in RTT organoids. An optical clearing approach for the SA quantification and/or a simple cryosection quantification for the number of VZ-like zones should be able to reveal a change of this magnitude. Authors electroporate a CAG-driven plasmid to visualize cells that they have previously reported, albeit in three samples, to almost exclusively (~95%) capture neurons (Delepine et al., 2021). As the rationale as to why a generic promoter shows lineage selectivity is unclear and as the imaging field of interest also includes other cell types that migrate in a similar fashion (i.e. radial glia that go inter-kinetic nuclear migration), a parallel labeling strategy, e.g. lineage-specific viral vectors or expression vectors with different promoters, to further delineate the specific lineage captured by the THG signal would be informative. For example, Figure 3A and B show VZ-like regions with high TGH signal within their cores, which are unlikely to be neurons. This could resolve questions of this nature.</p><p>3) Is the RTT migration phenotype caused solely by the more tortuous VZ region they need to navigate? Once they reach THG-high regions (cortical plate), does the phenotype recover? If not, does this indicate additional cell-intrinsic deficits?</p><p>4) An expanded discussion could serve the reader well to envision the true potential of the 3P/THG system. Do the authors envision additional features can be extracted in older (e.g. myelinated axons) or novel (e.g. organoids with endothelia) organoids using their models? Is THG-coupled calcium imaging possible, for example where one can couple VZ calcium dynamics, such as waves (Weissman et al., 2004), to neuronal dynamics? Can other disorders that cause structural abnormalities like cancers, tuberous sclerosis, or heterotopias be modeled using organoids and differentiated from one another using the 3P/THG signal?</p><p>References:</p><p>Bagley, J.A., Reumann, D., Bian, S., LÃ©vi-Strauss, J., and Knoblich, J.A.

There is a significant body of literature describing migration imaging using brain organoid models, including ones that use intact (not sliced) assembloid preparations not cited in the paper, as opposed to what's been suggested by the authors (Lines 60 and 61; Lines 258 and 259). These studies use viral labeling to visualize the cells of interest during long-term (days-long) migration imaging without seemingly affecting organoid health, again as opposed to what's been suggested (Line 66). Please revise to reflect more accurately what's been achievable by the current state of the art. This surely does not take away from the novelty of the 3P/THG method but better clarifies the limitations being addressed. Please see references in Reviewer 3's comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and have now included the suggested references in the main text of the revised manuscript (Lines 64-66). As a small point, while live cell imaging has been done in intact organoids with viral labeling, it is not clear that a viral strategy is the best for long-term imaging and preserving organoid health. In our recent paper performed in awake mouse brain (Yildirim et al., 2019), we found laser power regimes which have adverse (but not visible) effects on the physiological responses of virally labeled neurons, in addition to the higher laser power regime which can induce visible damage and optical breakdown. We have explained this briefly (Lines 69-70) as a further justification for using label-free approaches, importantly in conjunction with high-resolution deep-tissue imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major issue in the field of stem cell modeling of disease is how well the model recapitulates the disease. Please comment on how the phenotypes (less migration) in organoids inform our understanding of RTT. How does phenotype relate to patient neuropathology?</p></disp-quote><p>The vast majority of the literature has focused on the role of MeCP2 in postnatal brain maturation and function, mainly in mouse models, and relatively little is known about its effects in prenatal brain development. Structural deficits described in postmortem RTT human brains include reduced cortical thickness, cell size and dendritic arborization (Bauman et al., 1995; Armstrong et al., 1995), and reduced cerebral volume in MR imaging of RTT patients (Carter et al., 2008). These deficits are paralleled by reductions in dendritic arborization, soma size and spine density described in RTT mouse models (Smrt et al., 2007; Fukuda et al., 2005; Kishi and Macklis, 2004; Shahbazian et al., 2002). This is now mentioned in the Introduction (Lines 48-52).</p><p>Our previous work demonstrated impaired proliferation of the progenitor pool and delayed maturation and presumed migration of neurons (Mellios et al., 2018), consistent with the human postmortem deficits. However, as we point out, the use of fixed tissues did not allow cell tracking and analysis of parameters such as speed and trajectory of neuronal displacement; thus the dynamics and mechanisms of the presumptive migration deficit remain to be characterized. Our present findings directly demonstrate deficits in migration at very early stages of prenatal development which, together with deficits mentioned above and described as âcurtailment of developmentâ (Bauman et al., 1995), provide insight into early events which underlie the structural phenotypes of cortical development in RTT. This is now noted in the Discussion (Lines 427-430).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is the RTT migration phenotype caused solely by the more tortuous VZ region they need to navigate? Once they reach THG-high regions (cortical plate), does the phenotype recover? If not, does this indicate additional cell-intrinsic deficits?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain whether the RTT migration phenotype caused solely by more tortuous VZ region since we do not have long-term (potentially spanning several months) imaging data to reveal how cells migrate in the cortical plate. However, we have two working hypothesis that we would like to test. In the first hypothesis, the migration phenotype recovers when cells start to form the cortical plate since their differentiation into different neuronal cell types is fairly complete. We can address this by labeling neurons in the cortical plate with different cell-specific markers in addition to analyzing their migration patterns. In the second hypothesis, migration phenotypes especially for inhibitory neurons may continue while cortical layers are being formed. In this case, delayed neurodevelopment may cause disproportionately small and layered brain regions as well as disruption of excitation and inhibition (EI) balance. Although rare in the clinic, it is reported that some male babies born with a mutant MECP2 allele display disproportionately small frontal and temporal lobes characteristic of a prenatal pathogenesis (Schule et al., 2008). Recent studies have also demonstrated cell-autonomous deficits in GABA signaling, including that GABA is less hyperpolarizing in MeCP2-deficient mice (Banerjee et al., 2016) and in iPSC derived neurons generated from RTT patients (Tang et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please tone down the narrative in the introduction in which the dichotomy between intact 3D and sliced 2D structures is highlighted. While these are certainly different, both are still 3D and will benefit from deep tissue imaging techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the narrative in the introduction about dichotomy between intact 3D and sliced 2D structures. We now focus on challenges in 3D imaging of intact organoids and how to deal with them with label-free 3-photon imaging (Lines 64-73).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For clarity of the manuscript to a wide audience, please include some discussion contrasting THG with standard three-photon excitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded on our earlier description of three-photon fluorescence microscopy and THG microscopy in the Introduction. As reviewers suggested, we have now added more explanation about these microscopy techniques (Lines 79-96).</p><p>Both standard three-photon fluorescence microscopy and THG microscopy occur based on a three-photon interaction between ultrashort pulses and tissues. Three-photon fluorescence microscopy has been recently used to perform functional and structural brain imaging in anesthetized and awake mice (Ouzounov et al., 2017, Yildirim et al., 2019). These studies are based on utilizing a green (GCaMP) genetically engineered calcium indicator (exogenous fluorophores) with their corresponding excitation wavelengths (1300 nm) which provide peak absorption cross-sections for this indicator. In these three-photon fluorescence microscopy studies, three photons with enough peak power at these excitation wavelengths excite electrons from ground state to excitation states of this indicator. Then, these electrons release their energy while they return to their ground states. During this relaxation, they release emitted photons which have a large 1/e<sup>2</sup> bandwidth of fluorescence emission (70 nm for GcaMP6s/f). Therefore, they require an exogenous label with large bandwidth of emission spectrum to perform three-photon fluorescence structural or functional brain imaging. On the other hand, THG microscopy does not need to have any label to perform structural three-photon brain imaging. In addition, three photons with enough peak power at the excitation wavelengths excite electrons from ground state to virtual state so that these electrons do not lose any energy when they come back to the ground state. Therefore, they release emitted photons which have a small 1/e<sup>2</sup> bandwidth of emission (~20 nm), and the emission spectrum of THG imaging happens at exactly 1/3 of the excitation wavelength.</p><p>Overall, three-photon fluorescence microscopy is valuable for performing structural and functional brain imaging with fluorescent dyes for which the excitation wavelengths are limited by the peak absorption cross-sections of these fluorophores. However, three-photon fluorescence imaging is prone to phototoxicity and photobleaching particularly with high peak intensity pulses (Yildirim et al., 2019). In contrast, THG microscopy provides label-free structural brain imaging (Yildirim et al., 2020) without problems of phototoxicity and photobleaching â which are its strengths for long-term live cell imaging of cerebral organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An expanded discussion could serve readers well to envision the true potential of the 3P/THG system. Do the authors envision additional features can be extracted in older (e.g. myelinated axons) or novel (e.g. organoids with endothelia) organoids using their models? Is THG-coupled calcium imaging possible, for example where one can couple VZ calcium dynamics, such as waves (Weissman et al., 2004), to neuronal dynamics? Can other disorders that cause structural abnormalities like cancers, tuberous sclerosis, or heterotopias be odelled using organoids and differentiated from one another using the 3P/THG signal?</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewersâ suggestion, we have added a paragraph (Lines 436-444) to discuss possible applications of our label-free imaging system coupled with three-photon fluorescence imaging for different disorders. First, it is feasible to combine label free THG imaging and three-photon calcium imaging as shown in our recent paper (Yildirim et al., 2019). Therefore, we can also capture phenotypes in calcium activity in neurons in addition to their migration deficits in cerebral organoids. In addition, we can also capture structural phenotypes in myelinated axons and endothelial cells (microvasculature). We showed recently (Yildirim et al., 2020) that one can image calcium dynamics, myelinated axons, as well as microvasculature (three-color imaging) in the cortex and in the white matter of primary and higher visual areas of awake mice. We believe that imaging myelinated axons as well as endothelial cells can be used for studying brain disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimerâs Disease since there is a significant loss of myelin as well as reduction of blood flow in these diseases, respectively. Finally, it is possible to perform structural, and functional three-photon and THG imaging for revealing structural and functional phenotypes for cancer applications such as glioblastoma (Bakker et al., 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) On L343 &quot;incubation in index matching solution improved the imaging depth&quot; does not seem to be described in the Methods, please describe. Please also clarify whether this was quantified through attenuation length, maximum depth at which cells could be observed, or another measure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the effect of index matching solution on the imaging depth. We did not need to apply any index matching solution for 60% of the WT and MT organoids that we used in this study. For the remaining organoids, index matching gel improved the imaging depth up to about 50% as we quantified Supp. Figure 19 in the revised manuscript. We described the incubation of cerebral organoids in index-matching solution in the Methods (Lines 597-600).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Some explanations are proposed for the result that WT and MT organoids show a different attenuation length. Were any measurements made to validate these explanations? The stated structural differences would appear to be measureable from 3D organoid stacks, and thus may provide support to the conjecture.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained the differences in extinction lengths of WT and MT organoids based on the results that we presented in Figure 3C. We suggest that higher surface area with lower radial thickness in MT organoids resulted in irregular shapes of ventricular zones. In addition, number of ventricular zones in MT organoids is significantly higher than that of WT organoids. Therefore, higher number of irregular shaped ventricular zones may induce more scattering in MT organoids which results in their lower extinction lengths. We have added this additional explanation in the Discussion (lines 390-394).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) To better understand how the two different RTT iPSC isogenic pairs are measured and presented throughout the results, please use different colors or shapes to indicate data from the two lines so that it is clear that two lines were assessed and the data combined.

If so, it is misleading to report statistical differences between WT and MT groups. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewers pointed out, we agree that pooling the data from the cells that are not imaged for 12 hours is not reasonable for reporting statistical differences especially in displacement values of cells. These cells generally disappeared from the field of view before finishing 12 hours of imaging, therefore their values are limited to shorter time durations. We removed the data from these cells and updated figures 5 and 6 and supplementary figures 14,16-17 in the revised manuscript. Also, we updated the corresponding figure captions and reported values in the manuscript (lines 300-301, 304, 306, 314-315, 318-319).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note: Several validation studies were suggested in the reviews. The translation of THG signal to its cellular correlates is important and likely to present ongoing issues if this becomes a more commonplace imaging practice. However, given the strength of the technical advance and that this is the first proof-of-principle demonstration, we are not requiring further validation experiments at this time. If you already have data to address the issues, we highly encourage you to incorporate them into your revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers again for appreciating the technical advance of our paper, and we agree that it is the first proof-of-principle of THG imaging for intact cerebral organoids with application to Rett syndrome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Two major issues remain:</p><p>Throughout the results, it is not clear how the two different RTT iPSC isogenic pairs are measured and presented.

Information in the figure legend or results should provide additional clarification. Were all data from different lines combined? Are there differences between lines? How many experimental batches were done?</p></disp-quote><p>We explained whether we combined the data from both lines or not in each figure in the corresponding figure captions (Figures 2- 6 and Supp. Figures 5-8, 13, 15, 18, 20).</p><p>In terms of structural parameters (volume, surface area, volume per area and number of cerebral organoids), we observed no differences between WT and MT organoids of both lines. For example, MT organoids have larger surface area, lower volume/area thickness, and higher number of ventricular regions than those in WT organoids independent of the lines. When we focus on individual parameters, we can see some slight differences in absolute values of these parameters in MT and WT organoids in each line. For example, MT and WT organoids in Line 2 have higher number of ventricular regions as well as higher surface area compared to those in Line 1. Whereas, MT and WT organoids in Line 1 have higher volume/area thickness compared that of Line 2. Finally, WT organoids in Line 2 have higher ventricular volume compared to that in Line 1 whereas MT organoids in Line 1 have higher ventricular volume than that of Line 2.</p><p>In terms of migration parameters (overall displacement, average speed, and straightness), we found no differences between WT and MT organoids of both lines.

Firstly it is noted that sectioning induces unwanted tissue damage and cell loss. Yes, but this neglects that sectioning is intrinsically part of some cerebral organoid protocols, in order to mature them: as increasing numbers of neurons are produced, they are progressively pushed inside and undergo necrosis. The way of getting around this (and maturing 3D organoid structures over much longer timeframes) has been to slice the organoids and then maintain organotypic organoid slice cultures over long time periods. Thus the dichotomy made between intact 3D structures and sliced 2D structures in prior work is not really valid â there is much ongoing work on engineered cerebral organoids that occupy a middle ground.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the wording about dichotomy between 2d and 3d preparations of cerebral organoids in the Introduction and Discussion.

As it is important to translate the THG single as accurately as possible, similar validation experiments are needed to better link THG dynamics to specific cellular events in the following phenotyping experiments. For example, the authors show a higher surface area and about a 2-fold increase in the number of ventricles in RTT organoids. An optical clearing approach for the SA quantification and/or a simple cryosection quantification for the number of VZ-like zones should be able to reveal a change of this magnitude. Authors electroporate a CAG-driven plasmid to visualize cells that they have previously reported, albeit in three samples, to almost exclusively (~95%) capture neurons (Delepine et al., 2021). As the rationale as to why a generic promoter shows lineage selectivity is unclear and as the imaging field of interest also includes other cell types that migrate in a similar fashion (i.e. radial glia that go inter-kinetic nuclear migration), a parallel labeling strategy, e.g. lineage-specific viral vectors or expression vectors with different promoters, to further delineate the specific lineage captured by the THG signal would be informative. For example, Figure 3A and B show VZ-like regions with high TGH signal within their cores, which are unlikely to be neurons. This could resolve questions of this nature.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestions.
