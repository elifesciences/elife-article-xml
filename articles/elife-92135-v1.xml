genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can cause foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and other conditions in children that affect their physical and mental development. Many countries advise women who are pregnant or trying to conceive to avoid drinking alcohol entirely. However, surveys of large groups of women in Western countries indicate that most women continue drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol until they discover they are pregnant and then stop consuming alcohol for the rest of their pregnancy. It remains unclear how this common drinking pattern affects the foetus.</p><p>The instructions needed to build and maintain a human body are stored within molecules of DNA. Some regions of DNA called genes contain the instructions to make proteins, which perform many tasks in the body. Other so-called ‘non-coding’ regions do not code for any proteins but instead have roles in regulating gene activity. One way cells control which genes are switched on or off is adding or removing tags known as methyl groups to certain locations on DNA. Previous studies indicate that alcohol may affect how children develop by changing the patterns of methyl tags on DNA.</p><p>To investigate the effect of moderate drinking during the early stages of pregnancy, Bestry et al. exposed pregnant mice to alcohol and examined how this affected the patterns of methyl tags on DNA in their offspring. The experiments found moderate levels of alcohol were sufficient to alter the patterns of methyl tags in the brains and livers of the newborn mice. Most of the changes were observed in non-coding regions of DNA, suggesting alcohol may affect how large groups of genes are regulated. Fewer changes in the patterns of methyl tags were found in mice whose mothers had diets rich in two essential nutrients known as folate and choline.</p><p>Further experiments found that some of the affected mouse genes were similar to genes linked to foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and other related conditions in humans. These findings highlight the potential risks of consuming even moderate levels of alcohol during pregnancy and suggest that a maternal diet rich in folate and choline may help mitigate some of the harmful effects on the developing foetus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigeneome</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>114601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name><name><surname>Symons</surname><given-names>Martyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006065</institution-id><institution>Department of Health, Government of Western Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WACRF2019/20 R8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larcombe</surname><given-names>Alexander N</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name><name><surname>Muggli</surname><given-names>Evelyne</given-names></name><name><surname>Halliday</surname><given-names>Jane</given-names></name><name><surname>Hutchinson</surname><given-names>Delyse</given-names></name><name><surname>Buckberry</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name><name><surname>Lister</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Symons</surname><given-names>Martyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Martino</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Early moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy was sufficient to disrupt the fetal epigenome in newborn mice, and high folate maternal diets had a mitigating effect.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol consumption in pregnancy is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Popova et al., 2023</xref>). Alcohol can pass through the placenta acting as a teratogen in fetal tissues causing physical, cognitive, behavioural, and neurodevelopmental impairment in children at high doses with lifelong consequences for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2021</xref>). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can arise at binge levels of exposure, although not always at lower levels of exposure. Whether prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is sufficient to induce overt physiological abnormalities depends on multiple environmental and genetic factors including the dose and timing of alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal diet, smoking, stress, and potentially other factors that collectively influence fetal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sambo and Goldman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy vary, but epidemiological surveys suggest most women in Western countries consume low to moderate levels between conception until recognition of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2022</xref>), after which time consumption largely ceases, apart from occasional use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCormack et al., 2017</xref>). While the effects of binge levels of exposure are well documented as able to cause FASD, more subtle effects that reflect the more common patterns of drinking are unclear and more research is needed to support public health initiatives to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy.</p><p>Studies suggest alcohol can disrupt fetal gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bestry et al., 2022</xref>). DNA methylation is one epigenetic mechanism involving the catalytic addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases within cytosine-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide motifs during one-carbon metabolism. Methylation of DNA can alter chromatin density and influence patterns of gene expression in a tissue-specific and developmentally appropriate manner and disruption to this process may cause some of the difficulties experienced by people with FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin and Liu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fransquet et al., 2016</xref>).

Our recent systematic review, however, found limited replication of effects between studies suggesting the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation may be stochastic and influenced by numerous confounding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bestry et al., 2022</xref>). PAE can either directly inhibit DNA methyltransferase enzymes or disrupt one-carbon metabolism via inhibition of bioavailability of dietary methyl donors, such as folate and choline to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hutson et al., 2012</xref>). Choline, in particular, has been explored in several clinical trials to reduce cognitive deficits caused by PAE in affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wozniak et al., 2020</xref>), or when administered during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>), with results suggesting a high methyl donor (HMD) diet could at least partially mitigate the adverse effects of PAE on various behavioural outcomes.</p><p>Given the lack of clarity around the effects of typical patterns of alcohol consumption, which often do not cause observable phenotypes, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of early moderate PAE in mice. Regions identified as sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure were replicated in human cohorts. The study was a controlled intervention investigating the impact of early moderate PAE on offspring DNA methylation comparing exposed and unexposed mice, with an additional arm comparing the effect of alcohol exposure in the context of an HMD maternal diet. The exposure period covers the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans when neurulation occurs, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muggli et al., 2016</xref>). The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation and secondary outcomes of behavioural deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD were also examined. We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for unbiased assessment of CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zakhari, 2006</xref>), to explore tissue specificity of effects and to determine any ‘tissue agnostic’ effects which may have arisen prior to the germ layers separating in early gastrulation. We also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE. Our study provides cogent evidence that common patterns of drinking can have measurable effects on fetal gene regulation, highlighting a role for maternal dietary support in public health interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparison of prenatal characteristics across treatment groups</title><p>To investigate the effects of early moderate PAE and an HMD diet across pregnancy on offspring DNA methylation and behavioural outcomes, we employed a murine model with four treatment groups.

alcohol-sensitive regions</title><p>We also undertook a replication analysis in our murine data of previously published alcohol-sensitive regions by undertaking a systematic review of previously published mammalian studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bestry et al., 2022</xref>). Candidate gene studies identified 21 CpG sites (FDR&lt;0.05) in the brain from 15,132 CpG sites tested, including two sites in the <italic>Mest</italic> (<italic>Peg1</italic>) gene and 19 sites in <italic>Kcnq1</italic> (<italic>KvDMR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). There were nine FDR-significant CpG sites identified in the liver out of 15,382 CpG sites tested, all of which were in <italic>Peg3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref>). All FDR-significant CpG sites from both tissues had higher DNA methylation in mice with PAE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that moderate early (first trimester) PAE was sufficient to induce site-specific differences to DNA methylation in newborn pups without causing overt behavioural outcomes in adult mice. Although global levels of DNA methylation were not significantly different with PAE, regional analysis demonstrated widespread effects characterised predominantly by lower DNA methylation with PAE, mostly at non-coding regions of the genome. In our model, alcohol effects on DNA methylation were predominantly tissue-specific, with only two genomic regions and four genes that were similarly affected in both liver and brain. These perturbations may have been established stochastically because of PAE to the early embryo and maintained in the differentiating tissue. Further analysis in different germ layer tissues is required to formally establish this. Indeed, most of the observed effects were tissue-specific, with more perturbations to the epigenome observable in liver tissue, which may reflect the liver’s specific role in metabolic detoxification of alcohol. Alternatively, cell-type composition differences between brain and liver might explain differential sensitivity to alcohol effects. Generally, DMRs were enriched in non-coding regions of the genome with regulatory potential, suggesting alcohol has broad effects on genome regulation.</p><p>Both the human replication studies and the candidate gene analysis provide validity to our model for recapitulating some of the genomic disturbances reported in patients with clinical FASD. It is remarkable that some associations identified in our murine model of early moderate exposure were recapitulated in human subjects with FASD despite species and biosample differences, suggesting that at least some DNA methylation changes are stable over time. Notably the effect size for replicated regions were strikingly smaller in blood samples from subjects with FASD suggesting the dose and duration of exposure may need to exceed a high threshold to survive reprogramming in the blood. We speculate this may explain lack of reproducibility in the AQUA cohort.</p><p>In the candidate gene analysis we replicated previously published reports of decreased DNA methylation within <italic>Peg3</italic> and <italic>KvDMR1</italic> from South African children with FAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masemola et al., 2015</xref>). Both genes are methylated in a parent-of-origin specific manner, suggesting that alcohol may affect imprinting processes. Previous rodent and human studies have identified DNA methylation differences with PAE in imprinted regions such as the <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Portales-Casamar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Downing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), although results are not entirely consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marjonen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stouder et al., 2011</xref>). On the balance of this, we speculate duration of exposure, dose, and other tissue-related factors all likely influence the extent to which genome regulation is perturbed and manifests as differences in DNA methylation.</p><p>Our results are encouraging for biomarker studies and aid in the prioritisation of associations for future follow-up, particularly in relation to diagnosis of FASD. For example, three genes that were validated in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lussier et al., 2018</xref> cohort are zinc finger proteins (<italic>RP9</italic>, <italic>PEX12</italic>, and <italic>ZNF823</italic>) that play an important role in fetal gene regulation. Notably, <italic>PEX12</italic> is associated with Zellweger syndrome, which is a rare peroxisome biogenesis disorder (the most severe variant of peroxisome biogenesis disorder spectrum), characterised by neuronal migration defects in the brain, dysmorphic craniofacial features, profound hypotonia, neonatal seizures, and liver dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konkoľová et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Future studies could perform transcriptomic analysis to investigate. Another key finding from this study was that HMD mitigated some of the effects of PAE on DNA methylation. Although a plausible alternative explanation is that some of the PAE regions were not reproduced in the set of mice given the folate diet, our data are consistent with preclinical studies of choline supplementation in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otero et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, a subset of PAE regions were statistically replicated in subjects with FASD, suggestive of robust associations. Although our findings should be interpreted with caution, they collectively support the notion that alcohol-induced perturbation of epigenetic regulation may occur, at least in part, through disruption of the one-carbon metabolism. The most encouraging aspect of this relates to the potential utility for evidence-informed recommendations for dietary advice or supplementation, particularly in population groups with limited access to antenatal care or healthy food choices.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the use of controlled interventions coupled with comprehensive assessment of the effects of PAE on multiple tissues. We also performed WGBS representing the gold standard in DNA methylation analysis, which to our knowledge has not been performed before in the context of murine PAE studies. Our findings were partially generalisable in replication studies addressing the robustness of our experimental approach. Caveats of our study design include a limited ability to determine the contribution of specific cell types within tissues to the methylation differences observed, and we did not assess markers of brain or liver physiology. Additionally, we employed an ad libitum alcohol exposure model rather than direct dosing of dams. Although the trajectories of alcohol consumption were not statistically different between groups, this introduces more variability into alcohol exposure patterns, and might impact offspring methylation data. Despite these limitations, the results were meaningful in the context of typical patterns of alcohol consumption in human populations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that early moderate PAE can disturb fetal genome regulation in mice and humans and supports current public health advice that alcohol consumption during pregnancy, even at low doses, may be harmful.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Murine subjects and housing</title><p>To study the effects of early moderate PAE on offspring DNA methylation processes, we adapted a murine model study design that has previously reported DNA methylation changes at the A<sup>vy</sup> locus in Agouti mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaminen-Ahola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Two male and two female pups per treatment group (n=16 total) were euthanised by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine and xylazine on the day of birth for WGBS of their brain and liver tissues. Mouse tissue samples were stored at –80°C. Remaining littermates grew until adulthood for behavioural testing. Ten milligrams of tissue were collected from each liver and brain and lysed in Chemagic RNA Tissue10 Kit special H96 extraction buffer. Total nucleic acid was extracted from the tissues using the Chemagic 360 instrument (PerkinElmer) and quantified with Qubit DNA High Sensitivity Kit (Catalogue Number: Q32854, Thermo Scientific). 100 ng of genomic DNA was spiked with 0.5 ng of unmethylated lambda DNA (Catalogue Number: D1521, Promega) to assess the bisulfite conversion efficiency. Each sample was digested with 2 µl RNase A (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 20 min to remove RNA. 100 ng of genomic DNA from each sample was sheared using a Covaris M220 (300 bp settings, Covaris). Libraries were prepared using the Lucigen NxSeq AmpFREE Low DNA Library Kit (Catalogue Number: 14000-1, Lucigen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nextflex bisulfite-seq barcodes (Catalogue Number: Nova-511913, PerkinElmer) were used as the adapters with incubation at 25°C for 30 min.

Trajectories of liquid consumption and weight gain across pregnancy were assessed using a quadratic mixed effects model and the trajectory of chow consumption across pregnancy was assessed using a linear mixed effects model. To examine the effect of alcohol exposure on behavioural outcomes we used linear regression with alcohol group (binary) as the main predictor adjusted for diet and sex. For sequencing data, raw fastq files were mapped to the mm10 mouse reference genome with BSseeker 2 (version 2.1.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2013</xref>) and CG-maptools (version number 0.1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2018</xref>) using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. CGmap output files were combined as a bsseq object in the R statistical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>). We filtered the sex chromosomal reads and then combined reads from mice in the same treatment group using the <italic>collapseBSseq</italic> function, to maximise coverage prior to differential DNA methylation analysis. CpG sites with an aggregated coverage below 10× in each tissue type were removed prior to modelling to ensure there was sufficient coverage in all assessed CpG sites. This retained 94.9% of CpG sites in the brain and 93.8% of CpG sites in the liver. DMRs were identified within each tissue using a Bayesian hierarchical model comparing average DNA methylation ratios in each CpG site between PAE and non-PAE mice using the Wald test with smoothing, implemented in the R package <italic>DSS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). False discovery rate (FDR) control was achieved through shrinkage estimation methods. We declared DMRs as those with a local FDR p-value&lt;0.05 based on the p-values of each individual CpG site in the DMR, and minimum mean effect size (delta) of 5%. Gene ontology analysis was performed on the brain and liver DMRs using the gene set enrichment analysis computational method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) to determine if the DMRs were associated with any transcription start sites or biological processes. Brain and liver DMRs were tested for enrichment within ENCODE Project datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2020</xref>) by an overlap permutation test with 100 permutations using the <italic>regioneR</italic> package. The ENCODE Project datasets that were assessed included ENCFF845WSI, ENCFF764NTQ, ENCFF937JHP, ENCFF269TLO, ENCFF676TSV, and ENCFF290MLR. DMRs were then tested for enrichment within specific genic and CpG regions of the mouse genome, compared to a randomly generated set of regions in the mouse genome generated with <italic>resampleRegions</italic> in <italic>regioneR</italic>, with equivalent means and standard deviations. For candidate gene analysis, we compiled a set of key genes and genomic regions identified in previous mammalian PAE studies for site-specific testing based on our prior systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bestry et al., 2022</xref>), which identified 37 candidate genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e and f</xref>).

Sample quality was assessed using control probes on the array. Between-array normalization was performed using the stratified quantile method to correct for Type 1 and Type 2 probe bias. Probes exhibiting a p-detection call rate of &gt;0.01 in one or more samples were removed prior to analysis. Probes containing SNPs at the single base extension site, or at the CpG assay site were removed, as were probes measuring non-CpG loci (32,445 probes). Probes reported to have off-target effects in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCartney et al., 2016</xref>, were also removed.

They also investigated whether a high-methyl diet (HMD) could prevent the DNA methylation alterations caused by alcohol. Using bisulfite sequencing (n=4 per group), they identified 78 alcohol-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the brain and 759 DMRs in the liver, of which 85% and 84% were mitigated by the HMD group, respectively.

The researchers employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for unbiased assessment of the epigenome in the newborn brain and liver, two organs affected by ethanol, to explore tissue-specific effects and to determine any &quot;tissue-agnostic&quot; effects that may have arisen prior to the germ-layer commitment during early gastrulation. The authors found that PAE induces measurable changes in offspring DNA methylation. DNA methylation changes induced by PAE coincide with non-coding regions, including enhancers and promoters, with the potential to regulate gene expression. Though the majority of the alcohol-sensitive differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were not conserved in humans, the ones that were conserved were associated with clinically relevant traits such as facial morphology, educational attainment, intelligence, autism, and schizophrenia Finally, the study provides evidence that maternal dietary support with methyl donors alleviates the effects of PAE on DNA methylation, suggesting a potential prenatal care option.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of the study include the use of a mouse model where confounding factors such as genetic background and diet can be well controlled.

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Response to reviewers</p><p>We wish to thank the reviewers for the time taken to appraise the manuscript and the helpful feedback to improve it. We have taken onboard the suggested feedback and incorporated it into the revision. The findings of the revised manuscript are unchanged. Below is a point-by-point response to specific comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public reviews</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to reviewer 1 for the thorough and insightful review of our manuscript. We are pleased that the strengths of our research, particularly the use of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, the combination of animal and human data, and the investigation of a potential dietary intervention were recognized. We are confident that these aspects contribute significantly to the value and originality of our work.</p><p>We acknowledge the concerns regarding the statistical rigor of the study, particularly the sample size and data analysis methods. We would like to address these points in more detail:</p><p>Sample size: While we agree that a larger sample size would be ideal, the chosen sample size (n=4 per group) is consistent with other murine whole-genome bisulfite sequencing experiments in the field. We have carefully considered the cost-benefit trade-off in selecting this approach. In the revision we discuss the potential limitations of this sample size.</p><p>Data analysis: We acknowledge the inconsistencies in the study reporting and have committed to improving the clarity in the revision. We carefully reviewed the concerns regarding the use of causal language and the interpretation of differences in our results. In some cases, the use of causal language is justified by the intervention study design. We also believe other explanations like stochastic variation affecting the same genomic regions in different tissues, are exceedingly unlikely from a statistical viewpoint. In the revision we have adopted a balanced approach to the language.</p><p>Confounders: We acknowledge the importance of accounting for potential confounders such as birthweight, alcohol exposure and sex. The pups selected for genome analysis were matched for sex and on litter size as a proxy for in utero alcohol exposure. This careful selection of mice for genome analysis was intentionally guided to mitigate potential confounding.</p><p>Statistical rigour: We acknowledge the importance of multiple testing correction in the genome-wide analysis. We used the DSS method of Feng et al (PMID: 2456180) which employs a two-step procedure for assessing significance of a region. Instead of a single p-value for the whole DMR, DSS uses the area statistic to rank candidate regions and control the false discovery rate through shrinkage estimation methods. This approach reduces the risk of reporting false positives due to multiple testing across numerous CpG sites. It is similar in respects to employing local FDR correction at 0.05 level, with an additional minimum effect size threshold applied, and particularly suited to experiments where the number of replicates is low. In the revision we have committed to improving the clarity of the reporting of statistical methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to reviewer 2 for the comprehensive and valuable feedback on our manuscript. We take your concerns about the generalizability of our findings and the interpretation of certain results seriously. We would like to address your specific criticisms in detail:</p><p>Generalizability and Human Data: We agree that the generalizability of mouse models to human conditions has limitations. However, our study focused on understanding the early molecular alterations caused by moderate PAE, which can be more effectively modelled in a controlled environment like mice. To clarify this, we have strengthened the manuscript by emphasizing the focus on moderate PAE in the title and throughout the paper.</p><p>Transcriptome Analysis: We recognize the importance of investigating the functional consequences of PAE-induced DMRs and agree that transcriptome analysis would be highly valuable. We are currently planning to conduct future transcriptomic studies to understand the link between DMRs and gene expression.</p><p>Species-Specificity and DMR Enrichment: We acknowledge the likelihood of species-specific PAE effects. Our finding of enrichment of DMRs in non-coding regions was consistent with observations from the Lussier study of FASD. We agree there is further work to do and now highlight this in the discussion.</p><p>Tissue Sample Locations: Due to technical restrictions of processing newborn mouse tissue, we are unable to enhance the manuscript with specific tissue regions sampled.</p><p>Interpretation of Shared Genomic Regions: We appreciate your point about the alternative explanation for the shared genomic regions between brain and liver. Our interpretation is that regions identified in the alcohol group only affected equally in both tissues are likely established stochastically (as a result of the exposure) in the early embryo and then maintained in the germ layers. We have revised to suggest this is the most likely explanation and we acknowledge a more detailed examination in more tissues would be warranted for proof.</p><p>Additional Feedback</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p><p>Introduction</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 65 - alcohol consumption is not always preventable and these statements further increase the stigma associated with FASD.

In the revision we have corrected the order of figures to match the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is concerning that the H20-HMD group had lower baseline weights, which could impact the findings from these analyses. Please discuss how these differences were accounted for in the study design and analyses.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern about the lower baseline weight in the H20-HMD group. We agree that this difference could potentially affect our findings. However, we want to emphasize that total weight gain during pregnancy was statistically similar across all groups by linear mixed effect model. Additionally, all dams were within the healthy weight range for their strain. While we cannot completely rule out any potential influence of baseline weight, we believe the similarity in weight gain and the healthy range of all dams suggest that the in-utero experience of pups regarding weight-related factors was likely comparable across groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I have some concerns regarding the cutoffs used to identify the DMRs, particularly given the small N and number of tests. The authors should report the number of DMRs that meet a multiple testing threshold; if none, they should use a more stringent threshold than p&lt;0.05, as one would expect 950,000 CpGs to meet that threshold by chance (19,000,000 CpGs x 0.05). The authors should also report the number of DMRs tested, as this will be a more appropriate benchmark for their analyses than the number of CpGs (they should also report the specific number here).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concerns regarding the DMR cut-offs. We agree that clarifying the methods and justifying our choices is crucial. Our implementation of the DSS method for defining DMRs employs a local FDR p&lt;0.05 cut-off, with additional delta beta threshold of 5%. We have clarified this in the methods section of the revised manuscript . We want to emphasize that the local FDR approach effectively mitigates the concern of chance findings by adjusting for multiple comparisons across the genome. Line 414-420 in the revised methods contains the following amended text</p><p>“Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified within each tissue using a Bayesian hierarchical model comparing average DNA methylation ratios in each CpG site between PAE and non-PAE mice using the Wald test with smoothing, implemented in the R package DSS (46). False-discovery rate control was achieved through shrinkage estimation methods. We declared DMRs as those with a local FDR P-value &lt; 0.05 based on the p-values of each individual CpG site in the DMR, and minimum mean effect size (delta) of 5%”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I also have concerns about the delta cutoff for their DMRs. First, it is not clear if this cutoff is set for a single CpG or across the DMR (even then, it is not clear if this is a mean, median, max, min, etc.) Second, since the authors analyzed CpGs with 10X coverage, they can only reliably detect a delta of 0.1 (1/10 reads).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. In the revision we have clarified the effect size cutoff reflects the mean effect across CpGs within the DMR as follows (line 418)</p><p>“We declared DMRs as those with a local FDR P-value &lt; 0.05 based on the p-values of each individual CpG site in the DMR, and minimum mean effect size (delta) of 5%”</p><p>We chose the mean as it provides a comprehensive representation of the overall methylation change within the region, while ensuring all individual CpGs used in the analysis had at least 10x coverage. It is not true that we can only detect a delta of 1/10 reads, the mean effect is the relative difference in means between groups and is not dependent on the underlying sequencing depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Prenatal alcohol exposure is known to impact cell type proportions in the brain, which could lead to differences in DNAm patterns. The authors should address this possibility in the discussion, as well as examine their list of DMRs to determine if they are associated with specific brain cell types. The possibility of cell type differences in the liver should also be discussed.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that PAE-induced alterations in cell type proportions can influence DNA methylation patterns. While isolating specific cell types in our current study's brain and liver samples was not achievable due to tissue limitations, we acknowledge this as a limitation and recognize the need for further investigations incorporating single-cell or cell type-specific approaches in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is interesting, but maybe not surprising, that more DMRs were identified in the liver compared to the brain. This finding would warrant some additional interpretation in the discussion.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree that this finding indeed warrants further interpretation. We have added the following sentence into the discussion section of the revised manuscript that provides some potential factors behind this observation.</p><p>Lines 263 “Indeed, most of the observed effects were tissue-specific, with more perturbations to the epigenome observable in liver tissue, which may reflect the liver’s specific role in metabolic detoxification of alcohol. Alternatively, cell type composition differences between brain and liver might explain differential sensitivity to alcohols effects”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lines 148-149 - I disagree about the enrichment of decreased DNAm in brain DMRs, as 52.6% is essentially random chance. The authors should also include a statistical test here, such as a chi-squared test, to support this statement.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We agree that a revised interpretation is warranted. The updated manuscript has been amended as follows: “Lower DNA methylation with early moderate PAE in NC mice was more frequently observed in liver DMRs (93.5% of liver DMRs), while brain DMRs were almost equally divided between lower and higher DNA methylation with early moderate PAE (52.6% of brain DMRs had lower DNA methylation with early moderate PAE).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Similarly, I would recommend the authors use increased/decreased DNAm, rather than hypermethylated/hypomethylation, as the latter terms are better suited to DNAm values near 100% or 0%.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The use of hyper/hypo methylation is still considered common and well understood even for moderate changes. We agree the use of increased/decreased is more inclusive for a broader audience, so we have amended all references accordingly in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lines 153-155 - please report the statistics to support these enrichment results. A permutation test would be well suited to this analysis.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reporting of statistics related to the enrichment test has now been amended to read “Overlap permutation tests showed liver DMRs were enriched in inter-CpG regions and non-coding intergenic regions (p &lt; 0.05), while being depleted in all CpG regions and genic regions except 1to5kb, 3UTR and 5UTR regions, where there was no significant difference (Figure 2f).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 156 - &quot;overwhelming enrichment&quot; is a very strong statement considering the numbers themselves.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Omitted “overwhelming” in revised manuscript. Revised manuscript states: “Using open chromatin assay and histone modification datasets from the ENCODE project, we found enrichment (p &lt; 0.05) of DMRs in open chromatin regions (ATAC-seq), enhancer regions (H3K4me1), and active gene promoter regions (H3K27ac), in mouse fetal forebrain tissue and fetal liver (Table 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lines 165-167 - Please describe the analyses and metrics used to determine if the DNAm differences were mitigated in the HMD groups. As it stands, it is not clear if they are simply not significant, or if the delta was decreased. In terms of a figure, a scatter plot of the deltas for these DMRs would be better suited to visualizing these changes.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>To determine whether DMRs were mitigated we simply applied the same statistical testing procedure on the subset of PAE DMRs in the group of mice exposed to the HM diet. The sample size is the same, and the burden on multiple testing is reduced as we did not test the entire genome. We believe our interpretation stands although we have urged caution in the discussion as follows (line 319)</p><p>“Another key finding from this study was that HMD mitigated some of the effects of PAE on DNA methylation. Although a plausible alternative explanation is that some of the PAE regions were not reproduced in the set of mice given the folate diet, our data are consistent with preclinical studies of choline supplementation in rodent models (34, 35) (36). Moreover, a subset of PAE regions were statistically replicated in subjects with FASD, suggestive or robust associations. Although our findings should be interpreted with caution, they collectively support the notion that alcohol induced perturbation of epigenetic regulation may occur, at least in part, through disruption of the one-carbon metabolism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Given the lenient threshold to identify DMRs, it is possible that PAE-associated DMRs are simply false positives and do not &quot;replicate&quot; in a different subset of animals. One way to check this would be to determine whether there are any differences between mitigated/unmitigated DMRs and the strength of their initial associations. Should the mitigated DMRs skew towards higher p-values and lower deltas, one might consider that these findings could be false positives.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern about potential false positives due to the chosen DMR identification threshold. We reiterate the DMR calling thresholds were adjusted for local FDR; however, we acknowledge the need for further validation. We haven't observed this trend of mitigated DMRs having higher p-values and lower deltas, but we have replicated some PAE DMRs in independent human datasets and found support for their biological plausibility in the context of PAE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Related to the HMD analyses, I am concerned that the EtOH-HMD group consumed less alcohol, which could manifest in the PAE-induced DMRs disappearing, unrelated to the HMD exposure. The authors should comment on whether the pups were matched for ethanol exposure and include sensitivity analyses that include ethanol level as a covariate to confirm that their results are not simply due to decreased alcohol exposure.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern regarding the lower alcohol consumption by Dams in the EtOH-HMD group and its potential impact on DMRs. We agree that consistent in utero exposure is crucial for reliable results. Our pup selection for genomic analysis involved matching litter size as a proxy for in utero exposure, so even through the average alcohol consumption was lower for the EtOH-HMD group, we matched pups across treatment groups based on litter size as a proxy for alcohol intake levels, excluding pups with significantly different exposure levels. We agree more robust methods including direct measurement of blood alcohol content would improve the study. We have now incorporated this into the discussion of the revised manuscript on lines 351: “Additionally, we employed an ad-libitum alcohol exposure model rather than direct dosing of dams. Although the trajectories of alcohol consumption were not statistically different between groups, this introduces more variability into alcohol exposure patterns, and might might impact offspring methylation data”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lines 172 - please be more specific about the neurocognitive domains tested.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>In the revision we have included more detail about the neurocognitive domains tested (originally mentioned in the results) in the methods as follows:</p><p>“These tests included the open field test (locomotor activity, anxiety) (38), object recognition test (locomotor activity, spatial recognition) (39), object in place test (locomotor activity, spatial recognition) (40), elevated plus maze test (locomotor activity, anxiety) (41), and two trials of the rotarod test (motor coordination, balance) (42)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 191 - please report the tissue type used in the human study, as well as the method used to estimate cell type proportions.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We stated in the results section that buccal swabs were used in both human cohorts.</p><p>We added to the revised manuscript that cell type proportions were estimated using the EpiDISH R package.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Related to validation, it is unclear whether the human-identified DMRs were also validated in mice, or if the authors are showing their own DMRs.

We posit the lack of replication of our early moderate PAE regions in AQUA is explained in part by species-specific differences and considering the striking differences in effect size seen in regions that did replicate in FASD subjects, the exposure may need to be of sufficient magnitude and duration for the effects seen in brain and liver to survive reprogramming in the blood. The AQUA cohort is largely enriched for low to moderate patterns of alcohol consumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 197 - please provide a citation for the ethanol-sensitive regions. There are also several existing DNAm analyses in brain tissues from animal models that should be included as part of these analyses, as several have shown brain-region and sex-specific DMRs related to prenatal alcohol exposure. These contrasts might help the authors further delineate the effects of prenatal alcohol in their model and expand on current literature to explain the deficits caused by alcohol exposure.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Our candidate gene/region selection was informed by a systematic review of previously published human and animal studies reporting associations between in utero exposure to PAE and offspring DNA methylation. We synthesized evidence across several models, tissues and methylation platforms to arrive at a core set of reproducible associations.

We posit a more likely explanation is early perturbations in the embryo are established stochastically as a result of the exposure (supported by the interventional design) and maintained in the differentiating tissues. We agree further work is needed to prove this, specifically in a wider set of tissues from multiple germ layers so we have amended the discussion as follows:</p><p>“These perturbations may have been established stochastically because of alcohol exposure in the early embryo and maintained in the differentiating tissue. Further analysis in different germ layer tissues is required to formally establish this.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lines 222-224 - I completely agree with this statement.
