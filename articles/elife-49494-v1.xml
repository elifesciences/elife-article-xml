multitude of roles in the nervous system. We report that neurotrophins induce the fission of mitochondria along embryonic chick sensory axons driven by combined PI3K and Mek-Erk signaling. Following an initial burst of fission, a new steady state of neurotrophin-dependent mitochondria length is established. Mek-Erk controls the activity of the fission mediator Drp1 GTPase, while PI3K may contribute to the actin-dependent aspect of fission. Drp1-mediated fission is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced collateral branching in vitro and expression of dominant negative Drp1 impairs the branching of axons in the developing spinal cord in vivo. Fission is also required for NGF-induced mitochondria-dependent intra-axonal translation of the actin regulatory protein cortactin, a previously determined component of NGF-induced branching. Collectively, these observations unveil a novel biological function of neurotrophins; the regulation of mitochondrial fission and steady state mitochondrial length and density in axons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>Drp1</kwd><kwd>fission</kwd><kwd>branching</kwd><kwd>ngf</kwd><kwd>neurotrophins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS095471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>George M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallo</surname><given-names>Gianluca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS078030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallo</surname><given-names>Gianluca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Induction of the fission of mitochondria-populating sensory axons is shown to be a novel biological action of neurotrophins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotrophins are secreted growth factors that activate Trk and p75 receptors to control a multitude of aspects of neuronal cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reichardt, 2006</xref>). The promotion of axon collateral branching is an important effect of neurotrophin function during both development and nervous system repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diamond et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diamond et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen-Cory, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt and Rathjen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilimoria and Bonni, 2013</xref>). In the context of axon branching, neurotophins regulate both the actin filament and microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>) and also drive the intra-axonal translation of mRNAs coding for actin regulatory proteins involved in branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batista and Hengst, 2016</xref>). Recent work has identified mitochondria as fundamental elements in the mechanism of branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sainath et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Gallo, 2018</xref>). During NGF-induced branching mitochondrial respiration serves to locally drive axonal actin dynamics and intra-axonal translation of actin regulatory proteins required for NGF-induced branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). Prior work has determined that neurotrophins can regulate stalling at sites of localized NGF-signaling, mitochondrial membrane potential and coordinate axonal actin dynamics and mitochondria positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chada and Hollenbeck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verburg and Hollenbeck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sainath et al., 2017a</xref>). However, the full spectrum of the regulation of mitochondria by neurotrophins remains to be determined.</p><p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo fission and fusion in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiri and Hollenbeck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saxton and Hollenbeck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Gallo, 2018</xref>). The balance of fission and fusion serves to maintain cellular health, and fission positively contributes to aspects of cell division and organismal development. However, fission is also a characteristic response to a variety of insults and is generally considered to be a component of the cell death mechanism that when left unchecked results in fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balog et al., 2016</xref>). Dysregulation of the fission-fusion balance is also considered to underlie certain neuropathies and to have detrimental effects on neuronal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertholet et al., 2016</xref>). We now report that neurotrophins induce the rapid fission of axonal mitochondria that is then followed by a persistent new steady stage of mitochondria length and density in axons. The fission of mitochondria occurs through a Drp1 GTPase and actin filament based mechanism coordinated by PI3K and MAPK signaling and it is required for the induction of axon collateral branches. This study thus unveils a novel biological function of neurotrophins, the induction of mitochondrial fission and maintenance of steady state mitochondrial length and density in axons, and provides the first example of the ‘beneficial’ regulation of mitochondria fission by a family of neuronal growth factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neurotrophins induce the fission of axonal mitochondria and set new steady state mitochondria density and length</title><p>For experiments involving NGF (40 ng/mL) we used embryonic day (E) seven chicken embryo sensory neurons using culturing conditions wherein only NGF responsive TrkA positive neurons extend axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>). Briefly, at E7 only TrkA+ neurons extend axons on a laminin substratum in the absence of neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>). Imaging of fluorescently labeled mitochondria during the first 10 min after NGF treatment revealed elevated rates of fission (% mitochondria undergoing fission/10 min) without detectable effects on the rate of fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) relative to the no NGF treatment control (NGF vehicle treatment). In 80% of instances of fission one or both of the emergent mitochondria underwent transport (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for an example of transport following fission; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows an example of fission without subsequent transport), regardless of NGF treatment (p=0.56, Fisher’s test). Thus, fission correlates with an increased probability of subsequent transport regardless of NGF treatment. Fission occurred along stalled mitochondria and we did not observe moving mitochondria undergoing fission. The proportion of mitochondria undergoing transport after fission was 110% greater than that of other mitochondria that were initially stalled but then underwent transport without having undergone fission (80% following fission relative to 38% not having undergone fission; p=0.0025. Fisher’s test). Considering the whole population of axonal mitochondria, during the first 10 min of NGF treatment there was a trend toward increased transport as reflected in a slight decrease in the % of mitochondria that remained stalled throughout the imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), likely due to the proportion having undergone fission. The percent of time that mitochondria which underwent movement spent moving was not affected by NGF for either anterograde or retrograde directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> inset). For mitochondria having undergone fission after NGF treatment the transport was not biased in the anterograde or retrograde direction (p=0.29; Fisher’s test against a hypothetical population of the same sample size exhibiting 50/50 directionality) and the velocity of movement in either direction was not affected by NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The velocity of transport in either direction was also not affected by NGF between moving mitochondria not observed to have undergone fission and those that underwent fission prior to transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Analysis of the ‘run length’, the net distance traveled by mitochondria during a continuous period of transport, did not reveal an effect of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), although in the no NGF group we observed a trend toward more mitochondria undergoing continuous runs longer than 35 microns in either direction. However, following NGF treatment 55% of mitochondria undergoing runs exhibited one or more switches in direction during the run, compared to 15% in the no NGF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>; n = 47 and 38 respectively, p=0.0049, Fisher exact test). Thus, NGF treatment results in a bout of fission following which one or both of the two emergent mitochondria undergo redistribution within the axon, the latter correlating with fission and not linked to NGF-treatment. Although NGF did not impact a variety of aspects of mitochondria transport, in response to NGF the mitochondria undergoing transport exhibited more frequent reversal of directionality during a continuous run.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NGF induces a rapid bout of fission followed by maintenance of a new steady state of mitochondria length and density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of mitochondria labeled by expression of mitochondrially targeted DsRed (DsRed-mito) undergoing fission and subsequent transport during the first 5–10 min of NGF treatment (40 ng/mL throughout).

Fission: At 12 s a separation along the mitochondrion becomes evident (yellow arrowhead) and is reflected in the line scan as a drop in intensity to baseline levels at this and subsequent time points. During the fission the two ends of the emergent mitochondria (<bold>a and b</bold>) separate as the ends contract away from each other. In this example the fission did not coincide with subsequent transport of either of the emergent mitochondria, although there is a slight sub-micron movement of the left end of mitochondrion a between 12–15 s. Overlap: The mitochondrion labeled ‘a’ in red moves from right to left of the panel. At 3 s it overlaps with the mitochondrion labeled ‘b’ but moves past it by 6 s. Between 9–15 s a overlaps with c. At 21–30 s a stalls adjacent to c but does not fuse as indicated by (1) no equalization of fluorescence between the two mitochondria (a is brighter; compared to the fusion examples that follow) and (2) background level intensities between the two mitochondria as shown in the line scans. Fusion: Between 0–3 s mitochondrion b enters the field to the left of a. Mitochondrion b undergoes movement to the right of the panel between 3–15 s, during which there is overlap of a and b but no apparent change in the morphology or intensity of a. At 15 s the left end of b overlaps with a. Between 18–24 s a decrease in size and by 24 s a is no longer detectable as distinct from b. The emergent mitochondrion a+b is now of uniform intensity and there is no detectable overlap in fluorescence between a and b. This is interpreted as a and b having fused and the higher intensity initially apparent for a having redistributed over the longer length of a+b (in contrast to the preceding overlap sequence). During the sequence mitochondria c and b move toward each other but do not overlap and they remain adjacent to one another without any evidence of fusion or interaction. Furthermore, the length of mitochondria a and b at 12 s, during overlap, were 2.14 and 10.66 μm respectively. At 24 s and later the length of the fused mitochondrion (a+b) was 12.82 μm. Fusion 2: Between 0–12 s mitochondria a and b come into end-to-end contact. Between 12–18 s the ends overlap (denoted by yellow *). Between 18–54 s, when fusion is considered to have occurred and there is the loss of detectable overlap, the emergent mitochondrion undergoes rightward movement at both ends. Furthermore, while a and b initially exhibited differences in intensities, a having lower intensity that b at 0 s, by 54 s the intensity along the emergent mitochondrion (a+b) is uniform and there is no evidence of overlap as would be expected if a had migrated on top of b. Furthermore, at 0 s the summed length of a and b is 7.59 μm, and the length of the emergent mitochondrion a+b by 54 s and later is 7.52 μm.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49494-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Net mitochondria transport and examples of neurotrophin treated axonal mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During the first 5–10 min post NGF treatment there was no detectable difference in individual behavioral categories of the entire population of axonal mitochondria as reflected by the proportions undergoing net anterograde (antero), retrograde (retro), oscillatory movements without net displacement (oscillatory) or exhibiting no detectable movement (stable) (n = 95 and 100 mitochondria from 15 and 16 axons for no NGF and NGF).

To determine whether the effects of NGF on axonal mitochondria length and density are conserved throughout the neurotrophin family we assessed the effects of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3). Unlike with TrkA+ neurons there are no culturing conditions that allow us to have responsive neurons that are however naïve to the neurotrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>). Therefore, to address the effects of BDNF and NT3 we used a protocol we established previously to generate cultures wherein only BDNF or NT-3 responsive neurons would extend axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallo and Letourneau, 1998</xref>). By E9 chicken sensory neurons of all classes have become neurotrophin dependent for their survival. Thus, we cultured overnight in the relevant neurotrophin, which selects the responsive neuron population, on laminin followed by a 2 hr neurotrophin deprivation period prior to restoration of BDNF/NT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallo and Letourneau, 1998</xref>). This results in selection of the relevant neuronal populations that although not naïve to the neurotrophin have a high degree of responsiveness due to neurotrophin withdraw. As with NGF, a 45 min treatment with BDNF or NT3 increased the density of axonal mitochondria and decreased their length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the effects of neurotrophins on the regulation of steady state mitochondria density and length require continuous neurotrophin treatment, we cultured E7 DRG neurons in the absence of NGF overnight and then treated with NGF for 30 min, by which point the new steady state is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and then either the NGF containing medium was replaced with medium containing no NGF and also including a function blocking NGF antibody or with medium containing NGF (continuous NGF treatment with sham medium exchange). Following NGF withdraw mitochondria length and density increased and decreased, respectively, back to NO NGF treatment levels by 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Analysis of the percentage of mitochondria undergoing fission or fusion (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>) after NGF withdraw in the same paradigm as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> revealed increased rates of fusion at 10–20 min after NGF withdraw which returned to baseline by 40–50 min after NGF withdraw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). NGF withdraw did not affect rates of fission at either time points. Thus, loss of NGF signaling after a period of NGF signaling results in a bout of fusion. However, by 40–50 min after NGF withdraw the rates of fission and fusion are comparable (p=0.91, Mann-Whintey test), consistent with the maintenance of steady state induced by NGF withdraw. Collectively, these data reveal that NGF induces the fission of axonal mitochondria and determines a new steady state of length and density that is then maintained as long as NGF is present.</p><p>The time course of fission in response to bath application of NGF (&lt;10 min) indicates that the response is mediated locally within the axon shaft. To specifically address whether NGF is acting locally to induce fission we locally perfused axons with NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). During the first 10 min of local perfusion with NGF an average of 30% of mitochondria underwent fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>), similar to bath application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As with bath application, we did not observe an effect of local perfusion with NGF on the percentage of mitochondria undergoing fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). As an alternative approach to locally expose distal axons to NGF we used microfluidic compartmentalized chambers and measured the length of mitochondria in axons that grew into compartments containing no NGF or NGF (the cell body compartments did not contain NGF). Axons in compartments containing NGF exhibited shorter mitochondria relative to no NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>), consistent with a local action of NGF.</p><p>A dose response curve showed that the effect of NGF on mitochondria length and density became evident at 10 ng/mL NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>), consistent with activation of TrkA receptors. To further address the issue we pretreated with the TrkA inhibitor k252a prior to NGF treatment resulting in inhibition of the NGF-induced decrease in mitochondria length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>). All neurotrophins bind the p75 receptor but exhibit selectivity for Trk receptors. Treatment with BDNF (100 ng/mL) did not alter mitochondria length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate the effects of NGF on axonal mitochondria are mediated through the TrkA receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Drp1 GTPase mediates NGF-induced fission</title><p>Drp1 mediates fission in toxic scenarios as well as baseline fission in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zemirli et al., 2018</xref>).

Cotranslationally myristoylated GFP (myrGFP) is targeted to the nearest membrane wherein its diffusion is largely limited.

Two of the major signal transduction pathways activated by neurotrophins that control morphogenesis, PI3K and Mek-Erk, coordinate to regulate the mechanism of mitochondrial fission and their activity is required to maintain the new steady state. Secondarily, the NGF-induced fission of axonal mitochondria is required for NGF-induced axon branching, revealing the first contribution of the NGF-induced fission to a cell biological process regulated by NGF.

The observation that neurotrophins induce mitochondria fission and establish a new steady state of length and density along axons has implications for understanding how neurotrophins impact the biology of the nervous system, and also indicate that the regulation of mitochondria length and density may be a general determinant of the competency of axons to undergo collateral branching. Consistent with this suggestion, inhibition of fission machinery in vivo suppresses the developmental branching of both sensory axons (current study) and cortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>), neither of which is considered to be under regulation by neurotrophins.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary and hypothetical mechanism for the role of fission in allowing mitochondria to target to sites of NGF-induced sensory axon collateral branching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summary of previously established components of the mechanism of NGF-induced axon branching (black text; modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>) and the role of NGF-induced mitochondria fission elucidated herein (red text).

NGF increases the rate of actin patch formation, in part, by driving the intra-axonal translation of relevant actin regulatory molecules (cortactin, Arp2, WAVE1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>) required for patch formation. Herein, we show that NGF also induces the fission of axonal mitochondria during the first 10 min of signaling, prior to branching and the axonal translation-dependent increase in actin patch formation. The fission requires NGF-induced activation of Drp1 through Erk signaling. The fission also requires actin filaments that present as patches at the site of fission. Based on the requirement for actin filaments, PI3K-Akt signaling and the Arp2/3 complex for the formation of actin patches and fission, we suggest the role of PI3K in fission is mediated through the previously described APM also regulating the actin patch component of the fission machinery. The ensuing fission results in mitochondria with lengths that facilitate their targeting into nascent branches. The fission is also required for the NGF-induced and mitochondria-dependent intra-axonal translation of cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). The hypothetical mechanism by which fission may contribute to axonal translation is presented in the panel B. The approximate time line of the events described above is presented below. The NGF-induced burst of fission occurs during the first 10–15 min of signaling, after which the new steady state of length and density is established along axons. The fission precedes the subsequent axonal translation dependent increase in the formation of actin patches and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). The emerge of new branches from the axon follows becoming evident by after 20 min of NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Graphical representation of the hypothetical contribution of fission to the establishment of localized sites of intra-axonal protein synthesis during NGF-induced axon collateral branching. This hypothetical model is derived from the synthesis of from multiple prior studies showing the accumulation of organelles and translational machinery at sites of branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2017</xref>), the correlation of sites of branching with localized microtubule splaying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>) and the observation that NGF induces microtubule splaying by 5 min post treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>), the time when mitochondria are undergoing fission and redistribution within the axon. (i) before NGF treatment mitochondria are longer, and translational machinery is undergoing transport and stalling throughout the axon in an unregulated manner. (ii) Signaling through PI3K and Erk is required for the fission of axonal mitochondria in response to NGF, and the fission correlates with transport mediated redistribution of mitochondria within the axon. (iii) as mitochondria undergo redistribution they encountered segments of the axon within which microtubules have undergone splaying apart and correlate with sites of potential branching. Through an unspecified mechanism transport cargoes undergo stalling in the axon segments where microtubules have splayed and accumulate resulting in the mitochondria and translational machinery. This converge then assists in the establishment of axon segments with high translation potential that correlate with sites of potential axon branching. (iv) Axon branches can then arise from these specialized domains through a multifaceted process involving the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, intra-axonal protein synthesis and directed transport into branches. The shorter length of mitochondria following fission is permissive for the entry of mitochondria into nascent branches.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49494-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The field of mitochondria fission has relied on the analysis of spontaneously occurring fission or fission induced by impairing mitochondrial function (e.g., using mitochondrial poisons). A role for growth factor signaling in fission has not been reported. The mechanism of fission used by neurotrophins is Drp1 dependent, as with other forms of fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraus and Ryan, 2017</xref>). This study reveals a role for actin filaments in fission, consistent with an emerging literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, in the case of neurotrophin signaling, we were able to observe the formation of discrete actin patches at sites of fission. This observation unveils a novel role for axonal actin patches, their involvement in fission, independent of their previously described role in the formation of axonal filopodia that represents the first step in the sequence of morphological changes leading to axon collateral branching (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the data show that even for the population of patches that form associated with mitochondria there are two distinct subpopulations with dedicated roles in the formation of filopodia and fission, respectively.</p><p>The concentration profile of NGF induced fission on axonal mitochondria is consistent with activation of the TrkA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaplan et al., 1991</xref>) that activates both PI3K and Erk signaling. The observations that inhibition of TrkA using k252a inhibits NGF-induced fission and that treatment with BDNF at a concentration expected to activate the p75 receptor does not induce fission indicate that TrkA is the major receptor mediating the effect of NGF on mitochondria fission. However, a role for p75 in modulating TrkA signaling cannot at present be ruled out. A role for PI3K signaling in regulating Drp1-dependent mitochondria fission has not been previously reported. PI3K signaling, unlike Mek-Erk, does not regulate the activation of Drp1 through S616 phosphorylation. However, actin filament patches are required for the formation of Drp1 focal accumulations at sites of fission. Given the previously detailed role of PI3K in establishing local signaling microdomains in axons that determine the localized formation and elaboration of axonal actin patches that in turn colocalize with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>), the role of actin patches in fission and the dependence of both fission and actin patch formation on PI3K and Arp2/3, we propose that PI3K controls the actin patch dependent aspect of the fission mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), but do not exclude alternative mechanisms. The inhibition of Arp2/3-mediated actin filament nucleation prevented fission, further indicating that the subpopulation of actin patches that control fission is mediated by the previously detailed PI3K-Akt-Arp2/3 mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Other actin regulatory proteins likely also contribute to the actin-dependent fission induced by neurotrophins. For example, the INF2 formin has been shown to mediate ER-mitochondria contact mediated fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>) and mitochondria and the ER both accumulate at sites of axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, Mek-Erk controls the activity of Drp1. Drp1 phosphorylation by Erk has precedent in the cancer literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kashatus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>), and is here linked to neurotrophin-mediated regulation of mitochondria but not peroxysomes.</p><p>NGF-induced fission is required for the ensuing collateral branching, and inhibition of Drp1 in vivo impairs developmental collateral axon branching in the embryonic spinal cord although this branching is not initiated by NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, a recent study reports that inhibition of mitochondria fission through depletion of MFF, one of the Drp1 adaptors on the mitochondrial surface, decreases the terminal/collateral branching of cortical axons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). The current study provides insights into the contribution of mitochondria fission through the regulation of mitochondria length and density to the mechanism of branching, independent of the specific signal initiating the branching. The data reveal a ‘size principle’ for the targeting of mitochondria into nascent branches. In the absence of neurotrophins, only the few available short mitochondria target into spontaneously formed branches. The size of these mitochondria that enter branches in the absence of NGF is similar to the size induced by neurotrophins throughout the axon following fission, indicating that neurotrophins greatly increase the availability of mitochondria in the size range appropriate for branch formation and maturation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al. (2004)</xref> similarly reported that small mitochondria tend to target to dendritic filopodia and spines, although they also observed portions of larger mitochondria penetrating dendritic protrusions. Furthermore, the data show that when axonal mitochondria undergo fission, <italic>regardless</italic> of NGF treatment, one or both of the emergent mitochondria undergo transport. The increased density of mitochondria in NGF-induced branches is also consistent with increased targeting into nascent branches, as the branches form when NGF has set the new steady state of length and density in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, see timeline). While the mechanism that links fission with subsequent transport is not clear, an inverse relationship between the length of axonal mitochondria and their propensity for undergoing transport has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saxton and Hollenbeck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanareddy et al., 2014</xref>). The length of mitochondria is dependent on the balance of fission and fusion. Therefore, it is also possible that some signals may suppress fusion independent of fission but with the same functional effect in terms of the role of mitochondria length in promoting the targeting of mitochondria to nascent branches.</p><p>The temporal aspects of the NGF-induced fission and establishment of the new steady state of length and density relative to the ensuing formation of branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, see timeline), along with consideration of the literature, suggest a hypothetical working model for the role of fission and the subsequent reorganization of mitochondria within the axon in the formation of sensory axon collateral branches induced by NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). NGF induces a high rate of fission during the first 10–15 min of treatment after which a new steady state of mitochondria length and density is maintained by NGF signaling. In contrast, the NGF-induced increase in the formation of actin patches and filopodia, and subsequently branches, which are dependent on mitochondria respiration and intra-axonal protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sainath et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2017</xref>), become respectively prominent by approximately 15 and 30 min following NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>). We present the novel observation that instances of fission within the axon correlate with the subsequent transport of one of the emergent mitochondria, indicating that following the initial burst of NGF-induced fission mitochondria also undergo redistribution within the axon, prior to the emergence of branches and the increases in NGF-induced actin patches and filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Branches emerge from sites along the axon where mitochondria have undergone stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we suggest that one role of fission is to promote the reorganization of the distribution of axonal mitochondria allowing them the target to sites of future branching. The observation that following NGF treatment the majority of mitochondria runs consist of switches in directionality of movement may represent a mechanism whereby the mitochondrion can repeatedly sample the same axon segment for docking sites. Sites of branching are characterized by localized splaying of the axonal microtubule array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>) and NGF promotes the splaying by 5 min after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, as mitochondria are undergoing redistribution within the axon following NGF-induced fission they will encounter sites of microtubule splaying that we suggest may serve to locally capture mitochondria in transit, and lead to the observed accumulation of mitochondria and other organelles at the base of nascent branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). Through their respiration stalled mitochondria also establish sites of localized high axonal mRNA translation that correlate with sites of axon branching and are required for the ensuing branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). Sites of axon branching have also been shown to accumulate ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the orchestration in space and time of the accumulation of mitochondria and translational machinery at sites of axon collateral branching has been demonstrated in vivo along retinal ganglion cell axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2017</xref>) whose collateral branches are under regulation by BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen-Cory et al., 2010</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al. (2017)</xref> determined that both mitochondria and translational machinery stall at specific sites along axons supporting the idea that axons have specific sites that capture the relevant machinery (e.g., possibly sites marked by microtubule splaying). Thus, the fission may be required for axonal mitochondria to become redistributed within the axon and targeted to sites wherein additional components of axonal translational machinery are also targeted such as sites of axon collateral branching (e.g., ribosomes, mRNA-protein particles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), a complex issue that will be the focus of future investigation. This hypothetical mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) suggesting that mitochondrial fission contributes to a reorganization of the axonal cytoplasm may underlie the observed effects of blocking fission on the axonal translation of cortactin, and these complex issues are now under investigation.</p><p>Whether the proposed model may apply to the collateral branching of other neuronal types or in response to other branch inducing signals will have to be addressed by future investigations. The observations that both the developmental collateral branching of sensory axons in the spinal cord and cortical axons in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>) requires mitochondria fission, both contexts not considered to be mediated by neurotrophins, indicates that the requirement for fission and the regulation of axonal mitochondria length and density for axon collateral branching is likely to extended to additional collateral branching signals and scenarios. However, the current study and proposed model do not address the issue of the branching of the main axon through growth cone bifurcation or collateral branches that arise from sites along the axon at which the growth cone underwent pausing prior to continuing extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szebenyi et al., 1998</xref>). It will be of interest to address mitochondria behavior and dynamics in the context of these additional forms of axon branching. Similarly, netrin-1 induces the branching of cortical axons through the local regulation of axonal calcium levels through a mechanism requiring both CaMKII and MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang and Kalil, 2005</xref>). In dendrites, activity can drive the fission of mitochondria through a calcium and CamKII-dependent mechanism requiring phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Divakaruni et al., 2018</xref>). The induction of collateral branches by NGF is independent of calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallo and Letourneau, 1998</xref>) and in unpublished studies we have not detected increases in cytosolic calcium or mitochondrial calcium in response to NGF and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII did not affect NGF-induced branching. The data presented herein are consistent with Mek-Erk mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 downstream of TrkA activation. Interestingly, netrin-1 induced branching along cortical axons is dependent on both CaMKII and MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang and Kalil, 2005</xref>), but whether fission of mitochondria downstream of either of these kinases is involved remains to be determined.</p><p>Based on our prior work and that of others addressing the role of mitochondria in axon collateral branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2014</xref>), we consider that the mitochondrion, its fission and targeting to sites of axon branching are best considered as establishing domains along the axon that are <italic>permissive</italic> for the emergence of branches. As detailed in multiple reviews on the topic of axon collateral branching, the mechanism underlying collateral branching is complex and involves multiple molecular systems controlling multiple aspects of the actin filament and microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacheco and Gallo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>). Mitochondria positioning along the axon is a major determinant of sites of axonal actin patch formation and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sainath et al., 2017a</xref>), the first step in the mechanism of axon collateral branching. However, in the absence of additional extracellular signals that control cytoskeletal dynamics and rearrangements the mere presence of mitochondria is not sufficient to elicit high levels of actin patch and filopodia formation and in turn collateral branching. Indeed, as we have previously reported about 15% of the axon shaft of the sensory neuron population studied herein contains mitochondria regardless of NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ketschek and Gallo, 2010</xref>) and branch formation is only increased by NGF treatment, which activates the additional cytoskeletal rearrangements required for formation of branches that however occur preferentially at sites populated by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In conclusion, the mitochondrion and its positioning along the axon is a required component of the mechanism of axon branching but we suggest it should not be considered sufficient to elicit axon branches as the promotion of branching by NGF involves both signaling through a canonical cytoskeletal regulatory pathway (PI3K-Arp2/3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and the axonal translation of actin regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and also the promotion of microtubule targeting into nascent branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of the maintenance of the neurotrophin-induced steady state of mitochondria in axons will require further consideration. The persistent elevation in Erk and PI3K activity after the initial burst of NGF-induced signaling serve to maintain the steady state, as indicated by the observation of increased mitochondria length when either pathway is inhibited in the continuous presence of NGF. Interestingly, NGF withdraw after the prior establishment of a steady state results in increased rates of fusion but does not impact fission during the period soon after NGF withdraw (10–20 min). Subsequently, fusion rates return to baseline levels and match those of fission, as required for maintenance of the post-NGF withdraw steady state. The mechanism underlying the increase in fusion remains to be determined but may reflect a suppression of PI3K and/or Erk signaling following NGF-withdraw.</p><p>In conclusion, this report details that neurotrophins induce an initial burst of mitochondria fission and subsequently maintain a new steady state of mitochondria length and density within axons, and that the regulation of fission is a required component of the mechanism of NGF-induced axon branching. These observations pave the way for considering the role of the effects of neurotrophins on mitochondria fission in the context of the various other functions of neurotrophins spanning the regulation of cell survival, axon elongation/regeneration and synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing of primary neurons</title><p>Chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected at embryonic day 7 (E7) (SPF eggs obtained from Charles River Laboratories).

Glass electrodes were pulled to have tips in the 3–5 μm range and filled with NGF containing medium or control medium just prior to use. We included 50 μg/mL NGF and 25 μM CellTracker Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# C2925), to visualize the perfusion, in the NGF delivery medium, but only CellTracker Green in the control medium. Pipette positioning and manipulation was performed using a M3301R micromanipulator (World Precision Instruments). To control flow from the pipette we used a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin). The pipette tip was positioned approximately 60–80 μm away from and perpendicular to the target distal axon. Delivery was commenced using 5 psi and 20 msec pulses at a frequency of 2 Hz. Flow of medium in the direction parallel to the ejection from the pipette tip, to prevent local accumulation of the perfusion solution, was established by gravity flow using a Kimwipe (KimTech) placed at the opposite end of the culturing dish and draining into a separate dish. Dishes were filled with 4 mL of medium at the start of the experiment and medium was added during the duration of the experiment at the side of the dish opposite the direction of flow to maintain a steady level of medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Microfluidics</title><p>Microfluidic chambers were generated in house as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sainath et al. (2017b)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref> for an example). E6 dissociated chicken DRG neurons were plated within the microfluidic chambers on polylysine and laminin coated coverslips. The cell body compartment media did not contain NGF but was supplemented with FDU ( 5 uM 5-Fluorouracil, Tocris Cat# 325; 5 uM Uridine, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# U3003-5G) to reduce glial cell number. The distal axonal compartment contained NGF (20 ng/mL) or no NGF. Each cell body chamber contained approximately eight dissociated DRGs and were cultured for 48 hr with additional media added at 24 hr.</p><p>Mitochondria in the axons having entered to axon compartment were visualized using Mitotracker green (25 nM, ThermoFisher. The media from the axonal side reservoirs was replaced with media containing Mitotracker green in one of the axonal compartment reservoirs such that it flowed across the axons to reach the opposite side axonal reservoir. Axons were incubated in Mitotracker for 20 min followed by two washes with dye free medium before imaging at 100x. To wash out the Mitotracker dye, the media was removed from both axonal reservoirs and dye free media was added to one side of the axonal reservoir and allowed to flow over the axons to the opposite axonal reservoir.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of immunocytochemical labeling</title><p>For quantification of the levels of immunolabeling in axons the distal 50 μm of axons were sampled excluding the growth cone, defined as the region of the axon distal to the ‘neck’ of the growth cone where the axon diameter enlarges into the central and peripheral domains. Images were acquired using a Zeiss 200 M microscope with a camera binning of 2 × 2. For imaging a Zeiss Pan-Neofluar 100 objective with 1.3 NA, was used. The exposure parameters were set so as to maintain all images within the dynamic range without any pixels at saturation. Prior acquisition of imaging data sets, exposure parameters were determined from the control groups so that the mean axonal intensity of the control group was at about 30% of the dynamic range, providing for a two-fold increase in experimental groups that would still remain with the range. Zeiss Axiovision software was used for all measurements, and the area of the region of interest was multiplied by the background-subtracted mean intensity of the stain to obtain the total integrated level of fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Determination of mitochondria number, length, fission and fusion</title><p>Imaging was performed as described in the live imaging section above but camera binning was set to 1 × 1 to obtain maximal spatial resolution. The length and number of mitochondria in the axon were measured using ImageJ software, and the density of mitochondria was calculated per 10 μm of axon. Mitochondria length was defined as determined by a line, segmented if the mitochondrion was not strictly linear, running from one end to the other of the mitochondrion. Occasionally, mitochondria in axons overlapped as clearly evidenced by the additive signal of their fluorescence in the region of overlap. Overlapping mitochondria were excluded from analysis to ensue only mitochondria with clearly defined ends were used for quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Determination of rates of fission and fusion from live imaging time lapse videos</title><p>Instances of fission were determined manually by the user through frame by frame analysis using sequences as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The labeling of mitochondria using both dyes and the genetically encoded reporters was uniform along the mitochondrion, although with DsRed-mito mitochondria often exhibited differences in mean fluorescence intensities. Using the settings described in the live imaging section each pixel in the resulting images has a radius of 0.12 μm. Examples of fission and fusion and the relevant analytical considerations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. A completed fission event was defined as when the fluorescence intensity of the mitochondrion at the site of apparent fission had decreased to the background level of the axonal segment not containing mitochondria and the two resultant mitochondria were separated by over 5 pixels representing 0.6 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Occasionally mitochondria underwent apparent constrictions but did not continue into a full fission event, as the constriction sites returned to exhibit the prior width and intensity, and these instances were not counted as fission. Fusion events were similarly determined by the user. When mitochondria overlap in space the intensity signal is additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), allowing discrimination of overlap from fusion. Fusion was thus determined to occur in instances when mitochondria ends came into contact and then formed an apparent single mitochondrion with uniform intensity, verified by line scans using NIH ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As noted above, DsRed-mito often labeled mitochondria resulting in different mean intensities per mitochondrion. The redistribution of signal intensity from the higher intensity mitochondrion to equalize within the emergent fused mitochondrion was also taken as a criterion of fusion when disparities between the intensity of the two interacting mitochondria were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, following instances considered to reflect fusion the lengths of the considered emergent mitochondrion was additive of that of the two contributing mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A caveat is that we cannot exclude the possibility of rare events during which two mitochondria ends might have come into immediate proximity (e.g., less than 0.24 μm/2 pixels) giving the appearance of fusion, as defined by the apparent uniform intensity of the resulting dyad of adjacent mitochondria. However, as measured, the fusion rates were not affected in any case in this study and this caveat is unlikely to have biased results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of mitochondrial movement</title><p>The movement of mitochondria, as with fission/fusion dynamics, was determined through detailed frame-by-frame analysis. Stalled mitochondria were defined as those that spent at a minimum the first minute during the imaging sequence without detectable movement. Approximately, 60% of mitochondria thus defined as stalled, that did not undergo fission, remained stalled for the duration of the imaging period. The remainder provided the baseline for stalled mitochondria that did not undergo fission but that may have subsequently undergone transport. Oscillating mitochondria were defined as those that underwent bouts of antero-retrograde movements less that 1 μm in either direction but did not undergo net displacement during the imaging period, analogous to the ‘dynamic pause’ behavior described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al. (2016)</xref>. Mitochondria undergoing transport were defined as those having moved greater than 1 μm in the retrograde or anterograde direction. Rates of mitochondrial transport (μm/sec) were derived by measuring the displacement of the mitochondria end in the direction of transport during the period of continuous movement in that direction divided by the time during which the movement occurred. If a retrogradely transported mitochondrion exited the field of view the measurement was performed up to the last frame when the mitochondrial end was visible, and if an anterograde mitochondrion entered the growth cone the measurement was similarly ended. Measurements were made along the axon shaft up to the neck of the growth cone, where the axon shaft increases in diameter as the central domain commences, or if a distinct neck was not visible, as is the case with growth cone that do not have lamellipodia, then the distal 10 μm of the axon shaft were defined as the growth cone and excluded. The lengths of runs were determined by the sum of the distance a mitochondrion moved during a continuous bout of movement. If a mitochondrion switched direction during a run the total run length is reflective of the summed distance traveled during the run regardless of direction. Termination of movement during a run was defined as a period greater than or equal to 6 s during which no movement occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of axon branching</title><p>The criteria for determination of mature branches from in vitro experiments wherein the microtubules and actin filaments were labeled as described above her been extensively detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al. (2012)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spillane et al. (2013)</xref>, and were followed herein. Briefly, a branch was defined as containing microtubules and an asymmetric distal enriched accumulation of actin filaments. Similarly, for determination of branches in the spinal cord we followed the morphological criteria described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spillane et al. (2011)</xref>. Briefly, extensions along the axon shaft greater than 10 μm were classified as branches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Axonal actin dynamics</title><p>The methods for the analysis of the dynamics of axonal actin patches have been described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loudon et al. (2006)</xref> and were similarly followed in this work. Given that Drp1 accumulations followed similar dynamics to actin patches the same approach was used to analyze the former. As described for the quantification of immunocytochemical staining levels acquisition parameters were set so as to keep the pixels in the image within the dynamic range and 2 × 2 camera binning was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) Analysis</title><p>For FRAP experiments dissociated neurons were electroporated with myrGFP3`UTR-Cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>). As described for the quantification of immunocytochemical staining levels acquisition parameters were set so as to keep the pixels in the image within the dynamic range and 2 × 2 camera binning was used. Images were acquired immediately after NGF addition, and just before and after bleaching, at 5 min intervals for 1 hr. For imaging a Zeiss Pan-Neofluar 100 objective with 1.3 NA was used. Photobleaching of myrGFP was performed using a 2 min exposure of the distal axon in the imaging field to light from a 100 W source. Phase contrast images of the axons acquired at the same times as the GFP channel were used to determine the location of the axon at early time points in the FRAP when the GFP signal is too low to detect the axon. Only axons that were photobleached by 90% of their initial value were used in the analysis. To track recovery, the mean background subtracted intensity of myrGFP was measured in a fixed length of the axon at multiple time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In ovo electroporation and ex vivo imaging</title><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spillane et al.

(2013)</xref>, lumbosacral chicken embryo DRG were electroporated in ovo at E3 using a CUY-21SC electroporator (Nepa Gene) equipped with 3 mm L-shaped gold tip electrodes (Harvard Apparatus). Five 50 ms 50V pulses were applied at a rate of 1 pulse per second. Expression vectors were injected (1 μg/μl diluted in dH2O with 0.01% fast green) into the lumen of the neural tube and electrodes placed at the level of the lumbosacral enlargement. DRGs were transfected unilaterally. At E7, embryos were removed from the eggs and the entire spinal cord caudal to the first thoracic segment was dissected. The cord was then divided into two halves by cutting the roof and floor plates and immediately placed in the well of a video-imaging dish containing 20 μl of culturing medium. The well of the video dish was then closed by placing a glass coverslip on top of the well in the dish and sealed to the dish by a ring of medium between the glass and dish surface. The assembled video dish containing the spinal cord was immediately used for imaging. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss 200M inverted microscope equipped with an Orca-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu). For imaging a Zeiss Pan-Neofluar 100X objective with 1.3 NA was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>). Plasmid used for in ovo electroporation were: pDsRed2-Mito, pEYFP-C1-Drp1, mCherry, pEYFP-C1-Drp1K38A.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Generation of dominant negative K38A Drp1</title><p>The plasmid pEYFP-C1-Drp1 (Addgene; Cat# 45160) was used as the PCR template of directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies; Cat# 200519–4) to create the mutant plasmid pEYFP-C1-Drp1K38A.

The PCR conditions were set following the manufacture instructions as 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min, and 68°C for 7 min in a duration of 16 cycles. The PCR product was fully verified by sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>In vitro data involving population based statistical comparisons (i.e., axon branching, quantitative immunocytochemistry, mitochondria length and density) was collected from 4 to 6 cultures per experimental group sampling only axons that were not containing other cells along the regions where the analysis was performed. Individual cultures were generated using explants or cells from different embryos (herein defined as a biological replicate). All groups in the experimental design were cultured, treated and processed in parallel. For live imaging studies, the number of cultures is reflected in the number of axons sampled. Sampling between experimental groups within an experimental design was equalized across days so that data for different groups did not come from disparate sets of cultures sampled on different days. For in ovo electroporation studies 3–4 chicken embryos were electroporated and axons sampled therein, each chicken embryo is considered a biological replicate. Quantification was performed blind after masking data sets and identification of the groups from a masking key upon completion of the analysis.</p><p>All data were analyzed using Instat software (GraphPad software Inc). The software determines the normalcy of data sets using the Kolmogorov and Smirnov test. For normal data sets analysis was performed using the Welch t-test for independent groups or the paired t-test for before-after treatment experimental designs. If non-normal data sets were detected, then non-parametric analysis was used (Mann-Whitney test). For multiple comparison tests within experimental designs, parametric Bonferroni or non-parametric Dunn’s post-hoc tests were used based on the normalcy of the data sets. For data sets representing categorical data falling into bins the Fischer’s exact test was used on the raw data, although the data is expressed as percentages for ease of appreciation. One or two tailed p values are reported based on whether the hypothesis did or did not dictate the directionality of the expected change in mean or median, respectively. All graphs were generated using Prism (GraphPad software Inc). Sample sizes and qualitative statistical presentation are denoted in figure legends or figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Pharmacological reagents</title><p>LY294002 (Sigma, Cat# L9908),

induces mitochondrial fission in sensory neurons, resulting in collateral axon branching. The results confirm that neurotrophic signaling occurs through mitochondrial fission, which has been actively investigated recently by several groups. The impact of these studies is the suggestion that effects on morphological plasticity by neurotrophins depends upon mitochondrial function.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neurotrophins Induce Fission of Mitochondria Along Embryonic Sensory axons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stefan Kassabov (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study shows that NGF controls mitochondria fission which gives rise to axon branching in sensory neurons. The findings are novel and have a functional readout. There was considerable agreement that the study was well done and of interest. A number of major reservations were raised. The major issues are the need for compartmentalized cultures, if possible, to confirm the local effects of NGF and more pharmacological controls for mitochondria fission and axon branching. The controls include blocking Trk and PI3K and Erk pathways and are detailed in the reviews below. Several corrections in the text and additional discussion of the literature on mitochondrial fission are recommended. The reviewers also raise several pertinent questions and issues that should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report that neurotrophins induce mitochondrial fission in the embryonic chick sensory axons, which is followed by a steady state with stable mitochondria length and density. The NGF dependent branching is driven by combined PI3K and Mek-Erk signaling. Mek-Erk controls the activity of the fission mediator Drp1 GTPase, while PI3K may contribute to the actin dependent aspect of fission. It is interesting that the Drp1 mediated fission is specific to mitochondria and the regulation of mitochondrial fission is a required component of the NGF-induced axon branching mechanism. Overall this manuscript is well written, well referenced and rigorous. I am a bit torn with respect to how transformational this work is. I would argue that the majority of the work is connecting dots that are already out there not only from this group but also folks like Hollenbeck and Koyama. For example it's known that mitochondria are important for branching, Drp1 is required for fission, and that MAPK phosphorylates Drp1 among other things. The real novelty here is the NGF promotes mitochondrial fission which is required for branching. They fill in a lot of details for how NGF signaling fits into these previously published observations. Below are individual critiques:</p><p>Axons were locally perfused axons with NGF to address whether NGF is acting locally to induce mitochondrial fission (Figure 1—figure supplement 2G). It's hard to be totally confident that this is local. Is it possible to do these experiments in scenarios where the cell body is isolated (i.e. compartmentalized cultures)?</p><p>If actin patch formation is an NGF dependent process as shown by their previous work (Ketschek and Gallo, 2010), what are the dynamics of mitochondria fission and filopodia formation from the actin patch in presence of NGF? What is the timeline for actin patch formation after mitochondria fission?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript Galo and colleagues uncover a novel function of neurotrophins in regulating mitochondrial fission, which enables colateral branching in embryonic chick sensory axons in vitro. While the role of mitochondrial fission in axonal branching in vitro and in vivo has already been demonstrated in a recent paper by Franck Polleux's group (Lewis et al., 2018), the demonstration that neurotrophins exert their well-recognized effects on axonal branching through regulation of mitochondrial fission is indeed new and significant. It adds to a growing body of evidence connecting neurotrophic signaling with mitochondrial function and implies that other important functions of neurotrophins in neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity could be similarly dependent on their effect on mitochondrial dynamics.</p><p>The study is conducted in a very rigorous and thorough manner and the conclusions of the authors are well supported by the data. The papers is well written and the authors have thoroughly and comprehensively discussed their findings in the context of axon collateral branching. However, the authors should do more to contextualize their findings in a broader perspective of neurotrophin biology and its connection with mitochondrial function. There are some major omissions from their review of the existing literature, which are very pertinent and need to be cited and discussed as pointed below. There are also some additional experiments needed to extend and strengthen the author's conclusions as detailed below.</p><p>1) Literature review</p><p>Most critically the authors should cite and discuss a recent study by Tom Blanpied's group, that found that NMDAR dependent LTP induction is accompanied by and requires a rapid burst of dendritic mitochondrial fission (Divakaruni et al., 2018). The burst of mitochondrial fission triggered by LTP inducing stimuli is very similar to the one identified by the current study by Gallo's group, which raises the exciting possibility that BDNF release, that is well known to be critically important for LTP induction, is mediating the burst. The Blanpied's group study found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation triggered the mito fission burst in a CaMKII, actin and Drp1 dependent manner. Both studies found that phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser615 is critical and although Blanpied study concluded that CaMKII is the responsible kinase, it is also possible that the CaMKII role is indirect and needed for the secretion of BDNF and the actual kinase involved is Mek-Erk downstream of BDNF release as shown in the Gallo's study. There are examples from the broader non neuronal literature of both kinases phosphorylating Drp1 so they could also be differentially involved in the two different contexts.</p><p>In this context the authors should also cite the seminal study by Morgan Sheng's group (Li et al., 2004) showing that modulation of neuronal activity (KCl depolarization or TTX silencing) bi-directionally controls mitochondrial fission in a Drp1 dependent manner and mitochondrial fission is critical for synaptogenesis. That study found a higher level of invasion of the smaller mitochondria resulting from increased fission into nascent filopodial which are precursors of spines which led to formation of more excitatory synapses. That is very reminiscent of the higher level of invasion of smaller mitochondria into filopodial precursors of branches found in the Gallo study. Moreover, as in the more recent LTP study – BDNF release which is triggered by elevated neuronal activity could well be the factor inducing the fission observed in the earlier study, as the current Gallo study would imply.</p><p>The idea that neurotrophin release mediated mitochondrial fission is underlying branching, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity is a very exciting proposition, with large clinical ramifications that should be given a proper airing in the paper and will broaden its impact and appeal.</p><p>2) Experimental i) One important aspect of the study that has not been sufficiently elaborated, is the mechanism of persistence of the new steady state of mitochondrial fission/fusion balance in the presence of NGF. How is this balance stabilized at a certain set point and maintained and how does it revert back to its pre-existing level upon NGF withdrawal? After the initial burst of increased fission/fusion leading to smaller mitochondrial size, this ratio is brought back to equal to maintain that size. When NGF is withdrawn, either the fission rate must decrease or the fusion rate increase until the pre-existing mito length is achieved. The authors should analyze more closely the mitochondrial dynamics changes upon NGF withdrawal by live imaging at different points after NGF withdrawal to distinguish these possibilities and get a better sense of the kinetics of the reversal process. Moreover, they should block the PI3K-AKT and/or Mek-Erk pathways AFTER the establishing of the steady state to distinguish their relative contributions to the maintenance of this state.</p><p>ii) There are multiple studies showing that neurotrophin signaling modulates mitochondrial functions apart from mitochondrial dynamics and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, including ATP synthesis, membrane potential, respiratory capacity and others, some of which are cited by the authors themselves. Moreover, mitochondrial dynamics is intimately linked with mitochondrial functions. Given that it seems likely that some of these functional parameters could also be changed, so in addition to their smaller size the mitochondria in the new NT driven steady state could also be functionally distinct and more active. At minimum, the membrane potential can be relatively straightforwardly assessed using TMRM staining, but a more thorough investigation of other parameters like ATP production and respiratory capacity will be very informative.</p><p>iii) The authors have thoroughly analyzed the effects of exogenous NGF applications on mitochondrial fission, but it is important to assess what is the contribution of endogenous NT signaling. The authors can use function blocking antibodies and or pharmacological blockade of NT-Trk signaling to ask if the baseline level of fission/fusion balance is influenced. Given the finding of Blaniped's group that CamKII signaling is dynamically involved in the baseline maintenance of fission/fusion balance in addition to its role in LTP induction in hippocampal neurons, it will be interesting to asses CaMKII's role in the context of the current study.</p><p>iv) Since neurotrophins signal through both Trk and P75NTR receptors it is standard practice to assess what is the contribution of each class of receptor to the observed phenomenon. The authors do show that classic Trk mediated pathways are involved, but this does not automatically rule out p75NTR involvement, which can also augment Trk signaling in some contexts or antagonize it in others. This will be worthwhile to be assessed in the maintenance phase as well. As above, function blocking antibodies against Trk and p75NTR and pharmacological means (K252A) can be used to address this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper entitled &quot;Neurotrophins induce fission of mitochondria along embryonic sensory axons&quot; is describing nicely a novel role of short-term mitochondria fission as a promoter of axonal branching of sensory neurons, in an NGF dependent process. This neurotrophin signaling is mediated through both ERK and AKT pathways, leading to fast localized translation of actin related proteins that has a dual role both in filopodia formation and in mitochondria fission that contribute further to branching.</p><p>The manuscript displays a strong, validated system, and using a set of pharmacological and genetical manipulations is providing strong evidence supporting the novel and innovative hypothesized model.</p><p>1) For all genetic and pharmacologic manipulations – are they having effect on neuronal survival and cause degeneration? The author is using high levels of drugs such as Lantrunculin that is toxic to neurons but there is no control experiment measuring the effect of those drugs on neuronal viability in the current DRG system.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2G-H are discussing the effects of a &quot;local&quot; perfusion of NGF. However, as those experiments were not done under any separation or isolation of specific parts of the axon. The authors should either do those experiments in a compartmental chamber or by using labeled NGF so it can be interpreted as local effect.</p><p>3) The IF imaging of Phos-DRP, Phos-ERK and Phos-AKT (Figure 4) are not in high quality, and they are the only direct evidence (not pathway inhibition) used to describe the time course of NGF effect on their neuronal system. The authors should provide experiments with higher resolution and imaging quality. Also, the authors are claiming that P-AKT and P-ERK are higher in mitochondria positive axonal segments. However, the signal enrichment in those parts after 6 minutes is only around 150%, but when the authors measured the whole axon they found an enrichment of 450%, thus contradicting their own statement.</p><p>4) The in-vivo data is referring only to the effect of DN-DRP1 on mitochondria length and density, and number of axonal branches. This experiment is discussing a long-term effect of DRP1 inhibition, with no reference to the acute effect of NGF on this system. The experiments of the acute ex-vivo explants should be also tested after administration of NGF to see that NGF administration will not cause a rescue effect, meaning the observed changes are a result of the chronicle toxicity of DN-DRP1 on the embryo.</p><p>5) Figure 7 – The local synthesis results are very promising but require many crucial controls.</p><p>a) What is the effect of protein synthesis inhibition (puromycin, anisomycin, cycloheximide) on mitochondria fission and axonal branching of the sensory neurons? Also, a protein synthesis inhibition should be used as a control to see the baseline signal of no-recovery after photo-bleaching.</p><p>b) What is the effect of AKT or ERK pathway inhibitors on the local translation of cortactin?</p><p>c) Is there endogenous translation of cortactin after NGF treatment?</p><p>6) It is a long paper with complexed figures and inadequate writing that make it hard for the reader to follow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49494.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Axons were locally perfused axons with NGF to address whether NGF is acting locally to induce mitochondrial fission (Figure 1—figure supplement 2G).

NGF increases the rate of actin patch formation, but actin patches also form in the absence of NGF treatment (Ketschek and Gallo, 2010). Actin patches serve as precursors to filopodia formation regardless of NGF treatment and NGF does not elicit increased rates of filopodia formation from patches (i.e., the probability that a patch will give rise to a filopodium; Ketschek and Gallo, 2010) or alter other aspects of patch dynamics (at the population level). We previously described that increases in the rate of actin patch formation become detectable at 15 min post-treatment but reach the highest level at 30 min after treatment (Spillane et al., 2012). The increase in the rate of actin patch formation induced by NGF is dependent on the axonal translation of mRNAs coding for actin regulatory proteins (Spillane et al., 2012) involved in patch formation and development (Spillane et al., 2011. 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the timeline for actin patch formation after mitochondria fission?</p></disp-quote><p>The issue and the timeline of events (e.g., increase in actin patch formation and fission following NGF treatment) is presented in the Discussion and model figure (Figure 8A).

The mechanism of NGF induced sensory axon branching, unlike that described for some central nervous system neurons (e.g., Netrin induced branching along cortical axons; Tang and Kalil, 2005), does not involve calcium (Gallo and Letourneau, 1998). Over the years, we have further probed possible roles for calcium in unpublished experiments and invariably have failed to observe any role for calcium.</p><p>First, using cytosolic ratiometric calcium sensors (GCamp6) we fail to see and effect of NGF on axonal calcium levels. Second, using mitochondrially targeted ratiometric calcium sensors (mito-GCamp6) we also fail to detect an effect of NGF on mitochondrial calcium levels. In the context of these data sets we had positive controls using calcium ionophores. Third, using KN62 to inhibit CaM Kinases we do not observe an inhibition of NGF-induced axon branching (we used a 1-30 µM, 30 min pre-treatment prior to treatment with NGF; KN62 is expected to have saturating inhibitory effects at 5 µM). While we do not feel that these data sets addressing the role of calcium would add to the current manuscript we are now including a discussion of the absence of a role of calcium in NGF-induced axon branching and the literature suggested by the reviewer (Discussion, sixth paragraph). We are also referencing the Li et al., 2004 paper in the context of the discussion regarding mitochondria size and targeting to branches (Discussion, fourth paragraph). The added sections of text are reproduced below:</p><p>“Similarly, netrin-1 induces the branching of cortical axons through the local regulation of axonal calcium levels through a mechanism requiring both CaMKII and MAPK signaling (Tang and Kalil, 2005). […] Interestingly, netrin-1 induced branching along cortical axons is dependent on both CaMKII and MAPK signaling (Tang and Kalil, 2005), but whether fission of mitochondria downstream of either of these kinases is involved remains to be determined.”</p><p>“Li et al., 2004, similarly reported that small mitochondria tend to target to dendritic filopodia and spines, although they also observed portions of larger mitochondria penetrating dendritic protrusions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Experimental i) One important aspect of the study that has not been sufficiently elaborated, is the mechanism of persistence of the new steady state of mitochondrial fission/fusion balance in the presence of NGF. How is this balance stabilized at a certain set point and maintained and how does it revert back to its pre-existing level upon NGF withdrawal? After the initial burst of increased fission/fusion leading to smaller mitochondrial size, this ratio is brought back to equal to maintain that size. When NGF is withdrawn, either the fission rate must decrease or the fusion rate increase until the pre-existing mito length is achieved. The authors should analyze more closely the mitochondrial dynamics changes upon NGF withdrawal by live imaging at different points after NGF withdrawal to distinguish these possibilities and get a better sense of the kinetics of the reversal process. Moreover, they should block the PI3K-AKT and/or Mek-Erk pathways AFTER the establishing of the steady state to distinguish their relative contributions to the maintenance of this state.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we now present data on the percentage of mitochondria that undergo fission and fusion in the context of the NGF withdraw paradigm initially used in Figure 1F. The new data are presented in Figure 1G.We found that during the first 10-20 minutes after NGF withdraw there is an increase in fusion with no effect on fission. In contrast, during 70-80 minutes after NGF withdraw the rate of fusion returned to baseline levels, and that of fission was not affected. These data thus indicate, somewhat surprisingly, that upon NGF withdraw there is an activation of fusion without an impact on fission. This is an interesting observation and we plan of following it up in future work.</p><p>We also addressed the roles of PI3K and Mek-Erk signaling in maintaining mitochondria length during the NGF-induced steady state and find that inhibition of either of these pathways results in mitochondrial elongation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1K).</p><p>We had initially considered that the analysis of the mechanism of the mitochondrial steady state maintained by NGF would be a detailed follow up publication. However, based on the reviewer’s suggestions we now present these data herein and agree that they add to the present manuscript. We plan on following up on these data sets in a subsequent manuscript.</p><p>We have revised the text in the Discussion regarding the steady state to reflect the new observations, resulting in shortening of that section and removal of the more speculative aspects.</p><p>“The mechanism of the maintenance of the neurotrophin-induced steady state of mitochondria in axons will require further consideration. […] The mechanism underlying the increase in fusion remains to be determined but may reflect a suppression of PI3K and/or Erk signaling following NGF-withdraw.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) There are multiple studies showing that neurotrophin signaling modulates mitochondrial functions apart from mitochondrial dynamics and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, including ATP synthesis, membrane potential, respiratory capacity and others, some of which are cited by the authors themselves. Moreover, mitochondrial dynamics is intimately linked with mitochondrial functions. Given that it seems likely that some of these functional parameters could also be changed, so in addition to their smaller size the mitochondria in the new NT driven steady state could also be functionally distinct and more active. At minimum, the membrane potential can be relatively straightforwardly assessed using TMRM staining, but a more thorough investigation of other parameters like ATP production and respiratory capacity will be very informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior work from the Hollenbeck laboratory using the same neuronal chicken sensory population as in the current study has reported a slight hyperpolarization of axonal mitochondria in response to NGF treatment through measurements of TMRM intensity (Verburg and Hollenbeck, 2008; referenced in original submission). We have analyzed the ATP/ADP ratio in axons using the ratiometric sensor Perceval-HR and find no effect of NGF treatment during the first 15 min (we have not addressed later time points), although both inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis decreases the ATP/ADP ratio as positive controls. We are not including these data in the current manuscript and hold that an analysis of the effects of NGF on axonal bioenergetics is an additional issue, which we are however considering as our work progresses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The authors have thoroughly analyzed the effects of exogenous NGF applications on mitochondrial fission, but it is important to assess what is the contribution of endogenous NT signaling. The authors can use function blocking antibodies and or pharmacological blockade of NT-Trk signaling to ask if the baseline level of fission/fusion balance is influenced. Given the finding of Blaniped's group that CamKII signaling is dynamically involved in the baseline maintenance of fission/fusion balance in addition to its role in LTP induction in hippocampal neurons, it will be interesting to asses CaMKII's role in the context of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>For consideration of the issue of CaMKII we refer the reviewer to the prior response regarding the work of Divakaruni et al., 2018. Our system involves sensory axons not contacting other axons and not in an integrated network (as sensory neurons so not synapse on one another), on laminin coated substrata that specifically allows TrkA positive axons, and no other sensory subpopulations, to extend (as initially presented in Results). To our knowledge there is no “endogenous NGF signaling”, although laminin may well signal to mitochondria. The latter, while of interest, we consider to be beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Since neurotrophins signal through both Trk and P75NTR receptors it is standard practice to assess what is the contribution of each class of receptor to the observed phenomenon. The authors do show that classic Trk mediated pathways are involved, but this does not automatically rule out p75NTR involvement, which can also augment Trk signaling in some contexts or antagonize it in others. This will be worthwhile to be assessed in the maintenance phase as well. As above, function blocking antibodies against Trk and p75NTR and pharmacological means (K252A) can be used to address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial data indicating the effect of NGF is mediated by TrkA were the NGF concentration profile response and the well-established activation of TrkA of PI3K and Mek-Erk signaling. In agreement with the reviewer’s suggestion we have further probed the role of the TrkA receptor using two approaches. First, we used k252a and find that it inhibits NGF-induced decreases in mitochondria length. Second, we treated the cultures with 100 ng/mL BDNF, which binds the p75 receptor but not the TrkA receptor, and find that it does not induce changes in mitochondria lengths. These data are now presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2K, and the associated text in the Results is as follows; “To further address the issue we pre-treated with the TrkA inhibitor k252a prior to NGF treatment resulting in inhibition of the NGF-induced decrease in mitochondria length (Figure 1—figure supplement 2K). […] Collectively these data indicate the effects of NGF on axonal mitochondria are mediated through the TrkA receptor.”</p><p>The results of these two additional experiments are consistent with the requirement for TrkA activation by NGF and the insufficiency of p75 binding by neurotrophins in inducing mitochondria fission and discussed on 495-501; “The concentration profile of NGF induced fission on axonal mitochondria is consistent with activation of the TrkA receptor (Kaplan et al., 1991) that activates both PI3K and Erk signaling. The observations that inhibition of TrkA using k252a inhibits NGF-induced fission and that treatment with BDNF at a concentration expected to activate the p75 receptor does not induce fission indicate that TrkA is the major receptor mediating the effect of NGF on mitochondria fission. However, a role for p75 in modulating TrkA signaling cannot at present be ruled out.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) For all genetic and pharmacologic manipulations – are they having effect on neuronal survival and cause degeneration? The author is using high levels of drugs such as Lantrunculin that is toxic to neurons but there is no control experiment measuring the effect of those drugs on neuronal viability in the current DRG system.</p></disp-quote><p>The major sign of axonal toxicity is the beading and fragmentation of the axon as microtubules undergo depolymerization. We have not seen this in any of our manipulations including the prolonged treatments with LY294002 or Mek-Erk inhibitors. Toxicity and cell death usually also correlate with the induction of mitochondria fission, which the reagents used in the study instead block.</p><p>We have used Latrunculin extensively in our prior work using chicken sensory neurons and do not find it to be toxic. Furthermore, the treatment times used in the study are relatively brief. Indeed, latrunculin has been used in numerous studies using a variety of neurons and toxicity is not, to our knowledge, reported. For example, latrunculin treatment for 24 hrs promotes the formation of axon-like processes from hippocampal neurons (Bradke and Dotti, 1999, Science 283(5409):1931-4).</p><p>Similarly, expression of DNDrp1 was not found to have evident toxic effects in the context of our studies, and similar manipulations of Drp1 have not been reported to have toxic effect in neurons until extended time periods of weeks to months and on shorter terms are neuroprotective in injury/toxic scenarios. As the literature is large and overall consistent using a variety of methods to inhibit Drp1 just a couple of examples are referred to herein: Expression of DN-Drp1 for 4 days does not have reported toxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons (Li et al., 2004; Divakaruni et al., 2018).</p><p>In conclusion, based on our prior experience working with these reagents, lack of signs of toxicity (e.g., axon beading/swelling), their long history of use in the field and characterization, and the overall literature, we do not have reason to consider that toxicity is an issue, again emphasizing the treatments inhibit fission and fission is often a characteristic of cell death and toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2G-H are discussing the effects of a &quot;local&quot; perfusion of NGF. However, as those experiments were not done under any separation or isolation of specific parts of the axon.

The authors should provide experiments with higher resolution and imaging quality. Also, the authors are claiming that P-AKT and P-ERK are higher in mitochondria positive axonal segments. However, the signal enrichment in those parts after 6 minutes is only around 150%, but when the authors measured the whole axon they found an enrichment of 450%, thus contradicting their own statement.</p></disp-quote><p>The pErk data are from 7.5 min and 6 min after NGF treatment in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and G, respectively. Direct comparison between the two is thus not warranted.</p><p>The reviewer is correct about the discrepancy in the pAkt data presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and I. The data included herein are from an ongoing larger project addressing the issues of the time course of activation of pathways by NGF and their relationship to mitochondria. In considering the reviewer’s comment we noticed that data from Akt phosphorylation at serine 476 was used in making panel I, while it ought to have been the data from p308. We are grateful for bringing this to our attention. Figure 4—figure supplement 1I has been revised to show data from the phosphorylation of Akt at p308 as originally intended. Finally, we confirmed that Figure 4—figure supplement 1J is indeed from the p308 data set.</p><p>The images in the data sets are from experiments wherein the acquisition parameters are set to ensure that the signal remains well within the dynamic range of pixels for subsequent quantification, as described in the Materials and methods (Quantification of immunocytochemical labeling). While this results in visually suboptimal images it generates data sets amenable to digital quantification of fluorescence intensities within the dynamic range. The signal presents as puncta, and the treatments increase the density of puncta but have minor effects on their individual intensity (these data are not presented herein as they are reserved for the broader study of signaling along axons referred to above). The quantification shows that using these image data sets we observe the expected differences in the time course of activation of both the Akt and Erk pathways, as these have been extensively detailed through western analysis in the literature.</p><p>“NGF elevated the activity of both pathways in axon segments containing mitochondria at 6 min of treatment when fission is occurring (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-J)”. The statement in the manuscript that the pathways are activated in axonal segments containing mitochondria, as reflected by the analysis of staining intensity at mitochondria under no NGF and NGF treatment conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and I), is not impacted by the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in-vivo data is referring only to the effect of DN-DRP1 on mitochondria length and density, and number of axonal branches. This experiment is discussing a long-term effect of DRP1 inhibition, with no reference to the acute effect of NGF on this system. The experiments of the acute ex-vivo explants should be also tested after administration of NGF to see that NGF administration will not cause a rescue effect, meaning the observed changes are a result of the chronicle toxicity of DN-DRP1 on the embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the in vivo experiments expressing DN-Drp1 do not address the effects of NGF but rather the normally occurring developmental branching of sensory axons in the spinal cord, a point made through the manuscript (e.g., subsection “Inhibition of Drp1 function impairs the developmental collateral branching of sensory axons in the spinal cord”; Discussion, fourth paragraph) and we did not suggest otherwise. The value of the data from the in vivo experiments, we argue and as initially stated, is to provide evidence that in a context different than NGF-mediated axon branching suppression of Drp1 function also results in the impairment of axon branching. This result is consistent with a recent study addressing the role of fission in cortical axon development (Lewis et al., 2018).</p><p>We are beginning to address the issue of in vivo induction of sensory axon branching by NGF in the context of spinal cord injury scenarios wherein endogenously generated</p><p>NGF induces the branching of sensory axons contributing to autonomic dysreflexia (collaboration with our colleague Dr. G. Smith) but these experiments are not considered for this paper and we are retaining them as a separate project. We are also currently do not have a system set up to perform the suggested experiment in the chicken embryonic spinal cord which would require work well beyond the time provided for revisions as the system would need development (e.g., best delivery method, dosage, etc) and characterization (e.g., time course of effects of exogenous NGF on axon, etc) first, a large undertaking in and of its own.</p><p><italic>The observed changes are a result of the chronicle toxicity of DN-DRP1 on theembryo</italic>.</p><p>The electroporation method used results in DN-Drp1 being expressed only by a small subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in 2-3 DRGs unilaterally. Thus, embryonic toxicity is not a concern and we did not observe different rates of lethality of embryos after electroporation based on the construct being delivered. The axons of the transfected neurons do not exhibit signs of degeneration at the time points studied (i.e., no beading nor swelling) and although not quantified we did not observe difference in the number of transfected axons in the spinal cords between embryos transfected with control or DN-Drp1, indicating no deleterious effects. Furthermore, as noted in a prior comment, expression of DN-Drp1 or otherwise prolonged suppression of mitochondrial fission in neurons in vivo or in vitro does not have toxic effects until very delayed time periods. For example, in the most directly related other study to the current study (Lewis et al., 2018) cortical axons with In Utero Electroporation shRNA-mediated depletion of MFF from E15.5-P21 days developed normal axons that were however deficient in branching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7 – The local synthesis results are very promising but require many crucial controls.</p><p>a) What is the effect of protein synthesis inhibition (puromycin, anisomycin, cycloheximide) on mitochondria fission and axonal branching of the sensory neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>NGF-induced branching: We previously published that inhibition of intra-axonal protein synthesis inhibits the NGF-induced branching based on experiments such as those suggested by the reviewer (Spillane et al., 2012), providing the background and rationale for the current experiment on cortactin as we have shown this protein undergoes axonal translation in response to NGF (Spillane et al., 2012; Ketschek et al., 2016).
