This is particularly problematic in the case of the β-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin, which is the first-line therapy. It is therefore crucial to uncover targets that would kill or resensitize amoxicillin-resistant pneumococci. To do so, we developed a genome-wide, single-cell based, gene silencing screen using CRISPR interference called sCRilecs-seq (<underline>s</underline>ubsets of <underline>CR</underline>ISPR <underline>i</underline>nterference <underline>l</underline>ibraries <underline>e</underline>xtracted by fluorescence activated <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>s</underline>orting coupled to next generation <underline>seq</underline>uencing). Since amoxicillin affects growth and division, sCRilecs-seq was used to identify targets that are responsible for maintaining proper cell size. Our screen revealed that downregulation of the mevalonate pathway leads to extensive cell elongation. Further investigation into this phenotype indicates that it is caused by a reduced availability of cell wall precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis due to a limitation in the production of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), the lipid carrier that is responsible for transporting these precursors across the cell membrane. The data suggest that, whereas peptidoglycan synthesis continues even with reduced Und-P levels, cell constriction is specifically halted. We successfully exploited this knowledge to create a combination treatment strategy where the FDA-approved drug clomiphene, an inhibitor of Und-P synthesis, is paired up with amoxicillin. Our results show that clomiphene potentiates the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin and that combination therapy resensitizes amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. These findings could provide a starting point to develop a solution for the increasing amount of hard-to-treat amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a bacterium that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and other life-threatening illnesses in humans. Currently, many <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections are treated with the antibiotic amoxicillin, which kills the bacteria by weakening a structure known as the cell wall that surrounds each bacterium. However, more and more <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells are becoming resistant to amoxicillin, making it harder to treat such infections.</p><p>We need new ways to effectively treat <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections in humans. One potential strategy would be to combine amoxicillin with another drug that boosts the activity of amoxicillin so that it is able to kill the resistant bacteria. Two drugs that both target the same process in cells are more likely to boost each other’s activity. Therefore, Dewachter et al. decided to search for another drug that also weakens the cell wall of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p>The team first developed a new screening approach called sCRilecs-seq to silence individual genes in single <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells. By looking at many cells that each had a different gene that was no longer active, the team were able to identify several genes that when silenced resulted in the cells becoming longer than normal cells (a sign the bacteria may have weak cell walls). Further experiments revealed that the cell walls of these bacteria were weaker than normal cells due to a shortage in a cell wall building material known as undecaprenyl phosphate.</p><p>Dewachter et al. then demonstrated that combining an existing drug known as clomiphene – which is known to inhibit undecaprenyl phosphate production and is currently used to treat infertility in humans – together with amoxicillin is able to effectively kill <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> that are resistant to amoxicillin alone. Clomiphene also boosted the activity of amoxicillin against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> that remain sensitive to the antibiotic.</p><p>Before this new drug combination may be used to help treat <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections in human patients, further experiments will be needed to find out the optimum dose of clomiphene to use with amoxicillin. In the future, the new screening approach developed by Dewachter et al. may also prove useful to other researchers studying a wide range of biological questions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>amoxicillin resistance</kwd><kwd>sCRilecs-seq</kwd><kwd>mevalonate pathway</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan synthesis</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Skłodowska Curie 837923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewachter</surname><given-names>Liselot</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>771534-PneumoCaTChER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_200792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018693</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>847786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sirard</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_192517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40AR40_185533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40_180541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veening</surname><given-names>Jan-Willem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput single-cell based, genome-wide gene silencing screening (sCRilecs-seq) revealed that drugging the mevalonate pathway resensitizes amoxicillin-resistant pneumococci.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is an opportunistic human pathogen that is responsible for diseases such as pneumonia, middle ear infections, sepsis, and meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O’Brien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bogaert et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen for the development of novel antibiotics since it is one of the leading causes of fatal bacterial infections worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O’Brien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>), and antibiotic resistance is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Càmara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schrag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hakenbeck et al., 2012</xref>). The alarming increase in prevalence of penicillin non-susceptible <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was initially dealt with by the development and roll-out of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 in 2001, 2009, and 2010, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Càmara et al., 2018</xref>). These vaccines induce protection against infection caused by 7, 10, or 13 of the most prevalent serotypes of capsular polysaccharides that surround <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bogaert et al., 2004</xref>). Since many of the targeted serotypes are associated with penicillin non-susceptibility, the occurrence of infections with such resistant strains decreased at first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Càmara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brueggemann et al., 2007</xref>). However, due to the high genomic plasticity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanage et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Domenech, 2020</xref>), serotype switching created penicillin non-susceptible escape mutants that are not covered by the currently available vaccines and that are once again gaining in prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Càmara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Penicillin non-susceptible <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains carry a variety of mutations in their penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that decrease their affinity for penicillin and therefore increase resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hakenbeck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chi et al., 2007</xref>). These mutations do not only lower the susceptibility to penicillin but also to other β-lactam antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prieto et al., 2002</xref>). However, the efficacy of aminopenicillins such as amoxicillin is usually less affected by these mutations, meaning that amoxicillin remains a viable treatment option for many penicillin non-susceptible strains and therefore became one of the frontline antibiotics to treat pneumococcal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prieto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquero et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacobs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bradley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thiem et al., 2011</xref>). However, highly penicillin-resistant strains have been found to also be amoxicillin non-susceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Càmara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schrag et al., 2004</xref>), thereby now also threatening the clinical efficacy of this widely used antibiotic.</p><p>Because of the rise in antibiotic resistance, we urgently need new antibiotic targets and/or need to find ways to extend the clinical efficacy of our current antibiotic arsenal. To contribute toward this goal, we developed sCRilecs-seq (<underline>s</underline>ubsets of <underline>CR</underline>ISPR <underline>i</underline>nterference <underline>l</underline>ibraries <underline>e</underline>xtracted by fluorescence activated <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>s</underline>orting coupled to next generation <underline>seq</underline>uencing), a high-throughput single-cell based screening approach that we exploited to find targets that could resensitize resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains toward amoxicillin. sCRilecs-seq is based upon genome-wide gene silencing using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), which makes use of a catalytically dead form of the Cas9 enzyme, called dCas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). dCas9 is guided toward its target site in the DNA by the provided sgRNA(single guide RNA) but is unable to introduce double-stranded breaks. Instead, the dCas9 enzyme acts as a roadblock for RNA polymerase, thereby halting transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikard et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPRi gene silencing not only affects the target gene but also influences the expression of an entire transcriptional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cui, 2018</xref>). This technology therefore works at the operon level and generates strong polar effects that need to be considered. Despite this limitation, CRISPRi has proven to be a very powerful genetic tool to perform genome-wide depletion screens in various bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cui, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rousset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In the sCRilecs-seq screen used here, subpopulations that display a phenotype of interest are collected using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), as has previously been done in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2019</xref>) and for bacterial transposon libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). The abundance of sgRNAs in the sorted fractions is then compared to a defined control population to look for genetic factors involved in the phenotype of interest. This highly flexible screening approach allowed us to identify targets that can be exploited in our fight against bacterial infections.</p><p>Our sCRilecs-seq results highlight the importance of the mevalonate pathway for maintaining proper cell morphology in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. The mevalonate pathway is the only pathway used by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to produce isoprenoids, a highly diverse class of organic molecules that are essential to all life on earth and that function – among others – in processes such as cell wall synthesis, electron transport, membrane stability, and protein modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boronat and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heuston et al., 2012</xref>). Our screen revealed that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> leads to extensive cell elongation. The data suggest that this elongation is caused by a deficiency in peptidoglycan precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis, which is in turn due to a limitation in the production of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), the lipid carrier that is responsible for transporting these precursors across the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>). This shortage of peptidoglycan precursors allows cell elongation to continue but causes a block in cell division.</p><p>Additionally, based on the mevalonate depletion phenotype characterized here, we successfully designed a combination treatment strategy targeting <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. In this combination treatment strategy, amoxicillin is potentiated by the simultaneous administration of clomiphene, a widely used FDA-approved fertility drug that was shown to block Und-P production in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and to synergize with β-lactam antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farha et al., 2015</xref>). This combination of compounds is particularly powerful against amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains, as it is capable of resensitizing these strains to clinically relevant concentrations of amoxicillin in vitro. Our findings could therefore provide a useful starting point for the development of treatment strategies that are effective against the rising amount of amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections and could extend the clinical efficacy of this important antibiotic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amoxicillin treated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is elongated</title><p>To identify new druggable pathways that could potentiate the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin, we first established the impact of amoxicillin on pneumococcal morphology and growth. We therefore performed time-lapse microscopy of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the presence or absence of amoxicillin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, amoxicillin-treated cells initially elongate before they lyse. Indeed, quantitative image analysis confirmed that amoxicillin, like some other β-lactam antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsui et al., 2014</xref>), causes cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while growth curves in the presence of this antibiotic demonstrate that lysis occurs since optical density (OD) decreases at high amoxicillin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To demonstrate that cell elongation is specifically caused by amoxicillin and does not generally occur upon antibiotic treatment, we also assessed cell lengths in the presence of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin.

To test whether the mevalonate pathway is essential for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> viability and that the survival of the depletion strains at late time points is due to leaky expression and/or suppressor mutations, we attempted to delete the mevalonate operons without providing a complementation construct. As expected for essential genes, we were unable to delete these operons. However, when mevalonic acid – an intermediary in the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) – was added to the growth medium, we were able to delete operon 1, as was also shown previously in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balibar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reichert et al., 2018</xref>).

We next grew <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Δ<italic>operon 1</italic> (VL3702) with different concentrations of mevalonic acid. Cells grew normally and attained normal cell lengths when a high concentration of mevalonic acid was added to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). However, decreasing the concentration of mevalonic acid led to cell elongation and growth defects that became more pronounced at lower concentrations, thereby phenocopying genetic depletion of operon 1 and 2. In fact, when no mevalonic acid is provided at all, cultures are driven to full extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

In a first pulse, cells were labeled with the green FDAA, sBADA, for 15 min, and a second 15 min pulse consisted of the red FDAA, RADA (see Materials and methods). Fluorescence microscopy showed that peptidoglycan synthesis leads to both cell elongation and division in a wt strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Likewise, also the mevalonate depletion strains showed sites of active peptidoglycan synthesis, indicating that not all cell wall production is halted. However, in this case, almost no constricted FDAA-labeled sites were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Indeed, when defining septal peptidoglycan synthesis as FDAA bands that are less than 70% of the maximal cell width (i.e. sites of constriction, a criterion also used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wheeler et al., 2011</xref>), quantitative analysis of hundreds of peptidoglycan synthesis sites demonstrated that the amount of septal synthesis is drastically reduced when transcription of the mevalonate operons is repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, even though peptidoglycan synthesis continues upon mevalonate depletion, this process is slowed down since FDAA intensity is decreased under these conditions, indicating that less peptidoglycan is being produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Quantification of the intensity of the sBADA signal indeed confirmed that the incorporation of the label is strongly decreased upon mevalonate depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Since lysis usually occurs through weakening of the peptidoglycan cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yao et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesize that extended depletion of mevalonate operons eventually affects the integrity and/or rigidity of the peptidoglycan mesh, leading to cell lysis. However, considering the initial phenotypes found, we conclude that the primary effect of mevalonate depletion is a block in constriction necessary for cell division.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video4" xlink:href="elife-75607-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>An <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> mutant strain where the second mevalonate operon was depleted (VL3708) growing on agarose pads of C+Y medium without the inducer IPTG.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Depletion of mevalonate operons prevents cell division by decreasing the amount of peptidoglycan precursors available for cell wall synthesis</title><p>The mevalonate pathway provides the precursor for the production of all isoprenoids in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boronat and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilding et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, a shortage in the production of any of these isoprenoids could underlie the phenotypic effects of perturbed mevalonate production. However, given the nature of the observed phenotype, we thought it most likely that a shortage in the production of Und-P would be responsible for the observed effects. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that UppP, the gene product that dephosphorylates undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-PP) to create Und-P, is found as a hit that increases cell size in our sCRilecs-seq screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Und-P is a C55 isoprenoid that acts as the lipid carrier for transport of cell envelope precursors from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>). Und-P is produced by the dephosphorylation of Und-PP, which is in turn synthesized by UppS (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase) by the addition of eight isopentenyl units to the C15 isoprenoid farnesyl-PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boronat and Rodríguez-Concepción, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To test whether the observed effects of mevalonate depletion are indeed caused by a deficiency of Und-P, we constructed a <italic>uppS</italic> deletion/complementation strain (VL3584, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When this strain was grown in absence of <italic>uppS</italic> expression, cells were elongated and growth was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>), thereby phenocopying mevalonate mutants. In addition, UppS depleted cells contained multiple unconstricted Z-rings and initiated septa that failed to constrict further, even though peptidoglycan synthesis still occurred as demonstrated by TEM and fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>).

The observed phenotype of mevalonate and <italic>uppS</italic> mutants could therefore be caused by a shortage in either one or a combination of these components. To test which of these pathways contribute to the observed phenotypes upon mevalonate depletion, we tested each of them individually. First, we deleted the <italic>cps</italic> operon responsible for capsule synthesis in our D39V strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yother, 2011</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>, <italic>cps</italic> mutant cells were not elongated nor was growth rate affected, as also shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barendt et al., 2009</xref>), demonstrating that a shortage of capsule synthesis does not contribute to the mevalonate depletion phenotype. Next, we focused on the possible contribution of both teichoic acid and peptidoglycan synthesis by depleting the enzymes responsible for coupling the final cytoplasmic precursors to Und-P before transport to the outside of the cell. For peptidoglycan, it is known that the MurNAc-pentapeptide moiety that is produced in the cytoplasm is coupled to Und-P by MraY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>). Based on sequence similarity, bioinformatic analysis indicated that the enzyme that does the same for teichoic acid precursors in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is SPV_1620 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion/complementation strains for these genes were created, and the effect of depletion of either MraY or SPV_1620 was assessed (strain VL3585 and VL3586, respectively). Surprisingly, depletion of neither MraY nor SPV_1620 produced cell morphologies that resembled mevalonate operon depletions at the time we usually assess them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>, time point 4 hr). However, since at this time cells were severely malformed and many had already lysed, we decided to follow these depletions through time and record morphologies at earlier time points. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> shows the progression of these depletions in terms of average cell length, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> shows representative morphologies. From this analysis it became clear that, although depletion of both MraY and SPV_1620 led to increased cell length, the phenotype obtained upon SPV_1620 depletion differed profoundly from the phenotypes found when depleting mevalonate operons. Depletion of MraY, on the other hand, was highly similar to the mevalonate phenotype at early time points. We thus conclude that a deficiency in peptidoglycan precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis is mainly responsible for the elongated phenotype that is observed when components of the mevalonate pathway are depleted. Since we previously showed that this elongated phenotype is caused by continued peptidoglycan synthesis in the absence of cell constriction, it appears as though a certain threshold level of peptidoglycan precursors is needed for cells to divide. Cell elongation, on the other hand, can proceed with a lower amount of peptidoglycan precursors. Different explanations for such a threshold effect can be thought of and are elaborated on in our discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A sCRilecs-seq screen on mevalonate depleted cells to study the underlying genetic network</title><p>To identify pathways and genes that are particularly sensitive to reduced mevalonate levels and to obtain clues on why a lowered concentration of extracellular peptidoglycan precursors would allow elongation but not division, we performed a second sCRilecs-seq screen based on cell size (FSC) in a genetic background in which the first mevalonate operon was deleted (VL3834: D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9 lacI</italic> Δ<italic>mvaS-mvaA</italic>). This way, we could look for gene depletions that aggravate the observed phenotype, i.e., make cells even longer, and depletions that compensate for the mevalonate-dependent cell elongation. During construction of this CRISPRi library and prior to selection, cultures were grown in the presence of a high concentration of mevalonic acid (1 mM) which ensures wt growth and normal cell size even though the first mevalonate operon is deleted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). After construction of the pooled CRISPRi library, cultures were grown with limiting amounts of external mevalonic acid (100 µm) to trigger the elongated phenotype caused by mevalonate deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Simultaneously, dCas9 expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG for 3.5 hr. 10% of the population with the highest and lowest FSC values were sorted by FACS, and the centermost 70% of the population were collected to serve as a control. Comparing sgRNA read counts from the collected fractions led to the identification of many significantly enriched targets in the populations with the highest and lowest FSC values. We therefore limited our analysis to hits that are enriched or depleted by a factor 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>GO enrichment analysis identified cell division and closely related GO categories as significantly overrepresented in elongated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This suggests that depleting genes involved in cell division (such as significant hits <italic>ftsZ</italic>, <italic>divIB</italic>, <italic>divIC,</italic> and <italic>ftsW</italic>) will lead to additional cell elongation upon mevalonate depletion. However, there were only very few gene depletions that further increase the size of these mevalonate-deprived cells, indicating that cell length cannot be increased much more. Of note, depletion of both the second mevalonate operon and <italic>uppP</italic>, hits that were found to be highly enriched in the large-cell fraction in our original screen, no longer demonstrated differential FSC values here, indicating that they function in the same cell elongation mechanism as the deleted first mevalonate operon as expected. On the other hand, sgRNAs that are enriched in the small fraction of the population are often involved in protein expression (RNA biosynthesis, translation, tRNA aminoacylation, etc.) or energy metabolism (glycolysis, ATP synthesis coupled proton transport, etc.). Halting or interfering with protein expression or energy production therefore appears to reduce cell elongation caused by mevalonate deficiency. The results of these high-level analyses are clear; directly interfering with cell division reinforces the division block imposed by mevalonate depletion and inhibiting protein expression or energy production, both of which are necessary for growth in general, prevents cell elongation.</p><p>Additionally, when looking at individual genes and operons found among the significantly enriched or depleted hits, some interesting patterns emerge. For example, the sgRNA targeting <italic>divIVA</italic> was strongly depleted from the fraction of the population with the largest cell sizes and also highly enriched in the fraction with the smallest cells, indicating that the depletion of DivIVA hampers cell elongation upon mevalonate depletion. DivIVA activity was previously shown to be necessary for cell elongation, and DivIVA is known to be phosphorylated by the serine/threonine kinase StkP that is thought to constitute a molecular switch that governs elongation and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vollmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilharz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fleurie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nováková et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that a double depletion of the first mevalonate operon and DivIVA leads to reduced cell lengths in comparison to the depletion of mevalonate alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), indicating that also upon mevalonate depletion DivIVA activity assists cell elongation. However, cells depleted for both mevalonate and DivIVA are still larger than wt cells, indicating that a limited amount of elongation still occurs. Elongation enforced by mevalonate depletion is therefore not fully dependent on DivIVA activity. Additionally, CRISPRi depletion of the SEDS(shape, elongation, division and sporulation) proteins FtsW and RodA had opposite effects on cell size in our screen, with FtsW depletion leading to increased cell sizes while RodA depletion prevented cells from obtaining the largest cell sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These proteins are thought to be the primary transglycosylases responsible for peptidoglycan polymerization during cell division and cell elongation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perez et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, CRISPRi depletion of Pbp2b, the transpeptidase that works in conjunction with RodA to perform peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vollmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsui et al., 2016</xref>), showed up in the short-cell fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results indicate that RodA together with Pbp2b is at least partly responsible for cell elongation that occurs upon mevalonate depletion. Because Pbp2x, the transpeptidase that is essential for septal peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Massidda et al., 2013</xref>), is encoded in an operon together with <italic>mraY</italic>, its effect on mevalonate-dependent cell elongation could not be directly assessed in the sCRilecs-seq screen. Therefore, we constructed a clean <italic>pbp2x</italic> depletion strain.

Since amoxicillin also causes elongation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we set out to design a combination treatment strategy using amoxicillin and exploiting the mevalonate depletion phenotype characterized here. In a first step, we confirmed that the antibacterial effect of amoxicillin – but not that of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin – is increased upon mevalonate depletion, since amoxicillin could inhibit growth already at sub-MIC concentrations when mevalonate became limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).

Three compounds were selected; simvastatin and farnesol are expected to block the HMG-CoA reductase MvaA that catalyzes one of the first steps of the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Masadeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bergman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaneko et al., 2011</xref>), while clomiphene was shown to inhibit UppS in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and is counteracted by the addition of exogenous Und-P<sup>33</sup>. To confirm the specificity of these compounds for the mevalonate pathway or downstream production of Und-P, we first tested whether they could induce the expected cell elongation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Unfortunately, simvastatin and farnesol were not able to cause cell elongation. Farnesol, which was shown to be effective in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, most likely does not work in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.

However, the addition of clomiphene did result in filamentation under our conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We therefore selected this compound for further testing. Indeed, time-lapse analysis showed considerable cell elongation in the presence of clomiphene, albeit less than upon depletion of the mevalonate operons potentially due to the lag in severe and lethal effects upon gradual genetic depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Additionally, clomiphene most likely targets the production of Und-P, since sub-MIC concentrations of clomiphene led to severe growth defects in cultures that were slightly depleted for mevalonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Clomiphene, an inhibitor of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) production, potentiates amoxicillin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of several potential inhibitors of Und-P production on the cell length of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39V (VL333) was tested (Sim 4 µg/ml, Far 4 µg/ml, and Clom 8 µg/ml).

Treating mice with both clomiphene and amoxicillin did not show a stronger effect than treatment with amoxicillin alone, meaning that the potentiation of amoxicillin we observed in vitro could not be detected in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

We here screened for CRISPRi gene depletions that, like amoxicillin treatment, result in cell elongation. The rationale behind this strategy is that synergy is most often detected between compounds that target the same process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brochado et al., 2018</xref>). We show that hits identified by our sCRilecs-seq screen are reliable, accurate, and contain biologically relevant information. Interestingly, significant hits include a number of genes of unknown function that we can now implicate in the maintenance of proper cell size. Our sCRilecs-seq approach is thus able to uncover novel gene functions. On the other hand, several genes known to be involved in cell size regulation were not identified as significant hits, the most obvious example being the divisome-organizing cell division gene <italic>ftsZ</italic>. In the case of <italic>ftsZ</italic>, this false negative result might be caused by the core essential nature of this gene which would lead to low read counts for the corresponding sgRNA in the entire population. Since these low read counts are expected to strongly decrease statistical power, it is unsurprising that some essential genes are missed by our screen. However, such false negatives could be caused by a variety of other reasons as well. For example, simultaneous repression of all genes in an operon can obscure phenotypes expected upon repression of individual genes. Additionally, we observe a relatively high amount of variation between different repeats, which can also contribute to false negative results. Finally, depletion strains sensitive to mechanical vortexing could potentially be missed due to premature lysis, although no indications for such biased loss of strains were found. The latter issue could potentially be solved by working with an unencapsulated mutant strain that does not form cell chains which would eliminate the need for vortexing and is expected to exacerbate cell division phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barendt et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although we used the sCRilecs-seq method to screen for increases in cell size, this approach could be adapted to assess any phenotype of interest that can be measured by flow cytometry. In contrast to ‘classic’ CRISPRi-seq screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cui, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rousset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), our approach is therefore not limited to measuring changes in fitness but can be used to evaluate a wide array of different phenotypes, of which changes in cell size is just one possibility. In fact, we believe that the sCRilecs-seq method could be further improved when selecting for phenotypes other than cell size. We expect variation in experimental results to decrease when selecting for phenotypes that are better separated and display a smaller spread than FSC values do. Additionally, assessing phenotypes that are not associated with essential genes would eliminate the problem of decreased statistical power for corresponding sgRNAs (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Depletion of mevalonate pathway genes leads to cell elongation through inhibition of cell division</title><p>The sCRilecs-seq screen performed here revealed an important role for the mevalonate pathway in maintaining proper cell size. Indeed, depletion of the genes involved in this pathway led to a very large increase in cell length. Results obtained strongly indicate that this cell elongation is due to a deficiency in the production of Und-P, the lipid carrier that translocates all different cell envelope precursors across the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouhss et al., 2008</xref>), and subsequent limitation of the amount of peptidoglycan building blocks that is available for cell wall synthesis. This limiting amount of peptidoglycan precursors led to filamentation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Interestingly, chemically blocking Und-P production in the rod-shaped bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> led to a vastly different phenotype that more resembles a deficiency in wall teichoic acids than impairment in peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farha et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicate that the Und-P-dependent elongation phenotype is not universally conserved and might be specifically tied to the regulatory mechanisms responsible for morphogenesis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and possibly other related bacteria.</p><p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> filamentation caused by depletion of mevalonate pathway components is linked to changes in peptidoglycan metabolism. Whereas the peptidoglycan synthesis rate in general decreased, cell elongation continued long after constriction for cell division was inhibited. This observation points toward a difference in affinity and/or regulation of elongation and constriction, where it appears that a certain threshold concentration of peptidoglycan precursors needs to be exceeded for cell division to take place. Several potential explanations for this observation can be put forward. First, it is possible that peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes dedicated to cell division have a lower affinity for peptidoglycan precursors than their counterparts that function in cell elongation. When cell wall precursors become limiting, the enzymes involved in septal ring closure would be outcompeted and cell division would cease while elongation still occurs. Alternatively, it is possible that depletion of mevalonate pathway components and subsequent peptidoglycan precursor shortage induces transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory pathways that differentially affect the activity of protein complexes involved in cell elongation and division, thereby leading to filamentation. On the other hand, it has previously been suggested that a more complex switch-like regulatory mechanism decides whether cells elongate or divide. The serine/threonine kinase StkP and its cognate phosphatase PhpP was suggested to constitute a molecular switch that coordinates septal and peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vollmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilharz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fleurie et al., 2012</xref>). This switch is regulated by GpsB, which is necessary for maximal phosphorylation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rued et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Land et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of GpsB leads to an elongated phenotype with unconstricted cell division sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rued et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Land et al., 2013</xref>) that are highly reminiscent of the mevalonate depletion phenotype, hinting at possible crosstalk between both pathways. Results presented here indicate that, if such a switch exists, the decision between elongation and division would depend on the amount of peptidoglycan precursors that is exported. Since StkP contains PASTA domains that are known to bind peptidoglycan precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vollmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilharz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fleurie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zucchini et al., 2018</xref>), it has been suggested that its activity is indeed regulated in response to the concentration of peptidoglycan building blocks present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vollmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilharz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fleurie et al., 2012</xref>). However, it was previously shown that even though PASTA domains are necessary for StkP activation, peptidoglycan binding is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zucchini et al., 2018</xref>), arguing against StkP being a sensor for peptidoglycan precursor levels. Moreover, several of our observations do not fit into this switch-like regulatory model for peptidoglycan synthesis. First, the depletion of DivIVA, which is thought to be an integral part of the switch between elongation and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rued et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nováková et al., 2010</xref>), still allowed a modest amount of elongation to occur upon mevalonate depletion. Second, depletion of the division-specific transpeptidase Pbp2x limits the amount of elongation seen during mevalonate depletion. Additionally, the suggested switch-like behavior between peripheral and septal peptidoglycan synthesis has recently been put into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trouve et al., 2021</xref>). Detailed microscopic analysis of newly synthesized, fluorescently labeled peptidoglycan indicated that peripheral and septal peptidoglycan synthesis overlap throughout large parts of the cell cycle. It was shown that septal cell wall synthesis and splitting of the newly formed septal peptidoglycan occur throughout the early- and mid-cell cycle stages. The split septal peptidoglycan then becomes part of the lateral wall where peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis occurs and is inserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trouve et al., 2021</xref>). These results imply that a septum can only be formed when the septal peptidoglycan synthesis rate is higher than the splitting rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trouve et al., 2021</xref>). Our results can be interpreted in light of this model; FDAA labeling of active peptidoglycan synthesis showed that reduced precursor concentrations decrease the general peptidoglycan synthesis rate. This might render septal synthesis too slow in comparison to peptidoglycan splitting so that constriction is inhibited and no septum can be formed, even though septal cell wall synthesis is active. The slow rate of ongoing septal and peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis would then result in continued cell elongation. This interpretation of our results fit with observations regarding DivIVA and Pbp2x in the following way. In the absence of DivIVA, peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis is halted, but cell elongation upon mevalonate depletion can still occur due to the slowly ongoing septal cell wall synthesis which, combined with fast peptidoglycan splitting, results in elongation. Following the same logic, depletion of the septal cell wall synthesis enzyme Pbp2x now limits mevalonate-dependent elongation because the splitting of the septal wall no longer contributes to increased cell lengths. If true, slowing down septal peptidoglycan splitting should aid in constriction and should lower cell lengths in conditions where mevalonate is depleted. Indeed, downregulation of the proposed cell wall splitting enzyme PcsB reduces cell size upon mevalonate depletion according to our second sCRilecs-seq screen results. Further research will be necessary to conclusively determine how septal and peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis are regulated and balanced in ovococci such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and how the peptidoglycan precursor concentration influences this mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inhibition of Und-P synthesis by clomiphene resensitizes resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to amoxicillin</title><p>We successfully exploited the knowledge gained on the mevalonate depletion phenotype to fight amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains.

Also for MRSA and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, it has been shown that the antimicrobial activity of a variety of β-lactam antibiotics is increased in the presence of clomiphene. The sensitivity of MRSA is increased by a factor of approximately 8, while this increase in sensitivity was less pronounced for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farha et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, potentiation by clomiphene becomes much stronger in amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains such as 19F, Spain-23F, and 11A where the sensitivity toward amoxicillin is increased 16- to 64-fold. The potentiation by clomiphene is therefore proven to be more powerful in amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains than in amoxicillin-sensitive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> as well as MRSA and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, resistance toward β-lactam antibiotics is mostly caused by mosaic PBPs. These resistance-conferring mosaic PBPs are formed by recombination events following horizontal gene transfer from β-lactam resistant donor strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hakenbeck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gibson et al., 2021</xref>). It has been shown that many resistance-conferring PBP mutations are associated with considerable fitness costs that need to be compensated for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarracín Orio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zerfass et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Klugman, 2001</xref>) and that mosaic PBPs significantly alter the cell wall structure, potentially by a decrease in affinity for their natural substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garcia-Bustos and Tomasz, 1990</xref>). We therefore speculate that these mosaic PBPs display suboptimal activity which allows them to remain active during amoxicillin treatment but fail to carry out their task if the amount of peptidoglycan precursors available to them becomes limiting due to a deficiency in Und-P production. We believe that these suboptimal, resistance-conferring, mosaic PBPs are the reason why clomiphene has a much stronger potentiation effect in these strains than in all other tested strains and species.</p><p>Whereas this combination treatment strategy works remarkably well in vitro, in vivo results using a murine pneumonia disease model did not show benefits of combining amoxicillin treatment with clomiphene, likely because the in vivo concentration of active clomiphene was too low in the lungs. Nonetheless, we believe that clomiphene represents a promising starting point for the development of an optimized antibacterial compound that can be used in combination with amoxicillin and potentially other β-lactams. Clomiphene is an FDA-approved prodrug that is administered as a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers and is metabolized by the liver into active compounds that stimulate ovulation in anovulatory women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dickey and Holtkamp, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huppert, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasseri and Ledger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mürdter et al., 2012</xref>). However, since we observe antibacterial effects and amoxicillin potentiation in vitro, it seems likely that one or both of the prodrug isomers exert the desired effect. Determining which clomiphene stereoisomer has the highest antibacterial activity and designing non-metabolizable derivatives that are active at lower concentrations would be the first step to further optimize the here proposed combination treatment strategy for in vivo use. We hope that such an optimized antibacterial compound can be exploited for the eradication of amoxicillin-resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infections and could potentially also target other species and/or strains with a different resistance profile toward β-lactam antibiotics. We therefore believe that further investigation into this combination treatment strategy holds much promise in combating the ever-increasing amount of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

table. Unless specified otherwise, strains used throughout this work are derivatives of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Slager et al., 2018</xref>). In general, genomic changes were introduced by homologous recombination after transformation of a linear DNA molecule into <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This linear DNA was either obtained through a one-step PCR reaction starting from a different strain that already carried the desired transformation product (e.g. <italic>hlpA-gfp</italic> and <italic>ftsZ-mCherry</italic>) or through golden gate cloning in which three different PCR products were ligated. The first and last of these PCR products were homologous to the up- and downstream regions of the genome where a deletion or insertion had to be made. In case of insertion of expression cassettes into the <italic>zip</italic> locus, these fragments also contained a P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoter and a spectinomycin (or trimethoprim) resistance marker through amplification of fragments of the pPEPZ plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keller et al., 2019</xref>). In case of insertion of expression cassettes into the <italic>bgaA</italic> locus, these fragments also contained a P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic> promoter and a tetracycline resistance marker through amplification of fragments from strain VL2212 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). The third, middle fragment contained an antibiotic marker or a sequence to be inserted into the genome. Golden gate cloning sites were introduced into the PCR fragments as part of the primers. PCR fragments were digested with either BsaI, Esp3I, or SapI, followed by ligation and transformation. In case individual sgRNAs were cloned into <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the sgRNA sequences were first inserted into the pPEPZ-sgRNAclone plasmid in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). These integrative plasmids were then transformed into <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Transformation was performed with cells that were made competent by addition of the competence stimulating peptide (CSP-1) using a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Synefiaridou and Veening, 2021</xref>). Primers that were used for cloning are listed in the key resources table. <italic>hlpA-gfp</italic> was amplified from VL2226 with primers OVL47&amp;48. <italic>ftsZ-mCherry</italic> was amplified from VL1630 with primers OVL898&amp;901. Both PCR products were transformed to VL1998 to create VL3117. Complementation constructs for mevalonate operon 1 (<italic>mvaS-mvaA</italic>) and operon 2 (<italic>mvk-mvaD-mvaK2-fni</italic>) were made by amplification of the corresponding operons using primer pairs OVL3962&amp;63 and OVL3958&amp;59, respectively. Up- and downstream regions for insertion into the <italic>zip</italic> locus were amplified using primer pairs OVL3493&amp;2,181 and OVL2182&amp;3,496.

The complementation construct for SPV_1620 was created by amplification of the gene using OVL3671&amp;72, and up- and downstream <italic>zip</italic> regions were produced using OVL3493&amp;3,650 and 3649&amp;3,496. Deletion of the corresponding native genes was performed by replacing them with a promoter-less kanamycin resistance cassette that was expressed using the native promoter of the deleted genes. The kanamycin cassette was amplified from the pPEPY plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keller et al., 2019</xref>) with primers OVL3981&amp;82. The up- and downstream regions of the genes to be deleted were amplified using OVL4069&amp;70 and OVL4071&amp;72 for mevalonate operon 1 (<italic>mvaS-mvaA</italic>), OVL4585&amp;86 and OVL4587&amp;88 for <italic>uppS</italic>, OVL4597&amp;98 and OVL4599&amp;4,600 for <italic>mraY,</italic> and OVL3677&amp;4,601 and OVL4602&amp;3,680 for <italic>SPV_1620</italic>. Due to low expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprianto et al., 2018</xref>), mevalonate operon 2 (<italic>mvk-mvaD-mvaK2-fni</italic>) was replaced with a Km cassette that carried its own constitutive promoter. This fragment was amplified with OVL3983&amp;82 from pPEPY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keller et al., 2019</xref>), and up- and downstream regions for this operon were amplified with primer pairs OVL4061&amp;62 and OVL4063&amp;64. A complementation construct for <italic>divIVA</italic> was made by amplification of this gene using primers OVL5707&amp;08. Up- and downstream regions for insertion into the <italic>bgaA</italic> locus were amplified using primer pairs OVL2077&amp;OVL5705 and OVL5706&amp;1,369. Deletion of <italic>divIVA</italic> was performed by replacement with a promoter-less chloramphenicol resistance cassette that was expressed using the <italic>divIVA</italic> promoter. The chloramphenicol cassette was amplified from VL3117 to primers OVL5727&amp;28. The up- and downstream regions of <italic>divIVA</italic> were amplified using OV5729&amp;30 and OVL5731&amp;32, respectively. A complementation construct for <italic>pbp2x</italic> was made by amplification of this gene using primers OVL6276&amp;77. Up- and downstream regions for insertion into the <italic>bgaA</italic> locus were amplified using primer pairs OVL2077&amp;OVL5717 and OVL5718&amp;1,369. Deletion of <italic>pbp2x</italic> was performed by replacement with a promoter-less erythromycin resistance cassette that was expressed using the <italic>pbp2x</italic> promoter. The cassette was amplified from pJWV502 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) to primers OVL2933&amp;34. The up- and downstream regions of <italic>pbp2x</italic> were amplified using OV6214&amp;15 and OVL6216&amp;17, respectively.</p><p>Strains were grown in liquid C+Y medium (pH = 6.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Domenech et al., 2018</xref>) at 37°C without shaking under normal atmospheric conditions.

When necessary, P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoters were induced with various amounts of IPTG; 1 mM IPTG for induction of dCas9 for the sCRilecs-seq screens, 20 µM IPTG for complementation of mevalonate operon 1 (<italic>mvaS</italic>, <italic>mvaZ</italic>), 100 µM for complementation of <italic>uppS,</italic> and 1 mM IPTG for complementation of mevalonate operon 2 (<italic>mvk</italic>, <italic>mvaD</italic>, <italic>mvaK2</italic>, and <italic>fni</italic>), <italic>mraY,</italic> or <italic>SPV_1620</italic>. When necessary, P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic> promoters were induced with 500 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline (aTc). Where appropriate, mevalonic acid was added to cultures at the concentration indicated in the text (ranging from 100 µM to 1 mM). When strains lacking the first mevalonate operon had to be grown under non-limiting conditions, 1 mM mevalonic acid was used. The concentrations of antibiotics and other compounds that were used to assess their antibacterial activity are indicated in the main text and/or figures and/or figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mechanical disruption of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cell chains</title><p>Cultures were diluted 3× in PBS to a final volume of 1 ml in screw cap tubes. Tubes were placed into a FastPrep-24 5 G Instrument (MP Biomedicals) with QuickPrep-3 adapter and shaken with a speed of 6.0 m/s for 30 s. This protocol was validated using VL3117 that was grown for 3.5 hr in C+Y medium. Samples were either subjected to mechanical chain disruption using the FastPrep-24 5 G or not, after which both samples were analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Construction of the CRISPRi libraries</title><p>CRISPRi libraries were constructed by transformation of the desired strains with a pool of 1499 different pPEPZ integrative plasmids carrying constitutively expressed sgRNA sequences that together target the entire genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). sgRNAs are under control of the constitutive P3 promoter, while the <italic>dcas9</italic> gene is inserted chromosomally under control of the inducible P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoter. The 1499 sgRNAs were designed to each target a specific operon. All sgRNA sequences together with their targets and potential off-targets were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). For the initial screen, D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9 hlpA-gfp ftsZ-mCherry</italic> (VL3117) was transformed. Our second sCRilecs-seq screen was performed after transformation of D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9</italic> Δ<italic>mvaS</italic> Δ<italic>mvaA</italic> (VL3834) in the presence of 1 mM mevalonic acid. For both libraries, at least 10<sup>5</sup> individual transformants were obtained and collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>sCRilecs-seq screen</title><p>The transformed D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9 hlpA-gfp ftsZ-mCherry</italic> (VL3117) library was grown for 3.5 hr in C+Y medium supplemented with 1 mM IPTG. The D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9</italic> Δ<italic>mvaS</italic> Δ<italic>mvaA</italic> (VL3834) library was grown for 3.5 hr in C+Y medium supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 100 µM mevalonic acid. Cell chains were mechanically disrupted (see ‘Mechanical disruption of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cell chains’) and further diluted into PBS 3–10× based on culture density.</p><p>Cells were sorted using a FACSAria IIIu Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with violet, blue, and red lasers and a 70 µm nozzle. In case of the D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9 hlpA-gfp ftsZ-mCherry</italic> (VL3117) library, cells were gated based on FSC, SSC, and GFP fluorescence. For the D39V P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-dcas9</italic> Δ<italic>mvaS</italic> Δ<italic>mvaA</italic> (VL3834) library, cells were gated based on FSC and SSC only. For both libraries, cells with the 10% highest and lowest FSC values were collected, as well as 70% of the population located around the median FSC value. Flow rates and dilutions were adjusted to keep the efficiency of sorting as high as possible (and certainly above 85%) while not exceeding a sorting time of 60 min per sample. For every fraction, 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were collected, and six different biological repeats were performed.</p><p>Cells were collected into 2 ml tubes, centrifuged at 18,000 g for 5 min, and pellets were stored at –20°C. Cells were lysed by dissolving pellets in 10 µl H<sub>2</sub>O+0.025% DOC+0.05% SDS and incubating 20 min at 37°C, followed by 5 min incubation at 80°C. After samples were allowed to cool off, a colony PCR was performed using primers that contain index and adapter sequences necessary for Illumina sequencing. 10 µl of the lysed cell mixture was added to the PCR reaction as input DNA and 30 PCR cycles were performed. The amplicons were purified from a 2% agarose gel and Illumina sequenced on a MiniSeq according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed with a custom sequencing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Data analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Bakker et al., 2022</xref>). The sgRNA sequences were recovered from the resulting reads, mapped onto the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39V sgRNA library, and counted using 2FAST2Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bravo et al., 2021</xref>), and the DESeq2 R package was used to define enrichments and associated p values for every sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, DESeq2 takes raw count data as input and fits a binomial generalized linear model (GLM) to them. It normalizes by size factors, which account for both library size and library composition bias. Next, it tests for differential enrichment of each sgRNA between given conditions by testing the hypothesis that the log<sub>2</sub>FC (the fitted sgRNA-wise GLM coefficients) significantly differs from a user-specified threshold. Here, we tested for any differential enrichment (absolute log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;0) at a significance level of 0.05 (alpha = 0.05). Generated sgRNA-wise p values were adjusted for testing multiple comparisons with the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). We added the sample information to the design formula of DESeq2 to account for differences between samples (paired data, as the Min, Middle, and Max fractions were taken from the same samples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For the initial sCRilecs-seq screen, we defined significant hits as sgRNAs from the fraction with the highest FSC values with an adjusted p value&lt;0.1 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;1 compared to counts from the corresponding control population. For the second sCRilecs-seq screen performed with a Δ<italic>mvaS-mvaA</italic> mutant limits was set at an adjusted p value&lt;0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry experiments were performed using NovoCyte 2,100YB (ACEA Biosciences) flow cytometer equipped with violet, blue, and red lasers. To validate sCRilecs-seq hits, strains were grown for 3.5 hr in C+Y medium with or without 1 mM IPTG. Cultures were diluted in PBS, and cell chains were disrupted as described above. Next, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature to mimic the average waiting time in the 60 min sorting step before FSC was measured. Cell gatings were chosen based on FSC, SSC, and GFP values, as was done during sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>GO enrichment analyses</title><p>GO enrichment analyses were performed using the online GO Resource platform that is coupled to the PANTHER classification system analysis tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Consortium, 2019</xref>). Validated significant sgRNA hits were translated into the spr identifiers that correspond to the targeted genes, which were used as the input gene set that was compared to the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> reference list provided by the platform. A PANTHER overrepresentation analysis was performed to identify biological processes that are overrepresented as defined by a Fisher’s exact test using FDR-corrected p values.

Cultures were diluted 100× into C+Y medium supplemented or not with IPTG, aTc, or mevalonic acid and with or without the addition of antibacterial compounds, as indicated in the text. 300 µl of cell suspension was transferred into 96-well plates. When growth in the presence of BAL fluid was tested, cultures were diluted 100× into C+Y medium supplemented with ¼ BAL fluid. 200 µl of cell suspension was transferred into 96-well plates. In both cases, addition of compounds such as amoxicillin or clomiphene occurred at this stage by diluting stock concentrations into the wells of the 96-well plates (dilutions were chosen to always keep the DMSO(Dimethylsulfoxide) concentrations in the wells ≤1%). Growth was monitored by measuring OD<sub>595 nm</sub> every 10 min using a TECAN Infinite F200 Pro. OD<sub>595nm</sub> values were normalized so that the lowest value measured during the first hour of growth was 0.001, the initial OD<sub>595nm</sub> value of the inoculum. In case the area under the curve needed to be calculated, values were log-transformed before this parameter was determined using GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MIC measurements</title><p>MIC values were determined by constructing growth curves in C+Y medium (see above).

Cultures were then diluted 100× into C+Y medium without IPTG and grown until the OD<sub>595 nm</sub> of the wt strain reached 0.1. At this point, 250 µM sBADA was added, and cultures were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS (centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 min at 4°C), and pellets were dissolved in C+Y medium containing 250 µM RADA.

Pellets were dissolved in PBS and kept on ice prior to imaging.</p><p>Cells were imaged by placing 0.4 µl of cell suspension on pads made of PBS containing 1% agarose. Imaging was performed using a Leica DMi8 microscope with a sCMOS DFC9000 (Leica) camera and a SOLA light engine (Lumencor). Phase contrast images were acquired using transmission light with 100 ms exposure time. Leica DMi8 filter sets were used as follows: mCherry (Chroma 49017, Ex: 560/40 nm, BS: LP 590 nm, and Em: LP 590 nm) with exposure time 700 ms, sBADA (Ex: 470/40 nm Chroma ET470/40×, BS: LP 498 Leica 11536022, and Em: 520/40 nm Chroma ET520/40 m) with exposure time 200 ms, and RADA (Chroma 49017, Ex: 560/40 nm, BS: LP 590 nm, and Em: LP 590 nm) with exposure time 100 ms. Images were processed using ImageJ, and deconvolution was performed using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging) with standard settings using 15 iterations for FtsZ-mCherry and sBADA and 25 iterations for RADA.

For every repeat, at least 100 cells were recorded unless mentioned otherwise, and their average cell length was determined.

Seven days later, mice were inoculated intranasally with 10<sup>5</sup> CFU of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strain 19F in 30 μl of PBS.

This amoxicillin concentration was chosen because it is expected to lead to in vivo amoxicillin concentrations above the MIC of the resistant 19F strain and because we need to see an antimicrobial effect of the antibiotic alone on the bacterial load to then be able to see any synergistic effect with another compound. Mice were sacrificed 24 hr post-infection by intraperitoneal injection of 5.47 mg of sodium pentobarbital in 100 μl PBS (Euthasol, Virbac, France). BAL fluids were sampled after intratracheal injection of 1 ml of PBS and centrifugation at 1400 rpm for 10 min. Lungs and spleen were sampled to determine the bacterial load. Tissues were homogenized with an UltraTurrax homogenizer (IKA-Werke, Staufen, Germany), and serial dilutions were plated on blood agar plates and incubated at 37°C. Viable counts were determined 24 hr later. Statistical significance between groups was calculated by the Kruskall-Wallis test (one-way ANOVA). Analyses were performed with Prism software (version 9, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments complied with national, institutional and European regulations and ethical guidelines, were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use guidelines (D59-350009, Institut Pasteur de Lille; Protocol APAFIS#16966 201805311410769_v3) and were conducted by qualified, accredited personnel.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>TableS1: sCRilecs-seq results.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-75607-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>TableS2: GO enrichment of sCRilecs-seq hits.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-75607-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Table S3: sCRilecs-seq results for mevalonate mutant.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-75607-supp3-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Table S4: GO enrichment of sCRilecs-seq hits of mevalonate mutant.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-75607-supp4-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-75607-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data is available at SRA under accession number PRJNA763896.

xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.13.460059v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Amoxicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae can be resensitized by targeting the mevalonate pathway as indicated by sCRilecs-seq&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Malcolm Winkler as the Reviewing editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carol Gross (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three experts in the field reviewed your manuscript from slightly different perspectives. All three reviewers are generally positive about your interesting, well-presented paper and think that it leads to several advances in the field. However, the reviewers also think changes can be made that would considerably strengthen the current version and its impact. Most of these changes can be made from the existing data set and expanded discussion of methods, phenotypes, and context as described below, without additional experiments. Several relatively simple additional experiments are suggested that would contribute to some interpretations.</p><p>The three reviews offer many specific and constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript. Some of these suggestions are described in the public reviews, and others are listed in the reviews for the authors. We request a revision that addresses each major point raised in the reviews. We also request that you consider performing some of the additional suggested experiments.</p><p>Briefly, the revisions concern four topics. First, Reviewers #1 and #2 noted that the method seems incomplete and not optimized. In particular, Reviewer #2 provides several suggestions for ways to re-analyze the data to improve hit detection and reproducibility. Second, the reviewers would like more discussion of how other hits, besides the mevalonic acid pathway, may impact pneumococcal cell length. This discussion could include any new hits turned up by changes to the data analysis. Third, the reviewers request points of clarification about the mevalonic acid depletion pathway and its effects on cell shape (e.g., width by Reviewers #1 and #3) and peptidoglycan synthesis, including larger fields of cells from the microscopic analyses. These modifications may include any addition hits turned up by re-analysis of the SCRilecs-seq data during mevalonate limitation. Last, more context and comparison are requested for the potentiation studies of clomiphene on amoxicillin killing of amoxicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains, in view of the previous studies in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.</p><p>Finally, a couple of relatively simple additional experiments are suggested to answer several questions about conclusions (e.g., live-dead staining of mevalonate depleted cells in culture compared to time-lapse; dependence of lysis on LytA hydrolase; addition of exogenous undecaprenol; perhaps (not so simply) determination of relative Lipid-II amounts; etc.). Adding some of these additional experiments would strengthen certain conclusions and should be considered for the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments for the authors.</p><p>1. Line 26, 88, 334, 377, and throughout. The phrasing of &quot;insufficient transport of cell wall precursors&quot; is a bit confusing. In this case, there is reduced availability of precursors that limits PG synthesis, but the transport process (i.e., flipping) is normal. It gets confusing, because &quot;insufficient transport&quot; seems to imply that something is wrong with transport per se, rather than reduced amount of precursor. Please consider revising.</p><p>2. More might be mentioned in the Discussion on how to optimize the screen more. Given the context and goals of this paper, this does not need to done here, but it would be nice to see some ideas about optimization.</p><p>3. Line 228. I think that a 1.4X increase in width is more than slight, when its overall effect on cell volume is considered. Please consider re-phrasing.</p><p>4. Line 243. Please see above. What is the evidence for many survivors? Was live/dead staining and/or microscopy done to check for lysis. Why is there so much greater lysis on pads than in liquid culture? In line 245, are suppressors even possible for this essential pathway in S. pneumoniae? I suggest you tie together more the different observations mentioned in this paragraph.</p><p>5. Line 265. Please mention in liquid culture here, since the lower panel is on pads.</p><p>6. Line 314. Was the lysis dependent on the LytA hydrolase, whose activity is induced by antibiotics and PG stress? This would be interesting to know.</p><p>7. Line 375. I am not sure that the phenotype is that profoundly different at 3 and 3.5 h. Please consider how this would affect your conclusion?</p><p>8. Line 382. Please mention that possible mechanisms for this apparent threshold effect are taken up in the Discussion. The idea of a simple catalytic model for the two modes of PG synthesis is just one of several models discussed.</p><p>9. Line 383. Please cite 41-43 here instead of just 43. References 41 and 42 show a remarkably similar elongation without constriction phenotype for gpsB deletion mutants, which is accounted for by a switching model.</p><p>10. Line 446 and elsewhere. The short-hand here is a bit misleading: &quot;large fraction&quot; and &quot;small fraction&quot; mean something other than &quot;large-cell fraction&quot; and &quot;small-cell fraction.&quot; Please consider changing elsewhere as well.</p><p>11. Line 546. Since the 19F strain is resistance to amoxicillin (Table 1) in vitro, why does the bacterial load go down two orders of magnitude for amoxicillin in the model in Fig. 6I? Please clarify</p><p>12. Line 575. Is the statement about no false positives entirely correct? The number of candidates reported here is relatively small (at 17), and there were many false negatives as discussed in the text.</p><p>13. Line 636. Please consider changing &quot;a D39V lab strain&quot; to &quot;an amoxicillin-sensitive, virulent serotype 2 strain&quot;. Unlike true lab strains, D39 has retained strong virulence in infection models and D39 strains that were stored separately decades ago have very similar genome sequences.</p><p>14. Line 641. Based on activity and structural modeling of the WT and mutant PBPs are there references that would support this speculation? If so, please cite them.</p><p>15. Line 18. Please consider revising &quot;cluster nicely together&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To improve the impact of this paper, I suggest that the authors concentrate their efforts in three major directions. First, they must improve their sCRilecs-seq method and/or analysis to improve hit detection and reproducibility. Second, the authors should discuss other genes/pathways that contribute to changes in cell size. Finally, the authors should discuss the findings around clomiphene in the context of the previous work on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and MRSA. What aspects are similar? What aspects are different? What does this tell us about Streprococcus biology?</p><p>The authors' data exhibits extreme variability that may be due to issues with how the analysis and/or FACS was performed. This variability must be addressed for this method to be of general utility.</p><p>1. High variability covers up what seem to be legitimate hits. For example, sorting Table S1 by L2FC reveals many hits that are not significant at p = 0.1 (a very generous threshold) but very likely represent real hits - glmS, murB, ddl, ftsAZ, divIC, etc. Clearly the statistical treatment is incorrect if you are not detecting any false positive hits at p&lt; 0.1, a threshold at which you would naively expect ~10% false positive hits.</p><p>a. I'm surprised that the distribution of L2FC is centered around zero. It suggests that a WT cell has an equal chance of ending up in the middle 70% bin or in the top 10% bin, and this makes no sense. How does the WT FCS distribution compare with the library FCS distribution?</p><p>b. Consider alternate metrics beside L2FC.</p><p>c. Consider outlier detection and removal.</p><p>d. I'm not sure how you normalized counts (sum of reads?), but consider other methods of normalizing counts.</p><p>2. Replicate 1 seems to be particularly problematic in the initial screen. What happened?</p><p>3. For validation, the authors should confirm the morphology of select strains under the microscope in addition to evaluation by flow cytometry. Consider sampling not only the most significant hits, but also less significant hits to validate statistical threshold.</p><p>4. Data is not presented in a usable form. The supplementary tables include &quot;baseMean&quot;, which I assume (I shouldn't have to assume...) is the average read count in the middle 70%, and average L2FC, which is a measure of enrichment. There is no information on the individual replicates, which precludes any reanalysis of the data or interrogation of reproducibility. These issues are exacerbated by the fact that the SRA ascension includes only fastq files. Why not included a matrix of sgRNA counts for each sample as in the Cell Host and Microbe paper (Liu et al., 2021)?</p><p>5. The analysis is, in my opinion, insufficiently well described. For example, how was the data normalized between high/middle/low? Was it by the sum of total reads? Is this a reasonable assumption?</p><p>6. The methods constantly reference data sorted based on fluorescence, but I don't see any of this data in the manuscript or elsewhere.</p><p>a. L781 &quot;highest or lowest FSC/GFP/mCherry&quot;</p><p>b. L763 &quot;gated based on FSC, SSC and GFP fluorescence&quot;</p><p>A discussion of other hits in the authors' screen would dramatically improve this manuscript, especially if the issues with false negatives can be resolved. This has the potential to be a major part of the manuscript, as cell size determination has not been comprehensively explored in Streptococcus.</p><p>1. The authors have previously determined the growth of this library in vitro and in vivo. Is there an evidence of any relationship between growth rate and cell size?</p><p>2. Induction of the stringent response causes cells to become very small. Do the authors see evidence of stringent response regulators/effectors in their data?</p><p>3. Do the authors see evidence of moonlighting metabolic enzymes/pathways that may determine cell size?</p><p>4. In most bacteria the SOS system caused filamentation. As far as I know Streptococcus lacks a canonical SOS response and uses the competence regulon for this purpose. Is there filamentation when the competence system is disturbed?</p><p>5. Are there any genes of unknown and/or hypothetical function with size phenotypes? Can these phenotypes be used to help determine function?</p><p>6. The mechanical stress of breaking up chains can reveal &quot;fragile&quot; strains (they disappear from the population faster than expected from previous experiments). Were there any fragile strains identified in your assay? Were fragile strains associated with a particular size/morphology?</p><p>A major finding is that clomiphene potentiates amoxicillin in Streptococcus. The novelty of this finding is of questionable given that clomiphene was shown to potentiate aminopenicillins (ampicillin) in both MRSA and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Farha et al., 2015, PNAS) and to have effects on cell size.</p><p>1. The authors should expansively discuss (Farha et al., 2015, PNAS) and place their results in the context of this work. Are the interactions they discover consistent with this manuscript, or are there Streptococcus-specific differences?</p><p>2. In vitro data showed that only high concentration of clomiphene (8 μg/ml) can</p><p>sensitize S. pneumoniae to amoxicillin. Is it because of the low efficacy of clom?</p><p>3. The authors did a second screen to study the genetic interaction between the</p><p>mevalonate pathway and other division and cell wall related genes, and identified targets like DivIV and Pbp2x in Figure 5J. But it is still unclear what the &quot;underlying genetic network&quot; is. If the authors would like to claim a buffering or synergistic genetic</p><p>interaction, they should quantify and compare between the fitness/phenotype of the</p><p>individual and double mutants.</p><p>4. It is still not clear why disruption of the mevalonate pathway affects cell division more than cell elongation. The authors document that PG synthesis is reduced, and suggest that division is more sensitive than elongation to this reduction. This is potentially an important contribution of the ms. Are there additional experiments that could buttress it? Do any of the &quot;small&quot; colonies in the 2nd screen shed light on the nature of this requirement?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75607.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments for the authors.</p><p>1.

More might be mentioned in the Discussion on how to optimize the screen more. Given the context and goals of this paper, this does not need to done here, but it would be nice to see some ideas about optimization.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewer 2, we have invested time and effort into improving our data analysis pipeline which we believe was highly successful and already resulted in a large increase in significant hits (from 17 to 70 hits). Additionally, we have added some suggestions for further optimization in our discussion section at lines 677 and 692. Briefly, besides using an unencapsulated mutant as suggested by the reviewer, we believe better screening results could be obtained by choosing phenotypes to assess wisely. In contrast to FSC values that display a large spread and do not show an on-off response, other phenotypes that are better separated and display less spread should decrease the experimental variation which would lead to more accurate hit calling. Additionally, phenotypes that are not connected to essential genes would be better suited to study through sCRilecs-seq since they are unaffected by the low read counts (and corresponding weak statistical power) associated with essential genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 228. I think that a 1.4X increase in width is more than slight, when its overall effect on cell volume is considered.

Indeed, an increase by a factor 1.4x cannot be considered small. However, we had originally chosen this phrasing because the change in cell length is larger still. We believe that the adjustments to the text now make it clear that both changes are considerable, but that cell length is disproportionately affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Why is there so much greater lysis on pads than in liquid culture? In line 245, are suppressors even possible for this essential pathway in S. pneumoniae? I suggest you tie together more the different observations mentioned in this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>When growing depletion strains of operon 1 or operon 2 (native operon deleted and replaced by an IPTG-inducible copy elsewhere in the genome) in the absence of the inducer we indeed see a decrease in OD that levels out, like shown in Figure 3E. However, when following growth for a period of more than 10 hours, we see a rapid increase in OD after this time window (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2A, see below). A successive round of growth of the resulting culture in the absence of IPTG no longer shows the expected drop in OD (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2C-F, see below), indicating that suppressor mutations arose that cause the culture to no longer be dependent upon IPTG for growth.</p><p>When performing time lapse microscopy with these depletion strains, we have never observed suppressor mutants that were able to grow and thrive in the absence of IPTG. However, time lapse microscopy interrogated the behavior of only a small number of cells, while the inoculum size for the OD measurements is estimated to be around 10<sup>4</sup> cells, meaning that it is much more likely to encounter suppressor mutants there.</p><p>When a deletion strain of operon 1 (native operon deleted, no inducible copy elsewhere in the genome) is grown in the absence of mevalonic acid, cultures are driven to full extinction as is shown in Figure 3I. Here, the expected decrease in OD is not followed by a phase of growth, also not when the incubation period is extended (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2B, see below).</p><p>Because suppressor mutations are readily obtained in the depletion strains (with inducible complementation construct) but not in the deletion strain (absence of the operon in question), we believe that suppressors allow for constitutive expression of the inducible P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoter (e.g. mutations in <italic>lacI</italic> or P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic>). Indeed, sequencing of a couple of suppressors of depletion of mevalonate operon 1, operon 2 or <italic>uppS</italic> indeed revealed mutations in <italic>lacI</italic> or the <italic>lac</italic> operator of the P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoter (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2G, see below).</p><p>Given these experimental results, we are convinced that the plateau in OD that occurs in the depletion strains of operon 1 and 2 is due to the presence and growth of suppressor mutants that are unaffected by the absence of IPTG. Since these suppressors cannot arise in the deletion strain, no plateau is found here and instead lysis occurs until full extinction. Because of these results, we strongly suspect that when performing a Live/Dead staining on the depletion versus deletion strains, the former will consist of a mix of dying cells and healthy suppressors, while the latter will only contain dying cells. In other words, we expect that the same differences between the depletion and deletion strain that are seen in OD curves will be perpetuated in a Live/Dead staining due to the presence and absence of healthy suppressor, respectively. This is why we do not believe that performing a Live/Dead staining will be an added value in this particular setting.</p><p>The results containing suppressor mutations have been added to our revised manuscript as supplemental information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Line 314. Was the lysis dependent on the LytA hydrolase, whose activity is induced by antibiotics and PG stress? This would be interesting to know.</p></disp-quote><p>We have investigated this question and now show that lysis is partially, but not completely dependent on LytA.

Line 375. I am not sure that the phenotype is that profoundly different at 3 and 3.5 h. Please consider how this would affect your conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>Of course we respect the reviewer’s point of view, however, we do believe that these two phenotypes (depletion of <italic>mraY</italic>, related to PG synthesis, versus depletion of SPV_1620, related to TA synthesis) differ fundamentally, with the latter leading to more variation in morphology than is seen when <italic>mraY</italic> is depleted. We hope that the reviewer is more convinced of this difference when seeing the larger fields of view shown below.

Right now, we interpret the phenotypic data to mean that cell elongation caused by depletion of the mevalonate pathway is caused by a decrease in the availability of peptidoglycan precursors only. This also implies that peptidoglycan precursor levels are critical in regulating cell elongation versus cell division. If, however, also depletion of SPV_1620 would be interpreted to lead to the same elongation phenotype, we would conclude that decreases in both peptidoglycan precursors and teichoic acid building blocks would lead to cell elongation and a specific block in cell division, thereby implying that also teichoic acid precursors serve a regulatory role. However, as said, we are not convinced that this is the case and would therefore prefer to keep our manuscript unaltered on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 382.

First, they must improve their sCRilecs-seq method and/or analysis to improve hit detection and reproducibility. Second, the authors should discuss other genes/pathways that contribute to changes in cell size. Finally, the authors should discuss the findings around clomiphene in the context of the previous work on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and MRSA. What aspects are similar? What aspects are different? What does this tell us about Streprococcus biology?</p><p>The authors' data exhibits extreme variability that may be due to issues with how the analysis and/or FACS was performed. This variability must be addressed for this method to be of general utility.</p><p>1. High variability covers up what seem to be legitimate hits. For example, sorting Table S1 by L2FC reveals many hits that are not significant at p = 0.1 (a very generous threshold) but very likely represent real hits - glmS, murB, ddl, ftsAZ, divIC, etc. Clearly the statistical treatment is incorrect if you are not detecting any false positive hits at p&lt; 0.1, a threshold at which you would naively expect ~10% false positive hits.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the high variability in our screen likely covers up a lot of legitimate hits. We have therefore optimized our analysis according to the reviewer’s suggestions as also detailed in the responses below.</p><p>However, we do believe that a considerable portion of the detected variability stems from the biological data itself and is not merely caused by factors that are within our control such as data acquisition and analysis. We have chosen to sort cells based on cell size, which is not a fixed property and varies already by a factor 2 for wild-type cells during their natural cell cycle. Moreover, for a sgRNA to be detected as leading to an increase in cell size, it should not only cause lots of cells to have sizes that are within the top 10% FSC bin, but it should simultaneously deplete the number of cells that end up in the control population (middle 70% bin). Genes that upon depletion lead to a large variation in cell size might therefore automatically be missed.</p><p>Additionally, cell size is not directly measured and instead is evaluated by a cell’s forward scatter (FSC), which is a rough and imperfect measure for cell size. As is also clear from our answer to comment 1a below, the FSC distribution of the CRISPRi library remains largely unchanged by induction of the CRISPRi system, indicating that the induced CRISPRi library does not have a considerable larger spread of FSC values than a normal wild-type population would have. This relatively small impact of genome-wide gene depletions on FSC values in the populations surely complicates accurate sorting of the desired phenotype and subsequent hit calling.</p><p>Another difficulty in extracting all relevant genes involved in cell size regulation is that many of them are core essential genes. CRISPRi strains that repress such essential genes are depleted in any condition. So, in those cases specifically, we are contrasting low counts with low counts. As long as the strain count is not actually zero, we can still compute the fold change, but because of the low sequencing depth for such strains, the certainty with which we can estimate that fold change decreases, resulting in higher p-values. Hence, it is troublesome to reliably detect all genes involved in cell size regulation because many of them are essential for growth and are very quickly depleted from the entire population.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have optimized our data analysis pipeline to improve the results presented in our manuscript. To do so, we have re-extracted the sgRNA counts from the fastq files with 2FAST2Q, a new method recently developed in our lab (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.17.473121v1). This method is now also part of our standard CRISPRi-seq methods pipeline, which has recently been published (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00639-6). This resulted in slightly higher coverage, while preserving only high-quality reads (PHRED score &gt; 30). Because higher coverage means more statistical power, we expected to increase the probability of detecting real hits. Indeed, redoing the enrichment analysis with these newly acquired counts boosted the number of hits, including likely biologically meaningful ones as the reviewer suggested.</p><p>Additionally, we usually only consider sgRNAs to be hits when the log2FC exceeds a certain threshold. However, we realized that with only 3.5 hours of induction and quite large natural variability in cell size, we are also interested in relatively mild enrichment effects. Therefore, we have lowered the log2FC threshold to test against any increase/decrease in CRISPRi strain abundance (instead of a minimum of 2-fold enrichment/depletion), which allows us to detect more subtle effects. Simultaneously, we have lowered alpha to more conventional certainty (alpha = 0.05), meaning that hits are significant if the adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Taken together, these adjustments to our analysis yielded a total of 70 significant hits for which gene repression leads to an increase in cell size. These hits include all 17 sgRNAs previously identified. Moreover, <italic>glmS</italic>, <italic>ddl</italic>, <italic>divIC</italic> which were suggested to be important by the reviewer are now also detected as hits, as are many other. The other suggestions, <italic>murB</italic> and <italic>ftsAZ</italic>, are not detected because counts are extremely low for these operons (see remark on low sgRNA counts above).</p><p>The results generated by our new and improved analysis are included in our revised manuscript in both the results and discussion session at several locations in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. I'm surprised that the distribution of L2FC is centered around zero. It suggests that a WT cell has an equal chance of ending up in the middle 70% bin or in the top 10% bin, and this makes no sense. How does the WT FCS distribution compare with the library FCS distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>The vast majority of sgRNAs indeed have a log2FC of zero, meaning that they are found in the same proportions in the middle 70% and the top 10% bin. This might be surprising when operating under the assumption that the top 10% bin would only contain mutant cells with very drastic increases in cell size/FSC that are unimaginable for a wild-type cell to obtain.</p><p>However, this is not the case. Wild-type cells can very easily be found in the top 10% bin as is also clear from panel A shown in the figure below. In this panel, the FSC distribution for the CRISPRi library with (green) or without (yellow) induction of the CRISPRi system is shown. Since these two curves are almost indistinguishable, it is safe to say that even without external disturbances to morphology-related genes, cells can obtain phenotypes that render FSC values found in the top 10% bin.</p><p>We believe that this can – at least in part – be explained by the fact that FSC is only a very rough measure of cell size. Indeed, when looking at changes in FSC before and after separation of cell chains (Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1C), FSC is only modestly affected while the changes in the length of chains are considerable (Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1A-B).</p><p>We therefore conclude that the imperfect link between cell size and FSC, combined with the naturally occurring variation in cell size/FSC for wild-type cells can explain why the log2FoldChange for many sgRNAs is zero.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Consider alternate metrics beside L2FC.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to quantify differences in strain abundance between two conditions. The log2FC captures this quantity exactly, while also neatly making the distribution symmetric around zero, and is therefore our preferred metric. In addition, this kind of quantification, and corresponding hypothesis testing techniques, have been improved to near perfection by dedicated research groups. One of those analysis packages is DESeq2, which is one of the most commonly used packages worldwide. It takes into account the nature of the data (discrete counts) by implementing a GLM based on a negative binomial distribution and has robust internal normalization methods. For these reasons, it is the standard downstream analysis method in our recently published CRISPRi-seq protocol which we would prefer to implement here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Consider outlier detection and removal.</p></disp-quote><p>Outlier detection and removal is automatically performed by DESeq2 based on the Cook’s distance metric (measuring change in GLM coefficient estimates upon removal of each sample). In the new analysis, with 2FAST2Q-generated sgRNA counts, no such outliers were detected. As stated before, this does not mean all sgRNAs with high variability are considered outliers and they are thus not necessarily excluded from downstream analysis. Instead, their p-values simply inflate, since with higher variability among replicates, we can be less certain of any measured difference of fold change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. I'm not sure how you normalized counts (sum of reads?), but consider other methods of normalizing counts.</p></disp-quote><p>The DESeq2 normalization method is based on size factors. These are normalization factors that account for both library size bias and library composition bias, while division by the sum of reads only accounts for the former. The latter refers to the issues that arise when some sgRNAs use up either a lot or very few reads in a sample or in all samples belonging to one growth condition. This then leaves either very few or a lot of reads to be mapped to the other sgRNAs, thus yielding a bias in the whole library composition on top of the differences in just plain library size. This has been a well-documented source of bias, and most standard (RNAseq) analysis packages account for it (e.g. DESeq2, limma, edgeR). Hence, DESeq2’s size factors do not only correct for the number of reads per sample, but also for the variability in sgRNA counts over all samples, using the geometric mean. This makes the method more robust and better at detecting true differences, since the sgRNAs become more fairly comparable over conditions. For details, we refer to the original DESeq2 research paper and documentation (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html). For these reasons, we prefer to keep using the built-in DESeq2 normalization method.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, another normalization approach was used for the PCA. There, we use DESeq2’s regularized logarithm (rlog) normalization, which is recommended and part of the standard DESeq2 pipeline. It is akin to a log2 transformation, but decouples the variance from the mean; a well-known but generally undesired statistical property yielding large spread for lower counts on a logarithmic scale, largely caused by random noise instead of biological processes. The transformation is based on a shrinking approach presented in the DESeq2 research paper, which proportionally shrinks lower counts, thereby stabilizing the variance, i.e. rendering the data homoscedastic. This is ideal for input into downstream analyses, such as PCA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Replicate 1 seems to be particularly problematic in the initial screen. What happened?</p></disp-quote><p>We are unaware of any differences between the different repeats.

We can therefore not give any reasonable explanation for why certain repeats behaved differently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For validation, the authors should confirm the morphology of select strains under the microscope in addition to evaluation by flow cytometry. Consider sampling not only the most significant hits, but also less significant hits to validate statistical threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we validated hits using microscopy. Because of our improved analysis and increased number of hits, we only tested sgRNAs that were found to be among the most strongly enriched significant hits. Results are shown below and are included in our manuscript in Figure 2.

Data is not presented in a usable form. The supplementary tables include &quot;baseMean&quot;, which I assume (I shouldn't have to assume...) is the average read count in the middle 70%, and average L2FC, which is a measure of enrichment. There is no information on the individual replicates, which precludes any reanalysis of the data or interrogation of reproducibility. These issues are exacerbated by the fact that the SRA ascension includes only fastq files. Why not included a matrix of sgRNA counts for each sample as in the Cell Host and Microbe paper (Liu et al., 2021)?</p></disp-quote><p>The baseMean is the average of the normalized counts taken over all samples and is part of the standard DESeq2 output. We acknowledge that this was not clear in our original manuscript. Since it is not relevant to the interpretation of the results, we left it out in the updated differential enrichment analysis output table. In addition, we added the raw read counts per sample (2FAST2Q output) in this table and thank the reviewer for the useful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The analysis is, in my opinion, insufficiently well described. For example, how was the data normalized between high/middle/low? Was it by the sum of total reads? Is this a reasonable assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>We originally did not include an explanation of the analysis pipeline since this is part of the DESeq2 R package that is explained in the corresponding research paper. However, we appreciate that a rough overview of the different steps in the DESeq2 analysis is important for the understanding of our work. We have therefore included a brief explanation on the inner workings of DESeq2, including the normalization method, in our Materials &amp; Methods section, starting at line 940: “Briefly, DESeq2 takes raw count data as input and fits a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) to them. It normalizes by size factors, which account for both library size and library composition bias. Next, it tests for differential enrichment of each sgRNA between given conditions by testing the hypothesis that the log2 fold-change (the fitted sgRNA-wise GLM coefficients) significantly differs from a user-specified threshold. Here, we tested for any differential enrichment (absolute log2FC &gt; 0) at a significance level of 0.05 (alpha = 0.05). Thus generated sgRNA-wise p-values were adjusted for testing multiple comparisons with the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). We added the sample information to the design formula of DESeq2 to account for differences between samples (paired data, as the Min, Middle and Max fractions were taken from the same samples).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Cell gates were set based on FSC, SSC and GFP with the latter stemming from the HlpA-GFP fusion.

The authors have previously determined the growth of this library in vitro and in vivo. Is there an evidence of any relationship between growth rate and cell size?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, strains and conditions for this screen deviate from previous in vitro screens that we performed (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.10.001). First, in our previous CRISPRi-seq screens (where the CRISPRi-seq library was grown in the presence or absence of the inducer of <italic>dcas9</italic> expression and then sequenced to determine the relative sgRNA abundances), the library was grown for approximately 9 hours before sequencing. However, this long growth step results in the (almost) complete depletion of many sgRNAs that target essential genes. As said before, these extremely low counts would lower statistical power in our current experimental set-up which is why we decided to drastically shorten the incubation period to 3.5 hours. Additionally, the strain used here for library construction encodes the HlpA-GFP and FtsZ-mCherry fusion proteins which are absent from our previously constructed library. Whereas neither HlpA-GFP nor FtsZ-mCherry cause any growth defects, it is possible that they do show synergies and/or antagonisms when combined with CRISPRi-imposed gene depletions. Because of these reasons, comparing the CRISPRi screening results regarding growth rate and cell size might be tricky and we would prefer to do this as part of future work when the exact same libraries and growth conditions are used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

A future first step will therefore be to study how depletion or deletion of these genes affect growth, division and cell envelope integrity. We have now mentioned these exciting new leads in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The mechanical stress of breaking up chains can reveal &quot;fragile&quot; strains (they disappear from the population faster than expected from previous experiments). Were there any fragile strains identified in your assay? Were fragile strains associated with a particular size/morphology?</p></disp-quote><p>Since we cannot directly compare our screening results to previously obtained data where no rigorous vortexing was performed, we cannot give a comprehensive answer to this question. However, when performing validation of selected hits by microscopy, cells were vortexed before visualizing them. This did not lead to clear traces of lysis, meaning that vortexing is unlikely to have strong effects on the outcome of the screening. Images of the microscopy validation have been deposited on the EMBL-EBI BioImages Archive: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BIAD477.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major finding is that clomiphene potentiates amoxicillin in Streptococcus. The novelty of this finding is of questionable given that clomiphene was shown to potentiate aminopenicillins (ampicillin) in both MRSA and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Farha et al., 2015, PNAS) and to have effects on cell size.</p><p>1. The authors should expansively discuss (Farha et al., 2015, PNAS) and place their results in the context of this work. Are the interactions they discover consistent with this manuscript, or are there Streptococcus-specific differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe we have successfully addressed this comments by discussing and comparing both the antimicrobial and potentiation effects of clomiphene (paragraph starting at line 778) and the effect of clomiphene on <italic>B. subtilis</italic> morphology (starting at line 705).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In vitro data showed that only high concentration of clomiphene (8 μg/ml) can</p><p>sensitize S. pneumoniae to amoxicillin. Is it because of the low efficacy of clom?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, a clomiphene concentration of 8 µg/ml is most potent at boosting the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin in vitro. However, we do see some effect also at lower clomiphene concentrations. At a concentration of 4 µg/ml, for example, the sensitivity to amoxicillin of all tested strains has increased by a factor 2. For clinical isolates that are resistant to amoxicillin some very minor effects can even be seen at the lowest tested clomiphene concentration of 0.5 µg/ml.</p><p>However, to obtain an effect that might be of clinical importance we indeed need a concentration of 8 µg/ml which is quite high. We therefore hope to improve the compound in the future to increase its efficacy and lower the concentration needed to potentiate amoxicillin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors did a second screen to study the genetic interaction between the</p><p>mevalonate pathway and other division and cell wall related genes, and identified targets like DivIV and Pbp2x in Figure 5J. But it is still unclear what the &quot;underlying genetic network&quot; is. If the authors would like to claim a buffering or synergistic genetic</p><p>interaction, they should quantify and compare between the fitness/phenotype of the</p><p>individual and double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have studied and presented the effect of a select few double mutants in our manuscript. We have also investigated a couple more. However, having these double depletions of essential genes makes experiments very tricky and, for most double depletions, we were unable to identify combinations of inducer concentrations that led to wild-type behavior. This absence of proper control conditions prevented us from conducting reliable experiments which is why we decided to not include many double depletion mutants in our manuscript. However, we do believe that in our revised manuscript we have answered the question on the mechanism underlying the mevalonate elongation phenotype better than we previously did. More specifically, we interpreted our results – including from our second screen – in light of the new model for peptidoglycan synthesis in ovococci recently published by the Morlot group (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221005765). We believe this represents a significant improvement to our first manuscript version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is still not clear why disruption of the mevalonate pathway affects cell division more than cell elongation. The authors document that PG synthesis is reduced, and suggest that division is more sensitive than elongation to this reduction. This is potentially an important contribution of the ms. Are there additional experiments that could buttress it? Do any of the &quot;small&quot; colonies in the 2nd screen shed light on the nature of this requirement?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very important point for follow-up studies. We believe these should be focused on determining whether or not the rate of peptidoglycan splitting influences the mevalonate elongation phenotype. Our work presents the first support for this hypothesis since we have identified the proposed peptidoglycan splitting enzyme PcsB as a hit in our screen. Our results indicate that depletion of <italic>pcsB</italic>, and likely corresponding slowing of septal cell wall splitting, prevents excessive cell elongation upon mevalonate depletion. This is also highlighted in our manuscript. Further work is needed to dive into these observations and investigate these observations in more detail.</p></body></sub-article></article>
