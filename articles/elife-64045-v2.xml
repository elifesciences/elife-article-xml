and nutrient cycling. Diverse DMSP lyases in some algae, bacteria, and fungi cleave DMSP to yield gaseous dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an infochemical with important roles in atmospheric chemistry. Here, we identified a novel ATP-dependent DMSP lyase, DddX. DddX belongs to the acyl-CoA synthetase superfamily and is distinct from the eight other known DMSP lyases. DddX catalyses the conversion of DMSP to DMS via a two-step reaction: the ligation of DMSP with CoA to form the intermediate DMSP-CoA, which is then cleaved to DMS and acryloyl-CoA. The novel catalytic mechanism was elucidated by structural and biochemical analyses. DddX is found in several Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes, suggesting that this new DMSP lyase may play an overlooked role in DMSP/DMS cycles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The global sulfur cycle is a collection of geological and biological processes that circulate sulfur-containing compounds through the oceans, rocks and atmosphere. Sulfur itself is essential for life and important for plant growth, hence its widespread use in fertilizers.</p><p>Marine organisms such as bacteria, algae and phytoplankton produce one particular sulfur compound, called dimethylsulfoniopropionate, or DMSP, in massive amounts. DMSP made in the oceans gets readily converted into a gas called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is the largest natural source of sulfur entering the atmosphere. In the air, DMS is converted to sulfate and other by-products that can act as cloud condensation nuclei, which, as the name suggests, are involved in cloud formation. In this way, DMS can influence weather and climate, so it is often referred to as ‘climate-active’ gas.</p><p>At least eight enzymes are known to cleave DMSP into DMS gas with a few by-products. These enzymes are found in algae, bacteria and fungi, and are referred to as lyases, for the way they breakdown their target compounds (DMSP, in this case). Recently, researchers have identified some bacteria that produce DMS from DMSP without using known DMSP lyases. This suggests there are other, unidentified enzymes that act on DMSP in nature, and likely contribute to global sulfur cycling.</p><p>Li, Wang et al. set out to uncover new enzymes responsible for converting the DMSP that marine bacteria produce into gaseous DMS. One new enzyme called DddX was identified and found to belong to a superfamily of enzymes quite separate to other known DMSP lyases. Li, Wang et al. also showed how DddX drives the conversion of DMSP to DMS in a two-step reaction, and that the enzyme is found across several classes of bacteria. Further experiments to characterise the protein structure of DddX also revealed the molecular mechanism for its catalytic action.</p><p>This study offers important insights into how marine bacteria generate the climatically important gas DMS from DMSP, leading to a better understanding of the global sulfur cycle. It gives microbial ecologists a more comprehensive perspective of these environmental processes, and provides biochemists with data on a family of enzymes not previously known to act on sulfur-containing compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dmsp cleavage pathway</kwd><kwd>dms generation</kwd><kwd>ATP-dependent DMSP lyase</kwd><kwd>global sulfur

DMSP can function as an antioxidant, osmoprotectant, predator deterrent, cryoprotectant, protectant against hydrostatic pressure, chemoattractant and may enhance the production of quorum-sensing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sunda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cosquer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karsten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). DMSP also has important roles in global sulfur and nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiene et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charlson et al., 1987</xref>). Environmental DMSP can be taken up and catabolised as a carbon and/or sulfur source by diverse microbes, particularly bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curson et al., 2011b</xref>). DMSP catabolism can release volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or methanethiol (MeSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reisch et al., 2011a</xref>). DMS is a potent foraging cue for diverse organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nevitt, 2011</xref>) and the primary biological source of sulfur transferred from oceans to the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreae, 1990</xref>), which may participate in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei, and influence the global climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vallina and Simó, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria can metabolize DMSP via three known pathways, the demethylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howard et al., 2006</xref>), the recently reported oxidation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thume et al., 2018</xref>), and the lysis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curson et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The nomenclature of these pathways is based on the reaction type of the enzyme catalyzing the first step of DMSP catabolism. In the demethylation pathway, DMSP demethylase DmdA first demethylates DMSP to produce methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reisch et al., 2008</xref>), which can be further catabolized to MeSH and acetaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reisch et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). In the oxidation pathway, DMSP is oxidized to dimethylsulfoxonium propionate (DMSOP), which is further metabolized to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and acrylate; however, enzymes involved in this pathway are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thume et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways for DMSP degradation.</title><p>Different pathways are shown in different colors. The demethylation of DMSP by DmdA produces MMPA (in purple). The oxidation of DMSP produces DMSOP (in yellow). In the lysis pathway (in blue), DMSP lyase DddP, DddL, DddQ, DddW, DddK, DddY, or Alma1 converts DMSP to acrylate and DMS, DddD converts DMSP to 3-HP-CoA and DMS, using acetyl-CoA as a CoA donor, and the newly identified DddX in this study converts DMSP to acryloyl-CoA and DMS, with ATP and CoA as co-substrates.

There is large biodiversity in DMSP lysis, with eight different known DMSP lyases that encompass four distinct protein families (DddD a CoA-transferase; DddP a metallopeptidase; cupin containing DddL, DddQ, DddW, DddK, and DddY; and Alma1 an aspartate racemase) functioning in diverse marine bacteria, algae, and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curson et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). With the exception of DddD, which catalyzes an acetyl-CoA-dependent CoA transfer reaction, all other DMSP lyases directly cleave DMSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcolombri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>).

Currently, there is no known pathway whereby DMSP is ligated with free CoA, and it is tempting to speculate that there may be such a novel DMSP metabolic pathway. In this study, we screened DMSP-catabolizing bacteria from Antarctic samples, and obtained a strain <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 that grew on DMSP and produced DMS. Genetic and biochemical work showed that <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 possesses a novel DMSP lyase termed DddX for DMSP catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). DddX is an ATP-dependent DMSP lyase which catalyzes a two-step reaction: the ligation of DMSP and CoA, and the cleavage of DMSP-CoA to produce DMS and acryloyl-CoA. We further solved the crystal structure of DddX and elucidated the molecular mechanism for its catalysis based on structural and biochemical analyses. DddX is found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

To perform this two-step reaction, there are two alternative pathways: (i), DMSP is first cleaved to form DMS and acrylate, and subsequently CoA is ligated with acrylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this case, the intermediate acrylate is produced. (ii), CoA is primarily ligated with DMSP to form DMSP-CoA. Then, DMSP-CoA is cleaved, producing DMS and acryloyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In this scenario, the intermediate DMSP-CoA is produced. To determine the catalytic process of DddX, we monitored the occurrence of acrylate and/or DMSP-CoA in the reaction system via LC-MS. While acrylate was not detectable in the reaction system, a small peak of DMSP-CoA emerged after a 2 min reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that DMSP-CoA is primarily formed in the catalytic reaction of DddX, which is then cleaved to generate DMS and acryloyl-CoA.</p><p>Knowing the DddX enzyme activity, we examined its in vitro properties. The DddX enzyme had an optimal temperature and pH of 40°C and 8.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> <bold><italic>and B</italic></bold>).

Because ACS enzymes were reported to have promiscuous activity toward different short chain fatty acids, such as acetate and propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel and Walt, 1987</xref>), we tested the substrate specificity of DddX. The recombinant DddX exhibited no activity towards acetate or propionate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), and the presence of acetate or propionate had little effects on the enzymatic activity of DddX toward DMSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating that DddX cannot utilize acetate or propionate as a substrate. Furthermore, we tested the ability of the strain D2 to grow with acetate or propionate as the sole carbon source. The wild-type strain D2 could use acetate or propionate as sole carbon source but deletion of <italic>dddX</italic> has little effect on the growth of strain D2 on these substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that <italic>dddX</italic> is unlikely to be involved in acetate and propionate catabolism.

The catalytic processes of enzymes in the ACD superfamily involve a conformational change of a ‘swinging loop’ or ‘phosphohistidine segment’, in which a conserved histidine is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiße et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Verschueren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Sequence alignment indicated that His292 of DddX is likely the conserved histidine residue to be phosphorylated, and Gly280-Tyr300 is likely the ‘swinging loop’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the crystal structure of DddX, His292 from loop Gly280-Tyr300 directly forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting a potential for phosphorylation, which is further supported by mutational analysis. Mutation of His292 to alanine abolished the activity of DddX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating the key role of His292 during catalysis. Circular-dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis showed that the secondary structure of His292Ala exhibits little deviation from that of wild-type (WT) DddX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that the enzymatic activity loss was caused by amino acid replacement rather than by structural change. Altogether, these data suggest that His292 is phosphorylated in the catalysis of DddX on DMSP.</p><p>Having solved the crystal structure of the DddX-ATP complex, we next sought to determine the crystal structures of DddX in complex with CoA and DMSP. However, the diffractions of these crystals were poor and all attempts to solve the structures failed. Thus, we docked DMSP and CoA into the structure of DddX. In the docked structure, the CoA molecule is bound in the CoA-binding domain, while the DMSP molecule is bound in the interface between two DddX monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Because our biochemical results demonstrated that DMSP-CoA is an intermediate of DddX catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we further docked DMSP-CoA into DddX. DMSP-CoA also locates between two DddX monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>), and two aromatic residues (Trp391 and Phe435) form cation-π interactions with the sulfonium group of DMSP-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Mutations of these two residues significantly decreased the enzymatic activities of DddX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that these residues play important roles in DddX catalysis. To cleave DMSP-CoA into DMS and acryloyl-CoA, a catalytic base is necessary to deprotonate DMSP-CoA. Structure analysis showed that Tyr181, Asp208, and Glu432 are close to the DMSP moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and may function as the general base. Mutational analysis showed that the mutation of Glu432 to alanine abolished the enzymatic activity of DddX, while mutants Tyr181Ala and Asp208Ala still maintained ~40% activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that Glu432 is the most probable catalytic residue for the final cleavage of DMSP-CoA. CD spectra of these mutants were indistinguishable from that of WT DddX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that the decrease in the enzymatic activities of the mutants were caused by residue replacement rather than structural alteration of the enzyme.</p><p>Based on structural and mutational analyses of DddX, and the reported molecular mechanisms of the ACD superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiße et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Verschueren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), we proposed the molecular mechanism of DddX catalysis on DMSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Firstly, His292 is phosphorylated by ATP, forming phosphohistidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which will be brought to the CoA-binding domain through the conformational change of the swinging loop Gly280-Tyr300. Next, the phosphoryl group is most likely transferred to DMSP to generate DMSP-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which is subsequently attacked by CoA to form DMSP-CoA intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The last step is the cleavage of DMSP-CoA probably initiated by the base-catalyzed deprotonation of Glu432 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, acryloyl-CoA and DMS are generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and released from the catalytic pocket of DddX.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A proposed mechanism for DMSP cleavage to generate DMS and acryloyl-CoA catalyzed by DddX.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The residue His292 attacks the γ-phosphate of ATP.

Despite this similarity, DddX is fundamentally different to DddD. Firstly, the co-substrates of DddX and DddD are different. ATP and CoA are essential co-substrates for the enzymatic activity of DddX, while for DddD catalysis, acetyl-CoA is used as a CoA donor, and ATP is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcolombri et al., 2014</xref>). When CoA was replaced by acetyl-CoA in the reaction system, DddX failed to catalyze the cleavage of DMSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Secondly, the products of DddD and DddX are different. DddD converts DMSP to DMS and 3-HP-CoA, whereas DddX produces DMS and acryloyl-CoA from DMSP.

Why some bacteria have evolved multiple DMSP utilization pathways and some bacteria only possess one pathway awaits further investigation.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that DddX is a functional DMSP lyase present in several isolates of Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and, notably, Gram-positive Firmicutes, for example in <italic>Sporosarcina</italic> sp. P33. The distribution of DddX in these bacterial lineages points to the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the dissemination of <italic>dddX</italic> in environmental bacteria and this certainly warrants further investigation. Interestingly, DddX is found in several bacterial isolates which were isolated from soil or plant roots, suggesting that DMSP may also be produced in these ecosystems. Finally, it has been reported that many other Gram-positive actinobacteria can make DMS from DMSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, these Actinobacteria lack <italic>dddX</italic> and any other known DMSP lyase genes. Thus, there is still more biodviversity in microbial DMSP lyases to be uncovered.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>DMSP is widespread in nature and cleavage of DMSP produces DMS, an important mediator in the global sulfur cycle. In this study, we report the identification of a novel ATP-dependent DMSP lyase DddX from marine bacteria. DddX belongs to the ACD superfamily, and catalyzes the conversion of DMSP to DMS and acryloyl-CoA, with CoA and ATP as co-substrates. DddX homologs are found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial lineages. This study offers new insights into how diverse bacteria cleave DMSP to generate the climatically important gas DMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp.)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study;Zhang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type isolate; Available from Zhang lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp.)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Δ<italic>dddX</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study;Zhang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">the <italic>dddX</italic> gene deletion mutant of <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp.

The minimised structure had an RMSD 0.82 Å relative to the starting structure and a decrease in starting energy from 134999.58 kcal/mol to a final energy of 6888.60 kcal/mol. The DMSP, CoA and DMSP-CoA molecules were drawn in MarvinSketch (v19.10.0, 2019, ChemAxon for Mac) and exported as a Mol SDF format. The molecules were imported into Flare and docked into the proposed CoA/DMSP binding site using the software’s default docking parameters for intensive pose searching and scoring.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-14"><title>Identification of DddX homologs in bacteria and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>DddX (1697) of <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 was used as the query sequence to search for homologs in genome-sequenced bacteria in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>) using BLastP with a stringent setting with an e-value cut-off &lt; –75, sequence coverage &gt;70% and percentage identity &gt;30%. These high stringency settings are necessary to exclude other acetyl-CoA synthetase family proteins (ACS) which are unlikely to be involved in DMSP catabolism. Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using MEGA 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>) and the presence of histidine 292, tryptophan 391 and glutamate 432 was manually inspected. To confirm the activity of DddX homologs from retrieved sequences from these genome-sequenced bacteria, four sequences (<italic>Sporosarcina</italic> sp. P33; <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. P11G5; <italic>Marinobacterium jannaschii; Pelagicola</italic> sp. LXJ1103) were chemically synthesized and their enzyme activity for DMSP degradation was confirmed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method with 500 bootstraps using MEGA 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). The characterized ACS ACD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiße et al., 2016</xref>) was used as the outgroup.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>investigation, validation, writing-original-draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>investigation, writing-original-draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>supervision, validation, writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>investigation, writing-original-draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>investigation, writing-original-draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>investigation, writing-original-draft, writing-review-and-editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>conceptualization, funding-acquisition, supervision</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables listing sampling information, homology alignment results, kinetic parameters, crystallographic data, bacterial strains, plasmids, medium composition, and primers used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Information of the Antarctic samples used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Geog Pohnert as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

It initially focuses on a Gammaproteobacterium, Psychrobacter sp.D2, which the authors establish lacks a known DMSP lyase enzyme despite having DMSP lyase activity (this needs to be quantified). Through RNA-seq and bioinformatics, they identify the gene cluster responsible for this activity and identify a novel DMSP lyase somewhat related to DddD in that it involves CoA, but critically also ATP, which distinguishes it from the pack of other known Ddd enzymes. This enzyme is a ATP-dependent DMSP CoA synthase required for growth on DMSP and its transcription is upregulated by DMSP availability. The novel mechanism of this enzyme is proposed from a strong structural component to the study. The authors propose the downstream pathway for DMSP catabolism, which we find to be oversold and requiring gene mutagenesis to confirm, and to be preliminary in comparison with the authors' other findings. Finally, the study attempts to show how widespread the enzyme is in sequenced bacteria, confidently showing it to be functional in other related Gammaproteobacteria and some Firmicutes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Title: “a missing route&quot; was it really missing? We would suggest a more precise title. Would be better to say &quot;that releases DMS&quot; or an alternative.</p><p>2. This is a Ddd enzyme by definition and should be named as such.</p><p>Line 27- We disagree with the use of a new gene prefix when there is a strong precedent for the use of Ddd for &quot;DMSP-dependent DMS&quot;. If this enzyme is a DMSP lyase and is in bacteria then its naming should follow protocol and be called Ddd&quot;X&quot;-X-being a letter not currently utilised in known systems. Deviating from this convention causes confusion and is not appropriate. Furthermore, AcoD is already assigned in some bacteria to acetaldehyde dehydrogenase II.</p><p>3. As presented, the bioinformatics-based evidence regarding the broad distribution of this enzyme (as claimed e.g. in the Abstract, line 33) does not stand up.</p><p>Currently as presented in the manuscript, especially Figure 6, we are led to believe the enzyme is more widespread than can be demonstrated based on the authors' evidence (i.e., the authors allow a very low threshold of sequence identity and claim function outside of the groups they have tested). Either more work is needed to show that claims of such a wide distribution are merited, or the authors should limit their claims to what can be substantiated by their work. Specifically, the authors cannot comment on the &quot;functional&quot; enzyme being widespread outside of the Gamma's and Firmicutes that were tested, let alone the importance of the role in DMSP cycling. Only three &quot;AcoD&quot; enzymes were ratified in this study, which are relatively closely related to each (Psychrobacter sp. D2 Sporosarcina sp. P33 and Psychrobacter sp. P11G5 that are &gt; 77% identical to each other). As can be seen in Figure 6, these three proteins cluster together and are far removed from all the other sequences on the figure, for which we have no evidence of their function (i.e., nothing can realistically be said on Deltas, Actinos or Alphas or the MAGS). Just to be clear, these other proteins shown in clades above and below the functional &quot;AcoDs&quot; in Figure 6 are only ~30% identical to ratified &quot;AcoD&quot;.</p><p>Furthermore, only strain D2 was shown to make DMS; none of the other strains were tested. Far more testing of the diverse enzymes and strains are needed to make these statements as this study only tests one strain and three of the closely related enzymes (defined on Figure 6).</p><p>Additional specific comments on this issue:</p><p>Line 280. The sentence on MAGS and the environments containing them does not stand up for reasons summarised above. All MAGS shown on Figure 6 are not similar enough to &quot;AcoD&quot; to be termed as functional Ddd enzymes. More work has to be done on the strains and enzymes that are more divergent to true &quot;AcoDs&quot; before such a statement is supported. Please delete.</p><p>Line 509-We agree with what the authors write about stringency. However, these parameters do not seem to have been utilised as stated here. Their stringency statement holds up for comparison between the D2 &quot;AcoD&quot; and two other tested &quot;AcoD&quot; enzymes and all those in the middle clade on Figure 6. But this is not the case for the proteins shown above and below this &quot;AcoD&quot; clade in Figure 6 which have at best around 30% identity to characterised enzymes. See below for examples. As the authors state in their methods, high-stringency methods are needed to exclude other acetyl-CoA synthetase family proteins. Thus, most of the genes shown on fig6 cannot be taken as having this Ddd activity.</p><p>&quot;To further validate that these AcoD homologs&quot; the authors examined the activity of two closely related enzymes from a group of nine homologs with &gt; 65 % sequence identity (starting line 283, Figure 6). It is not surprising that these enzymes have the same activity. Homologs outside this group of nine (Figure 6) are far less related to the characterized AcoD (&lt; 32 % seq. identity). Conservation of the phosphate-transferring His (His292) and an active site Trp (Trp391) does not seem to be strong evidence for functional conservation. The manuscript does not provide any additional evidence that these less related enzymes also degrade DMSP. Either more experimentation is necessary, or the paragraph on the &quot;Distribution of the ATP DMSP lysis pathway in bacteria&quot; must be revised. For example:</p><p>Psychrobacter AcoD (WP_068035783.1) is 31% identical to Bilophila sp. 4_1_30 (WP_009381183.1) in the below group of bacteria on Figure 6.</p><p>Psychrobacter AcoD (WP_068035783.1) is 29% identical to Thermomicrobium roseum (WP_041435830.1) in the above group of bacteria on Figure 6.</p><p>Line 283. This is not the case! The two sequences that were chosen to &quot;validate&quot; are far to close to the D2 &quot;AcoD&quot; than to MAGS and other potential &quot;AcoDs&quot; shown above and below the functional Ddd clade on Figure 6. This section design is weak and does not lend weight to the expansiveness of this family. More work on the more diverse enzymes and bacteria is needed to support the authors claims. Please delete or study the activity of the more diverse strains and their candidate &quot;AcoDs&quot;.</p><p>Figure 6. This is a nicely presented figure that unfortunately slightly deceives the reader. The authors need to clearly show which strains they have shown to have Ddd activity (currently one as I understand it) and which enzymes they have shown to have the appropriate activity (currently three closely related enzymes as I understand it). If I am not wrong these are all confined to the middle clade of Gammas and Firmicutes. These stand clearly apart form the other strains (above and below) which have not been studied and which are only ~ 30% Identical to &quot;AcoD&quot; at the protein level. This is not clear on the figure and definitely misleads in the abstract and throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4. We expect to see kinetics done on the new enzyme in line with what the authors have done in other related studies on Ddd and Dmd enzymes.</p><p>This is important to place the work in context with previously identified Ddd and Dmd enzymes, many of which have been analysed by these authors in previous publications. The characterization of the AcoD activity remains entirely qualitative. The authors only provide relative activities measured at a single substrate concentration. This data does not support the following statement: &quot;Mutations of these two residues significantly decreased the enzymatic activities of AcoD, suggesting that these residues play important roles in stabilizing the DMSP-CoA intermediate&quot; (l.223-225).</p><p>5. The manuscript does provide unambiguous evidence for the activity of AcoD and its function during growth on DMSP. On the other hand, the description of the &quot;ATP DMSP lysis pathway&quot; is less clear.</p><p>Transcriptomics analysis (Figure 2C) suggest that growth on DMSP upregulate the genes 1696 (BCCT), 1697 (AcoD), 1698 and 1699. The function of the third and fourth protein remain unclear (line 253). Instead, a reductase (AcuI) encoded somewhere else on the same genome was shown to transform the acryloyl-CoA to propionate-CoA. What was the transcription profile of acuI acuH in the RNA-seq? were they induced by growth on DMSP? Is the 1696-1697-1698-1699 gene cluster conserved? What is the function of 1698 and 1699? These questions are only relevant if the authors plan to maintain the claim of having identified a new pathway. This pathway prediction component is very weak and could be supplemented by KO mutagenesis of the dddCB and acuI. Without such work this is speculation and needs to be written as such.</p><p>6. Appropriate controls, units and quantification should be used:</p><p>Line 102- Please give a normalised value for the level of DMS produced from DMSP per time and protein/cells.</p><p>Figure 2.</p><p>A. One would expect to see a growth curve of D2 on DMSP compared to acrylate, a conventional carbon source (e.g. pyruvate, glycerol or succinate) and a no carbon control. As &quot;AcoD&quot; is predicted to ligate CoA to DMSP it would be good to know if the strain grows on acrylate. It might be predicted to have different properties to e.g. Halomonas which does grow on acrylate. At least a no carbon and conventional carbon source should definitely be included.</p><p>B. The units for this figure are not appropriate. It would be more appropriate to show the actual amount of DMS that is produced by the strain, ideally normalised to protein, cells or absorbance and time. Detail in the figure what the control is.</p><p>C. Would like to see error bars on this figure. Also would have been sensible to colour code these to match panel D.</p><p>Figure 3.</p><p>B and C. as with Figure 2 we need to see levels of DMS normalised to cells/protein and time.</p><p>Line 374- No controls. Please include these as detailed above. No carbon, conventional carbon source, acrylate?</p><p>Quantitative data supporting Supplementary Figure 12 would be helpful. After all this route would have to explain that the bacteria can use acrylate CoA as sole carbon source (or at least alternatives would have to be discussed).

The study identified and characterized a new DMSP lyase enzyme in an Antarctic marine bacterium. Together with the eight previously identified DMSP lyase families, this enzyme may play an important role in the ocean sulfur cycle. While an experiment to verify the substrate specificity of the enzyme is still lacking, the majority of the conclusions drawn from the study are justified, and the data analysis is thorough.</p><p>This paper describes the identification and characterization of the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from the Antarctic marine bacterium Psychrobacter sp. D2. The authors show that using these enzymes, Psychrobacter can catabolize DMSP and use it as a sole carbon source while releasing the ubiquitous organosulfur gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS). DMS is a bioactive signalling molecule that plays a key role in the oceanic food web, it is also responsible for the formation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere and is the primary source of biogenic sulfur emitted from the ocean. The authors use a diverse set of tools from classic microbiology, molecular biology, enzymology and crystallography to identify and characterize the enzyme. The newly identified DMSP lyase belongs to the acetyl-CoA synthase family and uses CoA and ATP to transform DMSP to acryloyl-CoA and DMS. The discovery of another DMSP lyase family is surprising given that eight DMSP lyase families, belonging to four distinct superfamilies, had already been identified and are widespread in the marine environment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The researchers provides unambiguous evidence that the newly identified enzyme, DddX, allows Psychrobacter sp. D2 to grow on DMSP as a sole carbon source while releasing DMS. They also present rigorous characterization of the enzyme that includes structural analysis, proposed mode of action and kinetic parameters. Finally, the researchers provide evidence that other DddX homologous genes, obtained from a few species within the alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes, can also catalyse this reaction. In summary, the authors support most of their claims with data, and their findings are relevant for the understanding of the role of bacteria in the oceanic sulfur cycle.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the paper has several strengths, further work is necessary to test the specificity of DddX. Since DddX shows strong structure and sequence similarity to acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes (ACS), and due to its low catalytic activity toward DMSP, its low kcat / KM values, and its presence in a non-functional operon and in the genomes of soil bacteria (where DMSP is not commonly present) the substrate specificity of DddX toward DMSP is still puzzling. Given that acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes have been shown to have promiscuous activity toward different short chain fatty acids including unnatural substrates (Patel et al. JBC, 1987), it is feasible that in this study the authors actually describe an acetyl-CoA synthase enzyme with a mild promiscuous activity toward DMSP. In light of the above, before changing the annotation of the DddX enzyme to DMSP lyase, the authors should test if DddX lost its ability to catalyse its original and primary activity, which is to ligate acetate or propionate to CoA in the presence of ATP. A substrate competition assay that tests the ability of acetate and propionate to inhibit DMSP lyase activity would also be useful. Finally, the ability of the mutation ΔDddX to inhibit growth on acetate or propionate compared with the wild type would also be important to test. The results from the proposed experiments would not change the main conclusion of the paper, that DddX can catalyse the formation of DMS. Yet it may have a significant impact on the interpretation of the finding.</p><p>To assess the generality of their finding, the authors should also provide further details about the diversity and abundance of the DddX enzyme in the oceans and in other environments. For example, it would be appropriate to discuss why DddX enzymes are found also in soil and other non-marine environments, where, according to current knowledge, DMSP is not commonly produced (note that DMSP is produced by many organisms including marine algae, marine bacteria and corals and can be found in abundance in the oceans, in salt marshes, sea sediments and in the roots of specialized DMSP-producing plants). Is DddX a &quot;niche&quot; enzyme that can operate in multiple specialized species? Or is it an enzyme that is present in many bacteria in the ocean? As it stands, additional clarification and discussion of those points is required in the text.</p><p>Comments for authors:</p><p>1. The authors show that, under the conditions tested in the lab, DddX clearly supports the growth of Psychrobacter sp. D2 on DMSP as a sole carbon source and the DddX enzyme is able to catalyze the conversion of DMSP to DMS. However, the relatively low catalytic activity of DddX, low kcat/KM values, and the appearance of DddX in non-functioning operon and in the genomes of soil bacteria, raise questions about DddX substrate specificity. Given that Acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes have been shown to have promiscuous activity toward different short chain fatty acids and even towards unnatural substrates (Smita S. Patel and David R. Walt. JBC, 1987), It is possible, and not unlikely, that the authors actually describe in their study an acetyl-CoA synthase enzyme with a mild promiscuous activity toward DMSP. In Fact from the partial alignment the authors present in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, DddX is extremely similar to other Acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes (ACS). And as mentioned by the authors, it is also very similar in structure, having all the characteristics and active sites residues of other ACS enzymes. In light of the above, I think it's important that the authors test if the enzyme lost its original activity, to ligate acetate or propionate to CoA in the presence of ATP, before changing DddX annotation from &quot;ACS&quot; to &quot;DMSP lyase&quot;. A substrate competition assay that tests the ability of acetate and propionate to inhibit DMSP lyase activity would also be useful. And, testing the ability of the ΔDddX to inhibit growth on acetate or propionate and compare it with the growth of the wild-type would also be important.</p><p>If DddX lost its original function, then the authors should definitely use the name DddX and annotate their newly discovered enzyme as DMSP lyase. However, if not the author would probably want to keep the original name and maybe add a second name that includes the newly discovered function. Or at least discuss the possibility that this enzyme is bifunctional in their paper. The proposed set of experiments that we offer does not change the conclusion that DddX can catalyse the formation of DMS, but it may significantly change how we interpret the results.</p><p>Reference: Smita S Patel and David R.

The authors should explain as well as discuss in the paper how DddX enzymes are found in environments such as soil and other non-marine environments, where, according to our knowledge, DMSP is not commonly produced. Note that DMSP is produced by many organisms including marine algae, marine bacteria and corals and can be found in abundance in the oceans, in salt marshes, sediments or in roots of specialized DMSP producing plants but is it also produce in other soil environments? Please provide a brief description in the text of where the bacteria with DddX in their genome can be found. Also in Figure 6, please indicate the general location of isolation near each branch as in the previous version of the figure. Please search for it for each genome in the NCBI bioSample description. For example: Sporosarcina sp. P33 (with functional DMSP lyase) is a soil bacteria – (The location of isolation is interesting) – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN04589807</p><p>3. Please explain in more detail the general abundance of the DddX enzyme in the oceans (or other environments). Please use the &quot;Tara oceans gene atlas&quot; or other tools to support the high/low abundance of the DddX enzyme in the environment. Is DddX a &quot;niche&quot; enzyme that can operate in multiple specialized species and locations? Or is it one of the enzymes that many bacteria in the ocean possess? As it stands now it is not clear from the text/data. For example: In Line 36 – 38 the authors claims that &quot;DddX is found in diverse marine alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes, suggesting that this new DMSP lyase may play an important role in DMSP/DMS cycles&quot; – However, in Figure 6 It appears that there are not many organisms belonging to those diverse groups of bacteria. i.e. There are a very large number of bacterial species between and within alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes that do not have this gene. In fact from the data presented, DddX enzymes can be found sporadically in only very few groups of species which are very distinct from one another. In summary, try to be more specific in the description of the enzyme diversity and abundance throughout the paper. If DddX is only a &quot;niche&quot; DMSP lyase, the study is still very interesting and valid. However, one would not want to give the wrong impression about the abundance of a newly discovered enzyme. Make sure to discuss the abundance of DddX and the apparently sporadic diversity of the DddX enzyme in the discussion of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64045.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The sequence identity cut-off was set at &gt;30% (The 50% cut-off value was previously used to investigate the distribution of conserved ATP-grasp domain in the database in an early version of the manuscript; this error has now been corrected in this revision). After retrieving putative DddX homologues from the NCBI ref-seq database, multiple sequence alignment was manually inspected to search for the presence of conserved residues that we predict to be involved in DddX catalysis (e.g. H292, W391 and D432).</p><p>Re MAGS low homology issues, we fully agree with the reviewers on the inclusion of MAG sequences with lower identity to ratified DddX. For that reason, we have removed all mention of MAG analysis from Figure 6 and the manuscript. We thank the reviewers for pointing out these problems and feel the manuscript is tighter without their inclusion.</p><p>Re validation issues, we thank the reviewers for revealing the limitations of our initial analysis.

We have also thoroughly edited the manuscript throughout to convey the real known scope of DddX. Although we could have synthesised and assayed more DddX representatives, we now feel that the spread of validation is suitable for what we want to convey.</p><p>Re strain assays, we realise that it would have been more complete assay the strains that contain the more diverse functional DddX enzymes to confirm their activity.

The kinetic data of DddX (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), comparisons to other related enzymes (Supplementary file 1c), and the methods used are now added to the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our current data does not support the roles of the residues Trp391 and Phe435 in stabilizing the DMSP-CoA intermediate. Because DMSP-CoA is an unstable intermediate, and it is difficult to measure the kinetic parameters of DddX mutants towards DMSP-CoA, we have now modified this sentence to &quot;Mutations of these two residues significantly decreased the enzymatic activities of DddX, suggesting that these residues play important roles in DddX catalysis&quot; in line 237-239 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The manuscript does provide unambiguous evidence for the activity of AcoD and its function during growth on DMSP. On the other hand, the description of the &quot;ATP DMSP lysis pathway&quot; is less clear.</p><p>Transcriptomics analysis (Figure 2C) suggest that growth on DMSP upregulate the genes 1696 (BCCT), 1697 (AcoD), 1698 and 1699. The function of the third and fourth protein remain unclear (line 253). Instead, a reductase (AcuI) encoded somewhere else on the same genome was shown to transform the acryloyl-CoA to propionate-CoA. What was the transcription profile of acuI acuH in the RNA-seq? were they induced by growth on DMSP? Is the 1696-1697-1698-1699 gene cluster conserved? What is the function of 1698 and 1699? These questions are only relevant if the authors plan to maintain the claim of having identified a new pathway. This pathway prediction component is very weak and could be supplemented by KO mutagenesis of the dddCB and acuI. Without such work this is speculation and needs to be written as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the insightful comments and agree that future experiments are required in order to firmly establish the pathway of acryloyl-CoA degradation. We have now toned down the description of the pathway and moved the related text into the Discussion section in line 315-324 in the revised manuscript, which reads:</p><p>“If <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 employs its AcuH homolog to convert acryloyl-CoA to 3-HP-CoA (Cao et al., 2017),then, given the high sequence identity of 1698 to DddC and 1699 to DddB, it is possible that these enzymes further catabolize 3-HP-CoA to acetyl-CoA (Alcolombri et al., 2014; Curson et al., 2011b). […] Thus, <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 may also employ an AcuI homolog (i.e. 0105) to convert acryloyl-CoA to propionate-CoA, which would be metabolized through the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway (Reisch et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Appropriate controls, units and quantification should be used:</p><p>Line 102- Please give a normalised value for the level of DMS produced from DMSP per time and protein/cells.</p><p>Figure 2.</p><p>A. One would expect to see a growth curve of D2 on DMSP compared to acrylate, a conventional carbon source (e.g. pyruvate, glycerol or succinate) and a no carbon control. As &quot;AcoD&quot; is predicted to ligate CoA to DMSP it would be good to know if the strain grows on acrylate. It might be predicted to have different properties to e.g. Halomonas which does grow on acrylate. At least a no carbon and conventional carbon source should definitely be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important suggestions which we have now fully taken on. We have now added the quantitative data and appropriate controls in Figure 2 in the manuscript according to the reviewers’ suggestions. The growth curves of <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 on sodium pyruvate and acrylate, and a no carbon control are now added in Figure 2A. <italic>Psychrobacter</italic> sp. D2 could not use acrylate as a sole carbon source for growth in contrast to <italic>Halomonas</italic>, which is discussed in the discussion now in line 325-334.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. The units for this figure are not appropriate.

Re the error bars, <italic>RNA sequencing was carried out on a pool of</italic> three biological samples to produce a single library. We thus could not provide error bars here. However, the upregulation of these genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR that was done in triplicate. Thus, instead of the RNA seq data we include the RT-qPCR data in Figure 2C with error bars. We feel that this is much more appropriate. As covered above, DMS levels are reported appropriately normalised in Figure 3.</p><p>Furthermore, we acknowledge that the genes and metabolic pathway involved in acryloyl-CoA metabolism in this bacterium is unclear and requires further work. The amount of propionate-CoA normalised to protein levels is reported in the figure legend for <italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2</italic> (supplementary Figure 12 in the original version of manuscript). We now discuss several possibilities in line 312-324 in the revised version of manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] Comments for authors:</p><p>1. The authors show that, under the conditions tested in the lab, DddX clearly supports the growth of Psychrobacter sp. D2 on DMSP as a sole carbon source and the DddX enzyme is able to catalyze the conversion of DMSP to DMS. However, the relatively low catalytic activity of DddX, low kcat/KM values, and the appearance of DddX in non-functioning operon and in the genomes of soil bacteria, raise questions about DddX substrate specificity. Given that Acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes have been shown to have promiscuous activity toward different short chain fatty acids and even towards unnatural substrates (Smita S. Patel and David R. Walt. JBC, 1987), It is possible, and not unlikely, that the authors actually describe in their study an acetyl-CoA synthase enzyme with a mild promiscuous activity toward DMSP. In Fact from the partial alignment the authors present in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, DddX is extremely similar to other Acetyl-CoA synthase enzymes (ACS). And as mentioned by the authors, it is also very similar in structure, having all the characteristics and active sites residues of other ACS enzymes. In light of the above, I think it's important that the authors test if the enzyme lost its original activity, to ligate acetate or propionate to CoA in the presence of ATP, before changing DddX annotation from &quot;ACS&quot; to &quot;DMSP lyase&quot;. A substrate competition assay that tests the ability of acetate and propionate to inhibit DMSP lyase activity would also be useful. And, testing the ability of the ΔDddX to inhibit growth on acetate or propionate and compare it with the growth of the wild-type would also be important.</p><p>If DddX lost its original function, then the authors should definitely use the name DddX and annotate their newly discovered enzyme as DMSP lyase. However, if not the author would probably want to keep the original name and maybe add a second name that includes the newly discovered function. Or at least discuss the possibility that this enzyme is bifunctional in their paper. The proposed set of experiments that we offer does not change the conclusion that DddX can catalyse the formation of DMS, but it may significantly change how we interpret the results.</p><p>Reference: Smita S Patel and David R. Walt. Substrate specificity of acetyl coenzyme A synthetase.

We tested the enzymatic activities of recombinant DddX towards acetate and propionate. While DddX converted DMSP to DMS and acryloyl-CoA, it exhibited no activity towards acetate or propionate (Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Re the substrate competition assay, we tested the enzymatic activity of DddX towards DMSP in the presence of acetate or propionate. Acetate or propionate (with a final concentration of up to 5 mM) had little effect on the enzymatic activity of DddX towards DMSP (Figure 3—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Re strain growth experiment, we tested the ability of the wild-type strain D2 and its mutants to grow with acetate or propionate as the sole carbon source. The wild-type strain D2 could use acetate or propionate as the sole carbon source, and the deletion of <italic>dddX</italic> has little effect on its growth on acetate or propionate (<italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 6</italic>), suggesting that <italic>dddX</italic> is unlikely to be involved in acetate and propionate catabolism in strain D2.</p><p>The results above also indicate that DddX does not use acetate nor propionate as a substrate, as such it does not function as an acetate-CoA ligase. We therefore propose to keep the name “DddX” in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should explain as well as discuss in the paper how DddX enzymes are found in environments such as soil and other non-marine environments, where, according to our knowledge, DMSP is not commonly produced. Note that DMSP is produced by many organisms including marine algae, marine bacteria and corals and can be found in abundance in the oceans, in salt marshes, sediments or in roots of specialized DMSP producing plants but is it also produce in other soil environments? Please provide a brief description in the text of where the bacteria with DddX in their genome can be found. Also in Figure 6, please indicate the general location of isolation near each branch as in the previous version of the figure. Please search for it for each genome in the NCBI bioSample description. For example: Sporosarcina sp. P33 (with functional DMSP lyase) is a soil bacteria – (The location of isolation is interesting) – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN04589807</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the comments and we have now added back the location/environment of isolation for the strains shown in the phylogenetic tree (see revised Figure 6). It is difficulty to speculate the source of DMSP in soils since this has not been studied extensively. However, it is likely that soil-dowelling microbes may benefit from DMSP released from plants. We added the following sentence in the discussion, which reads:</p><p>“Interestingly, DddX is found in several bacterial isolates which were isolated from soil or plant roots, suggesting that DMSP may also be produced in these ecosystems”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please explain in more detail the general abundance of the DddX enzyme in the oceans (or other environments). Please use the &quot;Tara oceans gene atlas&quot; or other tools to support the high/low abundance of the DddX enzyme in the environment. Is DddX a &quot;niche&quot; enzyme that can operate in multiple specialized species and locations? Or is it one of the enzymes that many bacteria in the ocean possess? As it stands now it is not clear from the text/data. For example: In Line 36 – 38 the authors claims that &quot;DddX is found in diverse marine alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes, suggesting that this new DMSP lyase may play an important role in DMSP/DMS cycles&quot; – However, in Figure 6 It appears that there are not many organisms belonging to those diverse groups of bacteria. i.e. There are a very large number of bacterial species between and within alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes that do not have this gene. In fact from the data presented, DddX enzymes can be found sporadically in only very few groups of species which are very distinct from one another. In summary, try to be more specific in the description of the enzyme diversity and abundance throughout the paper. If DddX is only a &quot;niche&quot; DMSP lyase, the study is still very interesting and valid. However, one would not want to give the wrong impression about the abundance of a newly discovered enzyme. Make sure to discuss the abundance of DddX and the apparently sporadic diversity of the DddX enzyme in the discussion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have focused our analysis of the distribution of DddX in genome sequenced bacteria but not environmental omics datasets. As pointed out previously by other reviewers, it is necessary to test the function of those homologous sequences retrieved from environmental metagenomics datasets in order to ascertain their role in DMSP degradation. This proves challenging since those homologs returned from Tara Oceans datasets are usually short and do not always contain the full open reading frame, making it difficult for gene synthesis and overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In agreeance with the comments from other reviewers, we have focused on our analysis of DddX in genome-sequence bacteria isolates instead, and have chemically-synthesize several of these homologs to validate their role in DMSP catabolism (Figure 6). We have now modified the following sentences in the abstract, which reads:</p><p>“DddX is found in several Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes, suggesting that this new DMSP lyase may play an overlooked role in DMSP/DMS cycles.”</p><p>We also revised the last paragraph of discussion to reflect the fact that DddX is found in several bacterial isolates.</p></body></sub-article></article>
