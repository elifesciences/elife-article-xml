fast read-out marks the beginning of a new era in electron cryo-microscopy. Using the FEI Falcon II direct electron detector in video mode, we have reconstructed a map at 3.36 Å resolution of the 1.2 MDa F<sub>420</sub>-reducing hydrogenase (Frh) from methanogenic archaea from only 320,000 asymmetric units. Videos frames were aligned by a combination of image and particle alignment procedures to overcome the effects of beam-induced motion. The reconstructed density map shows all secondary structure as well as clear side chain densities for most residues. The full coordination of all cofactors in the electron transfer chain (a [NiFe] center, four [4Fe4S] clusters and an FAD) is clearly visible along with a well-defined substrate access channel. From the rigidity of the complex we conclude that catalysis is diffusion-limited and does not depend on protein flexibility or conformational changes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01963.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01963.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many microbes rely on enzymes known as hydrogenases to catalyse the metabolic reactions that generate energy. These enzymes cleave hydrogen molecules to release electrons that go on to participate in further reactions. In order to fully understand how hydrogenases and other enzymes work it is necessary to work out their structure at the atomic level.</p><p>Last year a technique known as electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) was used to show that Frh—a hydrogenase that is crucial for many different steps in the metabolic process of microbes that produce methane—had a tetrahedral structure. Cryo-EM involves freezing the molecule of interest in a layer of ice to preserve its structure as it is imaged with an electron beam. Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio in each image is low, so researchers must combine many separate images in order to determine the structure of the molecule.</p><p>The use of a new type of electron detector can improve the performance of an electron cryo-microscope in several ways. Higher frame rates can be used, which makes it possible to correct for movement of the molecule caused by the electron beam. The new electron detectors are also more efficient, so samples can be exposed to lower doses of electrons, reducing damage to the sample.</p><p>Using the new direct electron detectors, Allegretti et al. were able to work out the structure of Frh in greater detail than before. The results confirm that the previously reported structure is correct. Furthermore, several new structural features were seen for the first time, including a previously unseen ion located between two protein subunits. Allegretti et al. also revealed that the structure of Frh is highly rigid, and so the process by which it catalyses reactions involving its substrate, the coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>, does not involve changes in its shape. Instead, the reaction rate depends on the rate at which F<sub>420</sub> diffuses to the correct position in the enzyme, where the reaction occurs very rapidly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01963.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01963.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>[NiFe] hydrogenase</kwd><kwd>methanogenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Methanothermobacter marburgensis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMullan</surname><given-names>Greg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of a large enzyme complex involved in methanogenesis was determined at high resolution by electron cryo-microscopy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has long been recognized that electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) has the potential to solve protein structures at near-atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson, 1995</xref>). Since the first sub-nanometer resolution cryo-EM structures of icosahedral viruses, which have the advantage of multi-MDa size and high symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böttcher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conway et al., 1997</xref>), steady advances in instrumentation have yielded a number of virus structures at better than 4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigorieff and Harrison, 2011</xref>). For smaller and less symmetrical structures, progress has been slower, but several complexes have yielded structures at around 6 Å resolution where secondary structure is recognizable and X-ray structures of subcomplexes can be reliably fitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludtke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armache et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gipson et al., 2010</xref>). In a few cases, side chain densities have been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ludtke and Baker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). Radiation damage limits the electron dose that can be used in any individual EM image and the resulting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has meant that until recently high-resolution maps have required the equivalent of 10<sup>6</sup> images of asymmetric units.</p><p>The recent introduction of direct electron detection cameras with much better detective quantum efficiency (DQE) has meant that images having higher SNR can be obtained with the same, or lower, total electron exposure. In addition, these cameras have frame rates which make it possible to collect videos of the particles in the thin film of vitreous water during an exposure, and thus partially correct for the effects of beam-induced particle movement and specimen drift. Using a 70-MDa virus that can be accurately aligned even at short exposures, it was shown that electron irradiation causes random translations and rotations of the particles, which are typically largest in the first few frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>). In two recent studies, image processing schemes were developed to correct for these beam-induced motions. Using the 700 kDa archaeal 20S proteasome, which is too small to reliably detect and align in images recorded with a short exposure, a protocol was developed to align entire frames or subareas of &gt;2000 × 2000 pixels to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>) (The motion correction software is available to download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/extref/nmeth.2472-S2.zip">http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/extref/nmeth.2472-S2.zip</ext-link>). For the much larger ribosome (∼4 MDa) a statistical video processing approach was developed, which acts on individual particles using a user-defined running average of video frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). Both studies produced maps of unprecedented resolution, 3.3 Å for the D7 proteasome from 126,000 particles and 4.5 Å from 35,000 asymmetric 80S ribosomes.</p><p>Recently we determined the structure of the 1.2 MDa Frh complex, the F<sub>420</sub>-dependent hydrogenase from <italic>Methanothermobacter marburgensis</italic>, <italic>ab initio</italic> from cryo-EM data collected on photographic film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). Frh is a key enzyme in the metabolism of methanogenic archaea, where the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane involves the oxidation of four molecules of H<sub>2</sub> by a number of different hydrogenases. The reduced form of the F<sub>420</sub> coenzyme, which is the electron donor in several of these steps, is regenerated by Frh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thauer et al., 2010</xref>). The central role of Frh in the metabolism of methanogens is reflected in its abundance (∼2%) in the soluble cell protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 1987</xref>). Frh is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of the 43 kDa subunit FrhA that contains a [NiFe]-center, the 26 kDa subunit FrhG with three [4Fe4S] clusters, and the 31 kDa iron–sulphur flavoprotein FrhB, which contains the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site and has one [4Fe4S] cluster and an FAD. Our cryo-EM study showed that the Frh complex is a dodecamer with tetrahedral symmetry. The map had ∼5 Å resolution which was sufficient to show secondary structure and density for many side chains as well as the cofactors forming the electron transfer chain, making it possible to trace the three protein chains, one of them without a template.</p><p>We have now collected a new dataset of Frh as videos on a back-thinned Falcon II detector and reconstructed a cryo-EM using a ‘gold standard’ refinement approach. The resulting map from 26,000 particles has a resolution of 3.36 Å, which enabled us to refine the model obtained from film data. We can now trace the three proteins in the complex completely, and localize most side chains with confidence. We compare and discuss different processing schemes to deal with the video data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Images of the Frh complex were collected using the back-thinned FEI Falcon-II in video mode with 18 frames per second. Using videos allows long exposures in which the individual particles and Thon rings are clearly visible, while retaining the radiation-sensitive higher resolution information only present during the initial exposure. The particles were clearly distinguishable below 1 μm defocus with a 1.5 s exposure (∼90 e/Å<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A dataset of 33,590 particles (403,080 asymmetric units) at a defocus range of 0.8–3.5 µm was collected from 235 images in two sessions on a single grid. Areas of very thin ice were selected that we estimate to be only slightly thicker than the particle diameter of ∼175 Å; often similar holes nearby had no particles in the center but a densely packed outer rim, so apparently the thin ice had squeezed the complexes out to the edge of the hole.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data collection of the Frh complex and CTF correction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A typical electron micrograph recorded with the Falcon II camera on the FEI Tecnai Polara operated at 300 kV.

In this protocol, two half datasets are refined completely independently throughout, and after each cycle the new reference volumes are low-pass filtered to the resolution where the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between the two volumes drops to 0.143, thus preventing overfitting of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>). A first refinement using the sum of the first 20 video frames (discarding the last 4 frames because of likely radiation damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Rubinstein, 2010</xref>]) yielded a map at 3.94 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that looked considerably better than our previous map from 84,000 particles on film. Also, the map was virtually noise-free due to the RELION refinement procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Next we applied the frame alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>) and aligned all 24 frames to each other. In the majority of cases, the first frame showed a large movement in comparison with the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)<italic>.</italic> We refined the sum of the aligned frames with or without the first frame and found that discarding the first frame results in a higher-resolution map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As found also by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>), the correction cannot deal with the fast motion of the particles during the first frame. On this basis we discarded the first frame of every video for all subsequent refinements. The refinement of the 20 aligned frames resulted in a 3.74 Å map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In another refinement approach, we used the statistical alignment procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>) implemented in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheres, 2012</xref>). This method follows the movement of the particles within the videos (particle-based method) using a running average of frames. This procedure also improved the resolution relative to the unaligned particles in a very similar way to the whole-frame alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); the best resolution was obtained when 5 frames were averaged. In yet another approach we combined the two alignment procedures (whole-frame and particle-based). The resolution curve of this refinement gave a better FSC than the others over all frequencies and the resulting reconstruction had a resolution of 3.69 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that for the intermediate-sized particle investigated here the combination of the two alignment procedures works best.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves for different refinement strategies.</title><p>All refinements were performed with the gold standard procedure in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>).

The gold curve shows the FSC for the two half data sets with randomized phases beyond 4.5 Å. Subtraction of the gold curve from the red curve yields the green curve, which indicates the true map resolution corrected for over-aggressive masking. The close correspondence of the red and green curves shows that the used soft mask did not introduce spurious correlation and the true map resolution is 3.36 Å. A B factor of −156 Å<sup>2</sup> was determined and applied to sharpen the map.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01963.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01963.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01963-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Specimen movement as detected by recording images in video mode.</title><p>The motion correction software indicates a large movement at the beginning of the exposure.

We then continued to assess the effect of radiation damage on the quality of the map by successively reducing the number of frames. Every omitted frame improved the map resolution until only 6 frames were averaged. This gave the best resolution of 3.39 Å, compared to 3.74 Å for all 20 frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Reducing the number of averaged frames further to 4 or 5 made the resolution worse.</p><p>We attempted to improve the resolution further by adding more data. A third microscope session on a different grid yielded another 15,000 particles. Adding them, however, reduced the map resolution and these images were therefore not included in further steps. We assume the data quality was worse because of the thicker ice on this grid, which had made it necessary to use a higher defocus, never less than 1.2 µm, to distinguish the particles. We therefore decided to discard suboptimal images from the first dataset to improve the map. We removed the images with high defocus (&gt;2.5 µm) and those that were of poor quality as judged by the visibility and symmetry of the Thon rings. This reduced the dataset by 20% from 33,590 to 26,635 particles (319,620 asymmetric units). Refinement of this smaller dataset under otherwise identical conditions resulted in maps with better resolution than the full dataset, and the best map, with 6 frames averaged, extended to 3.36 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2C and 4</xref>). The accumulated dose for this data was ∼24 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. We tested the local resolution of the map with the program ResMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref>) to identify possible flexible protein regions.

We found that all three proteins had been traced essentially correctly in the lower-resolution film map (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The largest differences between the two models were found in surface loops that had been difficult to trace in the film map. The only unresolved part in the previous model involved a 12-residue stretch in FrhG (188–199), for which no density was found and which was thought to form a flexible surface loop. In the new map, two nearby density features, modelled as extended loops before, were clearly recognizable as alpha-helices (194–201 and 208–215) that accommodate the missing residues. The resulting shift of residues brings the cysteine residues C206 and C208, which are conserved in the FrhG family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), near a strong density on the dimer axis between two FrhG subunits.

The fundamental problem is the inevitable radiation damage to the biological sample caused by the electron beam. Reaching high resolution requires low exposures to maximize the SNR of rapidly destroyed high-resolution information. The resulting images are noisy, which makes it both difficult to detect particles and to determine the defocus parameters accurately. The high frame rate of direct electron detectors allows data collection in video mode, which removes these restrictions and allows beam-induced motion of particles to be identified and partially corrected for. Just as importantly, direct electron detectors offer increased detective quantum efficiency at high resolution and so while individual images are still noisy they contain more information. The combination of better images and improved data processing is now leading to better reconstructions which in turn allows more information to be extracted from the images due to better alignment of individual particles.</p><p>The advantages are illustrated in recently published studies of two very different specimens, the 4 MDa asymmetric <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ribosome and the 700 kDa D7-symmetric proteasome. These studies used two different detectors, the FEI Falcon II and the Gatan K2, respectively, and employed different strategies to align the video frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>). We have now reconstructed the 1.2 MDa tetrahedral Frh complex from ∼26,000 particles collected on the Falcon II, and determined the structure of the three proteins in the complex at high resolution.</p><p>The Falcon II data quality is far superior to that obtained with photographic film. With film we obtained a 5 Å map from 84,000 Frh particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>), but with Falcon II images of the same sample and the same electron microscope we were able to achieve a map with better than 4 Å resolution from 70% fewer particles. The higher DQE of the detector makes it possible to reliably detect particles at very low defocus. This is illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, showing a micrograph taken at 900 nm defocus in which the particles are clearly visible, whereas with film we were not able to detect the particles at less than 1500 nm defocus.</p><p>The high-resolution signal for the low-defocus images is very much better than that for images recorded at higher defocus, which was a critical factor in attaining the final map. This is illustrated by the fact that adding more particles recorded at higher defocus (from a grid with thicker ice) actually degraded the overall resolution, and that omitting particles with more than 2500 nm defocus, which did not contribute to the signal at high resolution, improved the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>A decisive advantage of direct electron detectors over film is the possibility of collecting video data. We found that two issues are important here: aligning the video frames to reduce the effects of beam-induced movement, and selecting the frame sequence used in the final map reconstruction to eliminate data affected by radiation damage. We used two approaches for video alignment. The first was the procedure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al. (2013)</xref> for aligning whole frames (or large fractions of frames) independent of the visibility of the particles of interest in the individual frames. This was developed for the 700 kDa 20S proteasome and is most useful for relatively small protein complexes that are hard to detect on images recorded at low electron exposure. The second method is the statistical alignment procedure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al. (2013)</xref>, which works on the particle level on user-defined running averages of substacks and requires the particles to be visible on the substacks. This was developed for ribosomes, which for a given dose are easier to detect due to their large size (several MDa) and high RNA content. The 1.2 MDa Frh complex, which contains 48 [4Fe4S] clusters and several other metal ions, is intermediate in density and size between the proteasome and the ribosome. For this complex we found that both video alignment methods gave similar improvements in final map resolution compared to unaligned frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the combination of the two methods, running the statistical particle alignment on pre-aligned stacks, yielded another improvement of similar magnitude. We used a running average of 5 frames for the particle-based alignment, so it is not unexpected that a pre-alignment of the frames was advantageous.</p><p>Collecting data in video mode also allows elimination of sub-optimal frames from the reconstruction. As was found in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>), beam-induced movement was much more noticeable in the first frame than in subsequent frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This large movement during the first fraction of the exposure would blur the first frame, and by omitting it, we obtained an improvement in resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The later frames are increasingly affected by radiation damage. Reducing the number of frames used in the reconstruction to only 6 (out of the total 24) produced the best map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The accumulated dose in these frames was ∼24 e/Å<sup>2</sup>, very similar to the accumulated dose (∼21 e/Å<sup>2</sup>) used for the 3.3 Å proteasome map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>). A 4.16 Å reconstruction after a refinement of only the last 6 frames of the 20-frame videos still showed partial side chains and clear helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In case of smaller particles than the 1.2 MDa Frh complex, it would be advantageous to record videos over longer periods with higher cumulative doses, so that the particles are more visible and easier to align. The later, radiation-damaged frames can then be omitted from the reconstruction if necessary, as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, direct electron detectors provide a way to optimize a posteriori the electron exposure of the data used for reconstruction.</p><p>Our 3.36 Å resolution map made it possible to determine the structure of the Frh complex unambiguously. All elements of secondary structure are obvious, and side chain density is clearly visible for most residues in the protein interior. Side chains on the surface are in general not seen, probably due to their flexibility in the aqueous solvent. The only conspicuous exceptions are the side chains of glutamates and aspartates, which are almost all absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), even in maps reconstructed from the earliest, least damaged frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). An absence of aspartate and glutamate side chain densities can also be observed in other high-resolution cryo-EM maps, including the electron crystallography maps of LHC-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kühlbrandt et al., 1994</xref>) and bacteriorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>) and the recent 3.3-Å single particle map of the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In X-ray crystallography it was noted that carboxylate side chains have higher B-factors after extended exposure to intense synchrotron radiation, possibly due to decarboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weik et al., 2000</xref>). A quantification of synchrotron radiation damage on carboxylate side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravanti et al., 2006</xref>) shows that this damage already occurs at radiation doses equivalent to less than 1 e/Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henderson, 1990</xref>), a much lower dose than is feasible in cryo-EM. This implies that the decarboxylation would have occurred well within the first frame of our video data set and aspartate and glutamate side chains would in general not be visible in cryo-EM maps. However, not all are absent. Among the few visible carboxylate side chains in Frh, two are involved in ligand binding: FrhG Asp60 in the coordination of the proximal FeS cluster, and FrhA Glu44 in liganding a possible Fe or Mg ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). In X-ray crystallography it is also found that not all glutamate and aspartate side chains are equally susceptible to radiation damage, but the dependence on the structural and chemical environment is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravanti et al., 2006</xref>). In the 3-Å bacteriorhodopsin EM map, the side chains of Asp85 and Asp212, which from spectroscopy are known to be deprotonated, were invisible, whereas the protonated side chains of Asp96 and Asp115 had good density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>). Active sites are often found to contain the most radiation-sensitive residues in X-ray crystallography, but the protonation state was not found to be essential, and a relation to pKa was also not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravanti et al., 2006</xref>). As more high-resolution cryo-EM maps become available, more data on the relative radiation sensitivity of side chains in different environments may give new insights in protein structure and dynamics.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.023</object-id><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The proximal FeS cluster of FrhG is coordinated by three cysteine residues and an aspartate (Asp60) with clear density.

There were many indications that our original Frh structure was essentially correct, for example well-resolved hydrophobic side chains in the protein interior and the observation of secondary structure in regions where it was expected from prediction programs. It was nevertheless gratifying to see how well the model fits the new, higher-resolution map. Note that it would hardly be possible to trace an electron density map obtained by X-ray crystallography at a nominal resolution of 5.5 Å. This clear difference reflects the quality of the phase information, which is conserved in the phase contrast electron micrographs and determined directly by image processing, whereas in X-ray crystallography it is determined indirectly by isomorphous replacement or anomalous scattering.</p><p>Although the overall chain trace is the same, in detail the model based on the 3.36 Å map is of course much improved. The function of Frh is the hydrogenation of F<sub>420</sub> by molecular hydrogen. Electrons are extracted from hydrogen by the [NiFe] cluster in FrhA, and transferred via the three [4Fe4S] clusters in FrhG and another one in FrhB to FAD and from there to the substrate. The electron transfer chain is clearly recognizable. The [NiFe] cluster has a high density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15B</xref>) and is coordinated by conserved residues, as in the large subunits of other [NiFe] hydrogenases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Nearby is another ion, also conserved, coordinated among others by the C-terminal histidine of FrhA, His386 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15B</xref>). The four FeS clusters were easily localized in the film map because of their high density; moreover, they are arranged in a chain with distances of ∼10 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). In the Falcon II map, the clusters are not just featureless blobs, but their tetrahedral coordination (mostly by cysteine residues, or, in one case, an aspartate) can be clearly seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A</xref>). Thus their orientation can be modelled correctly, with the irons facing the sulphurs of the cysteine side chains. One unexpected feature found in the new map was the density for an ion on the dimer interface between two FrhG subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This density feature was actually visible in the film map, but since the flanking conserved cysteines from the two FrhG subunits were not recognized, its interpretation as an ion was not obvious. The function of this ion is most likely to stabilize the dodecameric complex, but its location between the two medial FeS clusters at a distance of only 9 Å, which is less than the distance of ∼10 Å between adjacent FeS clusters in the electron transfer chains, means that a role in electron transfer cannot be ruled out. The final part of the electron transfer chain, the FAD in FrhB, which is close to the last FeS cluster, has unambiguous, continuous density in the Falcon II map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). FAD acts as a one-electron/two-electron redox switch between the FeS clusters and the F<sub>420</sub> substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alex et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thauer et al., 2010</xref>). This means that the substrate needs to approach the FAD to within van der Waals distance to enable hydride transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceh et al., 2009</xref>). In our previous study, we collected data from Frh with and without the substrate. In the map obtained in the presence of substrate we had identified a density near the FAD isoalloxazine ring that we interpreted as part of F<sub>420</sub> at low occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). For the new Falcon-II map, we used an Frh sample with a large excess of F<sub>420</sub>, but the F<sub>420</sub> binding pocket is clearly empty. As the same sample was used in both studies, we conclude that the density in the film map must have been due to noise. An access channel for the substrate can easily be recognized (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>) and its significance is confirmed by the high conservation of the amino acid residues lining the channel (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). There is no indication of even a low occupancy of substrate or of flexibility in this map region. A map of local resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref>) confirmed that the protein region around this pocket is rigid. This suggests that conformational changes do not play a role for the access of F<sub>420</sub> to the hydride donor, consistent with the finding that F<sub>420</sub> reduction by Frh is very rapid and most likely diffusion-limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Livingston et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>The advent of direct electron detection cameras opens new horizons for cryo-EM. It is now possible to obtain higher-resolution maps with many fewer images. Using the video data collection mode, the optimal data in terms of SNR or radiation damage can be extracted a posteriori, and frame alignment schemes can be fine-tuned to the object under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection</title><p>The purification of the Frh complex from <italic>Methanothermobacter marburgensis</italic> and the preparation of the grids for the electron microscope data collection were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, 3 μl of a 0.7 mg/ml Frh sample in the presence of 10 mM F<sub>420</sub> was applied to freshly glow discharged Quantifoil R1/4 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Jena, Germany).

In addition, a soft mask is applied to the last two unfiltered models before convergence and a new FSC curve is calculated.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, John Kuriyan, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Wesley Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors describe a high resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the F<sub>420</sub> reducing NiFe hydrogenase from the methanogenic archaeon, Methanothermobacter marburgensis (Frh). Frh is an exceptionally well behaved, heterotrimeric enzyme with overall Td symmetry, providing 12-fold molecular averaging. The new 3.36 Å resolution reconstruction represents a significant improvement on the ∼5 Å reconstruction reported last year by the same group.</p><p>The strengths of the study are that it provides: 1) a reconstruction that is “state-of-the-art” in terms of methodology and resolution, 2) helpful comparative analyses of different methodological approaches, and 3) additional information on the Frh structure, including side chain positions. The authors found that the reconstruction resolution was optimized when they a) averaged frames 2-7 (omitting the first frame owing to large sample motions and omitting subsequent frames owing to radiation damage), b) omitted images with the thicker ice, high defocus values and poor Thon rings, and c) combined the whole frame and particle alignment methods. With the optimized reconstruction, the authors were able to: a) confirm that the previous structure was correct, b) assign two new surface helices, c) identify a new Zn<sup>2+</sup>(Cys)4 site at the FhrG dimer interface, d) argue that the enzyme’s active site does not appear to adjust substantially upon F<sub>420</sub> substrate binding, e) add to the available data concerning electron beam-induced decarboxylation of Asp and Glu residues (most such side chains are decarboxylated, but several are not, including several that coordinate cofactors), and f) demonstrate that reliable near atomic-resolution information was present even in their previous EM maps that exhibited nominal overall ∼5 Å resolution, thanks to the direct phase information present in the images.</p><p>The study is of high technical quality and it provides another excellent example of the ongoing revolution in cryo-EM, where improved detector quantum efficiencies are increasing image signal-to-noise and improved software packages and data analysis approaches are making better use of the improved signal. The manuscript is as important for its demonstration of technical capability as for its biological insights.</p><p>Issues that should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) Since the authors interpret their density in terms of an atomic model (and they deposit coordinates) they should include in the paper, in addition to all the FSC curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>, at least one FSC between their best map and their best model. If their interpretation of the density map in terms of the model is mostly correct, then the map/model FSC should have a value of 0.5 at the same resolution where the gold-standard FSC between maps calculated from the two independent halves of the experimental data is 0.143. If it is not roughly in that range, then they should try to improve their model. This is a very rigorous test and should be included in any paper where a map and model are presented.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and the legend that describes it; the authors may have misunderstood the procedure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al. (2013)</xref> that is required to determine the extent of overfitting. In that paper, there were two uses of the idea of randomizing the phases. In the first, all the raw single particle images have their phases randomized beyond a chosen resolution. The entire structure determination is then repeated and equation 4 from Chen et al. is then used to calculate the true FSC in which any overfitting can be measured and removed to produce an FSCtrue plot. However, there is also another use of equation 4 of Chen et al shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which was used to determine the effect of any aggressive masking. In this second application of equation 4, the final 3D map has its phases randomized beyond a chosen resolution, and the FSC and the corrected FSCtrue is calculated to measure and remove the effect of masking. From the figure legend in Allegrini et al., it is unclear whether the authors have carried out the first or the second procedure. The first does indeed test for overfitting, whereas the second test only for over-aggressive masking. If the authors have done only the second, then all they have really done is to test whether the Relion masking is soft. In that case, they should carry out the (more time-consuming) procedure of repeating the entire structure determination using randomized high-resolution phases for the raw single particle images. Failing that, if the FSC test proposed in item 1 ends up being ∼0.5, (between the best density and the best model), then it is probably sufficient simply to correct the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend regarding the use of the HR-noise test (and remove all references to determination of overfitting, assuming they haven’t actually done that).</p><p>3) The issue of substrate occupancy should be clarified. It appears that the authors have made a typographical error in the Discussion when they say that: “We used an Frh sample with a large excess of FAD to calculate...” (presumably they mean to say “F<sub>420</sub>” rather than “FAD”?). The more significant issue is that it is unclear why they previously assigned density for the isoalloxazine ring of F<sub>420</sub> in the F<sub>420</sub>-replete sample but now don’t see any density in the new higher resolution map. Looking back at the previous F<sub>420</sub> density, it appears that this could well have been noise, but if this was the case then it should be stated clearly (or, if not, the discrepancy should be explained). The authors should also exercise care in how they phrase the conclusion that they expect no conformational changes when F<sub>420</sub> binds if they don’t really have a structure of the F<sub>420</sub>-bound enzyme.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01963.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Since the authors interpret their density in terms of an atomic model (and they deposit coordinates) they should include in the paper, in addition to all the FSC curves shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2 and 3</italic></xref><italic>, at least one FSC between their best map and their best model.
