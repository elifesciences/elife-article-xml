diseases. However, the underlying molecular interactions that drive aging remain enigmatic. Here, we develop quantitative time-resolved crosslinking mass spectrometry to monitor protein interactions and dynamics inside condensates formed by the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS). We identify misfolding of the RNA recognition motif of FUS as a key driver of condensate aging. We demonstrate that the small heat shock protein HspB8 partitions into FUS condensates via its intrinsically disordered domain and prevents condensate hardening via condensate-specific interactions that are mediated by its α-crystallin domain (αCD). These αCD-mediated interactions are altered in a disease-associated mutant of HspB8, which abrogates the ability of HspB8 to prevent condensate hardening. We propose that stabilizing aggregation-prone folded RNA-binding domains inside condensates by molecular chaperones may be a general mechanism to prevent aberrant phase transitions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular condensates</kwd><kwd>RRM</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>time-resolved quantitative XL-MS</kwd><kwd>FUS</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STE 2517/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stengel</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010583</institution-id><institution>Universität Konstanz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chemicals and small Equipment Purchase</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stengel</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence &quot;Physics of Life&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyman</surname><given-names>Anthony A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013278</institution-id><institution>EU Joint Programme – Neurodegenerative Disease Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carra</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007802</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Italiana di Ricerca per la Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Granulopathy and MLOpathy</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carra</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006601</institution-id><institution>Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dissolve_ALS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carra</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, University and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E91I18001480001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carra</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative time-resolved crosslinking mass spectrometry is developed to monitor protein interactions and dynamics inside molecular condensates and used to identify misfolding of the RNA-binding domain of FUS as a key driver of condensate-aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Condensate formation by liquid-liquid phase separation leads to a local density change of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). Liquid condensates can harden and evolve into less dynamic states with reduced fluidity and protein movement, leading to fibrillar assemblies that are often associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguzzi and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular changes that underly these aberrant phase transitions, and the ways that cells prevent them, remain poorly understood.</p><p>Stress granules have been used as a model to study the role of phase separation in the formation of cellular condensates, as well as disease processes that arise from aberrant phase transitions. Stress granules are composed of RNA and translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Markmiller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). There is an increasing body of evidence that the ability of stress granule proteins to phase separate forms the basis for stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, purified stress granule residing RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) phase separate into liquid droplets in vitro. Reconstituted droplets have physicochemical properties similar to stress granules in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). In vitro reconstituted molecular condensates are metastable and age into less dynamic amorphous drops, and fibrillar aggregates with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). These aggregates are reminiscent of protein aggregates seen in patients afflicted with age-related diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This process is referred to as molecular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the molecular aging process is accelerated by ALS-linked mutations in FUS and other RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that molecular aging of liquid condensates such as stress granules can be a disease process.</p><p>Recent studies have provided evidence for a link between stress granules and small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateju et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganassi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gu et al., 2020</xref>). These ATP-independent chaperones hold unfolded proteins in a refolding-competent state and both their intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and folded α-crystallin domain (αCD) contribute to this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haslbeck et al., 2019</xref>). sHSPs have been shown to accumulate in stress granules that undergo an aberrant conversion from a liquid to a solid-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateju et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ganassi et al., 2016</xref>). Aberrant stress granules have also been linked to disease and many sHSPs are associated with neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vendredy et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that chaperones, such as sHSPs, may regulate the properties of stress granules and presumably also the molecular aging process of stress granule proteins such as FUS.</p><p>FUS has been a model protein to study both aberrant and physiological phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hofweber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qamar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshizawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). It contains an intrinsically disordered prion-like low complexity domain (LCD) composed of only a small subset of amino acids, an RNA-binding domain (RBD) containing intrinsically disordered RGG-rich motifs, a Zinc finger (ZnF), and a folded RNA recognition motif (RRM). It has been shown that phase separation of FUS family proteins is driven by multivalent interactions among tyrosine residues within its LCD and arginine residues of their RBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qamar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuster et al., 2020</xref>). At least part of the LCD of FUS can assemble into amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2017</xref>) and the isolated FUS-LCD can adopt a hydrogel-like state that also depends on amyloid-like interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, the LCD appears to be disordered in liquid droplets, exhibiting no detectable secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>). Similar observations have been made for the LCD of hnRNPA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the LCD, the isolated FUS-RRM has been shown to spontaneously self-assemble into amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism by which proteins such as FUS undergo molecular aging are still unknown.</p><p>To determine the molecular changes during the aging of stress granule proteins such as FUS, it is critical to monitor protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and conformational dynamics within condensates. However, this has remained a major challenge. We and others showed previously that chemical crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is well suited to map PPIs and that relative changes in crosslinking as probed by quantitative XL-MS (qXL-MS) can provide a structural understanding of protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu and Huang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sailer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walker-Gray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we adopt XL-MS to study condensates.</p><p>In this study, we take a biochemical approach using purified proteins to reconstitute a chaperone-mediated quality control mechanism associated with RNP granules and combine it with qXL-MS to probe PPIs inside condensates. We find that unfolding of the RRM drives FUS aging and that interaction of its folded RRM with the sHSP HspB8 slows down this aging process. Importantly, these condensate-specific interactions are altered in a disease-associated HspB8 mutant, resulting in its inability to prevent FUS aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative and time-resolved XL-MS reveal domain-specific changes in crosslink abundances underlying condensate formation</title><p>To investigate the condensate-specific interactions of FUS after phase separation, we diluted purified FUS-G156E protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nomura et al., 2014</xref>), called FUS<sub>m</sub> throughout this manuscript, either into a low salt solution, which induces phase separation or into a high salt buffer, which prevents phase separation. After crosslinking of lysine residues and subsequent digestion, equal amounts of peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to reveal condensate-specific crosslink patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These crosslinks can either reflect the spatial proximity of regions and protein-domains within a given protein, called intra-links, or between different proteins, called inter-links. For a detailed description of the different crosslink types <italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. When the crosslinker reacts twice within one peptide, this is called a loop-link. Additional information comes from crosslinking of one side of the crosslinker with the protein and hydrolysis on the other side. This is called a mono-link and reveals information on the accessibility of a specific lysine residue. In some cases, we can also follow links between proteins of the same species (homo-dimeric link). These are crosslinks between overlapping peptides whose sequence is unique within the protein and that must therefore originate from different copies of the same protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain-specific changes in crosslink abundances underlying condensate formation and molecular aging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of quantitative crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (qXL-MS) of FUS<sub>m</sub> condensates.

(<bold>B</bold>) Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was used to introduce covalent bonds between proximal primary amines in order to link lysine residues within studied proteins. The actual crosslinking sites are subsequently identified by MS and reflect the spatial proximity of regions and protein-domains within a given protein (intra-link) or between different proteins (inter-link). Additionally, the crosslinker can react twice within one peptide (loop-link) or only on one side with the protein and hydrolyze on the other side (mono-link), revealing information on the accessibility of a specific lysine residue. XL-MS cannot readily discriminate if a crosslink has formed within one polypeptide chain (defined as intra-link, vide supra) or between homodimers or even higher oligomers of the same protein. This is usually not a problem, but in the case of the high protein concentrations within condensates it may play a role. However, as we detect all shown intra-links within FUS<sub>m</sub> and HspB8 also under the relatively low-concentration regime of the dilute phase, it is fair to assume that all of the links are indeed intra-links as usually defined—for example occurring within one FUS<sub>m</sub> polypeptide chain—as we assume in the current version of the manuscript. For some specific intra-links, we do however know that they must have occurred between different molecules of the same protein; these are crosslinks between overlapping peptides whose sequence is unique within the protein and that must therefore originate from different copies of the same protein (homo-dimeric link). (<bold>C</bold>) Significantly shorter crosslinking time periods than conventionally used lead to reproducible and sufficient crosslinking yields. A test protein was crosslinked for different time periods (1 min, 5 min, and the standard 30 min) before the reaction was quenched and crosslinks were identified by LC-MS/MS (data for two biological replicates are shown). In order to minimize the induced error rate due to sample handling, a crosslinking period of 5 min was chosen for all time points.

Additionally, links between the RRM domain and the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) were increased, while links within the Zinc-finger domain were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

A closer examination focusing on those crosslinks within the RRM that were increased during condensation shows that these also change during molecular aging and particularly during fiber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

We find that in the dense phase of the condensates the number of inter-links between the LCD of FUS<sub>m</sub> and both the IDR and the αCD of HspB8 was strongly increased, confirming previous results on the role of the LCD during phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Lactalbumin is a molten globule protein that partitions into FUS<sub>m</sub> condensates likely mediated by unspecific interactions between partially exposed hydrophobic patches in the client and the condensate scaffold protein. Mixtures of FUS<sub>m</sub> and lactalbumin that were crosslinked under condensate inducing low salt conditions (75 mM) and subsequently separated into the dilute phase (<italic>left</italic>) and dense phase of the condensates (<italic>right</italic>) by centrifugation did not show any significant differences in the overall crosslink patterns of dilute and dense phase. This suggests that in contrast to the HspB8: FUS<sub>m</sub> interaction, partitioning of lactalbumin into FUS<sub>m</sub> condensates is caused by unspecific interactions.

Misfolding of the RRM domain may represent the initial step on the pathway to forming a seed that subsequently promotes the nucleation of FUS fibrils. This may involve cross-beta sheet interactions of the LCDs via local concentration and LCD alignment.

Thus, it is a possibility that HspB8 has a general role in cell physiology in stabilizing RRM domains in condensates.</p><p>The changes we find in the inter-link patterns between FUS<sub>m</sub> and HspB8-WT or the neuropathy-causing mutant HspB8-K141E may appear counter-intuitive at first sight as far as they suggest a higher binding affinity of the mutant for FUS than the HspB8-WT. However, as sHSPs form oligomers subunit exchange between the WT and mutant HspB8 may influence the activity of the HspB8-WT. A heterodimer with lower activity than a WT homodimer could explain the differences in activity, and we do not exclude the possibility that HspB8 (which is present in mM concentrations inside the condensates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) will form higher-order oligomers which may enhance the mutant’s effect on the WT. Our data also point to shifts in conformation and dynamics of the RRM domain after condensation and during aging and within the HspB8-K141E mutant upon RRM binding. These shifts may differentially affect the fate of the bound substrate: stabilization of the FUS<sub>m</sub> native conformation by HspB8-WT versus loss of function by the HspB8-K141E mutant with subsequent FUS<sub>m</sub> aggregation. To date, mutations in the genes coding for HspB1, HspB3, HspB5, and HspB8 have been associated with neuromuscular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vendredy et al., 2020</xref>). To what extent similar mechanisms may also affect other HspB8 mutants therefore awaits further investigation.</p><p>A mechanism by which unfolding of globular domains is controlled by chaperones inside condensates may be a process of general importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Franzmann and Alberti, 2019</xref>). Deletion of the RRM slows down hardening but does not stop it. This suggests other driving forces such as aberrant LCD-LCD interactions that may require other types of chaperone systems to prevent them. Our study also highlights the interplay between folded domains and IDRs. A changed environment after phase separation could destabilize folded domains and require chaperones to stabilize them. Such a mechanism would necessitate many domain-specific chaperones for stabilization inside condensates.</p><p>In summary, by adapting existing XL-MS workflows, we were able to monitor PPIs and protein dynamics inside reconstituted protein condensates, thus paving the way for a deeper and more detailed structural understanding of condensate formation and aberrant phase transitions. Our study shows with unprecedented molecular detail how protein contacts are formed between a chaperone and the folded RRM of its client protein inside a condensate and therefore suggests a blueprint for how chaperones could act to stabilize biomolecular condensates in cells. More generally, our data suggests that established principles of cellular organization, such as domain-specific PPI sites, also apply to the biochemistry inside molecular condensates. Here, further work is required to expand the resolution of crosslinking mass spectrometry by developing crosslinking chemistries optimized for intrinsically disordered domains and to augment its current ability to also target condensates in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Two condensate droplets were trapped in two optical traps of the same trap stiffness at low overall light intensity to minimize local heating. With the first trap stationary, the second trap was moved to bring the droplets into contact and initiate coalescence, after which both traps were kept stationary. Laser signals and bright-field microscopy images were simultaneously recorded. Signals from the two traps—equal in magnitude, opposite in sign—were combined into the differential signal, from which coalescence relaxation times were deduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify the coalescence dynamics and account for droplets of different sizes, the relaxation time was normalized by the geometric radius of the two fusing droplets. Successful droplet coalescence was scored as yes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>) or no (0) depending on whether the process resulted in a near-spherical shape of the final droplet within 60 s. This duration was an order of magnitude longer than the earliest coalescence relaxation times under all conditions.

After incubation, the chamber was flushed with freshly formed FUS<sub>m</sub> condensates in reaction buffer either in the presence or absence of 20 µM HspB8. An image stack representing a volume of approximately 100 µm<sup>3</sup> and a voxel size of 0.1 µm×0.1 µm×0.3 µm was acquired every 30 min using a spinning disk confocal equipped with a glycerol immersion 60× objective. In the resulting image stacks, fibers tend to be relatively dim with bright cores. To produce an image that allows for good visualization of the process of fiber growth, we smoothed each stack and subsequently applied an enhanced local contrast method (CLAHE). This method uses tiles throughout the image and calculates an appropriate contrast for each tile. We used CLAHE implemented in ImageJ with a block size of 30. For each stack, we create a maximum projection of the resulting stack that produces a single image. Finally, we used an image registration method (using the stackreg plugin in ImageJ) to remove any small translational drift which occurs through the process.

In short, each image is resized eight times using a bicubic interpolation. An image is subsequently automatically thresholded using Otsu’s method through the imthresh command. Objects are identified as regions of connected pixels. Any objects which intersect the picture border or are very small are discarded from further analysis. Fibrous objects are identified as either objects with an eccentricity above 0.7 or, if the eccentricity is low, as objects that have a roughness above 6.4 pixels. The eccentricity is found by fitting an ellipse to a connected region and is defined as the ratio of the distance between the foci of the ellipse and its major axis length (implemented using the eccentricity argument in the regionprops command). To determine the roughness, each object is fit by a circle. The roughness is defined as the mean distance between the object border and the circular fit. Objects with low surface roughness as well as low eccentricity were considered droplets. All objects and their subsequent classification are also reviewed finally by eye to ensure that the parameters for the images are set properly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining of sHSPs in stressed cells</title><p>HeLa Kyoto WT (Identifier 5067) and HeLa Kyoto FUS-GFP (Identifier 5063) BAC cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose (Gibco Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml Penicillin+100 μg/ml Streptomycin. 250 μg/ml Geneticin (all Gibco Life Technologies) was added to the HeLa Kyoto FUS-GFP BAC cells.

Thus, samples were subjected to MS analysis either directly after adjustment of the high salt/low salt solution containing mixtures of essentially dilute phase or dense phase of the condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F &amp; G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) or after an additional separating step by centrifugation fully separating reconstituted droplets that had formed under low salt solution from the remaining dilute phase as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

In short, the dried protein samples were denatured in 8 M Urea, reduced by the addition of 2.5 mM TCEP at 37°C for 30 min, and subsequently alkylated using 5 mM Iodacetamid at RT for 30 min in the dark. Samples were digested by the addition of 2% (w/w) trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37°C after adding 50 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate to a final concentration of 1 M urea. Digested peptides were separated from the solution and retained by a C18 solid-phase extraction system (SepPak Vac 1cc tC18 [50 mg cartridges, Waters]) and eluted in 50% ACN, 0.1% FA. After desalting the peptides were evaporated to dryness and stored at −20°C. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 30% ACN, 0.1% TFA, and then separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 30 increase 3.2/300 (GE Life Science) to enrich for crosslinked peptides. The three early-eluting fractions were collected for MS measurement, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in 5% ACN, 0.1% FA. Concentrations were normalized by A215 nm measurement to ensure equal amounts of dilute and dense phase and peptides separated on a PepMap C18 2 µM, 50 µM×150 mm (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a gradient of 5–35% ACN for 45 min. MS measurement was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data dependent acquisition mode with a cycle time of 3 s. The full scan was done in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000, a scan range of 400–1500 m/z, AGC Target 2.0e5, and injection time of 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor selection and dynamic exclusion were used for precursor selection. Only precursor charge states of 3–8 were selected for fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation using 35% activation energy. MS2 was carried out in the ion trap in normal scan range mode, AGC target 1.0e4, and injection time of 35 ms. Data were searched using <italic>xQuest</italic> in ion-tag mode. Carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) was used as a static modification for cysteine. As database the sequences of the measured recombinant proteins along with reversed and shuffled sequences were used for the FDR calculation by <italic>xProphet</italic>.</p><p>Experiments were carried out in three biologically independent sets of experiments (meaning separate batches of expressed protein). For one set of experiments, each sample was independently crosslinked in triplicates and each of these was measured in technical duplicates. Crosslinks were only considered, if they were identified in two out of three replicates with a deltaS&lt;0.95, a minimum Id score≥20, and an ld score≥25 in at least one replicate (filtering was done on the level of the unique crosslinking site), and an FDR≤0.05 as calculated by <italic>xProphet</italic> for at least one replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitation of crosslinked peptides from condensates (qXL-MS)</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Quantitation</title><p>Initial processing of identified crosslinked peptides for quantitation was performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sailer et al., 2018</xref>). In short, the chromatographic peaks of identified crosslinks were integrated and summed up over different peak groups for quantification by <italic>xTract</italic> (taking different charge states and different unique crosslinked peptides for each unique crosslinking site into account). Only high-confidence crosslinks that fulfilled the above introduced criteria were selected for further quantitative analysis.</p><p>The resulting <italic>bagcontainer.details.stats.xls</italic> file was used as an input for in-house scripts developed for this manuscript. The bag container contains all experimental observations on a peptide level as extracted by <italic>xTract</italic> (e.g., peptide mass, charge state, the extracted MS1 peak area, and any violations assigned by <italic>xTract)</italic>. Missing observations were replaced by imputation with random values drawn from a normal distribution based on our experimental distribution. Here, the log-normal experimental distribution of measured MS1 peak areas was converted to a normal distribution by log2-conversion. Of the resulting normal distribution, the mean and standard deviations were determined. The mean was shifted downward while the width was decreased in order to obtain the distribution to draw imputed values from, following the same procedure and parameters as described for Perseus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) (width: 0.3 and down shift: 1.8).</p><p>Data were additionally filtered using a light-heavy filter as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walzthoeni et al., 2015</xref>) and peptides with a light-heavy log2ratio&lt;−1 or &gt;1 were excluded from further analysis. Experiments were normalized by their mean MS1 peak area using the mean of all experiments as reference. The ratio of each experiment compared to the reference was computed and all observed MS1 areas were multiplied by this experiment-specific ratio to receive the same mean for all experiments. In addition, replicates were normalized within each experiment. Thus, the mean of each biological and technical replicate within an experiment was shifted to the mean of an experiment in the same way as described above.</p><p>In the next step, log2ratios were calculated as the difference between the log2-converted MS1 peak areas (instead of the ratio). Here, the MS1 area for each experiment was shifted into a log2 scale after all summing operations but before taking any means, allowing us to calculate meaningful standard deviations between biological replicates and to avoid the influence of outliers in the original log-normal scale. P-value calculations were otherwise performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walzthoeni et al., 2015</xref>), with one notable exception: MS1 peak areas were not split by technical replicates in order to avoid artificially improved p-values with increasing numbers of technical replicates. FDR values were p-values corrected for multiple testing, following the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Significance</title><p>Only high-confidence crosslinking sites (see above) that were detected reliably and consistently with a deltaS&lt;0.95, a minimum Id score≥20, and a ld score≥25 in at least one replicate (filtering was done on the level of the unique crosslinking site), and an FDR≤0.05 were used for quantitation. Changes in crosslinking abundances were throughout the paper quantified against the dilute phase (i.e., relative enrichment within droplets is shown in green; relative decrease in red). Only crosslinking sites that were upregulated or downregulated twofold or more (log2ratio≥1 or ≤−1 and FDR≤0.05) in at least two biological replicate sets of experiments and in addition contained no opposing regulation in any replicate set were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Time-resolved quantitative crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry</title><p>Fresh FUS<sub>m</sub> condensates formed under low salt (75 mM KCl) conditions were left shaking at 650 rpm in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 28°C and monitored by fluorescence microscopy at regular intervals until conversion into fibers.

Here the authors use an innovative approach to study the effect of chaperones to counteract this aging process which is of great importance for understanding the molecular details of aggregation prone diseases. The methodological novelty of this approach is the use of protein-protein crosslinking to study the conformation of the RNA-binding domain of FUS in condensates in the absence and presence of HspB8.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HspB8 prevents aberrant phase transitions of FUS by chaperoning its folded RNA binding domain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Benesch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How is it possible to discriminate between intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinks, especially when the crosslinks were created within aggregates of proteins such as, in this case, FUS? Does the RRM indeed change its conformation, or does it simply interact with RRMs of other FUS molecules? Is the spacer of DSS not too long to allow any conclusion about the structure of such small domains as the RRM or Zn-finger, in particular for a protein prone to aggregation?</p><p>2) The authors titrated the crosslinker according to the numbers of lysine residues present in the two proteins HspB8 and FUS. They should discuss, or at least state, the concentration of the crosslinking reagent within the condensates compared with the concentration outside the condensate phase; this statement should include the correlation between the concentration of the crosslinker in the condensate and the protein concentration(s) inside and outside the condensates. (The authors used a 2.7 fold molar excess of crosslinker over lysine residues in the proteins – however, they should also state the concentrations as molarity.) A very high concentration of a chemical crosslinker could in principle grossly distort the structure of a protein, as has been observed in several studies; this might diminish the value of crosslinking as an indicator of protein condensation, and the authors should address this. Monitoring crosslinking in a concentration-dependent manner would have also been beneficial.</p><p>3) The exclusive use of a lysine-reactive crosslinker limits the resolution of monitoring intra- and inter-protein interactions. Although the authors state explicitly that they use a lysine-directed crosslinker solely because there are no lysine residues in the disordered regions of FUS, it is not clear why the authors did not also use crosslinkers reactive toward groups other than the amino group. Such crosslinkers could possibly have been useful to study protein interactions that are salt-sensitive. Indeed, the LCD of FUS is not suitable for applying lysine-reactive or carboxy-reactive crosslinkers; better suited to this would be (for example) ruthenium (II) tris-bipyridine, which connects tyrosine residues, and it is precisely tyrosine(s) in the LCD that seem(s) to be crucial for protein condensation. Furthermore, protein-protein crosslinking by UV light has been described and is attributed to covalent Y-Y links.</p><p>In particular: (i) Have the authors considered the use of different endoproteinases (such as chymotrypsin) in order to obtain a comprehensive sequence coverage of crosslinked peptides? (ii) Why have the authors not taken into account serine, threonine and tyrosine as crosslinking sites of DSS. It has been reported that DSS is also reactive toward these amino acids.</p><p>Related: The LCD of FUS contains the N-terminus of the protein – a primary amine.

Addition of Hsp8B seem to make them larger still (clearly obvious for the &quot;36h&quot; time point). Some questions are raised: What fraction of the FUSm is present the droplets/fibres and what fraction remains in solution? Is HspB8 present in the condensates as well? Complementary experiments using labelled HspB8 are necessary to clarify this.</p><p>5) The hypothesis that RNA and HspB8 compete for the interaction with FUS is interesting; however, the data supporting this are preliminary and the question requires more thorough investigation for example by pulldown experiments.</p><p>6) Can the authors rule out that the differences seen between FUS in low and high salt is not due to the salt concentration per se, but due to the phase separation? While unlikely, but it could be that DSS does not penetrate the FUS-rich phase, and cross-links are only observed between species in the FUS-poor phase (which still contains FUS, albeit at lower concentrations). Can the authors rule this out?</p><p>7) The ACD-snap and IDR-snap experiments are a bit confusing – the ACD doesn't partition, yet appears to have some activity?

In general, I consider the crosslinking data acquired in this work by CID in the ion trap to be of insufficient quality.

We cannot generally discriminate between intra crosslinks and interlinks between homo-oligomers and we also did not want to be suggestive of this; we can however discriminate for a specific subset of those.</p><p>We had tried to get this important point across in the legend to Figure S1A:</p><p>“XL-MS cannot readily discriminate if a crosslink has formed within one polypeptide chain (defined as intra-link, vide supra) or between homodimers or even higher oligomers of the same protein. This is usually not a problem, but in the case of the high protein concentrations within condensates it may play a role. However, as we detect virtually all shown intra-links within FUS<sub>m</sub> and HspB8 also under the relatively low-concentration regime of the dilute phase, it is fair to assume that at least a major part of the observed changes occurs within intra-links as usually defined – e.g. occurring within one FUS<sub>m</sub> polypeptide chain – as we assume in the current version of the manuscript. For some specific intra-links, we do however know that they must have occurred between different molecules of the same protein; these are crosslinks between overlapping peptides whose sequence is unique within the protein and that must therefore originate from different copies of the same protein (homodimeric link).”</p><p>These dimeric links are also indicated by a “d” in all figures – see for example Figure 1B.</p><p>At least this subset of homodimeric links – some of which we can follow in detail during both condensation and aging (see Figure 1B and 1C) – tells us that there must be heightened contacts between different RRM molecules within the dense phase of the condensates (which was admittedly also not an entirely unexpected result, given the high concentration of the condensates). Moreover, we also detect virtually all links specified as intralinks already in the dilute phase, suggesting that their increase can at least not only be due to heightened RRM contacts between different FUS molecules in the dense phase of the condensates. The same line of arguments can be applied to the aging time-course, as we observe here a decrease in dimeric intra-links and have also detected virtually all intra-links both in the dilute and dense phase (see Figure S1D), which again indicates that they should at least partially have emanated from monomeric intra-links.</p><p>We would also like to point out that we are very aware of the fact of that molecular condensates are particularly critical protein assemblies that require extra care. This is why we have analyzed critical experiments in high redundancy, e.g. as biological triplicate <italic>experiments</italic>, that each consist of 3 independently crosslinked replicates (which were additionally all measured as technical duplicates) (see Figure 2E).</p><p>We also fully agree with the reviewer that it is not possible to directly assign a specific conformational status to a crosslinking pattern, even though our work has demonstrated that changes in intralink pattern <italic>can</italic> reflect conformational changes (PMID: 30361475). This is why we tried very carefully throughout our manuscript to NOT directly assign a specific conformation status with the observed change in crosslinking pattern within the RRM.</p><p>For example:</p><p>“This suggests that there are augmented contacts within the RRM domain, indicative of a structural change. In addition, there was an increase in homo-dimeric links between RRM domains, indicative of interactions between RRM domains of different FUS<sub>m</sub> molecules.”</p><p>However, our main point is, that the majority of changes in crosslink abundance that we observe takes place WITHIN the RRM.</p><p>This fact, in combination with all the follow-up biochemical and molecular characterization on the folding status of the RRM in Figure 5 and 6, lead us to conclude that there is likely indeed a conformation change taking place in the RRM during condensation and in particularly during aging – which can be prevented by binding of HspB8; which is again in line with our crosslinking data, as we for example show in Figure S3I that the crosslinking pattern within the RRM does NOT change after binding of HspB8.</p><p>We also respectfully disagree that the linker that was employed in this study is too long to allow any conclusion about the structure of such small domains as the RRM or Zn-finger. We know from previous work that the linker used in this study covers distances up to 30 Å well, with a particular focus on distances from 12 to 15 Å (PMID: 22286754).</p><p>These are also the likely distances to be covered within the RRM and between HspB8 and FUS- RRM and FUS ZnF, as for example mapping our identified crosslinks to the existing NMR structure of the RRM of FUS (PDB 2LCW) demonstrates an excellent fit (i.e. we can map 8 out of 8 identified crosslinks, covering distances from 12 to 31 Å) and shows that also small distances can be covered by our crosslinker DSS H<sub>12</sub>/D<sub>12</sub> (Author response figure 1).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping identified cross-links identified using the crosslinker DSS H<sub>12</sub>/D<sub>12</sub> onto the NMR structure of the RRM of FUS (PDB 2LCW).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69377-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors titrated the crosslinker according to the numbers of lysine residues present in the two proteins HspB8 and FUS.

It is unfortunately not possible to directly measure the concentration of the crosslinker within the dense phase of the condensate and the dilute phase. We are nevertheless confident that this has not been a problem, as our experiments demonstrate that we obtain a similar amount of intralinks within the dense phase of the condensate and the dilute phase (see Figure 2E, Figures S2 F, G and E), which is a good indication that sufficient amounts of crosslinker were present in either of the phases.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that there are reports showing that an excess of crosslinker can lead to distortions in protein conformation. However, we respectfully disagree that high concentrations of a chemical crosslinker regularly or even generally distort the structure of a protein. More importantly, we did not employ high doses of crosslinker in our study, as we were operating within a regime of ~ 1 to 2 mM crosslinker (see updated experimental procedures for details) and such a conventional and widely accepted crosslinker concentration range (PMID:31045356). Moreover, as the protein concentration within the dense phase of the condensates is even higher (Figures S2C and S2D), the likelihood of possible distortions is even lower there.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now monitored crosslinking in a concentration-dependent manner and our data shows that there are no apparent differences in crosslink behavior and crosslinking yields within the crosslinker concentration range that was used in this study – i.e. 1 to 2 mM DSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Monitoring crosslinking in a concentration-dependent shows no apparent differences in crosslink behavior and crosslinking yield in the range used in this study, i.</title><p>e. 1 to 2 mM DSS (see updated experimental procedures).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69377-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The exclusive use of a lysine-reactive crosslinker limits the resolution of monitoring intra- and inter-protein interactions.

However, interaction/binding studies as suggested by the reviewer are very challenging in condensates and will likely not be quantitative. For example, we have tried to monitor both HspB8 levels in the dilute and dense phase by SDS-PAGE after adding different amounts of RNA and also tried to monitor aging of FUS<sub>m</sub> and FUS<sub>m</sub>∆RRM under increasing amounts of RNA. However, as the amount of RNA itself influences condensate formation and as condensate formation is additionally somewhat dependent on the exact composition of the pool of added RNAs, the data was inconclusive and did not permit a quantitative statement. We therefore feel that although the suggested experiment is interesting in its own right, it is clearly beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p>However, in order to get this important point across more clearly (i.e. the current rather hypothetical status of our investigations and the need for future investigations), we have amended the manuscript to write:</p><p>“This result suggests that RNA and HspB8 may compete for binding to FUS<sub>m</sub> and indicate a similar mechanism by which they stabilize its RRM domain to prevent FUS<sub>m</sub> aging.”</p><p>and extended our discussion to write:</p><p>“It has been proposed before that cells use RNA to regulate condensate formation. Our data suggests that RNA and HspB8 can compete for their interaction with FUS. While this requires experimental validation in future studies, we hypothesize that some RRM domains require stabilization by binding to RNA and in cases where no RNA is available, the chaperone HspB8 takes over this function and protects the RRM domain from unfolding and aggregation.”</p><p>We hope that this is a satisfactory solution for the reviewer; however, in case the reviewer should insist, we would be willing to completely remove Figure 5D from our manuscript prior to publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors rule out that the differences seen between FUS in low and high salt is not due to the salt concentration per se, but due to the phase separation? While unlikely, but it could be that DSS does not penetrate the FUS-rich phase, and cross-links are only observed between species in the FUS-poor phase (which still contains FUS, albeit at lower concentrations). Can the authors rule this out?</p></disp-quote><p>In our workflow we have included a centrifugation step <italic>after</italic> we crosslink to fully separate the dense phase of the condensates from the dilute phase. This extra step guarantees that we analyze dilute phase and dense separately and that the crosslinks detected in the dense phase must indeed stem from proteins that were located within the condensate (Figure 2E).</p><p>In these experiments we did also NOT change the salt concentration (i.e. we only used the low salt concentration of 75 mM to induce condensation in the first place). This already rules out that the differences in cross-links were due to a change in salt concentration. Moreover, in our control experiments (see Figure S2F) – where we indeed used low salt vs high-salt conditions without additional centrifugation – we identify the same crosslinking pattern (including the <italic>condensate-specific</italic> enrichment of links between the HspB8-αCD and the FUS<sub>m</sub>-RRM) as we detect without centrifugation, again corroborating that our crosslinker is able to penetrate the FUS-rich phase and that differences in crosslinking are not due to a change in salt concentration. The comparability of our “centrifugation“ and „salt“ experiments is additionally underpinned by Figure S3G which shows that also our quantitative crosslinking data are highly comparable between these conditions.</p><p>We apologize that this important point was not evident from the manuscript and was likely caused by an inadequate description of our experimental procedures, which we have therefore amended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The ACD-snap and IDR-snap experiments are a bit confusing – the ACD doesn't partition, yet appears to have some activity? While the IDR region doesn't partition nearly as well as the full-length, the N-terminal regions of sHSPs are frequently unstable c.f. aggregation – are the authors sure that the IDR-snap construct is stable – and if not, might this explain the difference?</p></disp-quote><p>The residual activity of the ACD-SNAP construct may be explained by the fact that this variant somewhat partitions into the FUS droplets as shown in Figure S4E and into FUS-LCD droplets as shown in Figure S4H. ACD-SNAP still shows about 18% of partitioning in comparison to the full-length HspB8-SNAP (Figure S4E). Considering that the concentration of the full-length HspB8 protein inside the FUS condensates is about 2.4 mM (Figures S2C and S2D), a lowered partitioning of the ACD-SNAP variant to 18% reflects a concentration of 0.4 mM inside the condensate. This fact could well explain the observation that the ACD-SNAP shows residual chaperone activity towards FUS inside the condensates (Figure S4F). These results are further supported by the fact that the swap variant with a HspB1-IDR fused to the HspB8-ACD (IDR1ACD8) shows a similar effect (Figure S4M and S4N). We did not observe aggregation of the IDR-SNAP variant during protein purification or our experiments. A possible explanation of the results may be related to the oligomeric state of HspB8 inside the droplets. Dimerization/oligomerization of HspB8 may play a role in increasing multivalency of interactions with itself and with FUS and thus have an influence on its partition coefficient. As the IDR-SNAP construct lacks the dimerization competent αCD, this may contribute to a reduced partitioning of this variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) HSPB8 likes to dimerize.

It seems counterintuitive that stronger binding of the mutant prevents the aging of the droplets and the transition to a more solid-like phase. Here more data or at least a more detailed discussion with a reasonable model would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed a well-known fact that sHSPs form oligomers and it is therefore a possibility that subunit exchange between the wildtype and mutant HspB8 takes place, which may influence the activity of the HspB8-WT. A heterodimer with lower activity than a wildtype homodimer could explain the differences in activity, and we do not exclude the possibility that HspB8 (which is present in mM concentrations inside the condensates, Figures S2C and S2D) will form higher order oligomers which may enhance the mutant’s effect on the wildtype.</p><p>Moreover, our data indicates that the mutant has a higher affinity for FUS than the wildtype (as suggested by the stronger binding) which could lead to an at least partial displacement of the HspB8 wildtype by the mutant. We reasoned that this in turn could result in a conformational change – or the stabilization of such a change – within FUS that affects its aging behavior. A notion that is again at least partially supported by changes that we detect in our crosslinking data that support a conformational change within the RRM of FUS during both condensation and aging (Figure 1B and 1C) and within the HspB8 mutant upon binding of the FUS RRM (Figure 6F).</p><p>“Concomitantly, multiple intra-links within HspB8 bridging the N-terminus to the αCD domain were increased in the HspB8-K141E mutant (Figure 6F), an observation that is in line with a potential conformational change of the chaperone mutant upon FUS binding that brings these domains closer to each other.”</p><p>The reviewer is however fully right in pointing out that currently this is mostly speculation and future research will be needed to shed light on this question. This is also why we write in the discussion:</p><p>“To what extent similar mechanisms may also affect other HspB8 mutants therefore awaits further investigation.”</p><p>In order to emphasize these important points even further, we have now removed any speculative parts from the Results section, and have amended the discussion of the manuscript to now write:</p><p>“The changes we find in the inter-link patterns between FUSm and HspB8-WT or the neuropathy-causing mutant HspB8-K141E may appear counter-intuitive at first sight as far as they suggest a higher binding affinity of the mutant for FUS than the HspB8-WT. However, as sHSPs form oligomers subunit exchange between the wildtype and mutant HspB8 may influence the activity of the HspB8-WT. A heterodimer with lower activity than a wildtype homodimer could explain the differences in activity, and we do not exclude the possibility that HspB8 (which is present in mM concentrations inside the condensates, Figures S2C and S2D) will form higher order oligomers which may enhance the mutant’s effect on the wildtype. Our data also point to shifts in conformation and dynamics of the RRM domain after condensation and during aging and within the HspB8-K141E mutant upon RRM binding. These shifts may differentially affect the fate of the bound substrate: stabilization of the FUSm native conformation by HspB8-WT versus loss of function by the HspB8-K141E mutant with subsequent FUSm aggregation. (….) To what extent similar mechanisms may also affect other HspB8 mutants therefore awaits further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors analysed the data using the search engine xQuest, which requires a pair of non- and isotopically labelled crosslinkers for confident identification of crosslinked peptides.

A notion that is also shared in the latest and first community-wide crosslinking study (PMID:31045356), where the approach chosen in this manuscript is explicitly mentioned as being <italic>lege artis</italic>, <italic>see</italic> page 6958:</p><p>“Some strategies provide additional layers of evidence that can be used to better control the error rate. For example, isotope-coded, noncleavable linkers provide two independent measures of precursor and fragment masses and charge state information for fragments independent of MS resolution”.</p><p>We also would like to point out that during the time-point where we have started this project, the approach used by us was the only one available that allowed for the automatic quantification of crosslink data.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have nevertheless acquired new data from samples of FUS::HspB8 condensates using high-resolution MS2 and searched them independently using the search engines <italic>pLink2</italic> (PMID: 31363125) and <italic>MeroX</italic> (PMID: 31283178) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref> shows an excellent overlap between the different approaches, where virtually all crosslinks detected by our approach could be validated by the high-resolution acquisition strategy and the different search engines. While <italic>pLink2</italic> detects overall more crosslinks than <italic>xQuest</italic>, the question if this is due to an improved acquisition strategy or rather a higher false-discovery rate, as shown previously for <italic>pLink2</italic> (PMID: 32029734), can remain open at this point, as the data clearly confirms that the data generated by the approach used for this manuscript consists of valid and highly reproducible crosslinks. A similar argument can be made for the comparison with <italic>MeroX</italic>, in which case <italic>xQuest</italic> is able to detect a larger number of crosslinks.</p><fig id="sa2fig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of detected crosslinks from FUS/HspB8 condensates at an FDR &lt; 0.</title><p>05 using either a high/low acquisition strategy and <italic>xQuest</italic> as a search engine or a high/high strategy and <italic>plink2</italic> (A) or <italic>MeroX</italic> (B) as search engine.
