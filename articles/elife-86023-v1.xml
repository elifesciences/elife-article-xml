species. Here, we explore a fundamental question concerning the impact of aneuploidy on systemic metabolism using a non-mosaic transchromosomic mouse model (TcMAC21) carrying a near-complete human chromosome 21. Independent of diets and housing temperatures, TcMAC21 mice consume more calories, are hyperactive and hypermetabolic, remain consistently lean and profoundly insulin sensitive, and have a higher body temperature. The hypermetabolism and elevated thermogenesis are likely due to a combination of increased activity level and sarcolipin overexpression in the skeletal muscle, resulting in futile sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) activity and energy dissipation. Mitochondrial respiration is also markedly increased in skeletal muscle to meet the high ATP demand created by the futile cycle and hyperactivity. This serendipitous discovery provides proof-of-concept that sarcolipin-mediated thermogenesis via uncoupling of the SERCA pump can be harnessed to promote energy expenditure and metabolic health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>trisomy</kwd><kwd>sarcolipin</kwd><kwd>SERCA pump</kwd><kwd>futile cycle</kwd><kwd>hypermetabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK084171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>G William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD098540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reeves</surname><given-names>Roger H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD038384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reeves</surname><given-names>Roger H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25221308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oshimura</surname><given-names>Mitsuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR18S4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kazuki</surname><given-names>Yasuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice carrying a near-complete human chromosome 21 are hypermetabolic and have increased thermogenesis due to sarcolipin overexpression in the skeletal muscle, leading to persistent uncoupling of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump activity and heat generation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The presence of an extra chromosome in mammals is generally lethal during fetal development, due to widespread cellular havoc caused by misregulated gene expression arising from gene dosage imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Down syndrome (DS), resulting from trisomy of chromosome 21, is one of the rare aneuploidies compatible with life although as many as 80% of trisomy 21 conceptuses miscarry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>). The increased expression of ~500 transcribed sequences of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) affects many cell types and organ systems during development and in the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonarakis, 2017</xref>). Humans with trisomy 21 have cognitive deficits, altered craniofacial development, and are at significantly higher risk for congenital heart defects, hearing and vision loss, leukemia, gastrointestinal disease, and early-onset dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonarakis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given the significant impact of intellectual disability on the lives of individuals with DS, research emphasis has naturally focused on the neurological deficits underpinning trisomy 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Potier and Reeves, 2016</xref>). In addition to developmental abnormalities associated with DS, there is an increasing awareness that adolescents and adults with DS also have an increased incidence of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Goor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertapelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fonseca et al., 2005</xref>). Although this was first noted in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milunsky and Neurath, 1968</xref>), the underlying cause for these metabolic dysregulations is mostly unknown and largely underexplored. Beyond clinical observations, limited studies have been conducted to determine the physiological underpinnings of metabolic impairments seen in DS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierssen et al., 2020</xref>). Our recent study on the Ts65Dn mouse model represents the most in-depth metabolic analysis, to date, of any DS mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarver et al., 2023</xref>). However, the segmental trisomic Ts65Dn mouse contains only ~55% of the orthologous protein-coding genes (PCGs) found on Hsa21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, it contains additional trisomic genes from the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 17 (Mmu17) not found in Hsa21, thus complicating the genotype-phenotype relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duchon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reinholdt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the past two decades, more than 20 mouse models of DS have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herault et al., 2017</xref>). Despite their utility in advancing DS research, none of these models recapitulate the full spectrum of human DS. With the exception of Tc1, all the DS mouse models are trisomic for some, but not all, of the orthologous mouse genes found in Hsa21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herault et al., 2017</xref>). Tc1 is the first mouse model with an independently segregating Hsa21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Doherty et al., 2005</xref>). However, Tc1 mice are missing &gt;50 of the 220 PCGs on Hsa21 due to deletion and mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gribble et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Tc1 mice show extensive mosaicism (i.e. the human chromosome is present in zygotes but is lost randomly from cells during development). As a consequence, every mouse has a unique developmental trajectory, complicating the interpretations of results obtained from Tc1 mice. To overcome the limitations of previously generated trisomic mouse models, a transchromosomic mouse model (TcMAC21) carrying an independently segregating and near-complete copy of Hsa21 was recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>). TcMAC21 is not mosaic and contains 93% of HSA21q PCGs, and is considered the most representative mouse model of DS.</p><p>Both mouse and rat that carry a non-mosaic Hsa21 recapitulate many DS phenotypes related to the central nervous system (e.g. reduced cerebellum volume, learning and memory deficit), craniofacial skeleton, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kazuki et al., 2022</xref>). The metabolic phenotype of TcMAC21, however, is unknown and has yet to be examined. The availability of the TcMAC21 mouse model has afforded a unique opportunity to address two fundamental questions: (1) what is the impact of aneuploidy on systemic metabolism; (2) what are the molecular, cellular, and physiological consequences of introducing a foreign (human) chromosome from an evolutionarily distant species into mice?</p><p>Unexpectedly, we discovered that TcMAC21 mice have all the hallmarks of hypermetabolism, likely driven by a combination of hyperactivity and elevated mitochondrial respiration and futile sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump activity in the skeletal muscle as a consequence of endogenous sarcolipin (SLN) overexpression. Our study has provided further evidence and proof-of-concept that endogenous SLN-mediated uncoupling of the SERCA pump can be harnessed for energy dissipation, weight loss, and metabolic health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human chromosome 21 genes are differentially expressed and regulated in mouse adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle</title><p>TcMAC21 mice carry a non-mosaic and independently segregating mouse artificial chromosome with a near-complete copy of the long arm of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>). The Hsa21q in TcMAC21 is comprised of ~37 Mb and 199 PCGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RNA-sequencing showed that TcMAC21 mice are capable of expressing Hsa21-derived transcripts in each of the tissues examined, and that gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The transcriptional activity map of Hsa21 shows regions of gene expression and repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There are three large regions of Hsa21 with little or no transcription activity: 29.5–31.1 Mb, 44.5–44.8 Mb, and 45.3–46.2 Mb. The first gap of transcriptional inactivity contains the PCGs <italic>Cldn8</italic> and <italic>Cldn17</italic>, <italic>Girk1</italic>, and 33 distinct <italic>Krtap</italic> (keratin-associated protein) genes.

A similar pattern can be seen in the non-protein-coding genes (NPCGs). We were unable to detect any Hsa21-derived NPCGs in the iWAT, while in gWAT we observed 37. Overlap analysis was carried out to assess how similar expression profiles were between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of the 126 Hsa21-derived PCGs expressed by at least one tissue, a majority (65 total) are shared between BAT, gWAT, liver, and skeletal muscle. Of the 109 Hsa21-derived NPCGs expressed by at least one tissue, the majority (53 total) are uniquely expressed by skeletal muscle. Of note, the liver uniquely expresses 6 PCGs and 2 NPCGs, gWAT 4 and 3, skeletal muscle 3 and 53, BAT 1 and 10, and iWAT 0 and 0.

Thus, relative to their body weight, TcMAC21 actually consumed a significantly higher amount of food than euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indirect calorimetry analysis indicated that TcMAC21 mice—regardless of the photocycle (light or dark phase) and metabolic states (ad libitum fed, fasting, refeed)—were expending ~25% more energy and were significantly more active compared to euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). It is known that normalization to lean mass can lead to an overestimation of energy expenditure (EE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tschöp et al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, ANCOVA (using body weight as a covariate of EE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tschöp et al., 2012</xref>) were also performed. Both types of analyses suggested that TcMAC21 mice had significantly higher EE relative to euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Despite much higher caloric intake per gram body mass, TcMAC21 mice were much leaner due to substantially elevated physical activity and EE. Hyperactivity and elevated EE were not due to altered circulating thyroid hormones, as serum triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>, the active form of TH) levels were not different between chow fed TcMAC21 and euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, after 8 weeks on high-fat diet (HFD), TcMAC21 mice gained only ~3 g of body weight, whereas the euploid controls gained &gt;15 g of body weight over the same period. Consequently, TcMAC21 mice weighed ~50% less than euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with the lean phenotype, the absolute and relative (normalized to body weight) fat mass were markedly reduced compared to euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The weights of other organs (liver, kidney, BAT) at time of termination were also lower in TcMAC21 mice, but tibia length was not different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Because relative lean mass was higher in TcMAC21 compared to euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the lean phenotype seen in HFD-fed TcMAC21 is largely due to reduced adiposity.

In glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), even though the rate of glucose disposal was similar between TcMAC21 and euploid mice, the amount of serum insulin present during GTT (time 0, 15, and 30 min) was dramatically lower in TcMAC21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>). This indicates that a substantially lower amount of insulin is sufficient to promote glucose clearance in TcMAC21 at a rate comparable to euploid mice, consistent with elevated insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues.

Quantification of β-islet size, pancreatic insulin and SST content, as well as insulin granule and vesicle size did not reveal any intrinsic differences between TcMAC21 and euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N–Q</xref>), thus ruling out a developmental cause and arguing in favor of enhanced insulin action. Pancreatic acinar zymogen granule size was also not different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting normal development of the exocrine pancreas.

First, we wanted to rule out whether there is a change in caloric intake. TcMAC21 mice actually consumed the same or slightly higher amount of food as the euploid controls despite markedly lower body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thus, relative to their body weight, HFD-fed TcMAC21 mice consumed a significantly higher amount of food than the euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To rule out any potential dysfunction of the gut that might adversely affect nutrient absorption, we collected, counted, weighed, and subjected fecal samples of each mouse to fecal bomb calorimetry. Neither fecal frequency, average fecal pellet weight, nor fecal energy content was different between TcMAC21 and euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Fecal energy content trended lower in TcMAC21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), implying a modest increase in the efficiency of nutrient absorption. Since energy input (caloric intake per gram body weight) was significantly higher in TcMAC21 and outputs (left-over fecal energy) were similar across genotypes, the data suggest hypermetabolism being a cause of the lean phenotype seen in TcMAC21 mice. Indeed, when we measured EE and physical activity of both groups, we found that TcMAC21 mice have markedly higher EE and physical activity irrespective of circadian cycle and metabolic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Indeed, deep colon temperatures of TcMAC21 were elevated, most notably in the dark cycle when mice are active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Assessment with thermal imaging showed an elevated skin temperature around the interscapular region of TcMAC21 mice, whereas the tail skin temperature was not different between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Importantly, the differences in interscapular skin temperatures persisted in TcMAC21 even when compared to weight-matched wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>), thus ruling out body weight (and hence surface area/volume ratio) as the cause of greater heat generation to compensate for greater heat loss.

This prompted us to examine the transcriptome of skeletal muscle, by far the largest metabolically active tissue that can substantially contribute to overall EE. RNA-sequencing of TcMAC21 skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) revealed it to be the most transcriptionally dynamic tissue, with 4.2% of the transcriptome changed relative to euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

SERCA pump uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol back into the SR. When SLN binds to SERCA, it promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> slippage without affecting the ATPase activity of SERCA. By doing so, SLN uncouples Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport activity from ATP hydrolysis of SERCA with concomitant heat generation. The increased duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the cytosol also elevates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and heat generation.

The <italic>Sln</italic> gene is known to be upregulated in skeletal muscle by cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rowland et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bal et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the markedly upregulated <italic>Sln</italic> expression seen in TcMAC21 mice housed at ambient temperature (22°C) remained high even when the animals were housed at thermoneutrality (30°C). Consistent with the mRNA data, SLN protein levels were also strikingly upregulated in TcMAC21 skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Immunofluorescence also indicated substantially more SLN positive muscle fibers in TcMAC21 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). We included skeletal muscle lysate from SLN overexpression transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>) as our positive control. While the transgenic mouse had ~2.5-fold higher level of SLN compared to controls, the SLN protein levels in TcMAC21 were ~4.5-fold higher than the euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). It is known that <italic>Sln</italic> can be induced in skeletal muscle as a compensatory response to muscle atrophy, dystrophy, and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2022</xref>). However, none of the genes involved in muscle repair, wasting, and atrophy were significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Sln</italic> overexpression is not due to structural or functional deficit of the skeletal muscle in TcMAC21 mice. Collectively, our data suggest that a mechanism exists that can achieve upregulation of endogenous mouse SLN at a level substantially higher than that seen in artificially overexpressed transgenic mice under non-pathological condition.</p><p>Quantification of histological sections revealed that the average gastrocnemius muscle fiber CSA in TcMAC21 was significantly smaller compared to euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests a shift from being a predominantly glycolytic muscle to a more oxidative muscle, as a smaller muscle fiber CSA is associated with a more oxidative muscle phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Wessel et al., 2010</xref>). In accordance, protein levels of mitochondrial complexes I–V were significantly higher in TcMAC21 gastrocnemius muscle compared to euploid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–L</xref>). Corroborating the Western blot data, immunofluorescence also showed substantially higher succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB) staining (marker of oxidative capacity) in gastrocnemius muscle of TcMAC21 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–N</xref>).</p><p>To determine if TcMAC21 mice have higher mitochondrial activity compared to euploid controls, we conducted mitochondrial respiration analyses in liver, BAT, iWAT, gWAT, and different muscle types (quadriceps, extensor digitorum longus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, soleus, tongue, and heart). Except soleus and heart, most muscle types from TcMAC21 fed either chow or HFD—regardless of whether they were predominantly slow-twitch (oxidative), fast-twitch (glycolytic), or mixed—showed significantly elevated oxygen consumption due to elevated mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O–Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">9</xref>). Enhanced mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities were more pronounced in glycolytic muscle tissues, suggesting that these normally glycolytic muscle fibers may assume a more oxidative phenotype in TcMAC21 mice. The greater oxidative phenotype in glycolytic muscle tissues was not due to changes in fiber-type composition, as none of the fiber type-specific transcripts were different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data are consistent with similar results reported for skeletal muscle-specific SLN overexpression mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sopariwala et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to muscle, mitochondrial activities of complexes I and II in interscapular BAT was largely unchanged in TcMAC21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>), despite the pronounced differences in BAT histology and lipid content between TcMAC21 and euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–L</xref>). In chow-fed mice, however, mitochondrial complex IV activity was higher in BAT of TcMAC21. In subcutaneous (inguinal) white adipose tissue, mitochondrial respiration was significantly reduced in chow-fed TcMAC21 mice but unchanged in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9</xref>). In visceral (gonadal) white adipose tissue, mitochondrial respiration was also largely unchanged in either chow- or HFD-fed TcMAC21 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9</xref>). Unexpectedly and in striking contrast to muscle and BAT, mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activity was markedly reduced in the liver and heart of both chow- and HFD-fed TcMAC21 compared to euploid mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">8</xref>), despite the liver of TcMAC21 mice being significantly ‘healthier’ with much reduced lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>).</p><p>All together, these data suggest that SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity in skeletal muscle is a potential driver underlying the hypermetabolism phenotypes seen in TcMAC21 mice. Because the futile SERCA pump activity consumes more ATP to transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> into SR due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sahoo et al., 2015</xref>), this creates a huge energy demand and markedly drives up the activity of mitochondrial respiration to supply the ATP needed for the SERCA pump. Presumably, this effect results in systemic channeling of metabolic substrates (e.g. lipids) into skeletal muscle to fuel the elevated mitochondrial respiration rate. This in turn leads to secondary improvements and protection—reduced fat accumulation and smaller adipocytes—we observed in liver, BAT, gWAT, and iWAT despite minimal changes in the transcriptomes of these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Potential regulators of SLN expression in skeletal muscle</title><p>Having established that SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity underlies hypermetabolism in TcMAC21 mice, we next asked what regulator(s) promote the upregulation of endogenous SLN, as little is known about what controls its expression in skeletal muscle. We took advantage of the observation that SLN overexpression appears to be locked in the ‘on’ position in skeletal muscle and could not be downregulated to control levels at thermoneutrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thyroid hormone (T<sub>3</sub>) is likely not the driver of SLN overexpression since serum T<sub>3</sub> was not different between TcMAC21 and euploid housed at thermoneutrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); in addition, SLN was shown to be upregulated in hypothyroid mice compared to euthyroid controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaspari et al., 2020</xref>).

However, when body weight was used as a covariate in ANCOVA, the higher EE seen in TcMAC21 was short of significance (p=0.0693), and this could be due to the small sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

We therefore performed RNA-sequencing on skeletal muscle isolated from HFD-fed TcMAC21 housed at thermoneutrality. RNA-sequencing data showed a total of 113 DEGs in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice, with 59 being upregulated and 54 being downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>).

Because <italic>Sln</italic> expression was similarly upregulated in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice housed at 22°C and 30°C, we presumed the regulator(s) of <italic>Sln</italic> would also display minimal variation across both temperatures. We therefore focused on genes that remained unchanged at 22°C and 30°C in TcMAC21 skeletal muscle. We first filtered out all genes above or below Log2(FC) of 0.5 or –0.5, which left us with 3754 transcripts whose expression remained relatively unchanged at both temperatures. We next sorted the data by p-value, then compared the entire list of unchanged transcripts to the list of shared DEGs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, and found that only five genes were present in both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

Again, these are the genes that are differentially expressed by TcMAC21 mice housed at 22°C and 30°C as compared to euploid, which remain unchanged in TcMAC21 mice across temperature. Thus, these are potential <italic>Sln</italic> regulators that are encoded in the mouse genome.</p><p>Alternatively, the regulator(s) of <italic>Sln</italic> expression could be one or more Hsa21-drived human genes. There was a total of 106 human transcripts expressed by TcMAC21 mice housed at 22°C and 30°C, with 94 PCGs and 12 NPCGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). There were four human PCGs only expressed in TcMAC21 mice housed at 30°C and 83 human genes whose expression was turned off at 30°C. Interestingly, a majority (75 out of 83) of the human genes that were turned off at 30°C are NPCGs. The human genes that we postulated as most likely to regulate <italic>Sln</italic> expression would be those that change the least at 22°C and 30°C. We first calculated the difference in Log2(FC) values of all human genes expressed at 22°C and 30°C in TcMAC21 skeletal muscle (i.e. Log2(FC at 22°C) - Log2(FC at 30°C)). Those values closest to zero represent genes with the most consistent expression across both housing temperatures. Genes with a negative Log2(FC) difference are expressed at higher levels at 30°C, and genes with a positive Log2(FC) difference are expressed at higher levels at 22°C. The ~20 genes with the closest-to-zero Log2(FC) difference are listed in yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), and these would be considered potential regulators of <italic>Sln</italic> derived from Hsa21.

Given that TcMAC21 mice recapitulate multiple features of human trisomy 21—most notably structural and functional neurological deficits and craniofacial skeletal alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>) and also a small body size compared to their euploid littermates—we initially expected the animals to show metabolic changes such as obesity and glucose intolerance reminiscent of the DS population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertapelli et al., 2016</xref>) or the metabolic dysregulation (e.g. insulin resistance and dyslipidemia) seen in the Ts65Dn DS mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarver et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, the TcMAC21 mice have several hallmarks of hypermetabolism. They are lean despite greater caloric intake, and have markedly elevated oxidative metabolic rate as indicated by increased VO<sub>2</sub>, EE, mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle, and by a shift to a more oxidative phenotype in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Although the higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes is well documented in the DS population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertapelli et al., 2016</xref>), the mechanism of how gene dosage imbalance causes metabolic dysregulation in vivo is largely unknown and limited to only a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierssen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fructuoso et al., 2018</xref>). Until our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarver et al., 2023</xref>), the scope of the previous metabolic studies using DS mouse models was limited. Our present study represents one of the most comprehensive metabolic analyses carried out in DS mouse models to date. To our surprise, TcMAC21 phenotypes appear to be the opposite of what is seen in DS. We can speculate on possible reasons for this: (1) The strong physiological effects of SLN overexpression in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 override and mask potential deleterious effects of high-fat feeding seen in the euploid controls. It is important to note that SLN overexpression is not seen in other commonly used DS mouse models such as the Ts65Dn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarver et al., 2023</xref>). Although candidate transcriptional drivers of <italic>Sln</italic> overexpression have been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it remains to be determined which among these are responsible for <italic>Sln</italic> overexpression in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice. (2) The unexpected phenotypes of TcMAC21, including SLN overexpression, could be the result of complex interactions between human genes and the mouse genome that we do not fully understand. The human Chr21 also contains a significant number of non-coding human genes (&gt;400) with uncertain effects on the mouse transcriptome. Further, the human proteins may alter the stoichiometric compositions of multi-protein complexes in an unpredictable way. For this reason, and for comparison, it is imperative to carry out similar comprehensive metabolic studies in other established DS mouse models (e.g. Dp(16)1Yey/+ and Ts66Yah) where all the trisomic genes are derived from the mouse instead of human, and also without extra trisomic genes not found in Hsa21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchon et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible the trisomic mouse orthologs of Hsa21 genes are overexpressed and interact with the rest of the mouse genome in a manner that more closely reflects what might be seen in the adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle of DS. This is an important issue to resolve in terms of selecting appropriate DS mouse models to best reflect the metabolic phenotypes seen in DS. While TcMAC21 is considered the best <italic>genetic</italic> model for DS in mice, the mouse apparently has a means of overcoming the negative metabolic impact of trisomy. Uncovering this mechanism could be important for the treatment or prevention of obesity and diabetes.</p><p>What could be the mechanism underlying the striking metabolic phenotypes of TcMAC21? One potential driver of hypermetabolism appears to be SLN overexpression in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice, leading to persistent uncoupling of the SERCA pumps, heat generation, and energy dissipation. This mechanism could explain multiple unexpected observations: despite a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the liver, BAT, and WAT, surprisingly few changes were seen in the transcriptomes of these tissues, and none could account for the striking tissue histology. Importantly, none of the key genes (e.g. <italic>Ucp1</italic> in BAT and browning/beiging genes in iWAT) involved in thermogenesis and lipid metabolism were significantly different between TcMAC21 and euploid mice, and yet the mice had elevated deep colon temperature. While the metabolic activity (i.e. mitochondrial respiration) of BAT was largely unchanged, complex I, II, and IV activities in the liver were surprisingly downregulated. Mitochondrial respiration was either downregulated or unchanged in iWAT and gWAT. All these striking phenotypes could be explained by metabolic substrates (e.g. lipid) channeling away from liver, BAT, and WAT, and into skeletal muscle to fuel elevated mitochondrial respiration, as this was needed to meet the high ATP demand created by futile SERCA pump activity.</p><p>We largely ruled out the involvement of thyroid hormones in promoting hypermetabolism in TcMAC21 mice. Under the basal state when mice were fed a standard chow, or HFD-fed mice housed at thermoneutrality, circulating T<sub>3</sub> levels were not different between groups despite the hyperactivity and hypermetabolism of TcMAC21 mice. Although serum T<sub>3</sub> levels were elevated in HFD-fed TcMAC21 housed at room temperature (RT) (22°C), the predicted T<sub>3</sub> effects were largely absent. It is known that T<sub>3</sub> negatively regulates the expression of SLN, as hypothyroidic mice have significantly upregulated SLN mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle compared to euthyroid mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaspari et al., 2020</xref>). Instead of the expected downregulation, SLN expression was dramatically elevated in the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice. Through its nuclear hormone receptor, T<sub>3</sub> regulates many metabolic genes in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>), and yet none of the well-known T<sub>3</sub>-regulated genes were upregulated in these tissues despite elevated T<sub>3</sub> levels. In addition, T<sub>3</sub> is a potent inducer of <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yau et al., 2019</xref>) and white adipose tissue beiging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johann et al., 2019</xref>), but <italic>Ucp1</italic> transcript levels were not upregulated in BAT or the white adipose tissue of TcMAC21 mice. This apparent T<sub>3</sub> resistance in HFD-fed TcMAC21 mice is likely a compensatory response to an already elevated body temperature and the hypermetabolism induced by SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity and heat generation in skeletal muscle. If T<sub>3</sub> further increased the metabolic rate of TcMAC21 mice, this would likely overtax the heat dissipation mechanism leading to hyperthermia and possible death.</p><p>By collapsing the proton motive force within the intermembrane space of mitochondria, UCP1-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling in BAT could raise body temperature and enhance EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chouchani et al., 2019</xref>). Although thermal imaging highlighted increased skin temperature around the interscapular BAT region of TcMAC21 mice, the thermal signal could be produced by local muscle around the interscapular area. Our gene expression, BAT transcriptomics, and functional data, however, do not support UCP1-mediated uncoupling in BAT as a probable mechanism for the hypermetabolism and elevated thermogenesis seen in TcMAC21 mice. Neither the expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> nor mitochondrial activity was consistently elevated in the BAT of TcMAC21 mice fed chow or HFD. Housing mice at a thermoneutral temperature would suppress BAT activity and beiging in iWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzalez-Hurtado et al., 2018</xref>), yet TcMAC21 mice housed at thermoneutrality for an extended period (&gt;2 months) retained elevated EE and lean body weight comparable to TcMAC21 mice housed at 22°C. Together, these data argue against BAT being a significant contributor to the thermogenesis seen in TcMAC21 mice.</p><p>Recent studies have also shown that creatine-driven futile substrate cycling and SERCA2b-mediated calcium cycling in beige fat can promote EE and thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kazak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of housing temperatures, none of the genes involved in creatine/phosphocreatine futile cycle (e.g. <italic>Slc6a8</italic>, <italic>Gatm</italic>, <italic>Gamt</italic>, <italic>Ckmt1</italic>, <italic>Ckmt2</italic>) or the SERCA2b-RyR2 pathway (<italic>Atp2a2</italic>, <italic>Ryr2</italic>) were upregulated in iWAT, suggesting that these pathways are likely not involved in the hypermetabolic phenotypes of TcMAC21. Promoting metabolic inefficiency in skeletal muscle by UCP1 or UCP3 overexpression can increase metabolic rate and prevent diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clapham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Son et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2000</xref>). In the skeletal muscle of TcMAC21 mice, <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Ucp3</italic> transcripts were not upregulated, suggesting that mitochondrial uncoupling by UCP1 or UCP3 is also unlikely to contribute to the observed lean and hypermetabolic phenotypes.</p><p>SLN plays a role in modulating body weight by promoting EE through its effects on the SERCA pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bombardier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacPherson et al., 2016</xref>). Binding of SLN to SERCA does not interfere with ATP hydrolysis of the pump, but reduces calcium transport into the SR lumen through a calcium ‘slippage’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sahoo et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, SLN promotes futile cycling of the SERCA pumps, ATP hydrolysis, and heat generation. Consistent with this model, mice lacking SLN are cold intolerant and gain more weight on an HFD due to reduced EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bombardier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacPherson et al., 2016</xref>); conversely, transgenic overexpression of SLN in skeletal muscle promotes a lean phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Under normal situations, SLN is mainly expressed in slow-twitch oxidative muscle tissues such as the soleus and diaphragm, with little expression in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle tissues such as the gastrocnemius and quadriceps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babu et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of hypothyroid mice, endogenous SLN is only markedly upregulated in oxidative muscle fibers (soleus and diaphragm) but not the large glycolytic muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaspari et al., 2020</xref>). It has been argued that in rodents the futile SERCA activity and EE occurring in soleus and diaphragm (both are small in size) is quantitatively insufficient to effect significant changes in body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell and Dicke, 2018</xref>). Notwithstanding the artificial overexpression of SLN in both fast-twitch glycolytic and slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>), it is unclear whether endogenous SLN can be substantially induced in large glycolytic muscle tissues such as the gastrocnemius and quadriceps under non-pathological conditions. Our data helps to resolve this issue. In TcMAC21 mice, endogenous SLN is markedly upregulated in a largely glycolytic muscle (gastrocnemius), suggesting that a mechanism indeed exists that can substantially elevate SLN transcript and protein in muscle fiber types that normally have low expression. Corroborating this is the observation that mitochondrial respiration is significantly elevated in most muscle types—gastrocnemius (fast-twitch), quadriceps (fast-twitch), plantaris (mixed), and extensor digitorum longus (mixed).</p><p>The huge ATP demand created by the futile SERCA pump activity appears to be the cause of upregulated protein expression of complexes I-IV, elevated mitochondrial respiration, and the assumption of an oxidative phenotype in muscle tissues that are normally glycolytic. This could also reflect skeletal muscle adaptation to increased physical activity level seen in TcMAC21 mice. This reprogramming of glycolytic muscle tissues into an oxidative phenotype is likely due to increased duration of calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>), leading to calcium-dependent activation of mitochondrial respiration and calcium-dependent signaling that drives increased production of OXPHOS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robb-Gaspers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jouaville et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tarasov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glancy et al., 2013</xref>). Since skeletal muscle makes up ~40% of the body’s weight and is a major energy consuming tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zurlo et al., 1990</xref>), elevated EE due to a combination of hyperactivity and futile SERCA pump activity—especially the big muscles (gastrocnemius and quadriceps)—will have substantial impact on total energy balance and body weight. As an added benefit, increased fuel consumption for non-shivering thermogenesis driven by the futile SERCA pump would channel lipid substrates into skeletal muscle for oxidation and prevent excess lipid accumulation in liver, BAT, and white adipose tissue, thus conferring an overall healthy metabolic profile with preserved systemic insulin sensitivity.</p><p>We do not know the relative contribution of hyperactivity and futile SERCA activity to the overall lean phenotype of the TcMAC21 mice. Future studies using a TcMAC21 mouse model specifically lacking SLN will help answer the important question of whether SLN indeed plays a causal role in promoting the lean phenotype we observed in TcMAC21 mice. Although TcMAC21 mice have increased voluntary physical activity, which can elevate metabolism, our data suggest that futile SERCA activity in skeletal muscle could be another potential driver of the hypermetabolic phenotype. Overexpression of SLN in skeletal muscle does not significantly alter voluntary physical activity at ambient RT or at thermoneutrality, yet the SLN transgenic mice consistently gained significantly less weight in response to high-fat feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bombardier et al., 2013</xref>). Further, SLN appears to be required for effective adiposity reduction in HFD-fed mice with access to a running wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gamu et al., 2015</xref>). Elevated locomotor activity in TcMAC21 mice, however, would likely amplify the effect of SLN-mediated uncoupling of the SERCA pumps, as muscle movement results in greater SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling. In cultured myotubes, caffeine-induced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR via the ryanodine receptor/channel (RYR1) would only activate calcium-dependent signaling in the presence, but not absence, of SLN; conversely, inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through RYR1 using dantrolene blocks calcium-dependent signaling only in SLN-expressing, but not SLN-deficient, myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurya et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling due to elevated physical activity would promote EE and also create a favorable cellular context to amplify the effects of SLN overexpression on uncoupling of the SERCA pumps. Accordingly, EE and the degree of leanness seen in TcMAC21 mice are significantly greater in magnitude than the SLN transgenic mice.</p><p>To fully harness SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity for energy dissipation and weight loss requires an understanding of how endogenous SLN expression is regulated, but the mechanism of which remains largely unknown. TcMAC21 mice offer critical insights into the switches that control SLN expression in skeletal muscle. Regardless of temperatures (ambient or thermoneutral), elevated <italic>Sln</italic> expression in TcMAC21 appeared to be in the ‘on’ position and could not be turned off. We exploited this information to zoom in on a defined set of mouse and Hsa21-derived transcripts—some of which are transcription factors (e.g. <italic>PKNOX1</italic>, <italic>ETS2</italic>), RNA binding proteins (e.g. <italic>Csde1</italic>), and epigenetic regulators (e.g. <italic>Kmt5a</italic>)—that remain significantly up- or down-regulated in skeletal muscle at both 22°C and 30°C, and show &lt;1% variability across the two temperatures. We presume that one or more of these genes could potentially be the sought after ‘switches’ of <italic>Sln</italic> expression. Additional studies are needed to identify such critical on/off switches. A recent study has suggested that the C-terminal cleavage fragment of TUG can upregulate <italic>Sln</italic> expression in the skeletal muscle when it enters the nucleus and forms a complex with PPAR-γ and PGC-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Habtemichael et al., 2021</xref>). However, this pathway is largely abrogated in mice fed an HFD; thus, we think this transcriptional mechanism is likely not involved in upregulating <italic>Sln</italic> expression in TcMAC21 mice fed an HFD.</p><p>Weight loss can be achieved by reducing caloric intake or promoting EE, and the latter can be physiologically accomplished by increasing physical activity (e.g. exercise) or through shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chouchani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roesler and Kazak, 2020</xref>). SLN-mediated non-shivering thermogenesis offers an attractive approach for promoting EE and weight loss: Expression of SLN is largely restricted to the striated muscle of all mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rowland et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vangheluwe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fajardo et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to BAT (~1.5% of body weight in young men) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leitner et al., 2017</xref>), the total mass of skeletal muscle (~40% of body weight) makes futile SERCA activity in this large tissue especially effective in energy dissipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of SLN in skeletal muscle does not appear to have adverse effects; rather, SLN transgenic mice have higher endurance capacity and improved muscle performance due to enhanced oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sopariwala et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our work provides further proof-of-concept that endogenous SLN-mediated uncoupling of SERCA pumps to enhance EE can potentially be harnessed for systemic metabolic health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model</title><p>The transchromosomic TcMAC21 (simply referred to as MAC21) mice carrying a near-complete human chromosome 21 were generated and genotyped as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kazuki et al., 2020</xref>).

High-throughput sequencing data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA877694.</p><p>We interrogated the effects of MAC21 genotype, tissue, and the statistical interaction between genotype and tissue on the transcriptome, further adjusting for confounders of gene assignment rate and mitochondrial mapping rate, using the limma voom approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Law et al., 2014</xref>). Given that four of the tissues were derived from the same animals, we used linear mixed effect using the animal ID as a random intercept. We accounted for multiple testing by controlling for the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate across all mouse genes (since human genes were highly enriched for being DEGs given these defined the genotype effect). As a secondary analysis, we modeled the effect of MAC21 genotype within each tissue (also adjusting for the same two sequencing-derived confounders as the full model) using linear regression (since there were no repeated measures within a tissue). Gene set enrichment analyses were performed using clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and accounted for the false discovery rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Respirometry of frozen tissue samples</title><p>Respirometry was conducted on frozen tissue samples to assay for mitochondrial activity as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, all tissues were dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C freezer for later analysis. Samples were thawed in MAS buffer (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM HEPES pH 7.4), finely minced with scissors, then homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was spun at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and immediately used for protein quantification by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225). Each well of the Seahorse microplate was loaded with 8 µg of homogenate protein for all tissue types, except for BAT and heart of which 4 µg was loaded. Each biological replicate is comprised of three technical replicates. Samples from all tissues were treated separately with NADH (1 mM) as a complex I substrate or Succinate (a complex II substrate, 5 mM) in the presence of rotenone (a complex I inhibitor, 2 µM), then with the inhibitors rotenone (2 µM) and antimycin A (4 µM), followed by TMPD (0.45 mM) and ascorbate (1 mM) to activate complex IV, and finally treated with azide (40 mM) to assess non-mitochondrial respiration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student’s t-tests or by repeated measures ANOVA. For two-way ANOVA, we performed Sidak’s post hoc tests. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>M.O. is CEO, employee, and shareholder of Trans Chromosomics, Inc which manages commercial use of the TcMAC21 mouse.

By doing various physiological and metabolic analyses of TcMAC21 mice including transcriptome analysis of both human and mouse genes in the TcMAC21, the authors showed that TcMAC21 mice are lean, hyperactive, and hypermetabolic, which is caused by an increased protein level of sarcolipin, a membrane protein regulating the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) in skeleton muscles, thus futile SERC activity. All experiments were carried out well with control and the results presented in the paper are very much convincing.</p><p>One of the weaknesses of the paper is that the authors did not provide any molecular insight on how the presence of human chromosome 21 in skeleton muscles increases the sarcolipin.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Based on the #3 reviewer's comments, it would be nice to soften the conclusion by adding some sentences and revising the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors clearly addressed my concerns as well as ones by the #2 reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am happy with the responses to my points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Sarver et al. revisions have improved the paper, however, the data and their responses are not satisfactory. Their interpretation of the data is too strong and the tone needs to be softened. Below are my remaining criticisms.</p><p>Dividing EE by lean mass</p><p>It is incorrect to normalize EE to lean mass if this parameter is different between groups (PMID: 20103710; PMID: 22205519). As noted clearly in PMID: 22205519, the problem of dividing by lean mass is that the division by lean mass overcompensates for the mass effect. The key conclusion of this paper is that ANCOVA or generalized linear modeling (PMID: 22205519 and references 37-39,43 within) is the most appropriate statistical approach to accommodate discrete (genotype) and continuous (body mass) traits, rather than using a simple division by BW or lean BW. The data where the authors show EE divided by lean mass is completely misleading. Only the ANCOVA should be shown.</p><p>Regarding EE by ANCOVA</p><p>The authors state in their response: &quot;we have now also included the ANCOVA data (Figure 2D-F and Figure 4D-F) where we used body weight as a covariate as recommended (PMID: 22205519). The results clearly indicate that the TcMAC21 mice have significantly higher EE compared to the euploid controls.&quot; I do not understand how the authors can say these results are clear. The ANCOVA of EE (FIGURE 2D, FIGURE 2F and FIGURE 7F) look like they lie on a common line in relation to lean mass. The ANCOVA in FIGURE 2E looks more promising, but it tracks very well with physical activity (i.e. the activity levels are strikingly higher in 2E compared to 2D and 2F). Regarding the ANCOVAs, I cannot find any easily seen statistics that were undertaken to indicate that these effects that are shown indicate an increase in EE that is independent of body composition changes. I do not see any statistics reported for the ANCOVA in the methods or in the figure legends. The word &quot;ANCOVA&quot; appears 4 times in the paper: (1) Figure 2 legend; (2) Figure 4 legend; (3) Fig7 legend; (4) Methods (indirect calorimetry section). So, how can the authors assert that &quot;we have now also included the ANCOVA data (Figure 2D-F and Figure 4D-F) where we used body weight as a covariate as recommended (PMID: 22205519). The results clearly indicate that the TcMAC21 mice have significantly higher EE compared to the euploid controls&quot;?</p><p>Regarding mechanistic claims about SERCA-based calcium cycling</p><p>The tone about SERCA-based calcium cycling being causal for any metabolic phenotype needs to be toned down substantially. As, the authors note, they cannot determine if their proposed hypermetabolism is arising from movement or SERCA, but considering these associative data and the complete lack of direct analysis of SERCA activity in this paper, it is imperative that the authors tone down their claims about futile calcium cycling. For example, they make strong claims such as: (1) &quot;Unexpectedly, we discovered that TcMAC21 mice have all the hallmarks of hypermetabolism, driven by elevated mitochondrial respiration and futile sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump activity in the skeletal muscle.&quot; (2) &quot;All together, these data suggest that SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity in skeletal muscle is likely the dominant driver underlying the hypermetabolism phenotypes seen in TcMAC21 mice&quot;. (3) &quot;Having established that SLN-mediated futile SERCA activity underlies hypermetabolism in TcMAC21 mice….&quot;. These statements are quite strong. However, there is no data that directly measures futile SERCA activity and there is no data that link SERCA-mediated calcium cycling to the metabolic effects of TcMAC21 mice. Other than SLN expression, there is no evidence that any futile thermogenic cycle is involved. The authors mention in the responses that &quot;ATP-consuming futile activity of the SERCA pump is presumably happening in resting muscle&quot; but they provide no causal evidence other than mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, there is clear evidence that TcMAC21 mice are more physically active and that the changes in ANCOVA-based EE track well with movement (see above). There is also indications that there is a higher degree of respiratory chain levels, which could be secondary to elevated physical activity – akin to exercise training. This is in contrast to the differences in EE between TcMAC21 mice and controls, where the effect size is minimized at thermoneutrality, even though a major tenet is that SLN expression is high in a temp-independent manner.</p><p>Why not anesthetize mice and measure EE to determine if physical activity is driving the increased metabolic rate?</p><p>Food intake measurements are not clear</p><p>Cumulative food intake would be more informative. The food intake data is plotted per day. How was this measured? For example, was some random day chosen to quantify food consumption, or was the food consumption quantified over the duration of the study and then normalized by the duration to get a daily average? If the latter, then the authors are correct and this could support their argument that food intake is not contributing to the phenotype. If the former, this is questionable of whether the particular day they chose to measure was representative of the entire duration of the intervention.</p><p>EE does not seem to be higher at TN</p><p>The authors note that &quot;TcMAC21 mice still have significantly higher EE compared to euploid controls when housed at thermoneutrality.&quot; First, there are no statistics that I can find in the paper that support the authors' claim. Second, the ANCOVA in FIGURE 7F looks like the regression lines of the EE between the two groups lie on a common line in relation to lean mass. Thus, the authors' claim &quot;the TcMAC21 mice never reduce their EE to the level of euploid controls when housed at thermoneutrality&quot; does not appear correct. Moreover, EE should not be plotted as a histogram, which is what the authors have done in FIGURE 7F to conduct their stats. The statistics should be a 2-way ANOVA for 7F (although beware as the data is improperly normalized by lean mass).</p><p>GTT</p><p>In my first review, I mentioned that GTT should be normalized to lean mass, since that is very different between TcMAC21 mice and controls. Guidelines have been written about this (PMID: 29143855). However, the authors responded by saying that: &quot;The dose of glucose injection in GTT based on mouse weight is widely and extensively practiced across the metabolic community.&quot; I am bewildered by the fact that the authors think that dividing EE by lean mass is acceptable, but then don't think normalizing for lean mass for GTT is appropriate. The response to the ITT being better in TcMAC21, despite getting less of a dose, is a decent argument that the authors provide. Unfortunately, the basal blood glucose levels of the ITT in FIGURE 3K were different to begin with. The authors could normalized the baseline to 100%. This will decrease the difference, but maybe statistical significance can still be reached. Or you could use AUC to correct for baseline differences.</p><p>The authors say they &quot;sought to uncover the physiological mechanisms responsible for TcMAC21 resistance to weight gain…&quot;. The authors mention that their data strongly support hypermetabolism being the cause of the lean phenotype seen in TcMAC21 mice. However, this has not really been shown. The massive reductions in lean mass have erroneously made it seem like EE is elevated, and the ANCOVAs do not look very promising by eye, but importantly there is no statistical test done on the ANCOVA that I could find. The p value should be placed on the graph to make it clear. In any case, if the authors want to uncover the physiological mechanisms responsible for TcMAC21 resistance to weight gain, EE needs to be measured PRIOR to a change in body composition. If hypermetabolism (i.e. physical activity) is causal, then it should precede the changes in body weight/composition that occur later in life. The authors note in their paper that TcMAC21 mice are born at the same weight as their euploid littermates, but by 3 months of age weigh significantly less. Is there a time-window where TcMAC21 mice can be compared to controls, when their weights are identical? If EE is higher at that early time, this would be strong evidence that hypermetabolism drives the phenotypes associated after weights have diverged.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86023.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Fiber types need to be shown across the genotypes for the muscles examined.</p></disp-quote><p>In the qPCR data as shown in Figure 6C, we have profiled many genes associated with slow- and fast-twitched muscle fibers in gastrocnemius, and little if any changes were noted.

However, we did not perform the same qPCR analyses for all the other muscle types we isolated (EDL, quadriceps, plantaris, soleus, and tongue).

The TcMAC21 mice have persistent uncoupling of the SERCA pumps due to chronic overexpression of SLN. However, the mice also are hyperactive in both light and dark cycle, though the hyperactivity is much more pronounced in the dark cycle. Since both SERCA pump uncoupling and hyperactivity are both present at all times of the day, it is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of each to the hypermetabolic phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many corrections to the description of Ca handling are required, see above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed all the issues raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C: Correct spelling: &quot;Ca Handling&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this typo in Figure 6C.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Sarver et al. revisions have improved the paper, however, the data and their responses are not satisfactory.

We have provided ANCOVA analyses, including the statistics, in the revision. In our study, EE normalized to lean mass or presented by ANCOVA gives the same results, namely that the TcMAC21 mice have significantly higher energy expenditure. For the sake of transparency and thoroughness, we provided both types of data for the reader to see, as both types of analyses yielded the same results. The 24 hr tracing allows readers to appreciate that TcMAC21 mice have higher EE across the entire circadian cycle (light and dark), as well as across three different metabolic states (ad libitum fed, fasting, refeeding). Even the reviewer had specifically requested that we show the 24 tracing for the thermoneutral data (Figure 7) in the previous round of review. For this reason, we would like to keep all the figure panels. However, to acknowledge the important point raised by the reviewer, we have now clearly stated in the result section (in the revision) that EE normalized to lean mass can result in an overestimation and that ANCOVA results are included to further support our observations that TcMAC21 mice have significantly higher energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding EE by ANCOVA</p><p>The authors state in their response: &quot;we have now also included the ANCOVA data (Figure 2D-F and Figure 4D-F) where we used body weight as a covariate as recommended (PMID: 22205519).

We have now included the ANCOVA statistic in Figure 2D, Figure 4D, and Figure 7F, calculated based on the method outlined in the article (PMID: 22205519, Supplementary Note 4). Figure 2D and 2F show diverging regression lines, indicating that as body weight increases there will be no point at which the EE of TcMAC21 mice is not higher than their euploid controls. As exemplified in Figure 1 and 2 of the article (PMID: 22205519), the TcMAC21 mice fit the category where the animals have higher energy expenditure compared to control mice. Even a modest increase in EE can result in significant weight loss over time. Because EE is continuously higher in TcMAC21 relative to euploid controls (regardless of the circadian cycle and metabolic states), this persistently higher EE contributes to the lean phenotype we observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding mechanistic claims about SERCA-based calcium cycling</p><p>The tone about SERCA-based calcium cycling being causal for any metabolic phenotype needs to be toned down substantially.

In our previous revision (based on the comments by reviewer 2), we did indicate that we do not know the relative contribution of elevated metabolism vs. increased physical activity to the overall lean phenotype of TcMAC21 mice. However, some of our evidence suggest that SLN-mediated futile cycling, at least in part, drives the hypermetabolism phenotype we observed; for example, in Figure 6O-Q, we show that mitochondrial respiration is significantly elevated in several different muscle fiber types, including quadriceps, EDL, gastrocnemius, and plantaris. Because SLN overexpression will result in increased ATP utilization (based on published studies referenced in our manuscript), this presumably necessitates an increase in mitochondrial respiration in the skeletal muscle to meet the demand created by the SLN-mediated futile SERCA pump activity. We do not know whether this reflects skeletal muscle adaptation to increased physical activity. As a future follow up experiment, we agree that anesthetizing the mice and measuring EE would be helpful in teasing out the contribution of SLN-overexpression on the hypermetabolic phenotype of TcMAC21 mice. However, the suggested experiment can be technically challenging to perform because the mice need to be housed in the metabolic cage (CLAMS) and at the same time be subjected to prolonged anesthesia (which is known to depress respiration, heart rate, and metabolism).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Food intake measurements are not clear</p><p>Cumulative food intake would be more informative. The food intake data is plotted per day. How was this measured? For example, was some random day chosen to quantify food consumption, or was the food consumption quantified over the duration of the study and then normalized by the duration to get a daily average? If the latter, then the authors are correct and this could support their argument that food intake is not contributing to the phenotype. If the former, this is questionable of whether the particular day they chose to measure was representative of the entire duration of the intervention.</p></disp-quote><p>Food intake was measured while the mice were in the CLAMS (comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system). Food intake was measured alongside VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub>, RER, EE, and activity. The general process can be found in the Methods section under indirect calorimetry. Briefly, data were collected for three days to confirm mice were acclimatized to the calorimetry chambers (indicated by stable body weights, food intakes, and diurnal metabolic patterns), and data were analyzed from the subsequent three days. Data from mice were collected with ad libitum access to food, throughout the fasting process, and in response to refeeding. It is more common for mice to under eat than over eat while in the CLAMS chambers. Therefore, it is less likely that the food intake assessment grossly overestimated the food intake levels of TcMAC21 mice. For the sake of transparency, we provided the food intake data we collected for 6 consecutive days in the CLAMS. In the chow-fed group, the TcMAC21 mice tended to eat a bit more than the euploid controls. For the high-fat group, except day 1 where TcMAC21 eat a little less than euploid controls, the rest of the days the TcMA21 mice eat either a similar amount or significantly more (Day 6, refeeding after a 24 fast). Even though TcMAC21 mice weigh substantially less than the euploid controls, they eat as much as the control mice. This data is consistent with the notion that TcMAC21 mice have significantly higher energy expenditure and therefore need to increase caloric intake to fuel the higher energy metabolism.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Food intake (kcal/day)</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chow-fed</td><td align="left" valign="top">Euploid</td><td align="left" valign="top">TcMAC21</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>p-</italic>value</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 1</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.93±1.75</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.39±1.07</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.52</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 2</td><td align="left" valign="top">11.95±2.41</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.16±1.47</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 3</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.20±2.60</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.32±1.68</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 4</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.74±2.56</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.41±2.26</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.57</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 5 (fasted)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0</td><td align="left" valign="top">0</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 6 (Refed)</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.55±2.97</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.32±1.46</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.83</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Food intake (kcal/day)</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">HFD-fed</td><td align="left" valign="top">Euploid</td><td align="left" valign="top">TcMAC21</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>p-</italic>value</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 1</td><td align="left" valign="top">15.52±3.68</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.00±1.71</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 2</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.30±5.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.0±2.22</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 3</td><td align="left" valign="top">14.67±5.90</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.80±2.60</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 4</td><td align="left" valign="top">15.28±3.40</td><td align="left" valign="top">16.15±2.48</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 5 (fasted)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0</td><td align="left" valign="top">0</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Day 6 (Refed)</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.04±2.46</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.74±2.30</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.001</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EE does not seem to be higher at TN</p><p>The authors note that &quot;TcMAC21 mice still have significantly higher EE compared to euploid controls when housed at thermoneutrality.&quot; First, there are no statistics that I can find in the paper that support the authors' claim.

Thus, the authors' claim &quot;the TcMAC21 mice never reduce their EE to the level of euploid controls when housed at thermoneutrality&quot; does not appear correct. Moreover, EE should not be plotted as a histogram, which is what the authors have done in FIGURE 7F to conduct their stats. The statistics should be a 2-way ANOVA for 7F (although beware as the data is improperly normalized by lean mass).</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics for Figure 7F (the bar graphs) were calculated using 2-way ANOVA. We included this information in the figure legend. We have also included the ANCOVA statistics in Figure 7F. The ANCOVA of Figure 7F shows separated and divergent regression lines. Although TcMAC21 mice do still appear to have a higher EE at thermoneutrality relative to euploid controls, because of the small sample size, the <italic>P</italic>-value (0.069) fell short of reaching statistical significance. We have now revised our manuscript text accordingly. Much of the work was carried out during the first two years of the pandemic where we had to navigate many restrictions imposed on mouse studies. We acknowledge that the thermoneutral study was underpowered and this is clearly a limitation. We did the best we could in light of the major challenges of breeding this new mouse line. We can only use the females for breeding as the males are infertile (similar to other Down Syndrome mouse models). As stated in Supplementary note 5 of the article (PMID: 22205519) “…virtually every study of energy balance yet performed, including all by our own groups, have probably been underpowered to detect subtle effects of the treatment on energy balance.”. The concluding paragraph in the last page of the Supplementary note of the article (PMID: 22205519) also stated: “…we note that referees and editors also need to be realistic in reviewing papers not to insist on completely unrealistic power for this type of analysis. Otherwise nothing will be published.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>GTT</p><p>In my first review, I mentioned that GTT should be normalized to lean mass, since that is very different between TcMAC21 mice and controls. Guidelines have been written about this (PMID: 29143855). However, the authors responded by saying that: &quot;The dose of glucose injection in GTT based on mouse weight is widely and extensively practiced across the metabolic community.&quot; I am bewildered by the fact that the authors think that dividing EE by lean mass is acceptable, but then don't think normalizing for lean mass for GTT is appropriate. The response to the ITT being better in TcMAC21, despite getting less of a dose, is a decent argument that the authors provide. Unfortunately, the basal blood glucose levels of the ITT in FIGURE 3K were different to begin with. The authors could normalized the baseline to 100%. This will decrease the difference, but maybe statistical significance can still be reached. Or you could use AUC to correct for baseline differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Since muscle mass scales with body weight, a heavier mouse will have more lean mass. A quick survey of the recent literature (PMID: 29724723, PMID: 33571454, PMID: 22961109, PMID: 36329217, PMID: 28844881, PMID: 35995995, PMID: 35677645, PMID: 30605666, PMID: 34819664, PMID: 29466739, PMID: 33691105, PMID: 31875646) shows a number of studies that have used glucose dose based on body weight and not lean mass even though there are significant differences (in some cases large differences) in body weight, and in some of these studies the lean mass was also significantly different. Although not an exhaustive search, the authors have been unable to find a study where the dose of glucose injected (in GTT) is based on lean mass. The dose of glucose injected (for GTT) based on body weight likely reflects the fact that the insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Adipose-specific knockout of GLUT4 actually has similar metabolic phenotypes as the skeletal muscle-specific knockout of GLUT4 (PMID: 12788932), thus underscoring the relative importance of insulin-regulated glucose uptake in adipose tissue vs. skeletal muscle. Therefore, it provides a rationale to give a dose of glucose based on body weight (accounting for glucose uptake in both lean and fat mass). It is true that the basal blood glucose does not start at the exact same place as represented in the ITT graph of Figure 3K, but this is also not significantly different between genotype. As requested, we included the AUC graph as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. The AUC data is consistent with the ITT tracing, indicating greater insulin sensitivity in TcMAC21 mice relative to euploid controls.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86023-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For insulin sensitivity, we have multiple independent lines of evidence in addition to the GTT data: (1) The ITT data that directly test for insulin action. Even though TcMAC21 received a much smaller dose of insulin (dose based on body weight), glucose clearance was significantly greater in TcMAC21 mice (Fig, 3K). (2) Overnight fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were significantly lower in TcMAC21 mice (Figure 3G). (3) HOMA-IR (insulin resistant index) was significantly lower in TcMAC21 mice (Figure 3H). (4) In the refeeding period following an overnight fast, the TcMAC21 mice blood glucose rose to the same level as the euploid control (Figure 3L), but the rise in insulin levels in response to refeeding was substantially lower in TcMAC21 mice. This indicates that a much lower amount of insulin is required for TcMAC21 to handle the rise in blood glucose after refeeding. Altogether, these data provide strong support that TcMAC21 mice are indeed more insulin sensitive compared to euploid controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors say they &quot;sought to uncover the physiological mechanisms responsible for TcMAC21 resistance to weight gain…&quot;. The authors mention that their data strongly support hypermetabolism being the cause of the lean phenotype seen in TcMAC21 mice. However, this has not really been shown. The massive reductions in lean mass have erroneously made it seem like EE is elevated, and the ANCOVAs do not look very promising by eye, but importantly there is no statistical test done on the ANCOVA that I could find. The p value should be placed on the graph to make it clear. In any case, if the authors want to uncover the physiological mechanisms responsible for TcMAC21 resistance to weight gain, EE needs to be measured PRIOR to a change in body composition. If hypermetabolism (i.e. physical activity) is causal, then it should precede the changes in body weight/composition that occur later in life. The authors note in their paper that TcMAC21 mice are born at the same weight as their euploid littermates, but by 3 months of age weigh significantly less. Is there a time-window where TcMAC21 mice can be compared to controls, when their weights are identical? If EE is higher at that early time, this would be strong evidence that hypermetabolism drives the phenotypes associated after weights have diverged.</p></disp-quote><p>There was no “massive reductions in lean mass…” in TcMAC21 mice. This would constitute a pathological condition (aging-associated sarcopenia, injury-associated muscle atrophy, etc). The TcMAC21 mice weigh a lot less. Since skeletal muscle mass scales with body weight, the muscle mass of TcMAC21 mice scale appropriately with their lean body weight, as highlighted by the % lean mass data (Figure 2B and 3A). In fact, the relative lean mass (% of body weight) was higher in HFD-fed TcMAC21 mice relative to euploid controls (Figure 3B). Similarly, a person that weighs 300 pounds will have more muscle mass than someone that weighs 150 pounds; in each case, the muscle mass scales accordingly in order to support different amounts of body weight.</p><p>We have now included the ANCOVA statistics in Figure 2, 4 and 7. Except for the thermoneutral data that fell short of reaching statistical significance (due to small sample size), all the other ANCOVA data were highly significant.</p><p>We agree that finding a time in which the body weights of TcMAC21 and euploid control mice are equal would be hugely beneficial to uncover more about the hypermetabolism of the TcMAC21mice. Unfortunately, while fed a standard chow or a high-fat diet there is no time window beyond P1 that TcMAC21 mice weigh the same as their euploid littermates. Assessing EE of young pups (while they are still suckling) is technically challenging to conduct. The EE data needs to be collected in a specialized metabolic cage where the animal is individually housed and this is not feasible when the pups are still suckling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
