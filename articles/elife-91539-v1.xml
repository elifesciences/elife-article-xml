We have investigated this carefully and found several copy-and-paste errors that occurred during data organization and resulted in these duplicates. To help understand how this type of mistake happened, we made a summary of our standard workflow for data collection and analysis of miniature synaptic responses.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cells are recorded using Clampex on PC computers. Files generated in Clampex are opened in Clampfit to be exported into an abf integer format (Clampex generates them in a floating-point format) that is compatible with our mini analysis software by Synaptosoft.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Converted abf files are opened in Mini Analysis. Events are selected based on their kinetic properties with a minimum threshold amplitude set in the program.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Processed miniature response data are copy and pasted into Excel (Windows XP edition) for further analysis. The average amplitude and frequency of each cell are calculated in Excel. From here the individual cells are transferred into a summary sheet for the particular experiment sets.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Once an experimental set is processed in excel, the data is then transferred into Prism (MacOS) to compile preliminary figures and statistical analysis.</p></list-item></list><p>Large data sets including multiple independent biological replicates are compiled into prism sheets. Data is then pooled for figure generation, Individual columns per experimental group must be copied into a single column for this purpose.</p><p>We use SigmaPlot combined with Adobe Illustrator for generating publication-quality figures. To generate source data files for final figure generation in SigmaPlot, Prism compilations are copied into Excel (MacOS). We use the ‘sort’ function in Excel to efficiently get rid of the empty spreadsheet cells between data points.</p><p>Figures made in SigmaPlot are finalized in Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>We realize that the data processing steps we used for this type of data – some of which are further complicated since data collection is done on PCs and analyses are done on Mac computers - are not ideal and may have contributed to the copy-and-paste errors in this publication. We take full responsibility for the errors we made. They have all been corrected in the article. The conclusions of the study are unaffected by the correction.</p><p>The specific errors and corrections are listed below.</p><p>In Figure 1B, three data points in the postsynaptic RARα KO DMSO group (ctrl for RA treatment) were mistakenly copied from the postsynaptic RARα KO DMSO group for Figre 1C (ctrl for CNQX treatment) during data organization. We have taken out the three data sets from this group in the corrected Figure 1B.</p><p>The corrected Figure 1 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91539-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original incorrect Figure 1 is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91539-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The corrected legend for Figure 1 should now read:</p><p><bold>Figure 1.

The amplitude data were not affected. We have replaced the incorrected dataset with the correct ones.</p><p>A second mistake is in Figure 3E and 3F, WT (uninfected) DMSO and treatment groups for both RA and CNQX experiment have mistakenly included a subset of data for the same group in 3 C. This was caused by copying the data from the wrong tab of the EXCEL files as the labels for the columns were identical on these different tabs of sheets (same experimental manipulations in different mouse lines). We have corrected this error by taking out the wrong set and replaced with the correct set that was left out from the original files.</p><p>A third mistake is in Figure 3F postsynaptic TrkB KO CNQX treated group, four data points were copy and pasted twice (duplication error) and these four duplicates have now been removed.</p><p>The corrected Figure 3 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91539-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original incorrect Figure 3 is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91539-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The corrected legend for Figure 3 should now read:</p><p><bold>Figure 3.
