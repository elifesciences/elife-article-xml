of blindness and a considerable health burden during aging but effective therapeutic or preventive strategies have not so far become readily available. Here, we show in mouse models that signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT protects photoreceptor cells against both light-induced and inherited retinal degeneration. Upon light damage, photoreceptor cells upregulate Kit ligand (KITL) and activate KIT signaling, which in turn induces nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NRF2 and stimulates the expression of the antioxidant gene <italic>Hmox1</italic>. Conversely, a viable <italic>Kit</italic> mutation promotes light-induced photoreceptor damage, which is reversed by experimental expression of <italic>Hmox1</italic>. Furthermore, overexpression of KITL from a viral AAV8 vector prevents photoreceptor cell death and partially restores retinal function after light damage or in genetic model<bold>s</bold> of human retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, application of KITL may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for prevention or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endogenous neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinase receptor</kwd><kwd>stem cell factor</kwd><kwd>retinitis pigmentosa</kwd><kwd>antioxidative</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81800838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Huirong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate a cell-autonomous role of the KIT ligand/KIT signaling pathway in protecting retinal photoreceptor cells from environmentally or genetically caused degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal degeneration due to photoreceptor loss is a major threat to human health as progressive vision loss severely interferes with a person’s daily activities. Such photoreceptor cell loss is common to a number of degenerative eye disorders including cone dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and the highly prevalent age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wright et al., 2010</xref>). Each of these disorders is influenced, to various degrees, by mutations in a number of distinct genes. RP, for instance, has been associated with mutations in about 80 genes and can be inherited as an autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, or X-linked trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2018</xref>). It is characterized initially by degeneration of rod photoreceptors, followed by a loss of cone photoreceptors and of the photoreceptor-trophic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Consequently, patients suffer from progressive night blindness, tunnel vision and, rarely, may become totally blind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dias et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Currently, one of the major challenges for the field of retinal degenerative diseases is to provide strategies to prevent or delay the onset of photoreceptor cell loss. Several approaches are currently under investigation to treat vision loss in patients suffering from retinal degenerations, including retinal prostheses implants, stem cell transplants and gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gagliardi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scholl et al., 2016</xref>). Although gene therapy has recently been approved for a specific causative mutation (RPE65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2017</xref>), there are still no broadly applicable and efficacious treatments available to prevent or cure vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration. Alternatively, photoreceptor cell death could be prevented by strengthening endogenous prosurvival mechanisms or by directly blocking cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pardue and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trifunović et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, several neuroprotective factors have been identified based on results obtained with transgenic and conditional knockout animals and pharmacological treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2009</xref>). They include ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF), all of which might potentially be used to treat photoreceptor degeneration in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Río et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). Their clinical application, however, is hampered by relatively short half-lives, systemic side effects and reduced efficacy, and none are commercially available for clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pardue and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scholl et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to identify additional factors that are capable of improving photoreceptor survival and that may have pharmacokinetic properties that differ from those already studied.</p><p>Retinal degeneration, regardless of whether it is due to intrinsic genetic or extrinsic environmental conditions, is normally associated with an induction of damaging effector molecules. As a corollary of damage, the eye may respond with the induction of damage-limiting, endogenous neuroprotective factors such as the ones mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pearson and Ali, 2018</xref>). This fact prompted us to search for additional neuroprotective factors after experimental light damage (LD). It is known that limited light stress activates the FGF2/gp130 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2009</xref>) and that prolonged exposure to light upregulates CNTF and FGF2, although usually at levels too low to protect against retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaVail et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 1998</xref>). That LD is a valid strategy to identify novel retinoprotective factors is underscored by the role excessive light may play in worsening genetically influenced retinal degenerations such as AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Organisciak and Vaughan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To discover novel retinoprotective factors, we applied an RNA-seq analysis to mouse neural retinas after prolonged LD. This approach confirmed the induction of a number of genes previously found to be altered during LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hadziahmetovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rattner and Nathans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutar et al., 2015</xref>) and identified a number of novel genes not previously recognized in this context. One of them is <italic>Kit ligand</italic> (<italic>Kitl</italic>) whose protein product, KITL (also known as stem cell factor, SCF, or mast cell growth factor, MGF), stimulates an important signaling pathway by interacting with its receptor, KIT (also known as the proto-oncogene c-KIT) and promotes cell survival, migration and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou and Pavan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Hou, 2018</xref>). KIT is a multi-domain transmembrane tyrosine kinase expressed in a variety of cell types including melanocytes, germ cells and cells of the hematopoietic lineage, and is required for their normal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blume-Jensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comazzetto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuzawa et al., 2007</xref>). Interaction of KIT with its ligand leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation which in turn activates the MAPK pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3’-kinase (PI3K), JAK/STAT and SRC family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou and Pavan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>). In mice, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Kit</italic> cause severe anemia, pigmentation abnormalities, sterility, mast cell deficits, spatial learning memory deficits and defects in peripheral nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zsebo et al., 1990</xref>). Nevertheless, although KIT has been found to be expressed in retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2019</xref>), its functional role in the adult retina is still unknown.</p><p>Here, we find that mice homozygous for the <italic>Kit<sup>Wps</sup></italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2010</xref>) show an exacerbated photoreceptor degeneration and that overexpression of KITL can prevent photoreceptor cell death in light-damaged mice. Furthermore, we show that KIT signaling stimulates the expression of <italic>Hmox1</italic> in an NRF2-dependent manner and that experimental expression of <italic>Hmox1</italic> in <italic>Kit<sup>Wps</sup></italic> homozygotes prevents light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of KITL prevents photoreceptor cell death and partially rescues the retinal dysfunction in mouse genetic models of retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, our findings suggest a mechanism by which KITL/KIT signaling contributes to protection of photoreceptor cells from degeneration and which may potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies in retinal degenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light damage upregulates endogenous KITL in photoreceptor cells</title><p>Previous results have shown that light stress induces endogenous factors in the eye that are capable of protecting photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we used LD in light sensitive BALB/c albino mice to search for such inducible factors. Retinal damage is usually accompanied by reactive gliosis, characterized by the accumulation of filamentous proteins such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and formation of a glial scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyer and Cepko, 2000</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, after 1 day of continuous exposure (15,000 Lux), BALB/c neural retinas showed no obvious signs of retinal degeneration, but increased expression of GFAP. After three days of continuous exposure, however, there was significant retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A to C</xref>). Therefore, we used the 1-day exposure to identify novel protective genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and longer exposures to test for effects on late-stage damage. Whole neural retinas were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. The RNA-seq data showed a large number of genes whose expression was significantly changed (<italic>p</italic> adjust value &lt;0.01 and fold change &gt;2) in the LD-treated neural retinas compared with the non-treated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These genes included known light-inducible ones such as <italic>Gfap, Edn2, Fgf2, Ccl3</italic> and <italic>Ccl12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and hence supported the validity of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hadziahmetovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rattner and Nathans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rutar et al., 2015</xref>). A KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis identified the MAPK pathway among the top 20 altered signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with increased expression, for instance, of the genes encoding LIF, KITL and NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). RT-PCR confirmed their differential expression identified by the RNA-seq analysis. In particular, <italic>Kitl</italic> expression was significantly increased in the neural retina after LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because KIT signaling plays vital roles in a variety of cell types, we focused on this pathway in the retina. Quantitation of western blot bands showed that both mature transmembrane and cleaved soluble forms of KITL (45 and 19 kDa, respectively) were increased (m-KITL, 2.4 ± 0.9 fold; s-KITL, 4.5 ± 1.6 fold; n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Phosphorylated KIT (indicative of activated KIT), although not total KIT, was also increased (3.14 ± 0.94, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Immunostaining showed that upregulation of KITL was predominantly seen in photoreceptor inner segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggest that following prolonged light exposure, upregulation of KITL leads to activation of KIT signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Light damage induces increased expression of KITL and activation of KIT in mouse retina.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of time frame and analysis of light damage (LD).

First, KIT is expressed in mouse retina, including in its photoreceptor cells, and its activation leads to stimulation of the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways. Second, photoreceptor cells respond to prolonged high-level light exposure by upregulating their endogenous KITL expression, which activates KIT signaling in these cells. Third, when KITL is experimentally overexpressed in <italic>Kit<sup>+/+</sup></italic> retina, it alleviates the effects of LD. Fourth, when KIT signaling is genetically impaired, photoreceptor cells are more susceptible to LD, and this enhanced susceptibility cannot be overcome by additional experimental upregulation of KITL. Fifth, experimental expression of HMOX1 in photoreceptor cells in vivo partially protects these cells against light damage even when their KIT signaling pathway is impaired. Sixth, experimental overexpression of KITL also partially protects against photoreceptor cell loss in <italic>Kit<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice harboring mutations in <italic>Pde6b</italic>, the mouse homolog of the human RP gene, whose mutations are associated with retinal degeneration in both mice and humans.</p><p>Given these findings, the use of KITL and activation of KIT signaling may add to the arsenal of endogenous pathways that may be considered clinically for photoreceptor protection during retinal degeneration. Indeed, in contrast to other strategies such as stem cell therapies, optogenetics and retinal prostheses, which all face major technical and financial investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scholl et al., 2016</xref>), the application of endogenous neuroprotective factors would seem to provide a more straightforward therapeutic avenue, with the added benefit that it may work regardless of the actual pathogenetic mechanism underlying photoreceptor degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pardue and Allen, 2018</xref>). AAV-mediated expression of neurotrophic factors or antioxidant genes such as RdCVF and NRF2 has indeed proved beneficial in protecting photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leveillard and Sahel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2017</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>), and similar strategies using KIT activation may prove equally valuable.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated, however, that Kit signaling can have both beneficial and deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>). On the one hand, KIT is needed for cell development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blume-Jensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wen et al., 2010</xref>), but on the other hand, excessive KIT signaling, associated, for instance, with activating <italic>KIT</italic> mutations, may also lead to formation of tumors, in particular gastrointestinal stromal tumors, adult acute myeloid leukemia, and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>). Hence, activation of KIT signaling should be used with caution in clinical settings. Nevertheless, local expression of KITL following intraocular injection of recombinant AAV might considerably reduce potential deleterious effects because gene expression is locally restricted and transfer of protein to other tissues is effectively blocked by the blood retinal barrier. In addition, the optimal choice of virus promoters and doses reduces the risk of virus-induced retinal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, before any further use of KITL in a clinical setting is entertained, it is paramount to establish the precise pathway of its action in the retina.</p><p>In the current paper we have so far shown that it is KITL activation in photoreceptor cells themselves, rather than in RPE cells or potentially other retinal cells, that has protective effects on retinal degeneration, and that it is cell-autonomous KITL action that protects photoreceptor cells against degeneration. Nevertheless, other cell types also express KIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Too et al., 2017</xref>). Among them are Müller glial cells, which have been reported to participate in reactive gliosis and regulate retinal repair during retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Too et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman, 2014</xref>). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that cells such as Müller glial cells indirectly help to mediate KITL action on photoreceptor cells. Such an indirect, non-cell autonomous effect of a cellular receptor, EDNRB (the receptor for endothelin-3), has been observed, for instance, in neural crest-derived melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have also shown that the pathway downstream of KIT involves a cytoplasm-to-nuclear shift of the transcription factor NRF2, which is likely mediated by KIT signaling-dependent activation of AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, KIT signaling leads to increased expression of HMOX1 in an NRF2-dependent way. The involvement of HMOX1 seems particularly interesting as it can reduce oxidative stress by breaking down heme and reducing molecular oxygen and oxygen radicals in the heme oxygenase reaction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otterbein et al., 2016</xref>). Photoreceptor cells have a rich complement of mitochondria to accommodate their high metabolic rate and are more sensitive to oxidative stress than many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campochiaro and Mir, 2018</xref>). The development of AMD, for instance, is tightly linked to oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>), and antioxidant therapy can delay cell loss in retinal degenerative diseases and lead to reduced photoreceptor cell death in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haruta et al., 2009</xref>). Oxidative stress has also been observed in many other neurodegenerative conditions, including LIRD, and antioxidant treatment is useful in their prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). The induction of <italic>Hmox1</italic> following LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hadziahmetovic et al., 2012</xref>) can therefore be seen as a homeostatic mechanism operating in photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that in our model, KITL overexpression or isolated overexpression of HMOX1 did not lead to full protection against LD. Hence, the KITL-KIT-NRF2-HMOX1 axis that we here identified is likely only one among many pathways involved in protection of photoreceptor cells against LD.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide strong evidence for KIT signaling in protecting photoreceptor cells against light-induced retinal damage as well as against inherited forms of retinal degeneration. We believe that these findings justify a detailed exploration of how this signaling pathway could be harnessed pharmacologically for prevention or delay of progressive photoreceptor cell and vision loss as seen in AMD, RP and other retinal degenerations. Hence, the findings have implications not only for our understanding of the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in retinal degeneration in general but also as a potential treatment for photoreceptor loss in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and histology</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines of the Wenzhou Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Permit Number: WZMCOPT-090316).

response to photoreceptor degeneration, upstream of NRF2/HMOX1. The fact that it is providing protection to light damage makes it clinically relevant and this should be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KIT ligand protects against both light-induced and genetic photoreceptor degeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers appreciated the discovery that activation of the <italic>Kitl</italic>/SCF pathway is an early stress response to photoreceptor degeneration, upstream of NRF2/HMOX1, and that it is providing protection to light damage. The clinical relevant of this observation is therefore very high.</p><p>However, the reviewers noticed a number of important points that must be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication:</p><p>1) First, you must show that the effect in autonomous and not driven by the RPE where. Using cell specific promoters to rescue the phenotype would allow you to address this point. The three reviewers were concerned about this point that must absolutely be addressed.</p><p>2) One reviewer was also concerned with the use of the 661W tumor cell line that might not be appropriate for these experiments. Have you used any other cell line?

The findings of this group that activation of the <italic>Kitl/Kit</italic> pathway is one of the early stress responses to photoreceptor degeneration and that it is the upstream of NRF2-dependent HMOX1 upregulation are novel. The authors provided strong evidence that the <italic>Kitl/Kit</italic> pathway is necessary and sufficient to provide protection to photoreceptors following light damage. Further study using genetic retinal degeneration mouse models indicated a generic protective effect of that <italic>Kitl/kit</italic> pathway, which may have impact on RP treatment. Overall, I found that this manuscript delivers high quality data and is clearly written. The results are compelling and have appropriate quantifications whenever possible.</p><p>One part of the story that is less clear to me is whether the activation of the KITL/KIT pathway in the photoreceptors is in a cell-autonomous manner or not. The authors suggested that it is the photoreceptors upregulating <italic>kitl</italic> following light damage or AAV-KITL infection. What is the expression level of <italic>kitl</italic> and kit in the RPE vs. retina in uninjured eyes? And have the authors examined the <italic>kitl</italic> expression in the RPE following light damage by qPCR or immunostaining (Figure 1I used retinal section without RPE)? In terms of the rescue experiment by viral vectors, AAV-CMV vector also drives strong transgene expression in the RPE cells, which is evident in Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2. The strong staining of <italic>Kitl</italic> in the OS is likely from the cilia of the RPE cells. This is also obvious in Figure 5F, where KITL and HMOX1 overexpression are not overlapping. What the authors can do in the future is to use RPE-specific or photoreceptor-specific promoters to drive <italic>Kitl</italic> expression and examine the rescue effects. As for this manuscript, I think that the authors should discuss the possible involvement of RPE and/or the other cell types in the retina in the activation of the KITL/KIT pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Li et al. focuses on the role of KIT/KITL signaling in photoreceptors of the retina as it relates to response to light damage. Light damage in a sensitive mouse strain leads to increased signaling through the KITL/KIT/MAPK pathway. They used a Kit hypomorphic allele on pigmented and albino mouse strains to show that signaling through this pathway is necessary to protect photoreceptors. In addition, AAV delivery was used to demonstrate that ectopic KITL expression could partially protect photoreceptors using their light damage model. Additional experiments were focused on elucidating the other components of the pathway such as HMOX1 and NRF2. Those studies were primarily ectopic expression and knockdown experiments. The authors used in vivo mouse models but also a cell line from a mouse tumor (661W). The strengths of the manuscript include the emphasis on in vivo studies and the potential impact on a major human disease. The limitations are scientific rigor, use of the retinoblastoma 661W cell line and incomplete experimental details. Specific comments include:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the western blots are not convincing and data to demonstrate specificity of the antibodies should be provided.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the immunofluorescence data are not convincing. The photoreceptor inner segments are a common site of non-specific staining and efforts should be made to demonstrate specificity and localization of the signal. For example, it is impossible to distinguish inner segments from Muller apical microvilli in their images.</p><p>3) Controls should be included to definitively demonstrate which cells are infected with the AAV vector. AAV8 should infect all cell types and they did not provide convincing data on photoreceptor specificity. This is important because cell autonomous versus non-autonomous signaling is an important distinction for KITL/KIT signaling.</p><p>4) The 661W cell line is a mouse retinoblastoma with features of multiple cell types and this is not an appropriate proxy for normal cells.</p><p>5) The in vivo rescue was not well controlled. How many mice were used, how long were they followed, empty vector was not used in all experiments as should have been done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present a detailed report exploring novel genetic factors associated with light induced damage of photoreceptor cells. The authors identify a gene previously unassociated with light damage, KITL (KIT Ligand, also known as SCF, SLF), as upregulated following light damage. This leads to activation of its receptor, KIT (also known as CD117, c-KIT), and down-stream signaling pathways. Inactivation of the KIT pathway using a genetic mutant results in worsening of light induced photoreceptor loss. Over-expression of KITL in photoreceptors via AAV transduction can protect against light induced damage, but not in animals lacking functioning KIT. The authors identify HMOX1 as a potential downstream target of KIT signaling as a factor important for mediating this protective effect. They show that activation of the KIT pathway with either light damage or over-expression of KITL results in upregulation of HMOX1. This effect on HMOX1 appears to be regulated through nuclear translocation of NRF2 which is inhibited in KIT deficient animals. The authors then show that over-expression of HMOX1 via AAV transduction is sufficient to partially protect photoreceptors from light induced damage. Finally, the authors show that activation of the KIT signaling pathway through over-expression of KITL is capable of protecting photoreceptors in two models of retinitis pigmentosa.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is well written with strong supporting evidence for the claims stated. The experiments are presented in a logical order with convincing data. I would recommend this manuscript for publication after revision.</p><p>I highly suggest giving the manuscript an additional editing pass for spelling and grammar as well as wording of some sentences (e.g. The sentence &quot;We observed that after 2 weeks of injection, high-level KITL expression was restricted to photoreceptor cells and the RPE…&quot; implies that the injections were performed for 2 weeks, when in reality they were done once and then the animals were followed up 2 weeks later. There are numerous occasions of this type of phrasing and other similar examples that are confusing and detract from the overall manuscript).</p><p>I would also ask that the authors revisit their Discussion and explore more rationale as to the protective effect of KIT signaling on photoreceptors. The authors mainly restate their results and do not spend anytime analyzing how HMOX1 could be mediating its protective effect and this discussion is necessary to explain how KIT signaling can be protective. The authors also need to address alternative pathways downstream of KIT that may also be contributing to photoreceptor protection. The authors admit that HMOX1 is only capable of partially rescuing photoreceptors. Are there other pathways which may be of interest to examine next?</p><p>There are several ERG graphs that show only noisy traces which are not useful for assaying retinal function (Figure 3B, Kit+/+ no light damage photopic; Figure 8F, AAV8-KITL transduced <italic>rd10</italic> homozygous animals; Figure 9—figure supplement 1B, both traces). If these panels are representative of all data collected for these experiments then they would either need to be repeated or omitted from the manuscript. The associated morphological data is sufficient to show a protective effect of KITL/damaging effect of removing KIT signaling without needing ERG data to show functional deficits.</p><p>Is the AAV8 construct used for HMOX1 identical to the one used for KITL (besides the gene)? If so, why is there such broad expression of HMOX1 compared to KITL after transduction? The promoter used is CMV so one would expect broad expression in most cells of the retina.</p><p>KIT appears to be mainly expressed on the inner segments of photoreceptors while KITL appears to be mainly expressed on the outer segments of photoreceptors/RPE villi. Do photoreceptors normally express KITL or is this exogenously supplied by RPE during stress? Could the authors provide an in situ hybridization showing if KITL is expressed in photoreceptors or in RPE (or both)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51698.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the reviewers noticed a number of important points that must be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication:</p><p>1) First, you must show that the effect in autonomous and not driven by the RPE where.

According to your suggestion, we have performed additional experiments and provide stronger evidence supporting the conclusion that photoreceptor cells upregulate KITL expression to prevent photoreceptor degeneration during light damage. Firstly, based on the results of gene expression analysis by qPCR, WB, IF and ISH, we show that photoreceptor cells upregulate <italic>Kitl</italic> expression in response to light damage (see new Figure 1I, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The details are described in the revised Results section (subsection “Light damage upregulates endogenous KITL in photoreceptor cells”, last paragraph). Secondly, we expressed KITL specifically in photoreceptor cells or RPE cells, using AAV8 viruses allowing for KITL expression either under the control of the photoreceptor cell-specific promoter RHO (AAV8-RHO-KITL) or the RPE cell-specific promoter RPE65 (AAV8-RPE65-KITL), and analyzed its effect on LD (see new Figure 5，Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The results are consistent with the view that it is predominantly KITL generated in photoreceptors and not KITL generated in RPE cells that protects photoreceptors against LD. In other words, KITL acts in an autocrine and not paracrine fashion. The results are described in the subsection “Overexpression of KITL in photoreceptor cells prevents light-induced retinal degeneration”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One reviewer was also concerned with the use of the 661W tumor cell line that might not be appropriate for these experiments. Have you used any other cell line? In any case, this must be discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestions and understand the reviewer’s concerns. As far as we know, the 661W cell line is the only cell line representing photoreceptor cells, and it has been widely used for investigations of photoreceptor cell biology and function (Tan et al., 2004). Recently, Wheway et al. have performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing of 661W cells and showed that 661W cells originated from photoreceptor cells and can be used as a cell model for studying retinal ciliopathies (Wheway et al., 2019). We, therefore, reasoned that 661W cells serve as an appropriate model of photoreceptor cells for in vitro studies, designed principally to support our main in vivo results. According to your suggestion, we have modified the original sentence in the Results section (subsection “KIT signaling regulates <italic>Hmox1</italic> expression in photoreceptor cells”, second paragraph). To further address your concern, we also isolated primary photoreceptor cells from C57BL/6J mice at P7 to examine the relationship between KITL/KIT and <italic>Hmox1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The IF data show that a high proportion of the primary retinal cells expressed photoreceptor specific marker Rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), suggesting they are photoreceptor cells. In response to stimulation of KITL, the primary cells not only upregulated phosphorylated KIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), but also turned on <italic>Hmox1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C and D</xref>). These results are consistent with the studies in 661W cell line.

The specificity of other antibodies can also be seen by which tissue is stained (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). For instance, MITF is known to be an RPE-specific marker and Rhodopsin a photoreceptor cell specific marker.

Are there other pathways which may be of interest to examine next?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comments and apologize for the insufficient information. We have revisited our Discussion according to your suggestions and discussed the action model of KITL/KIT in photoreceptor cells, the potential manner by which HMOX1 could protect photoreceptor cells against LD, the regulation of relationship between the KITL/KIT and NRF2-HMOX1 axis and the limitation of this work (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several ERG graphs that show only noisy traces which are not useful for assaying retinal function (Figure 3B, Kit+/+ no light damage photopic; Figure 8F, AAV8-KITL transduced rd10 homozygous animals; Figure 9—figure supplement 1B, both traces). If these panels are representative of all data collected for these experiments then they would either need to be repeated or omitted from the manuscript. The associated morphological data is sufficient to show a protective effect of KITL/damaging effect of removing KIT signaling without needing ERG data to show functional deficits.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your suggestions, we have repeated the ERG examination and replaced the previous images with improved ones (Figure 3B; Figure 9F; Figure 9—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the AAV8 construct used for HMOX1 identical to the one used for KITL (besides the gene)? If so, why is there such broad expression of HMOX1 compared to KITL after transduction? The promoter used is CMV so one would expect broad expression in most cells of the retina.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. The basic vector of AAV8-HMOX1 contains a CMV promoter and is the same as that of AAV8-KITL. This AAV8-CMV vector has been reported to drive gene expression mainly in photoreceptor cells and RPE (Xiong et al., 2015). Our data also show that AAV8-KITL drives KITL expression mainly in photoreceptor cells and RPE. Similarly, we have repeated the examination of HMOX1 expression in the retinas infected by AAV8-HMOX1 and found that HMOX1 expression is mainly restricted to photoreceptor cells (see new Figure 8B in this revision).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>KIT appears to be mainly expressed on the inner segments of photoreceptors while KITL appears to be mainly expressed on the outer segments of photoreceptors/RPE villi. Do photoreceptors normally express KITL or is this exogenously supplied by RPE during stress? Could the authors provide an in situ hybridization showing if KITL is expressed in photoreceptors or in RPE (or both)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. According to your suggestions, we have examined KITL expression in RPE and photoreceptor cells of light-injured or uninjured retinas by gene expression analysis, including in situ hybridization (see new Figure 1I, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The data consistently show that photoreceptor cells upregulate <italic>Kitl</italic> expression in response to light stress (subsection “Light damage upregulates endogenous KITL in photoreceptor cells”, last paragraph). In addition, to analyze the cell specificity of the protective role of KITL, we used the photoreceptor cell-specific promoter RHO (AAV8-RHO-KITL) or the RPE cell-specific promoter RPE65 (AAV8-RPE65-KITL) to drive KITL expression in photoreceptor cells and RPE cells, respectively (see new Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and the response as described above in the Editor comment 1). Indeed, KITL exerts its protective role when expressed in photoreceptors and not when expressed in the RPE. The results are described in the subsection “Overexpression of KITL in photoreceptor cells prevents light-induced retinal degeneration”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
