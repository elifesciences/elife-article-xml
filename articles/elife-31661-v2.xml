The key determinants that drive their functional distinction are unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that β- and γ-actin functions are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence, using targeted editing of the mouse genome. Although previous studies have shown that disruption of β-actin gene critically impacts cell migration and mouse embryogenesis, we demonstrate here that generation of a mouse lacking β-actin protein by editing β-actin gene to encode γ-actin protein, and vice versa, does not affect cell migration and/or organism survival. Our data suggest that the essential in vivo function of β-actin is provided by the gene sequence independent of the encoded protein isoform. We propose that this regulation constitutes a global ‘silent code’ mechanism that controls the functional diversity of protein isoforms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31661.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammalian cells, including human cells, contain high levels of a protein called actin. This protein is essential for many of the processes that organisms use to develop and survive. For example, filaments of actin maintain the shape of cells, and help generate the forces needed for cells to move and divide.</p><p>As in many other animals, every cell in the human body contains two related actin proteins – known as β-actin and γ-actin. These proteins are made from almost identical amino acid building blocks. Yet the genes that encode these two proteins vary much more. The two actin proteins also play different roles: disrupting the gene for β-actin causes mouse embryos to die, but mice without the gene for γ-actin develop almost like normal. It was not fully understood how these almost identical proteins could perform such different roles.</p><p>Earlier studies exploring the mechanisms that underlie the unique roles of β- and γ-actin focused on the differences in their amino acid sequences. Now, Vedula, Kurosaka et al. test the hypothesis that the differing roles of these two actin proteins are due to the pronounced differences in the DNA sequences of their genes.</p><p>A gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9 was used to make small changes to the mouse gene for β-actin so that it coded for the γ-actin protein. As a consequence, these mice did not make any β-actin protein and instead made the γ-actin protein from a mostly intact gene for β-actin. These mice lacking the β-actin protein survived as normal and were fertile. The shape of their organs and the movement of their cells – two other major processes that need β-actin – were also unaffected. Hence, the γ-actin protein can substitute for β-actin when the β-actin gene is intact.</p><p>These observations imply that it is the DNA sequence of the gene rather than the amino acid sequence of the protein that determines the essential role of β-actin in cell migration and the organism’s survival. The next step will be to see if other proteins work in a similar way. If so, this mechanism might allow scientists to discover new ways to fine-tune how proteins behave in healthy and diseased human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>coding sequence</kwd><kwd>isoforms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kashina</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM117984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kashina</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in mice reveals that diverse functions of actin isoforms are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence, suggesting a novel mechanism of nucleotide-dependent protein regulation in eukaryotic genomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin is an essential and abundant intracellular protein that plays a major role in developmental morphogenesis, muscle contraction, cell migration, and cellular homeostasis. Two of the closest related actin isoforms, non-muscle β-actin and γ-actin, are ubiquitously expressed but encoded by different genes, producing nearly identical proteins except for four residues within their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vandekerckhove and Weber, 1978</xref>). Notably, β-and γ-actin mRNA coding sequences differ much more significantly, by nearly 13%, due to silent substitutions affecting approximately 40% of their codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erba et al., 1986</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that this difference in mRNA coding sequence affects translation dynamics of the two actin isoforms: β-actin is translated in bursts and accumulates faster than γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Such faster translation results in their differential post-translational modification by arginylation, which targets only β- but not γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, actin isoforms are differentially regulated via changes in their mRNA coding sequence that can affect their translation and post-translationally modified state.</p><p>Despite their high similarity and abundance in the same cell types, β- and γ-actin play distinct non-redundant biological roles. A body of evidence shows that these actins localize to different parts of the cell and tend to incorporate into different actin cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kashina, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Otey et al., 1986</xref>). More definitively, several studies show that β-actin knockout in mice results in early embryonic lethality despite proportional up-regulation of other actin isoforms to compensate for the total actin dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shawlot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shmerling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strathdee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tondeleir et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>), while γ-actin knockout in mice has a much milder phenotype that does not interfere with animal survival during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunnell and Ervasti, 2010</xref>). This lethality of β-actin knockout in mice can be rescued by a targeted knock-in of the β-actin cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tondeleir et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the coding region of this gene is far more important for organism’s survival than any non-coding elements affected by the β-actin knockout. The underlying mechanisms conferring such functional differences to these two nearly identical protein isoforms are unknown.</p><p>Several distinct features of the two actin isoforms have been proposed as the mechanism conferring unique roles to the two proteins. Some biochemical differences between β- and γ-actin were observed in polymerization assays both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergeron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapustina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, β-actin mRNA, unlike γ-actin mRNA, gets spatially targeted to the cell periphery via zipcode-mediated transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill and Gunning, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kislauskis et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, β- and γ-actin actin can differentially regulate gene expression of a subset of cytoskeleton proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tondeleir et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>). Despite these differences, no study to date has definitively identified the key functional determinants that confer unique functions to the mammalian actin isoforms in organism’s survival, or determined whether these determinants reside at the amino acid level.</p><p>Here, we used targeted editing of the mouse genome to test the hypothesis that β- and γ-actin functions in vivo are defined by their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequence. Although previous studies have shown that disruption of the β-actin gene critically impacts embryonic development and organism survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shawlot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shmerling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strathdee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tondeleir et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>), we demonstrate here that editing of the β-actin coding sequence to encode γ-actin protein without disruption of the rest of the β-actin gene does not affect mouse survival or produce a visible phenotype at the organismal or cellular level. This result shows that γ-actin protein is functionally capable of substituting for β-actin in the absence of gene disruption. Thus, we demonstrate that the differences in in vivo functions of β- and γ-actin actin are ultimately determined by their nucleotide rather than amino acid sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>β-actin nucleotide sequence, rather than amino acid sequence, defines its essential role in vivo</title><p>It has been previously found that knockout of β-actin gene in mice, unlike γ-actin, leads to early embryonic lethality – a result that definitively demonstrates its essential, non-redundant biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether this essential function of β-actin is defined by its amino acid or nucleotide sequence, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to introduce five point mutations into the native mouse β-actin gene (<italic>Actb),</italic> altering it to encode γ-actin protein without changing any of the features of the rest of the gene sequence (‘beta-coded gamma actin’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We termed this edited gene <italic>Actbc-g</italic>, in which the native β-actin gene is nearly intact (with five point mutations within the first 10 codons) and contains the same promoter, as well as the same coding and non-coding elements, but the protein produced from this gene is identical to γ-actin. The outcome is no β-actin protein at all, enabling us to definitively test whether β-actin amino acid sequence, or its nucleotide sequence, is responsible for its essential function in organism’s survival. If intact β-actin amino acid sequence is required, the mutant mice would die in embryogenesis, similarly to the β-actin knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shawlot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shmerling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strathdee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tondeleir et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2014</xref>). If the nucleotide sequence also contributes, these mice would be expected to survive longer than the β-actin knockout mice and have an overall milder phenotype. Finally, if the nucleotide sequence is the sole determinant of β-actin function, these mice would have no phenotype at all.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31661.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>β -coded γ -actin (<italic>Actbc-g</italic>) mice exhibit no phenotypic changes compared to control.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRISPR/Cas9 editing strategy used to generate <italic>Actbc-g</italic> mouse.

To assess the potential differences in translation dynamics between the actin isoforms, we analyzed the global ribosome profiling data for these genes (mouse <italic>Actb</italic> and <italic>Actg1,</italic> encoding non-muscle β- and γ-actin, respectively) available at the GWIPS-Viz genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gwips.ucc.ie">http://gwips.ucc.ie</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Michel et al., 2014</xref>) that aggregates the results of multiple ribosome profiling studies across genomes. Remarkably, composite data from 26 independently performed ribosome profiling studies from different mouse tissues show that the ribosome density on mouse β-actin mRNA is over a thousand fold higher than γ-actin (average ribosome density over the first 150 codons: 1351.607 for β-actin versus 1.289 for γ-actin, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>) . These data suggest that the translation dynamics of β-actin in vivo is dramatically different from that of γ-actin. We next extended this analysis to the whole family of mouse actin genes and correlated the previously reported phenotypes resulting from mouse knockouts of different actin isoforms with the ribosome density number for each isoform (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This analysis shows that members of the actin family have vastly different ribosome densities, with β-actin being by far the highest, while γ-enteric smooth muscle actin is by far the lowest (ribosome density 0.377), suggesting that the intracellular accumulation rate for these two proteins, as well as their translation dynamics, should be vastly different from each other. In support, they also have different mRNA structures in the coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). Notably, the actin isoforms that tend to become up-regulated in different knockout models are typically those with the closest ribosome density to the isoform that had been knocked out (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It appears likely that the success of functional compensation may also be linked to this number, directly or indirectly. For instance, alpha skeletal and alpha smooth muscle actins appear to partially cross-compensate for each other, and these isoforms are also the second and third highest by ribosome density, after β-actin. α-cardiac actin completely rescues knockout of α-skeletal actin, which has the closest ribosome density. In contrast, loss of α-cardiac actin cannot be substituted for by γ-enteric smooth muscle actin, which has a ~10 fold lower ribosome density. These results suggest the actin isoform with similar ribosome density can plausibly compensate for the loss of one of the isoforms. In agreement, given the orders of magnitude difference in ribosome density between β-actin and other actin isoforms, none of the other actin isoforms can compensate for the loss of β-actin. We propose that changes in ribosome density arising from silent substitutions in nucleotide sequence, affect translation dynamics and protein accumulation rates, which in turn regulate functional diversity of actins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Silent substitutions in the coding sequence as a potential global regulator of homologous protein isoforms in eukaryotic genomes (‘silent code’)</title><p>We next used sequence analysis and Ribo-seq data profiling to test whether this type of silent substitution dependent protein regulation may potentially be applicable to other closely related protein isoform families in the mouse genome. First, to identify all protein families encoding highly similar proteins, we searched the mouse genome for proteins that are over 90% identical both in length and in their amino acid sequence over their entire length, and are encoded by different genes. This search yielded 741 families in mouse, encoding nearly 4000 different open reading frames. Next, we compared ribosome density numbers for different protein isoforms within these families using published ribosome profiling data found on GWIPS-Viz genome browser, and sorted these families by the normalized standard deviation (SD) of difference between ribosome densities for different members within the family. We discarded those families in which the ribosome density on the highest translating gene was less than 1, suggesting that their relative abundance in the polysome fraction is negligible (e.g., the majority of olfactory receptors). In the resulting list, we selected the top 100 families with SD of ribosome densities of 1.4 and above and classified them by functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also performed the same analysis in two other vertebrate genomes, human and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>) and cross-referenced the identity of the top families to each other.</p><p>The top families identified in these searches were similar in all three vertebrate genomes, and contained the actin family as one of the top hits.

In the case of non-muscle actins, our finding resolves decades of controversial studies and reconciles a body of seemingly contradictory results obtained in the attempts to address functional distinction between β- and γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergeron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapustina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patrinostro et al., 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the nucleotide sequence of the gene, rather than the amino acid sequence of the encoded isoform, determines the absolute requirement of β-actin for organism’s survival.</p><p>Closely related protein isoforms can exhibit functional differences which can be attributed to one or more of the following three sources. First, variations at the amino acid level can cause profound differences in protein function. Second, variations in mRNA properties due to differences in their coding sequence and UTR regions can strongly affect mRNA localization, stability, and translatability via secondary structure and codon usage. Finally, variations in gene intron sequences, promoter, and enhancer regions can contribute to the overall gene regulation, expression levels, and tissue specificity. Contribution of each of these levels to actin isoform function has been extensively investigated in prior studies. While β-actin and γ-actin isoforms share a remarkable conservation at the amino acid level, with just four homologous amino changes at their N-termini, these two proteins have been shown to have slightly different polymerization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergeron et al., 2010</xref>) and to differentially interact with cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapustina et al., 2016</xref>) and non-muscle myosin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). At the level of mRNA, actin 3′UTRs are isoform-specific and evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they play important roles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erba et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill and Gunning, 1993</xref>). A plethora of literature elucidates the importance of β-actin 3′UTR for the localization of the transcript (see, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Condeelis and Singer, 2005</xref>) for a comprehensive review). It has also been shown that γ-actin mRNA induces a ribosome pausing event, resulting in its slower translation compared to β-actin, a mechanism that drives their differential arginylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). An alternative poly A site in β-actin mRNA increases its translation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, at the gene level, several studies point to roles of various regulatory elements in the actin isoforms. γ-actin gene contains a unique and highly conserved intron III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lloyd and Gunning, 1993</xref>), and an alternatively spliced exon 3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond and Friderici, 2013</xref>). β-actin exhibits both 3′UTR-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lloyd and Gunning, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lyubimova et al., 1999</xref>) and 3′UTR-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lloyd et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schevzov et al., 1992</xref>) feedback regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Our prior data showed that silent substitutions in β- and γ-actin coding sequence, amounting to a 13% overall difference, confer changes in the rates of their accumulation in the cell, and in their posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We show here, by analysis of publically deposited RiboSeq datasets, that β- and γ-actin mRNAs dramatically differ in ribosome densities, suggesting vastly different translation dynamics and likely different accumulation rates in cells. We propose that these silent substitutions in the nucleotide coding sequence may be key determinants that drive β- and γ-actin function. It is possible, however, that at the gene level additional non-coding elements and the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the actin mRNA may also contribute to the functional distinction between the actin isoforms. This possibility requires further investigation.</p><p>Ribosome profiling experiments show that among the 6 members of the actin family in mice, β-actin by far has the highest representation in the polysome fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that this confers the cell with the ability to spatially and temporally fine tune translation of β-actin and the local and global rate of its intracellular accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ströhl et al., 2017</xref>), and thus makes β-actin the most essential of the actin isoforms and cannot be compensated for when deleted. The nearly identical non-muscle γ-actin appears to be more functionally redundant and can be largely compensated for by other actins that have similar ribosome densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perrin and Ervasti, 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). Our findings suggest that actin isoforms with similar ribosome densities and translation dynamics are more likely to compensate for each other’s functions, while β-actin, with the highest-ribosome-density is unique in its functional significance. Elucidating the exact contribution of translation dynamics to actin isoform functions constitutes an exciting direction of future studies.</p><p>Our result that targeted genome editing of mouse β-actin gene to encode for γ-actin protein leads to no apparent phenotype proves for the first time that the major determinants of β-actin’s essential function in vivo are encoded at the nucleotide level. Some of the existing data point to the possibility that this effect is mediated primarily or exclusively via the coding region, rather than the promoter, the UTR, or the intron sequences. Indeed, deletion of exons 2 and 3 of the β-actin gene that include β-actin translation initiation site but do not encompass the promoter region, UTR, or the non-coding elements in the rest of the gene leads to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, in <italic>Actb</italic> knockout mice other actin isoforms are up-regulated to compensate for the total actin dosage, but this promoter-mediated up-regulation is insufficient to rescue the phenotype of early embryonic lethality. At the same time, targeted insertion of the human β-actin coding sequence into this region rescues embryonic lethality in these mice, further supporting the idea that the coding sequence plays a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tondeleir et al., 2012</xref>). Data from our group previously showed that coding sequence drives differences in actin’s posttranslational modifications, one of the forms of functional actin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). While these studies do not fully exclude a potential contribution of non-coding elements, especially those that may be located between exons 2 and 3 in the gene, they strongly support our hypothesis that the coding region is primarily responsible for the uniquely essential role of β-actin in vivo. Elucidating the underlying hierarchy of silent substitutions among other modes of regulation, would further our understating of the various levels of factors affecting the function of different actin isoforms.</p><p>Despite the fact that non-muscle actin isoform genes have evolutionarily diverged &gt;100 million years ago, they have retained remarkable sequence conservation, far higher than what would be expected if the synonymous substitutions in their coding sequence were completely randomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erba et al., 1986</xref>). This is consistent with our idea that actin isoform coding sequence exists under additional evolutionary pressure, over and above the conservation of amino acid sequence. We propose that at least some of this pressure is aimed to maintain the divergent translation dynamics within the actin family, in order to drive their divergent functions.</p><p>Our sequence analysis and data mining suggest that this mechanism of homologous protein regulation through ‘silent code’ may be globally applicable to multiple protein families throughout eukaryotic genomes. Notably, one of the top candidate families for this regulation in addition to actin – tubulin – is also a major cytoskeletal protein regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. Some members of the tubulin family conceivably may be regulated via silent substitutions in their coding sequence affecting translation dynamics, like shown previously for non-muscle actins. While systematic mouse knockout data for the alpha and β− tubulin isoform families is not available, based on the analogy with the actin isoforms, we predict that tubulin β-V (<italic>Tubb5</italic>) is likely the most essential of the β− tubulin genes, whose knockout likely cannot be substituted by up-regulation of any other β− tubulin.

The donor females were super-ovulated using 5 IU of PMSG followed 48 hr later with 5 IU HCG, after which the females were mated immediately to C57Bl/6 studs. MEGAshort-script T7 transcription kit (Ambion Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used for in vitro transcription of small guide sgRNA (gctgcgctggtcgtcgacaaCGG, where CGG is the Protospacer Adjacent Motif, PAM) as per manufacturer’s protocol. mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Ambion) was used to synthesize Cas9 mRNA. MEGAclear transcription clean up kit (Ambion Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to purify the synthesized RNAs. About 20 hr post HCG, the CRISPR solution was injected into zygotes via pronuclear injection at a concertation of: Cas9 mRNA: 100 ng/µL, template DNA: 100 ng/µL, and gRNA: 50 ng/µL. The zygotes were further cultured overnight in KSOM media using a 5% CO2 incubator. All the embryos which successfully cleaved to the 2 cell stage were transferred into recipient females via oviduct transfer. A founder female that was mosaic for the mutation was derived and crossed with a wildtype male to derive heterozygotes. One male and female heterozygote from the F1 generation were crossed to produce F2 generation. Two separate litters from the F2 generation produced two wildtype females, five heterozygote males, one heterozygote female, and three homozygote males.</p><p>Template DNA sequence:</p><p><named-content content-type="sequence">5′CGGCTGTTGGCGGCCCCGAGGTGACTATAGCCTTCTTTTGTGTCTTGATAGTAGTTCGCCATGGAAGAGGAAATCGCTGCGCTGGTCATTGACAACGGCTCCGGCATGTGCAAAGCCGGCTTCGCGGGCGACGATGCTCCCCGGGCTGTA 3′</named-content></p><p>The <italic>Actb</italic> gene has an EcoRV site which gets destroyed upon gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Moreover, β-actin deletion results in embryonic lethality and cannot be compensated by up-regulation of other actin isoforms. Recent studies by the Kashina lab revealed that only β-actin is arginylated in cells. Moreover, they demonstrated that differences in the nucleotide coding sequences, instead of amino acid sequences, between β- and γ-actin actin isoforms are responsible for differences in their arginylation.</p><p>Here, Vedula et al. generated knock-in mice to test whether the differences in the in vivo functions between β- and γ-actin arise from differences in their nucleotide, rather than their amino acid sequences. Importantly, their data demonstrate that editing β-actin gene to encode γ actin does not result in detectable defects in animal development and survival, or in migration and cytoskeletal organization of MEFs isolated from the mutant embryos. These and other data presented in the manuscript propose that in highly homologous protein isoforms, including β- and γ-actin and perhaps also histone and tubulin isoforms, the functional differences may arise from specific features of the nucleotide sequences that regulate translational dynamics, and hence affect post-translational modifications.</p><p>Majority of the experiments presented in the manuscript appear very convincing and of good technical quality. However, the manuscript could be significantly improved by better presentation of the data, by performing some additional control experiments, and by refocusing the manuscript to the most important findings.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p>1) The claim that γ-actin coded by the β-actin gene leads to no impact on organism survival needs some quantitative data, which can be derived from mouse breeding records.

The average litter size for Actbc-g mice is 6.4 pups (averaged from 9 litters), which is very similar to the reported 6.3 average litter size for the background C57Bl6 wild type mouse strain used for CRISPR editing.

We have several others, mostly 3-7 months old (and some younger ones), but many of them were euthanized for experiments at different ages, precluding accurate assessment of their life spans. During the course of the study we did not at any point observe spontaneous lethality in these mice. All this information has been added to the revised manuscript. Overall, many studies in the field make conclusion about survival at the weaning stage, after which the phenotype is considered viable, even in those cases where high mortality rates are observed later on. For this reason, and given that we observe absolutely no survival issues in our mice at any analyzed stage up to 8 months, we believe that our conclusion about survival is merited in this case. However, we read through the text to make sure each statement about survival is justified and supported, and removed those that appeared unwarranted. We hope the reviewers agree, and we would be glad to make further specific changes as needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The part of manuscript focusing on editing of γ-actin gene to encode β-actin is not particularly informative.

However, we feel that the γ coded β-like mouse does provide limited additional information relevant to this study. For this reason, we took the liberty of keeping it in the paper in a greatly downplayed form. We removed the separate section describing this mouse, and added it as a supportive piece of evidence to the first Results section and to the supplemental figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We hope the reviewers find this permissible, and we would be glad to remove these data altogether if needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data on cell migration (since this is the process, where β-actin has been specifically implicated) could be solidified by further experiments.

To address this comment we performed single cell migration study to measure directionality of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts of both genotypes, measured as total displacement by total distance. The directionality of both cell types is similar, suggesting that no changes in the migration of these cells occur because of the mutation. We also added more cell images to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> to illustrate the variation in cell morphology that may have caused the initial impression about these differences. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should extensively modify the 'Discussion' to better acknowledge previous biochemistry work on β- and γ-actins, as well as to consider alternative explanations for their results.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been expanded to include the papers pointed out by the reviewers and systematically consider alternative explanations of our results in the context of the published literature in the field.</p></body></sub-article></article>
