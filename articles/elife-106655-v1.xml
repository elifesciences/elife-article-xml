However, this remains challenging when sensitivity analyses overlook the underlying drivers of spring phenology. In this article, we present a new measure <italic>phenological lag</italic> to quantify the overall effect of phenological constraints, including insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses, based on observed response and that expected from species-specific changes in spring temperatures, that is, changes in spring forcing (degree days) from warming and average temperature at budburst with the warmer climate. We applied this new analytical framework to a global dataset with 980 species and 1527 responses to synthesize observed changes in spring budburst (leafing or flowering) and investigate the mechanisms of differential phenological responses reported previously. We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to a more stressful environment associated with warmer and drier climate. Smaller forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in the boreal region (compared to the temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, mean annual temperature (MAT), and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined &lt;2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology. Our method helps to determine mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spring phenology</kwd><kwd>phenological lag</kwd><kwd>forcing change</kwd><kwd>budburst temperature</kwd><kwd>phenological response</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new method to partition observed phenological changes based on drivers of spring phenology has been presented.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant phenology, particularly in spring, is shifting with warming climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallinat and Primack, 2016</xref>).

For example, observed changes are often smaller with experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>), native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>), and warmer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding these differences (also referred to as discrepancies, disparities, or mismatches) is crucial for predicting changes in plant communities and ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallinat and Primack, 2016</xref>) but difficult using sensitivity analysis that is based on a relative rate of change, that is, change in days per degree Celsius or year/decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Plants in the northern hemisphere require an accumulation of cool winter temperatures (winter chilling) to break dormancy and an accumulation of warm spring temperatures (spring forcing, degree days) to initiate budburst (e.g., leafing or flowering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>). If chilling requirements are fully met and other phenological constraints (e.g., photoperiod effect and environmental stresses) do not change with warming, the changes in spring phenology, in response to a warmer climate, result primarily from changes in spring temperatures, that is, changes in spring forcing and rate of forcing accumulation (i.e., temperature) at budburst with the warmer climate. That is, higher budburst temperatures are associated with smaller observed changes and sensitivity, opposite to the effects of forcing changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). As species often differ in timing of budburst, both forcing change and budburst temperature are species-specific, reflecting variations of individual species in phenological responses to climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). The effects of insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod (day length), and environmental stresses (e.g., drought and spring freezing) are similar in constraining the advance of spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Körner and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the difference between observed phenological change and that expected from forcing change and budburst temperature represents phenological difference due to changes in phenological constraints and can be thereafter named phenological lag. Separating the effects of different constraints is possible if soil moisture or plant water status is monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Post et al., 2022</xref>), or if species-specific chilling and photoperiod effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Man et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Man et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2019</xref>) or cold hardiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Man et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Man et al., 2021b</xref>) are known from previous research. For example, phenological lag can represent chilling effects when photoperiod effect and environmental stresses remain unchanged with warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The changes in spring phenology are often assessed by sensitivity, a parameter that does not account for uneven warming patterns and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaubien and Hamann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rafferty et al., 2020</xref>) and therefore does not provide meaningful insights into the magnitude and underlying mechanisms of changes in spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). For example, the same average temperature change (spring or annual temperature) can lead to different changes in spring phenology if warming occurs unevenly before and after budburst. Under this circumstance, interpretations based on sensitivity analysis can be misleading. Here, we present a new method to partition observed phenological changes based on changes in spring phenology and temperatures with control (baseline) and warmer climates. We applied this analytical approach to meta-analyze phenological changes reported in the literature and investigated the mechanisms of the differential responses reported previously on research approach (observational or experimental), species origin (native or exotic), climatic region (boreal or temperate), and growth form (tree, shrub, herb, or grass). Our objective was to determine how phenological responses differ among different groups and how differential responses are related to the drivers of spring phenology, that is, forcing change, budburst temperature, and phenological lag.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Across 66 studies with 980 species and 1527 responses, observed responses (<italic>N</italic><sub>O</sub>) ranged from −23.8 to +26.8 days for leafing and −36.3 to +49.9 days for flowering, with an average of +6.0 days for both events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). These changes differed from expected responses (<italic>N</italic><sub>E</sub>) which ranged from −3 to +27 days for leafing and −3 to +26 days for flowering and averaged +7.8 and +9.5 days, respectively.

By synthesizing global data, we found that observed flowering responses in experimental studies were non-significantly smaller than that in observational studies, but this was not the case for leafing responses; these findings differ from those based on temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). The greater warming in experimental studies did not produce greater observed responses, due to longer phenological lags, which may have resulted in the reduced sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). First, experimental studies are often conducted at higher altitude sites with lower MAT, later spring phenology, and therefore longer accumulation of winter chilling. The longer phenological lags are therefore unlikely the result of insufficient winter chilling. Second, artificial warming has typically provided higher forcing changes and budburst temperatures than natural climate warming (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Greater forcing changes produce larger expected responses (observed response + phenological lag), whereas higher budburst temperatures reduce expected responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolkovich et al., 2021</xref>). The high temperatures in the artificial warming structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marion et al., 1997</xref>) can also reduce humidity and soil moisture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ettinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), slowing spring development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganjurjav et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moore et al., 2015</xref>), particularly in early spring when temperatures in the surrounding environment are low, thus restricting soil water movement. While the different forcing changes adequately account for the differences in expected leafing responses (2.5 out of 3.3 days, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> note c), the large differences in forcing changes but similar expected responses in flowering (8.63 and 9.07 days, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggests a strong effect of budburst temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> note d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, warming-induced moisture stress and high budburst temperatures may interact to alter observed phenological responses and temperature sensitivity in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). Future experiments should consider humidity, soil moisture, and plant water status to better understand disparities between observational and experimental studies and relate plant phenological changes from experimental warming to those from natural climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Native vs. exotic species</title><p>Exotic species are often reported with more noticeable observed responses to warming, a trend that is generally based on flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>). The ecological implications of this response are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Lower budburst temperatures faced by early-start exotics are likely partially the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>), as shown by a reverse trend for late-start exotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zohner and Renner, 2014</xref>). In this synthesis, phenological lag did not increase from early leafing to late flowering for exotic species, a trend that is consistent with dormancy release commonly reported on leaf and flower buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gariglio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wall et al., 2008</xref>), contrary to that for native species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The smaller observed response in flowering for native species is associated with longer phenological lags and accumulations of winter chilling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting more stressful environments later in the season or higher stress sensitivity with reproductive events. Comparatively, plants starting growth early in the growing season may be less restricted by soil moisture that often recharges from winter precipitation and is depleted with increased moisture consumption over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sherry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>), particularly in dry climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Man and Greenway, 2013</xref>). Moisture stress can progressively develop over the season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>) and differentially affect exotic and native species with differing spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuble et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>). The smaller observed responses in flowering of native species suggest reproductive disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">IPCC, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>). The consistent leafing response, however, does not support suggestions that late-start native species would have relatively shorter active growing seasons and, therefore, a competitive growth disadvantage relative to early-start exotic species with climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallinat and Primack, 2016</xref>). Total thermal benefits from climate warming do not differ among species with differing spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). Given the projected increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation for many parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">IPCC, 2014</xref>), future studies should assess the differences in drought sensitivity between vegetative and reproductive events and among functional groups and climatic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Boreal vs. temperate region</title><p>Spatial variations along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients are often reported but not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Our analysis indicates smaller observed responses in the boreal region (MAT&lt;6°C) due to less forcing changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but not to longer phenological lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The similar spring warming but less forcing change suggests that the temperature increases in the boreal region occur more frequently in the winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaubien and Hamann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 2015</xref>) when temperatures are below freezing and don’t contribute to spring forcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Man and Lu, 2010</xref>).

When forcing changes are held constant, however, observed responses increase with altitude and latitude, as shown by the positive regression coefficients in both leafing and flowering models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The possible mechanisms behind this may be lower budburst temperature and less moisture stress at higher altitude and latitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rafferty et al., 2020</xref>), as shown by the negative collinearity of altitude and latitude with budburst temperature and phenological lag in both leafing and flowering (data not shown).

In phenological research, the influence of budburst temperature is not adequately recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2023</xref>) and can be confounded with progressive increases of phenological lag with greater chilling requirements or insufficient winter chilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallinat and Primack, 2016</xref>), photoperiod constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Körner and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>), or moisture stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>) suggested for late season species. The difference in the significance of budburst temperatures between leafing and flowering models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) suggests that the influence of budburst temperatures can be greater if budburst temperatures decrease with the advance of spring phenology and progress of climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to spring average temperature change that explained &lt;0.5% of the variation in observed responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), forcing change quantifies climate warming effect relevant to phenological change of individual species and reduces uneven warming effects among species with different spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>) and areas in different climatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Both forcing change and budburst temperature can be readily extracted from phenological and temperature data, as demonstrated in this synthesis, but have not been used in assessment of plant phenological changes in spring.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions and caveats</title><p>In this article, we outline an analytical framework to partition phenological changes based on drivers of spring phenology and report differential phenological responses identified through the meta-analysis of observed changes and phenological lag. Longer phenological lag, likely resulting from more stressful environments with warmer and drier climate, helped to explain smaller responses with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, while less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in the boreal region and in grass leafing. Some of these differential responses are different from those reported previously based on sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Our approach does not require species-specific chilling and forcing needs, chilling–forcing relationships, or temperature response models that are often unavailable or variable in methods of estimation across species and studies. As chilling and forcing models reflect physiological aspects of chilling and forcing processes, the use of alternative base temperatures or forcing models would not change the partitioning of phenological changes for individual species, but would affect comparisons among species under different temperature regimes, i.e., different climatic regions or timing of spring phenology.</p><p>While our method helps to understand changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses across different functional groups or climatic regions, the ecological implications of phenological lag can be uncertain without investigation of individual constraints. In this synthesis, the effects of photoperiod and insufficient winter chilling are likely limited across all studies with the current level of climate change. In the boreal region with a long winter, insufficient winter chilling is unlikely to occur with the levels of climate warming projected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). Phenological lag reflects the overall lag effect and highlights the need to investigate individual constraints that can be specifically determined at individual study level if biological and environmental constraints are known from on-site monitoring or previous research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec

We used Web of Science and Google Scholar to search experimental and observational studies on warming-induced changes in spring phenology. The following criteria were used to select papers: (a) accessible peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals for boreal (MAT&lt;6°C) and temperate (MAT ≥6°C) regions in the northern hemisphere, (b) studies reporting spring budburst (leafing or flowering) before Julian day 213 (July 31), (c) studies containing different climatic conditions of baseline (lower temperatures in early period of observations or control treatment) and warmer (higher temperatures in later periods of observations or warmer treatment) climates, (d) access to local temperature data (only one study was excluded due to lack of nearby temperature data within 50 km), and (e) reported phenological changes in unique locations, species, and periods of observations/warmer treatments. When publications did not contain sufficient phenological information, we accessed data directly from phenological databases (e.g., China’s National Earth System Science Data Center). When results were reported in graphical format, we extracted the required data using the distance measuring tool in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. In experimental studies with multiple warming treatments, we selected the treatment with the smallest temperature increases to represent a likely scenario of climate change and to maintain data independence. We also excluded studies where the timing of spring budburst, total temperature change, or observational time periods were not available.</p><p>In total, 66 studies were identified from 87 locations, containing 1527 phenological responses for 980 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A–C</xref>). For studies reporting multiple phenological stages, we only used data for the first occurrence of the events. To account for variation in phenological responses, each study location was characterized by research approach (observational or experimental), climatic region (boreal or temperate), biogeographic origin of species (exotic or native to study area), and growth form (tree, shrub, herb, or grass).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution of phenological studies used in this synthesis.</title><p>Numbers correspond to study information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

When temperature data were available from multiple sources, we selected the data set with the fewest missing values. For each phenological response, the number of weather stations within 50 km of data collection ranged from 1 for studies at a single location to 14 for observational studies across large geographic areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We calculated forcing change, expected response, budburst temperature, and phenological lag for each of the 1527 responses compiled. We used linear mixed-effects models to explore the differences in observed responses and phenological lags between research approaches (observational vs. experimental), species origins (native vs. exotic), and climatic regions (boreal vs. temperate), and among growth forms (trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses). Observed response is the total phenological change observed (commonly called phenological change or response), while phenological lag represents the lag effect of all constraints and therefore modification of phenological change from the expectation based on changes in spring temperatures. A separate analysis was conducted for each of the four fixed effects and two budburst events (leafing and flowering). Location and species were treated as random effects.</p><p>To assess the influences of climatic, phenological, and biological variables, we used a stepwise regression with automated combined forward and backward selection by Akaike information criterion (AIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>) to select the best combination of variables for predicting observed responses (N<sub>O</sub>).<disp-formula id="equ5"><alternatives><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"

They found that, across all samples, observed phenological responses to climate warming were smaller than expected responses for both leafing and flowering spring events. They also show that data from experimental studies included in their analysis exhibited increased phenological lag compared to observational studies, possibly as a result of reduced sensitivity to climatic changes. Furthermore, the authors present evidence that spatial trends in phenological responses to warming may differ than what would be expected from phenological sensitivity, due to the seasonal timing of when warming occurs. Thus, climate change may not result in geographic convergences of phenological responses. This study presents an interesting way to separate the individual effects of climate change and other abiotic changes on the phenological responses across sites and species.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A straightforward mathematical definition of phenological lag allows for this method to potentially be applied in different geographic contexts. Where data exists, other researchers can partition the effects of various abiotic forcings on phenological responses that differ from those expected from warming sensitivity alone.</p><p>Identifying phenological lag, and associated contributing factors, provides a method by which more nuanced predictions of phenological responses to climate change can be made. Thus, this study could improve ecological forecasting models.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The analysis here could be more robust. A more thorough examination of phenological lag would provide stronger evidence that the framework presented has utility. The differences in phenologica lag by study approach, species origin, region, and growth form are interesting, and could be expanded. For example, the authors have the data to explore the relationships between phenological lag and the quantitative variables included in the final model (altitude, latitude, mean annual temperature) and other spatial or temporal variables. This would also provide stronger evidence for the author's claims about potential mechanisms that contribute to phenological lag.</p></disp-quote><p>We did examine the relationships of phenological lag with geographic or climatic variables in our analyses. Other than the weak correlations with latitude and altitude cited in the discussion section (lines 292-293), phenological lag was not related to mean annual temperature or long-term precipitation for both leafing and flowering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors include very little data visualizations, and instead report results and model statistics in tables. This is difficult to interpret and may obscure underlying patterns in the data. Including visual representations of variable distributions and between-variable relationships, in addition to model statistics, provides stronger evidence than model statistics alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Table 2 shows the influences of geographic or climatic variables, particularly those related to drivers of spring phenology, i.e., budburst temperature, forcing change, and phenological lag, on phenological changes. As quantitative contributions of these drivers have been extracted, the influences of remaining variables are either minor or insignificant. Thus, examination of variable distributions, which has been done in previous syntheses, is probably not necessary.</p><p>Some of independent variables were apparently correlated (r &lt;0.6), e.g., MAT with altitude and latitude, budburst temperature with forcing change and spring warming, and forcing change with spring warming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed a new phenological lag metric and applied this analytical framework to a global dataset to synthesize shifts in spring phenology and assess how abiotic constraints influence spring phenology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The dataset developed in this study is extensive, and the phenological lag metric is valuable.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The stability of the method used in this study needs improvement, particularly in the calculation of forcing requirements. In addition, the visualization of the results (such as Table 1) should be enhanced.</p></disp-quote><p>Not clear how to improve the calculation of forcing accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Editor (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>To improve the robustness of the metric and the conclusions drawn, we recommend that the authors:</p><p>Test the sensitivity of their results to different base temperature thresholds and to nonlinear forcing response models, even for a subset of species. The proposed framework relies on an accurate understanding of species-specific thermal responses, which remain poorly resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>Different above-zero base temperatures have been used previously, although justifications are mostly following previous work. As we indicated in our first responses, the use of above-zero base temperatures underestimates forcing from low temperatures, which has more impacts on species with early spring phenology or in areas of cold climate due to greater proportions of forcing accumulations from low temperatures. The use of high base temperatures can lead to an interpretation that early season species require little or no forcing to break buds, which is biologically incorrect. Thus, the use of above-zero base temperatures would be more appropriate for particular locations or species than for meta-analysis across different spring phenology and climatic conditions.</p><p>The research on multiple warming is limited in terms of levels of warming used (mostly one and occasionally two) for assessing non-linear forcing responses. This can be the focus of future work.</p><p>Our framework is based on drivers of spring phenology and not dependent on “accurate understanding of species-specific thermal responses”. However, a good understanding of species- and site-specific responses to phenological constraints (e.g., insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses) does help determine the nature of phenological lag. All these are explained in our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analyze relationships between phenological lag and additional geographic or climatic gradients already available in the dataset (e.g., latitude, mean annual temperature, interannual variability).</p></disp-quote><p>We did examine the relationships of phenological lag with geographic or climatic variables in our analyses.
