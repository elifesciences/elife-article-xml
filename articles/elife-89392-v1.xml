and death) in soil. However, little is known about how such processes responds to simultaneous regime shifts in temperature and precipitation. We used the <sup>18</sup>O-water quantitative stable isotope probing approach to estimate bacterial growth in alpine meadow soils of the Tibetan Plateau after a decade of warming and altered precipitation manipulation. Our results showed that the growth of major taxa was suppressed by the single and combined effects of temperature and precipitation, eliciting 40–90% of growth reduction of whole community. The antagonistic interactions of warming and altered precipitation on population growth were common (~70% taxa), represented by the weak antagonistic interactions of warming and drought, and the neutralizing effects of warming and wet. The members in <italic>Solirubrobacter</italic> and <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> genera had high growth rates under changed climate regimes. These results are important to understand and predict the soil microbial dynamics in alpine meadow ecosystems suffering from multiple climate change factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>warming</kwd><kwd>altered precipitation</kwd><kwd>microbial population growth</kwd><kwd>multifactor interaction</kwd><kwd>the Tibetan Plateau</kwd><kwd>quantitative stable isotope probing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42277100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ling</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Warming and altered precipitation reduce the growth rates of alpine soil bacteria by 40-90%, and the growth of ~70% taxa is influenced by antagonistic interactions between factors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global climate change is threatening multi-dimensional ecosystem services, such as terrestrial primary productivity and soil carbon storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), especially in high-elevation ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Of these, the effects of global climate change on microbial processes related to soil carbon cycling should receive more extensive attention, because carbon balance will have feedbacks on climate system, and further reinforce/diminish the net impact on ecosystem functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>). Microbial growth and death, the critical eco-physiological processes, serve as the major engine of soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover and thus dominates the feedback on climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sokol et al., 2022</xref>). Quantitative estimates of trait-based responses of microbes to multiple climate factors is critical for improved biogeochemical models and predicting the feedback effects to global change.</p><p>Climate warming and precipitation regime shift can influence soil microbial physiological activities directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schimel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Purcell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sokol et al., 2022</xref>). The Tibetan Plateau is considered among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In such alpine regions, warming can alleviate low temperature limitations to enzymatic activity, stimulating SOC mineralization and microbial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Streit et al., 2014</xref>). Long-term warming reduces soil organic carbon pools and exacerbates carbon limitation of soil microbes, causing a negative effect on microbial growth and eco-physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Purcell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Streit et al., 2014</xref>). Precipitation fluctuation constrains microbial physiological performance and functions, which is expected to be the major consequence of future climate change in mesic grassland ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McHugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oppenheimer-Shaanan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Reduced precipitation affects soil processes notably by directly stressing soil organisms, and also altering the supply of substrates to microbes via dissolution, diffusion, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schimel, 2018</xref>). Increased frequency and magnitude of precipitation events could cause microbial species loss by ‘filtering out’ the taxa with low tolerance to increased soil moisture and drying-rewetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Wallenstein, 2014</xref>). In addition, higher mean annual precipitation (MAP) triggers an increase in SOC decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), which could cause a negative effect on microbial growth in long term. Collectively, climate change typically causes negative consequences on the microbe-associated processes in terrestrial ecosystems.</p><p>As temperature and precipitation are of particular relevance, the interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation remain largely illusive, especially on the population growth of soil microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Drought limits the resistance of the entire system to warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoeppner and Dukes, 2012</xref>). Higher evapotranspiration in a warmer world will result in chronically lower average soil moisture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reich et al., 2018</xref>), further reducing the eco-physiological performance of soil microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schimel, 2018</xref>). In contrast, enhanced precipitation relieves overall water limitations caused by warming and improved primary productivity and soil respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fay et al., 2008</xref>). The responses of microbial population growth to multiple climate factors could be complex because (i) the changed climate conditions can directly affect the eco-physiological characteristics of soil microbes and (ii) indirectly affect microbial functioning by altering soil physicochemical properties (e.g. redox conditions and nutrient allocation) and aboveground plant composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). The response of decomposer growth rates to the interaction of climate factors may be strongly idiosyncratic, varying among taxa, thus making predictions at the ecosystem level difficult.</p><p>The goal of current study is to comprehensively estimate taxon-specific growth responses of soil bacteria following a decade of warming and altered precipitation manipulation on the alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau, by using the <sup>18</sup>O-quantitative stable isotope probing (<sup>18</sup>O-qSIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We focused on the single and interactive effects of temperature (T) and precipitation (P) on the population-specific growth of soil bacteria. We classified the interaction types as additive, synergistic, weak antagonistic, strong antagonistic and neutralizing interactions between climate factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by using the effect sizes and Hedges’ <italic>d</italic> (an estimate of the standardized mean difference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Côté et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harpole et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yue et al., 2017</xref>). We addressed the following hypotheses: (1) long-term warming and altered precipitation regimes (i.e. drought or wet) have negative effects on microbial growth in alpine meadow soils; (2) the interactive effects between warming and altered precipitation on microbial population growth rates are not simply additive.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Field experiment design for simulated warming and altered precipitation, qSIP incubation, and the growth responses of soil bacteria to changing climate regimes.</title><p>To examine the effects of warming and altered precipitation on an alpine grassland ecosystem, two levels of temperature (T<sup>0</sup>, T<sup>+</sup>), and three levels of precipitation (-P, nP, +P) were established in 2011.

The diagram shows that two factors (X and Y) of warming and altered precipitation impact a biological response in the same direction (upper) or have opposing effects on when acting separately. Their combined effect could be additive, that is the sum of the two factor effects. Alternatively, the interaction types can be antagonistic or synergistic.

Here, we estimated microbial growth responses by using the qSIP technique to decadal-long warming and altered precipitation regimes in the alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau, which is considered highly susceptible and vulnerable to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). After a decade of temperature and precipitation regime shift, the pervasive negative impacts of climate factors on soil bacterial growth in alpine grassland ecosystem were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which supports our first hypothesis that long-term warming and altered rainfall events consistently reduce microbial growth. Consistent with our findings, a recent experimental study demonstrated that 15 years of warming reduced the growth rate of soil bacteria in a montane meadow in northern Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Purcell et al., 2022</xref>). These negative effects of climate factors on microbial growth are likely due to the variation related to availability of soil moisture and organic carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).

Carbon is the critical element in cell synthesis, the reduction of microbially accessible carbon pools may explain the diminished microbial growth after long-term warming. In addition, long-term warming can induce soil water deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>), thereby slowing microbial growth.</p><p>Altered rainfall patterns, resulting in increased aridity or wetter conditions, mediate ecosystem cycling by affecting above- and below-ground biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Song et al., 2019</xref>). As soil water availability is reduced, changes in osmotic pressure cause microbial death or dormancy, while others can accumulate solutes to survive under lower water potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schimel, 2018</xref>). However, such accumulation of osmolytes could depend on highly energetic expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schimel et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in less energetic allocation to growth (trade-offs between microbial growth and physiological maintenance). On the other hand, intensified rainfall patterns alter the composition and life strategies of soil bacteria, enriching the taxa with higher tolerance to frequent drying-rewetting cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Wallenstein, 2014</xref>). Such taxa may possess physiological acclimatization, such as synthesizing chaperones to stabilize proteins and thicker cell wall to withstand osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schimel et al., 2007</xref>).

In this study, a decade-long experiment revealed that bacterial growth in alpine meadows is primarily influenced by the antagonistic interaction between T and P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Similarly, a range of ecosystem processes have been revealed to be potentially subject to antagonistic interactions between climate factors, for instance, net primary productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>), soil C storage and nutrient cycling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>). Reduced precipitation can mute organic carbon mineralization by inhibiting soil respiration, which could maintain a relatively adequate soil carbon content and explain the diminished negative effects on microbial growth by the combined manipulation of warming and drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, enhanced precipitation could stimulate SOM decomposition, causing further loss of soil carbon under warming conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). However, increased rainfall can also alleviate the moisture limitation on plant growth induced by warming, increasing plant-derived carbon inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). The increased carbon inputs may alleviate microbial carbon limitation in soil, which partly explains the higher microbial growth rates under the combined treatment of warming and enhanced precipitation than that in the single climate factor treatments.</p><p>The degree of phylogenetic relatedness can indicate the processes that influenced community assembly, like the extent a community is shaped by environmental filtering (clustered by phylogeny) or competitive interactions (life strategy is phylogenetically random distribution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Wallenstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). The results showed that the incorporators whose growth was influenced by the antagonistic interaction of T and P showed significant phylogenetic relatedness, indicating the occurrence of taxa more likely shaped by environment filtering (i.e. selection pressure caused by changes in temperature and moisture conditions). In contrast, the growing taxa affected by synergistic interactions of T and P showed random phylogenetic distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), which may be explained by competition between taxa with similar eco-physiological traits or changes in genotypes (possibly through horizontal gene transfer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Wallenstein, 2014</xref>).

This is, however, still to be verified, as the functional output from PICRUSt2 is less likely to resolve rare environment-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests the development of methods combining qSIP with metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to assess the functional shifts of active microorganisms under global change scenarios. Note that the experimental parameters such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies also have significant effects on the accuracy of growth assessment. This alerts the need to standardize experimental practices to ensure more realistic and reliable results.</p><p>The evaluation of ecosystem models based on results obtained from single-factor experiments usually overestimate or underestimate the impact of global change on ecosystems, because the interactions between climate factors may not be simply additive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dieleman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Our results demonstrated that both warming and altered precipitation negatively affect the growth of grassland bacteria; However, the combined effects of warming and altered precipitation on the growth of ~70% soil bacterial taxa were smaller than the single-factor effects, suggesting antagonistic interaction.

Four ‘V’-shaped transparent polycarbonate resin channels (Teijin Chemical, Japan) were fixed at a 15° angle, above the infrared heaters, to intercept 50% of incoming precipitation throughout the year. The collected rainfall from the drought plots was supplied to the wet plots manually after each precipitation event by sprinklers, increasing precipitation by 50%.

The cumulative growth rates at the phylum-level were estimated as the sum of taxon-specific growth rates of those OTUs affiliated to the same phylum. Significant differences of bacterial growth rates for each group between climate treatments were assessed by two-way ANOVA in R (version 3.6.2).

NTI with values larger than 0 and their p values less than 0.05 represent phylogenetic clustering. The p values of NTI between 0.05 and 0.95 represent random phylogenetic distributions.

In the discussion section there must be some additional caveats introduced to some of the claims the authors are making.

Because other studies may exhibit different results due to the focus on different ecosystem functions as well as environmental conditions. As such, softening of the language is recommended- lines are noted below- and these will not adjust the outcomes of this study, but support more precise interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence to “In this study, a decade-long experiment revealed that bacterial growth in alpine meadows is primarily influenced by the antagonistic interaction between T and P” (Line 497-499).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(32) Picrust analysis is a good way to connect species and their functions, especially Picrust2, which updated the reference database and optimized the algorithm to improve its prediction accuracy (Douglas et al., 2020, Nature Biotechnology). However, the link between microbial taxonomy and microbial metabolism is still not straightforward, especially in diverse microbial communities like soils. The authors should introduce caveats within discussion that they know the limitations of their methods. For context, as a reader who does metabolisms in soils, I found myself somewhat disappointed when piecrust data was introduced and not properly caveated. Particularly, it might be helpful to introduce briefly in the last paragraph of the results. These caveats are necessary to not potentially overstate the author's findings, and to make sure the reader knows the authors understand the very clear limitations of these methods.

It is recommended to make a general summary of the results in the last part of Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a general summary in the last paragraph of DISCUSSION, that is “Our results demonstrated that both warming and altered precipitation negatively affect the growth of grassland bacteria; However, the combined effects of warming and altered precipitation on the growth of ~70% soil bacterial taxa were smaller than the single-factor effects, suggesting antagonistic interaction.

It was found that all climate manipulations had negative effects on microbial growth, and that single-factor manipulations exerted larger negative effects as compared to combined-factor manipulations. The degree of antagonism between factors was analyzed in detail, as well as the differential effect of these divergent antagonistic responses on microbial taxa that incorporated the isotope. Finally, a hypothetical functional profiling was performed based on taxonomic affiliations. This work gives additional evidence that altered warming and precipitation regimes negatively impact microbial growth.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A long term experiment with a thorough experimental design in apparently field conditions is a plus for this work, making the results potentially generalisable to the alpine grassland ecosystem. Also, the implementation of a qSIP approach to determine microbial growth ensures that only active members of the community are assessed. Finally, particular attention was given to the interaction between factors and a robust approach was implemented to quantify the weight of the combined-factor manipulations on microbial growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The methodology does not mention whether the samples taken for the incubations were rhizosphere soil, bulk soil or a mix between both type of soils. If the samples were taken from rhizosphere soil, I wonder how the plants were affected by the infrared heaters and if the resulting shadow (also in the controls with dummy heaters) had an effect on the plants and the root exudates of the parcels as compared to plants outside the blocks? If the samples were bulk soil, are the results generalisable for a grassland ecosystem? In my opinion, it is needed to add more info on the origin of the soil samples and how these were taken.</p></disp-quote><p>The samples taken for the incubations can be considered as a mixture of rhizosphere and bulk soils. During soil sampling, we did not use conventional rhizosphere soil collection methods. However, there is a certain proportion of fragmented roots in the soil samples we collected, indicating that soil properties are influenced by plants. We have added this description in MATERIALS AND METHODS (Line 158).</p><p>To minimize the impact of physical shading on the plants, each sampling point was as far away from infrared heaters as possible. We have added this information of soil collection in MATERIALS AND METHODS, that is “In each plot, three soil cores of the topsoil (0-5 cm in depth) were randomly collected and combined as a composite sample, which can be considered as a mixture of rhizosphere and bulk soils. Each sampling point was as far away from infrared heaters as possible to minimize the impact of physical shading on the plants.

The researchers adopted an experimental approach to assess the impact of climate change on microbial diversity and functionality. This study was carried out within a controlled environment, wherein two primary factors were assessed: temperature (in two distinct levels) and humidity (across three different levels). These factors were manipulated in a full factorial design, resulting in a total of six treatments. This experimental setup was maintained for ten years. To analyze the active microbial community, the researchers employed a technique involving the incorporation of radiolabeled water into biomolecules (particularly DNA) through quantitative stable isotope probing. This allowed for the tracking of the active fraction of microbes, accomplished via isopycnic centrifugation, followed by Illumina sequencing of the denser fraction. This study was followed by a series of statistical analysis to identify the impact of these two variables on the whole community and specific taxonomic groups. The full factorial design arrangement enabled the researchers to discern both individual contributions as well as potential interactions among the variables</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work presents a timely study that assesses in a controlled fashion the potential impact of global warming and altered precipitations on microbial populations. The experimental setup, experimental approach and data analysis seem to be overall solid. I consider the paper of high interest for the whole community as it provides a baseline to the assessment of global warming on microbial diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the encouragement and positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While taxonomic information is interesting, it would have been highly valuable to include transcriptomics data as well. This would allow us to understand what active pathways become enriched under warming and altered precipitations. Non-metabolic OTUs hold significance as well.

The work would have benefited from using more biological replicates of each treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestions.</p><p>(1) Metatranscriptomics can assess the functional profiles of the community, but it has relatively low sensitivity to rare species, which is difficult to correlate the function pathways with the assignment to the numerous active taxa identified by qSIP. Additionally, due to the low DNA concentration, most fractionated samples are difficult to construct sequencing libraries, while amplicon based sequencing analyses were allowed. This study therefore focused on active microbial taxa and their growth in response to multifactorial climate change. We have added the prospect in DISCUSSION, that is “This suggests the development of methods combining qSIP with metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to assess the functional shifts of active microorganisms under global change scenarios” (Line 542-544).</p><p>(2) 18O-qSIP can identify the growing microbial species (i.e., 18O incorporators) in the environment rather than metabolically active taxa. These non-incorporators in our study were likely to be metabolically active, i.e., maintaining life activities without reproduction, or recently deceased (Blazewicz et al., 2013). Therefore, it is hard to distinguish whether these non-incorporators possess metabolic activity.</p><p>(3) Agreed. The qSIP experiments involve the use of isotopes and the sequencing of a large number of DNA samples (90 samples per biological replicate in this study). Considering its high cost, we selected three replicates for analysis. We have explained this issue in MATERIALS AND METHODS, that is “Considering the cost of qSIP experiment (i.e., the use of isotopes and the sequencing of a large number of DNA samples), we randomly selected three out of the six plots, serving as three replicates for each treatment” (Line 154-157).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Nuccio, E.E., Starr, E., Karaoz, U. et al.

Additive interactions are those in which the combined effect size of factors is equal to the sum of the single effects of the factors (i.e., additive expectation, Fig. 1B). Synergistic interactions refer to the effect size was larger than the additive expectation by the combined manipulation of factors. On the contrary, antagonistic interactions refer to the combined effect size of factors is smaller than the additive expectation. In this study, the antagonistic interactions were further divided into three sub-categories: weak antagonistic interaction, strong antagonistic interaction, and neutralizing effect (Fig. 1B). The weak antagonistic interaction refers to the combined effect size smaller than the additive expectation and larger than any of the single factor effects. The strong antagonistic interaction refers to that the combined effect size is smaller than any of the single factor effects but larger than 0. The neutralizing effect refers to that the combined effect size is equal to 0, implying that the effects of different factors cancel each other out.</p><p>Methodologically, the single and combined effects of two climate factors and their interaction effects were calculated by the natural logarithm of response ratio (lnRR) and Hedges’ <italic>d</italic>, respectively (Yue et al., 2017).</p><p>We have added the result interpretation about the phylogenetic distribution patterns of incorporators, that is “The degree of phylogenetic relatedness can indicate the processes that influenced community assembly, like the extent a community is shaped by environmental filtering (clustered by phylogeny) or competitive interactions (life strategy is phylogenetically random distribution) (Evans &amp; Wallenstein, 2014; Webb et al., 2002).The results showed that the incorporators whose growth was influenced by the antagonistic interaction of T and P showed significant phylogenetic relatedness, indicating the occurrence of taxa more likely shaped by environment filtering (i.e., selection pressure caused by changes in temperature and moisture conditions). In contrast, the growing taxa affected by synergistic interactions of T and P showed random phylogenetic distributions (Table S1), which may be explained by competition between taxa with similar eco-physiological traits or changes in genotypes (possibly through horizontal gene transfer) (Evans &amp; Wallenstein, 2014). We also found that the extent of phylogenetic relatedness to which taxa groups of T and P interaction types varied by climate scenarios, suggesting that different climate history processes influenced the ways bacteria survive temperature and moisture stress” (Line 515-529).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Evans, S.E. &amp; Wallenstein, M.D. (2014).

In this process, microorganisms will reduce metabolism, and shift towards a potentially active state (Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov, 2013). A previous study suggested that the potentially active microbial population permanently existing in soil between the active and dormant physiological states. Even under long-term starvation the potentially active microorganisms maintain ‘physiological alertness’ to be ready to occasional substrate input (Blagodatskaya and Kuzyakov, 2013).

This process may cause disturbance to the microbial community. In this study, the soil samples were placed in a thermostatic incubator (14℃ and 16℃), rather than air-drying at 25℃ (as used in most studies). The incubation temperature is relatively low (compared to 25℃) and there is no violent air convection in the incubator, resulting slower evaporation and no significant discoloration caused by severe soil dehydration after 48 h. The process of soil drying in this study simulated the natural phenomenon, i.e., slow water loss in soil.</p><p>We have added the description in MATERIALS AND METHODS, that is “There is no violent air convection in the incubator and the incubation temperature is relatively low (compared to 25℃ used in previous studies), resulting slower evaporation and no significant discoloration caused by severe soil dehydration after 48 h” (Line 171-174).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Blagodatskaya, E. &amp; Kuzyakov, Y.
