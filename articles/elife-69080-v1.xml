In Lepidoptera, aposematic species typically harbour conspicuous opaque wing colour patterns with convergent optical properties among co-mimetic species. Surprisingly, some aposematic mimetic species have partially transparent wings, raising the questions of whether optical properties of transparent patches are also convergent, and of how transparency is achieved. Here, we conducted a comparative study of wing optics, micro and nanostructures in neotropical mimetic clearwing Lepidoptera, using spectrophotometry and microscopy imaging. We show that transparency, as perceived by predators, is convergent among co-mimics in some mimicry rings. Underlying micro- and nanostructures are also sometimes convergent despite a large structural diversity. We reveal that while transparency is primarily produced by microstructure modifications, nanostructures largely influence light transmission, potentially enabling additional fine-tuning in transmission properties. This study shows that transparency might not only enable camouflage but can also be part of aposematic signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lepidoptera</kwd><kwd>mimicry</kwd><kwd>transparency</kwd><kwd>nanostructures</kwd><kwd>aposematism</kwd><kwd>optics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Insects</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0014/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Nipam H</given-names></name><name><surname>Berthier</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>Marianne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE02-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berthier</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name><name><surname>Andraud</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomez</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>Marianne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>France-Berkeley fund grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FBF #2015‐58</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Nipam H</given-names></name><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>Marianne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wing transparency in mimetic butterflies and moths is achieved by an unexpected diversity of structural features, and both structures and light transmission properties of wings are under selection for convergence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are characterised by large wings typically covered by scales, as testified by the name of the order (after the ancient greek <italic>lepís</italic> - scale and <italic>pterón</italic> – wing). Scales can contain pigments or generate structural colours, thereby producing colour patterns across the entire wing. Wing colour patterns are involved in thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dufour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heidrich et al., 2018</xref>), sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kemp, 2007</xref>), and anti-predator defences, such as crypsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Endler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Webster et al., 2009</xref>), masquerade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skelhorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoddard, 2012</xref>), disruptive coloration, and deflection of predator attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vallin et al., 2011</xref>). Another type of anti-predator defence in Lepidoptera involving wing colour pattern is aposematism, where the presence of secondary defences is advertised by the means of bright and contrasted colour patterns. Because of the positive frequency-dependent selection incurred on aposematic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwood and Cotton, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chouteau et al., 2016</xref>), aposematic species often engage in Müllerian mimetic interactions, whereby species exposed to the same suite of predators converge on the same colour pattern and form mimicry ‘rings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Müller, 1879</xref>). Co-mimetic species (species that share a common aposematic colour pattern) are often distantly related, implying multiple independent evolution of the same colour pattern. Among such co-mimetic lepidopteran species, several studies using visual modelling have shown that analogous colour patches (i. e. those occupying a similar position in the wing and harbouring similar colour) cannot be discriminated by birds, believed to be the main predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bybee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llaurens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thurman and Seymoure, 2016</xref>). Therefore, mimicry selects for convergent (when a trait in different species evolves towards the same value) or advergent (when a trait of a given species evolves towards the trait value in another species) colourations, as perceived by predators.</p><p>Surprisingly, although most aposematic Lepidoptera species harbour brightly coloured patterns, some unpalatable (due to the presence of chemical compounds in their body), aposematic species exhibit transparent wing patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClure et al., 2019</xref>). In those species, wing colour pattern typically consists of a mosaic of brightly coloured elements and transparent patches. Notably, in tropical America, many mimicry rings comprise such transparent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beccaloni, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willmott et al., 2017</xref>). Mimicry among species harbouring transparent patches raises the question of selection for convergence in optical properties, as perceived by predators, in those transparent patches.</p><p>A related question is whether transparency in co-mimetic species is achieved by the means of similar structural changes in wings and scales. Previous studies on a handful of species (most of which are not aposematic) have revealed several, non-mutually exclusive means to achieve transparency, through scale modification or scale shedding, with the effect of reducing the total coverage of the chitin membrane by scales. Scales can fall upon adult emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoshida et al., 1996</xref>); they can have a reduced size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dushkina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>) and even resemble bristle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hernández-Chavarría et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>); they can be either flat on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>) or erected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dushkina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>), which also reduces effective membrane coverage by scales. Reducing scale density could also make wings transparent to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez et al., 2021</xref> reported that some Lepidoptera achieve transparency with transparent scales. In addition to scale modifications, the presence of nanostructures on the surface of the wing membrane may enhance transparency through the reduction of light reflection, by generating a gradient of refractive index between the chitin-made membrane and the air allowing better penetration of light through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>). Yet, so far, no study has compared the microstructures (scales) and nanostructures present in transparent patches across co-mimetic species. Furthermore, the diversity of structures described above may lead to a large range of transparency efficiencies. Exploring the link between structural features and optical properties can shed light on whether and how different structures might achieve similar degrees of transparency in the context of mimicry.</p><p>Here, we investigate the transmission properties and the structural bases of wing transparency in a community of 62 Neotropical Lepidoptera species belonging to seven families and representing 10 distinct mimicry rings. All mimicry rings contain species with transparent wings, but in a few of them some co-mimics have opaque wings, or nearly so (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for the illustration of this transparency gradient). We characterise wing micro- and nanostructures with digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and measure transmission properties of transparent patches using spectrophotometry in the range of wavelengths 300–700 nm, visible to both Lepidoptera and their avian predators. We implement comparative analyses that account for phylogenetic relatedness, to (1) examine the putative convergence or advergence (hereafter, convergence, for the sake of simplicity) among co-mimetic species in visual appearance of transparent patches as seen by bird predators, (2) identify and examine the putative convergence of structures involved in transparency in the different co-mimetic species and finally (3) explore the links between structural features and transmission properties of transparent patches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Convergence among co-mimics in visual appearance of transparent patches as seen by bird predators</title><p>To assess whether transparent patches of co-mimetic species were under selection for convergence due to mimicry, we tested whether these transparent patches were more similar, as perceived by predators, among co-mimetic species than expected (1) at random, and (2) given the phylogeny. The first test, which assesses whether predators have a similar perception of analogous transparent patches in co-mimetic species, informs on the selection on transparent patches incurred by predators. The second test, which accounts for the phylogenetic relationship between species, informs on the underlying process leading to similarity, and specifically on whether any case of similarity among co-mimics detected in the first test is due to shared ancestry or to evolutionary convergence. We used spectrophotometry to measure specular transmittance of the transparent patches, which is a quantitative measurement of transparency. As birds are assumed to be the main predators of butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brower, 1984</xref>), we applied bird perceptual vision modelling on the resulting spectra to calculate the chromatic and achromatic contrasts (respectively dS and dL) for each pair of species from our dataset. If transparent patches among co-mimetic species are more similar than expected at random or given the phylogeny, contrasts between pairs of co-mimetic species are expected to be smaller than predicted at random and given the phylogeny, respectively. We only compared analogous spots (i.e. occupying a similar position on the forewing) between species. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that for three spots out of five and across all mimicry rings the difference in achromatic contrast (dL) between co-mimetic species is significantly smaller than expected both at random and given the phylogenetic distances between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), irrespective of the illuminating light or the visual system considered (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a and b</xref> for results under the full range of conditions). Differences in chromatic contrasts (dS) between co-mimetic species are marginally significantly smaller than expected at random and given the phylogenetic distance between species only for the most proximal spot on the forewing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). These results mean that, on average, predators see transparent patches among co-mimetic species as more similar than among species that belong to different mimicry rings. The fact that these tests remain significant (dL) or marginally so (dS) with the phylogenetic correction indicates that such similarity in transparent patches is due to convergent evolution. When looking more precisely at similarity between co-mimetic species for each individual mimicry ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we show that in six out of 10 mimicry rings achromatic contrasts (dL) between co-mimetic species are smaller than expected at random for at least one spot on the forewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After accounting for the phylogeny, this figure drops down to two out of 10 mimicry rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two additional mimicry rings showed evidence for convergence, but not increased similarity. Regarding chromatic contrasts (dS), six mimicry rings out of 10 comprise co-mimetic species exhibiting smaller chromatic contrast than expected at random and three out of them comprise co-mimetic species with smaller chromatic contrast than expected given the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that in some cases the similarity in transparent patches between co-mimetic species is due to convergent evolution but we cannot rule out that for some mimicry rings (notably ‘theudelinda’, ‘hewitsoni’, ‘panthyale’) similarity could be due to shared ancestry. A lack of statistical power may also explain why we do not find any convergence or similarity for some mimicry rings as many of these mimicry rings only comprises two (e.g ‘blue’ mimicry ring) to three (e.g. ‘hewitsoni’ mimicry ring) species in our dataset. Achromatic aspects (achromatic contrast dL) appear more significant than chromatic aspects (chromatic contrast dS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a,b</xref>), suggesting that selection may act more on broadband transmittance (which is related to the degree of transparency) than on colour in transparent patches.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Test of convergence of transmission properties between co-mimetic species.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69080-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Results of the test of convergence of achromatic (dL) contrasts for each mimicry ring.</title><p>All the visual systems (VS and UVS) and the illuminants (large gap ‘lg’ and forest shade ‘fs’) tested are presented. For each spot measured on the forewing and for each mimicry ring (see figure on top of the table), the mean achromatic contrast has been compared to what is expected at random (1st column highlighted in grey for each mimicry ring, p-value corrected for multiple testing with ‘Holm’ method in brackets) and to what is expected according to the phylogeny (2nd column for each mimicry ring, p-value corrected for multiple testing with ‘Holm’ method in brackets). Mean achromatic contrasts statistically different from what is expected at random or given the phylogeny are highlighted in bold. To test whether mean achromatic contrast between co-mimetic species of a given mimicry ring is smaller to what is expected at random, we randomised the value of the achromatic contrast 10,000 times over each pair of species, we calculated the mean achromatic contrast for these co-mimetic species for each randomisation and we calculated the p-value as the proportion of randomisations where the mean achromatic contrast for co-mimics is smaller than the observed mean achromatic contrast. To test whether the mean achromatic contrast between co-mimetic species of a given mimicry ring is smaller than what might be expected given their phylogenetic relationship, we did a linear model between achromatic contrasts and phylogenetic distances to account for the effect of phylogeny on the achromatic contrast and we considered the mean of residuals for co-mimetic species of a given mimicry ring. If co-mimetic species are more similar than expected according to the phylogeny, the mean of residuals should be negative. To test whether the mean of residuals is smaller than expected according to the phylogeny, we randomised residuals over all pair of species and we calculated the mean of residuals for co-mimetic species of a given mimicry ring. We calculated ‘p-value with phylogenetic correction’ as the proportion of randomisations where the mean of residuals is smaller than the observed mean of residuals. Each spot measured is localised on the forewing and the results of the test are represented by the colour of the spot. Black spots stand for spots that are neither more similar than expected at random nor convergent (more similar when phylogenetic relationships are accounted for) between co-mimetic species. Blue spots stand for spots that are not more similar than expected at random but which are convergent because they are more similar that what might be expected according to their phylogenetic distance.

Even though this result does not hold for each mimicry ring considered is this study, likely because of a lack of statistical power and/or because some mimicry rings comprise only closely related species, our results suggest that transparent patches in co-mimetic species can be under selection for convergence, mirroring what has been shown for coloured patches in opaque species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bybee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llaurens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thurman and Seymoure, 2016</xref>). This convergent resemblance, which regards mainly the degree of transparency (a general term to refer to what extent a patch appears transparent), suggests that transparent patches might be part of the aposematic signal. Nevertheless, convergence in properties of transparent patches may also result from other selective processes. Transparency is also involved in crypsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias et al., 2020b</xref>), even in aposematic prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClure et al., 2019</xref>), and the degree of transparency needed to achieve crypsis may depend on the ambient light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnsen and Widder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias et al., 2020a</xref>). Specifically, in bright environments only highly transparent prey are cryptic, whereas in darker environments moderately transparent prey can be cryptic. In our case, as co-mimetic species share their habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chazot et al., 2014</xref>) and microhabitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willmott et al., 2017</xref>), characterised by a specific ambient light, we cannot rule out that the similarity in the degree of transparency observed between co-mimetic species is the result of selection for crypsis rather than aposematism. Moreover, habitat-specific conditions, such as temperature or humidity, could also affect the evolution of transparent patches. Therefore, we cannot rule out that the observed convergence is driven by such abiotic factors (related to thermoregulation for example) instead of predation pressure. However, several studies on Ithomiini butterflies have shown that multiple mimicry rings usually coexist in the same localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beccaloni, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chazot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willmott et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the species belonging to the mimicry rings ‘banjana-m’, ‘panthyale’, ‘hewitsoni’, and ‘theudelinda’ are all high-altitude species that are found in the same localities, and are therefore exposed to the same environmental conditions (ambient light, temperature, humidity). The fact that co-occurring chemically defended species that belong to different mimicry rings differ in transmission properties of their transparent patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggests that the convergence observed is likely driven by Müllerian mimicry, and is not only the result of selection for crypsis or local adaptation to abiotic factors.</p><p>This study therefore challenges our vision of transparency, which might have evolved under multiple selective pressures in aposematic butterflies. Transparency has been shown to be involved in camouflage and to decrease detectability by predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias et al., 2020b</xref>), even in aposematic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, our results suggest that transparent patches might also participate in the aposematic signal and that selection acts on the transmission properties of these patches, particularly on the degree of transparency, but also on chromatic aspects to some extent. Therefore, transparent aposematic Lepidoptera benefit from a double protection from predation, which can act at different distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cuthill, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tullberg et al., 2005</xref>): transparent aposematic species are less detectable than opaque species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClure et al., 2019</xref>), but when detected they may be recognized as unpalatable by experienced predators, due to their aposematic wing pattern, and spared by those predators.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structural features underlying transparency</title><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Diversity of structures underlying transparency</title><p>We revealed an unexpected diversity of structures underlying transparency.

Here, we describe some species with coloured erected scales that are completely perpendicular to the wing membrane, such as in the ithomiine <italic>Methona curvifascia</italic>, and some species with transparent scales. Both these features were reported in transparent Lepidoptera only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>).

However, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>, who studied a large number of transparent species with a wide range of ecologies and belonging to 31 families, our study is restricted to mimetic transparent butterflies and, as such, spans a relatively small number of families. Scales in Lepidoptera are not only involved in colour patterns but also play a role in hydrophobicity. The scale modifications underlying transparency described in our study may impair the waterproofing properties of wings, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref> the wing of the translucent papilionid <italic>Parnassius glacialis</italic> are less hydrophobic than most Lepidoptera wings. Transparency may therefore come at a cost, especially for tropical Lepidoptera living in humid environments.</p><p>We also revealed an unexpected diversity of nanostructures covering the wing membrane, which we classify into five categories: absence of nanostructures, maze-like, nipple arrays, sponge-like and pillar-shaped nanostructures. While nipple arrays and pillars have previously been described on the wing of the sphingid <italic>Cephonodes hylas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>) and in the nymphalid <italic>Greta oto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>), respectively, maze-like nanostructures have only been reported on the corneal surface of insect eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the sponge-like type of nanostructures is reported here for the first time. Those nanostructures can be related to the classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>: pillars are a subcategory of nipple arrays, with higher and more densely packed nipples with enlarged bases; sponge-like nanostructures are similar to dimples (holes embedded in a matrix), although with much bigger and more profound holes. Nipples, mazes and dimples have been found to be produced by Turing’s reaction-diffusion models, a solid framework that explains pattern formation in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turing, 1952</xref>). Theoretical models of nanostructure formation in a tri-dimensional space and developmental studies are needed to understand the process by which nanostructures are laid on butterfly wing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pomerantz et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Link between structural features and transmission properties</title><p>The diversity of structures underlying transparency described above raises the question of whether these different structures confer different visual aspects. We indeed showed that mean transmittance over 300–700 nm, which is a proxy of the degree of transparency, depends on several structural features: scale type, scale density, nanostructure density, wing membrane thickness and scale colour. To summarise, mean transmittance increases when membrane coverage decreases, either due to reduced scale surface and/or scale density, because there is less material interacting (reflecting, diffusing, or absorbing) with light. Mean transmittance also increases when nanostructure density increases. Light transmission is indeed negatively correlated to light reflection and nanostructures are known to have anti-reflective properties, as demonstrated in the sphingid <italic>Cephonodes hylas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>) and in the nymphalid <italic>Greta oto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>). Reflection increases as the difference in refractive index between air and organic materials increases. Nanostructures create a gradient of refractive index between air and wing tissue, and gradient efficiency in reducing reflection increases with a smooth increase in proportion of chitin inside the nanostructures. For instance, pillars with conical bases are more effective at cancelling reflection than cylinders because cones produce a smoother air:chitin gradient from air to wing than cylinders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2015</xref>). Nanostructure shape is thus important in creating a smooth gradient. In our case, nanostructure density is highly correlated to nanostructure type, which we have defined according to their shape (phylogenetic ANOVA on nanostructure density with nanostructure type as factor: <italic>F</italic> = 26.26, p-value = 0.001, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3d and e</xref> for details). Specifically, the nanostructures whose shape likely creates the smoother gradient (pillar and sponge) are also the denser ones. This can explain why nanostructure type is not retained in our models because variation in mean transmittance is already explained by nanostructure density, a quantitative variable. When nanostructure density increases, light reflection thus decreases. Light can either be transmitted, reflected or absorbed, and assuming that the chitin wing membrane only absorbs a small amount of light between 300 and 700 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stavenga et al., 2014</xref>), when light reflection decreases because of the presence of nanostructures light transmission necessarily increases, which explains the positive effect of nanostructure density on mean transmittance.</p><p>We showed that mean transmittance decreases when membrane thickness increases, because wing membrane is mainly made of chitin and even if chitin absorbs a little amount of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stavenga et al., 2014</xref>), thicker membranes, which contain more chitin, absorb more light than thinner ones, thereby reducing light transmission.</p><p>We finally showed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>, that wings covered with transparent scales transmit more light than wings covered with coloured scales. This is due to the presence of pigments, such as melanins or ommochromes commonly found in butterfly scales, which absorb some part of the light spectrum, thereby reducing light transmission.</p><p>Given the high structural diversity uncovered, future studies should thoroughly quantify the relative contributions of micro and nanostructures on the produced optical effects, notably on reflection in transparent patches, which may encourage bio-inspired applications for transparent materials.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>Selection on optical properties as a potential driver of the evolution of structures</title><p>We showed that transmission properties are convergent among co-mimetic species and that they depend on the underlying structural features, which confer peculiar visual aspects, raising the question of the putative convergence of structural features among co-mimetic species. We indeed showed that despite the high phylogenetic signal of structures underlying transparency that points to the existence of developmental constraints, both micro- and nanostructural features are convergent among co-mimetic species for some mimicry rings. Convergence is also detected for structural syndrome (i.e. association between micro- and nanostructures). Our data suggest that nanostructures are more labile than microstructures. Nanostructures could therefore evolve more readily in response to selection on the degree of transparency. We showed that the presence and higher densities of nanostructures increase mean transmittance when scale density is already low, thereby allowing fine-tuning of transparency. The interplay between scales and nanostructures can thus modulate the degree of transparency and the selective pressures on the transmission properties of transparent patches may select specific associations of structural features.</p><p>To conclude, this study reveals convergence of transparency features in aposematic mimetic Lepidoptera, which may be the result of selection by predators, likely through aposematism, even though transparent patches may also be under other local selection pressures such as selection for crypsis or adaptation to climatic conditions. Transparency entails strong structural modifications of scales that might impair other functions such as thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berthier, 2005</xref>), hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwyn et al., 2009</xref>) and perhaps mate signalling. Transparency may therefore come at a cost in those large-winged insects, which may explain why it is not pervasive among Lepidoptera.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>For further details about materials and methods see the Materials and methods section in the Appendix.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Material</title><p>In this study, we focus on 62 different species represented by one or two specimens collected with hand nets in understory forests in Peru and Ecuador, by ourselves and private collectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). The choice of species (and therefore the sample size) was dictated by the availability of specimens that could be imaged in SEM, and therefore destroyed (which precludes using collection specimens). We attempted to maximise the number of mimicry rings, the number of species within mimicry rings, and the phylogenetic diversity within mimicry rings. The selected species belong to seven different families (Nymphalidae, Riodinidae, Pieridae, Papilionidae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Geometridae) and represent 10 different mimicry rings, following the classification used in Ithomiini: ‘agnosia’, ‘aureliana’, ‘banjana-m’, ‘confusa’, ‘eurimedia’, ‘hewitsoni’, ‘lerida’, ‘panthyale’, ‘theudelinda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chazot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willmott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Willmott and Mallet, 2004</xref>).

Moreover, we checked that there were not significant differences between ventral and dorsal sides regarding main structural features (see Appendix and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3f,g and h</xref>). We defined as scale type the interaction between scale form and scale insertion (erected lamellar scale, flat lamellar scale and piliform scale).

We also determined for each species the structural syndrome, defined as the association between micro- and nanostructural features. On a subset of 3 species, we measured 10 specimens per species, each specimen being measured twice for density and five times for scale dimensions.

The p-value was calculated as the proportion of randomisations where the calculated mean distance for co-mimetic species was smaller than the observed mean distance. The result of this test allows us to determine whether co-mimetic species are perceived as similar by their main predators, irrespectively of the evolutionary underlying mechanism, which can be either shared ancestry of convergent evolution. To disentangle the two possible mechanisms, we accounted for the phylogenetic relationship between species by performing a linear regression between phenotypic distances and phylogenetic distances for each pair of species, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elias et al., 2008</xref>. Pairs of species below the regression line (with a negative residual) are phenotypically more similar than expected given the phylogeny. To test whether pairs of co-mimetic species were mostly below the regression line, we calculated the observed mean residuals for co-mimetic species and we compared it to a null distribution of mean residuals for co-mimetic species, where residuals have been randomised 10,000 times over the 1891 possible pairs of species. The p-value was calculated as the proportion of randomisations where the calculated mean residuals were smaller than the observed mean residuals for co-mimetic species.

For each model, we give: the F statistic with the degrees of freedom in indices, the p-value of the model (in brackets), the corrected Akaike criterion (AICc) of the model, the adjusted R² and the value of lambda branch length transformation which has been estimated by maximum likelihood given the statistical model linking traits. When λ equals 1, the branch length of the phylogeny is unchanged, whereas when λ equals 0 branch length is set to zero, meaning that all species are considered independent. The ‘p-values’ for the value of λ, given in brackets, are the probability that λ is equal to 0 or to 1. We also give for each model the value of the coefficient estimate for each variable tested and the p-value (in brackets) is represented with the follow symbols: '***': p &lt; 0.001; '**': p &lt; 0.01; '*': p &lt; 0.05; '<bold>.'</bold> : p &lt; 0.1; 'n.s.': not significantly different from 0. NA means that the variable was not retained in the model.</p><p>(<bold>f</bold>) Technical repeatability of transmission measurements and structural features. For each grouping factor (either the number of species or the number of individuals or the total number of different spots measured; indicated in the ‘number of groups’ column), we calculated the value of repeatability R based on several measurements of the same element of a grouping factor. The calculation of repeatability is based on mixed linear models. Confidence intervals are calculated with parametric bootstraping and p-values (associated to the test <italic>R</italic> &gt; 0) are calculated with two methods: with likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood of the model with and without the tested random effect and with permutation tests. We also calculated the coefficient of variation (CV, as the mean of the group devided by the standard error) for each group and we give here the median value of the CV distribution.</p><p>(<bold>g</bold>) Biological repeatability of transmission measurements and structural features. For each grouping factor (either the number of species, or the number of different spots measured per species; indicated in the ‘number of groups’ column), we calculated the value of repeatability R based on several measurements of the same element of a grouping factor. The calculation of repeatability is based on mixed linear model. Confidence intervals are calculated with parametric bootstraping and p-values (associated to the test <italic>R</italic> &gt; 0) are calculated with two methods: with likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood of the model with and without the tested random effect and with permutation tests. We also calculated the coefficient of variation (CV, as the mean of the group devided by the standard error) for each group and we give here the median value of the CV distribution.</p><p>(<bold>h</bold>) Similarity between conspecific individuals for chromatic and achromatic contrasts. To test whether conspecific individuals were perceived as more similar than expected at random for each spot on the forewing, we randomised the contrasts over all pair of species and we calculated the mean distance for conspecific individuals. We compared the mean phenotypic distance (either chromatic or achromatic contrast) for the observed data to the distribution of mean phenotypic distance calculated for 10,000 randomisations and we calculated the p-value as the number of randomisations where mean phenotypic distance was smaller than the observed phenotypic distance. We conclude that conspecific individuals are perceived as more similar than expected at random, implying that any individual is representative of its species.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69080-supp1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Supplementary files related to phylogenetic reconstruction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Information on specimens used to infer a phylogeny. </p><p>(<bold>b</bold>) Node constraints used to calibrate the phylogeny.

To improve phylogeny topology, we added 35 species representing eight additional families to the dataset. When no sequence was available for a particular species on Genbank, we sequenced de novo the COI, CAD and MDH genes of that species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We have missing data for some species, but we had at least the COI sequence for each species considered.</p><p>For de novo sequencing, DNA was extracted from butterfly legs with a DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (QIAGEN laboratory) and targeted genes were amplified with PCR conditions adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahlberg and Wheat, 2008</xref>. COI, CAD and MDH were amplified in two pieces with the primers described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahlberg and Wheat, 2008</xref>. PCR were performed in a volume of 25 µL with 2–4 µL of genomic DNA, 1 µL of each primer at a concentration of 100 pmol/µL, 1 µL of nucleotides at a concentration of 2 mM, 2.5 µL of DreamTaq buffer, 0.125 µL of DreamTaq polymerase. The elongation phase was reduced to 70 seconds. For CAD and MDH, the annealing temperature was reduced to 50 °C for most specimens. Eurofins Genomics sequenced the PCR products with Sanger method.</p><p>Sequences were aligned with CodonCodeAligner (version 3.7.1.1, CodonCode Corporation, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.codoncode.com/">http://www.codoncode.com/</ext-link>) and concatenated with PhyUtility (version 2.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Dunn, 2008</xref>). The dataset was then partitioned by gene and codon positions and the best models of substitution were selected over all models implemented in BEAST, using the ‘greedy’ algorithm and linked rates implemented in Partition Finder 1.0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lanfear et al., 2012</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref> for best scheme).

We constrained some clades to be monophyletic (notably Ithomiini, Danainae, Nymphalidae, Riodinidae, Pieridae, Papilionidae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Geometridae, Noctuoidae, Papilionoidae) and we calibrated the crown age and divergence time of some groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawahara et al., 2019</xref>. Four independent analyses were run for 50 million generations, with one Monte Carlo Markov chain each and a sampling frequency of one out of 50,000 generations (resulting in 1,000 posterior trees). After checking for convergence of the two best analyses, the posterior distributions of these two runs were combined (using logCombiner 1.8.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>), with a burnin of 10 %. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree with median node ages was computed using TreeAnnotator 1.8.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It would be helpful to clarify some of those points. In particular, the sentence starting on line 385 is unclear &quot;Transparent scales have already been reported in the opaque papilionid Graphium sarpedon (Stavenga et al., 2010) and as Gomez et al. (2020, in review) we are describing them for the first time in transparent Lepidoptera.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Pinna et al. used spectrophotometry, comparative methods, and microscopy to investigate the convergent evolution of transparent wing patches across 10 groups of Mullerian mimics. The authors provide abundant new data on the micro- and nanostructures of transparent wing patches, potentially offering insights into necessary features of transparent wings and forming a comparative dataset to investigate tradeoffs associated with transparency. In addition, the authors claim that transparent wing patches are more similar within mimicry rings than expected based on phylogenetic distance in support of the hypothesis that transparent wing patches may form part of the aposematic signal in these Lepidopterans. While the question is an interesting one, there are major concerns about the spectrophotometric methods used to collect transmittance data and whether the existing data supports the authors' claim.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1) Transmittance data forms the foundation of most of the analyses in this paper, however the reported transmittance measurements reveal either flawed methodology or a flawed premise. Many wing patches measured here have transmittance values of &lt;10% (including some with transmittance &lt;1%), which would make these wing patches opaque, if the data are accurate. This issue may be caused by the spectrophotometric technique used. By measuring the transmittance of an object that is not flat with several centimeters between the object and the detector, small amounts of scattering or refraction can lead to large errors in measured transmittance. For example, a glass prism in a similar experimental set up would lead to a measurement of ~0% transmittance, despite being perfectly transparent. Without accurate transmittance data, it is difficult to evaluate the strength of the authors' claims.</p><p>2) Beyond the issues with the transmittance data, it is not clear that the authors' conclusions are well supported by the data. When investigating the convergence of transmission properties, the pooled dataset of all species seems to demonstrate convergence across 4/5 wing patches, but when broken out by mimicry ring the story is different. Only 2/10 mimicry rings show evidence of convergence in at least 5/10 comparisons (5 chromatic, 5 achromatic comparisons per group). Conversely, 4/10 mimicry rings show no evidence of convergence. The discussions of the findings within the manuscript seem to focus heavily on the pooled data and do not discuss the substantial differences in evidence for convergence across mimicry rings.</p><p>3) Similar to the investigation of convergent transmission properties, the tests for micro- and nanostructure convergence seem to show substantial differences across mimicry rings. Despite the pooled data showing convergence in scale scale type, only 2/10 mimicry rings show evidence for scale type convergence. Focused on nanostructures, 5/10 mimicry rings show evidence for nanostructure convergence, but the authors' analyses later in the manuscript demonstrate that nanostructure type has no effect on transmittance in any of the 8 retained models.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The authors have generated an exciting comparative dataset of the micro- and nanoscale scale features that may be involved in transparency in Lepidoptera. Datasets comprised of this many species are uncommon in biophotonics. Further quantification of these structures paired with accurate transmittance data could provide a number of insights into the structural basis of terrestrial transparency, a less well understood phenomenon than aquatic transparency.</p><p>My primary recommendation for improving the manuscript center around the collection of transmittance data. To reduce the effects of scattering and refraction on the measurement, it is necessary to reduce the distance between the emitting and collecting probes to as little as possible. Over a 7cm distance, even small errors (2 degrees or less) can drastically affect the result. Another potential option is to use integrating spheres on both sides of the wing to collect transmittance regardless of whether light was scattered or not.</p><p>It would also be useful to the reader to see a discussion of the differences between the pooled results and the convergence results within each mimicry ring. There are potentially interesting reasons for why one might find convergence in some groups and not others, but those are not explored in the manuscripts current form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69080.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

In particular, the sentence starting on line 385 is unclear “Transparent scales have already been reported in the opaque papilionid Graphium sarpedon (Stavenga et al., 2010) and as Gomez et al. (2020, in review) we are describing them for the first time in transparent Lepidoptera.”</p></disp-quote><p>Both papers (Gomez et al. and this one) were initially submitted almost simultaneously. Both papers reveal transparent scales in clearwing Lepidoptera (Stavenga et al. 2010 did report transparent scales, but in an opaque species), but only our paper submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> reports sponge-like nanostructures. Since Gomez et al. is now published in Ecological Monographs, we do not claim anymore to be the first to reveal transparent scales and we modified the sentences in the discussion (lines 338-339) as well as in the introduction (lines 84-85).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Pinna et al. used spectrophotometry, comparative methods, and microscopy to investigate the convergent evolution of transparent wing patches across 10 groups of Mullerian mimics. The authors provide abundant new data on the micro- and nanostructures of transparent wing patches, potentially offering insights into necessary features of transparent wings and forming a comparative dataset to investigate tradeoffs associated with transparency. In addition, the authors claim that transparent wing patches are more similar within mimicry rings than expected based on phylogenetic distance in support of the hypothesis that transparent wing patches may form part of the aposematic signal in these Lepidopterans. While the question is an interesting one, there are major concerns about the spectrophotometric methods used to collect transmittance data and whether the existing data supports the authors' claim.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1) Transmittance data forms the foundation of most of the analyses in this paper, however the reported transmittance measurements reveal either flawed methodology or a flawed premise. Many wing patches measured here have transmittance values of &lt;10% (including some with transmittance &lt;1%), which would make these wing patches opaque, if the data are accurate. This issue may be caused by the spectrophotometric technique used. By measuring the transmittance of an object that is not flat with several centimeters between the object and the detector, small amounts of scattering or refraction can lead to large errors in measured transmittance. For example, a glass prism in a similar experimental set up would lead to a measurement of ~0% transmittance, despite being perfectly transparent. Without accurate transmittance data, it is difficult to evaluate the strength of the authors' claims.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is concerned about the validity of our transmittance measurements, performed using fibres placed several centimetres apart. Below we provide new data and arguments for why we believe our measurements are robust. We also make clearer that patches with very low transmittance are opaque, or nearly so.</p><p>Collimated fibres and specular transmission</p><p>As stated in the previous version (Material and methods in the Appendix, l.49 and l.51), the fibres are collimated over a distance of 11 cm, meaning that the light beam is parallel along 11 cm and that light divergence is negligible over this distance. In our setting, the fibres are 22 cm apart, meaning that the distance between the fibres and the sample is 11 cm (now corrected in the ‘Spectrophotometry’ subsection of the material and methods section in the Appendix, l.53). We indeed mistakenly stated in the previous supplementary material that the fibres were 14 cm apart because 14 cm is the graduation of the position of the fibre. However, the sample is placed at a graduation of 25 cm, meaning that the distance between the fibres and the sample is 11 cm.</p><p>Regarding potential light scattering by the wing material, we recall that in this paper we are interested in specular transmission, which is the definition of transparency, and which is also more biologically relevant, since this is what predators perceive, and not total transmission. The collecting fibre only collects light transmitted in its direction, which is what we need. As the wing membrane is thinner than 2 μm, we assume that no refraction can deviate the light beam enough so as it is not collected by the collecting fibre.</p><p>Repeatability</p><p>In the previous version we showed data on repeatability, estimated on 19 species (either the same specimen measured several times and/or different specimens of the same species measured one time, see ‘Spectrophotometry’ subsection in the ‘Materials and methods’ section of the Appendix in the manuscript, l.87). For each measure, samples were taken and placed between the fibres (when the same sample was measured multiple times, it was repeatedly removed and replaced). Although we placed each sample perpendicularly to the fibres, we may expect small variations in the incident angle of the membrane with fibres if the wing is not perfectly flat. Yet, despite such variation, measurements are repeatable at different levels (species and spots), meaning that variation in orientation induced by placing the specimen, if any, does not affect the result and that the measurements are reliable.</p><p>Additional measurements to assess the robustness of our data</p><p>To further assess the robustness of our measurements with regard to distances between fibres and incident angle, we selected 8 species such as to maximize the diversity in macroscopic aspect of their transparent patches and the diversity of structures (one specimen per species):</p><p>On each specimen, we performed measurements at one point (the fourth spot as represented on figure 1 in the manuscript), at different distances (at 11, 9, 7, 5, and 4 cm, which is the shortest distance possible on our device) and at different incidence angles between the sample and the fibres (every 2° from -10° to 10°, which was visually far beyond any accidental variation in sample positioning, as for the original measurements of the study we ensured the sample was set perpendicular to the axis of fibres). Hence, for each species, we obtained a total of 55 spectra (5 distances and 11 angles for the same specimen). We extracted the mean transmittance (B2) for each spectrum, and we explored the effect of distance and incident angle on mean transmittance by applying a linear model, where mean transmittance B2 was the response variable and with species, distance, incident angle and their interaction as explanatory variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Results of the linear model linking mean transmittance (B2) with species, distance and incident angle between fibres and the wing sample and the interaction between incident angle and distance (F<sub>10, 429</sub> = 2691, p-value &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub> = 0.984).</title><p>Species are represented by their initials (GP: Godyris panthyale, IA: Ithomia agnosia, OO: Oleria onega, EN: Eresia nauplius, HE: Hyalurga egeon, IF: Ithomiola floralis, MC: Methona curvifascia, PIER1: Pieridae 1).

As expected, the variable <bold>‘</bold>species<bold>’</bold> has a strong – and in fact, the strongest – effect on mean transmittance, as different species (each represented by a single specimen in our test) harbour different degrees of transparency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) .</p><p>Distance between fibres and wing sample also has a significant effect on mean transmittance: mean transmittance tends to slightly decrease as distance between fibres and wing sample increases. However, the effect size associated with distance between fibres and sample is much smaller than the effect size associated with species (0.02 for distance against 1.19 to 18.55 for species), meaning that species effect is at least 59 times higher than the distance effect (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> to visualise differences between measurements within the same species and differences between species). Moreover, we can see on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> that the effect of distance on mean transmittance is different from one species to another, meaning that there is no systematic underestimation or overestimation of transmittance values for a given distance. For example, for scattering species (<italic>Hyalurga egeon</italic> and <italic>Oleria onega</italic>), distance tends to increase mean transmittance while for highly to moderately transparent species (<italic>Godyris panthyale</italic>, <italic>Ithomia agnosia</italic>, <italic>Ithomiola floralis</italic>), distance tends to decrease mean transmittance. Contrarily to what was stated by reviewer 3, there is no extinction of transmittance with distance between fibres and there is no optimal distance for measuring wing transmittance, as long as the same distance is used for every measurement.</p><p>Based on the results of the linear model, incident angle does not have any significant global effect on mean transmittance (non-significant effect of incident angle in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref>). Even though mean transmittance can vary with incident angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), this variation is different from one species to another, meaning that there is no systematic trend overall. Moreover, the range of angles we explored in this new measurement session is much wider than the range of angles that was included in the actual measurements (which was due to small errors in wing positioning and wing roughness). This means that the small variation in angle in our original dataset has virtually no effect on our transmittance measurements.</p><p>Finally, the coefficient associated with the interaction between distance and angle is significantly different from zero and is negative, meaning that when the distance between fibres and sample increases the effect of angle decreases. While the analysis of the distance effect showed no optimal distance, the analysis of the incident angle effect shows that measurements gain in accuracy by placing the fibres further apart. Hence, our chosen distance was better in optimizing both the effects of distance and angle.</p><p>To conclude, based on the fact that fibres are collimated, that our measurements are repeatable, and that the effect of distance and incident angle are respectively modest and nil compared to the effect of species, we argue that the spectrophotometric method we use is reliable, reproducible and robust and that our measurements are accurate.</p><p>Low transmission values and opaque species</p><p>We had not made it very clear in the previous version of our article but some of the co-mimetic species are actually opaque or almost so, and transmittance values below 10% correspond to such opaque patches. Specifically, some of the mimicry rings (‘eurimedia’ mimicry ring for example) comprise opaque species, resembling transparent, yet coloured species from another lineage. For ‘agnosia’ mimicry ring, many species (mainly riodinids) ‘fake’ transparency using white patches and dark veins. We now make clearer in the introduction (l. 96-101) and in the material and method section (l.456-457) that some specimens are opaque. We also added supplementary figure to show the range of macroscopic transparency in our dataset (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). Finally, we added the information in the ‘Transparency status’ column in the supplementary file 1d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Beyond the issues with the transmittance data, it is not clear that the authors' conclusions are well supported by the data. When investigating the convergence of transmission properties, the pooled dataset of all species seems to demonstrate convergence across 4/5 wing patches, but when broken out by mimicry ring the story is different. Only 2/10 mimicry rings show evidence of convergence in at least 5/10 comparisons (5 chromatic, 5 achromatic comparisons per group). Conversely, 4/10 mimicry rings show no evidence of convergence. The discussions of the findings within the manuscript seem to focus heavily on the pooled data and do not discuss the substantial differences in evidence for convergence across mimicry rings.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that evidence for convergence only applies to some mimicry rings, patches and conditions, but we think this already provides evidence that selection can act on transparency too, and therefore that in those mimicry rings transparency is part of the aposematic signal.</p><p>Also note that our study has relatively little power, given that some mimicry rings only contain 2 (e.g. ‘blue’ mimicry ring) or 3 (e.g. ‘hewitsoni’ mimicry ring) species, and some only contain closely related species (‘hewitsoni’, ‘panthyale’ and ‘theudelinda’ mimicry rings only comprise Ithomiini species). Therefore, we may have underestimated the importance of convergence in transmittance in mimetic Lepidoptera.</p><p>Following this remark, we toned down the discussion to account for the fact that convergence is not detected in all rings (l.281-284), and we now add a statement on why some mimicry rings show convergence and others do not in the Results section (l. 161-164). We also modified our title to &quot;Mimicry <bold>can</bold> drive convergence in structural and light transmission features of transparent wings in Lepidoptera&quot;.</p><p>We don’t see the fact that convergence does not apply to all patches or both types of contrast as an issue: selection is at play, even when it exerts to only some occurrences and aspects of transparency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similar to the investigation of convergent transmission properties, the tests for micro- and nanostructure convergence seem to show substantial differences across mimicry rings. Despite the pooled data showing convergence in scale scale type, only 2/10 mimicry rings show evidence for scale type convergence. Focused on nanostructures, 5/10 mimicry rings show evidence for nanostructure convergence, but the authors' analyses later in the manuscript demonstrate that nanostructure type has no effect on transmittance in any of the 8 retained models.</p></disp-quote><p>Similarly, as stated above, we feel that the fact that we do find convergence for micro- and nanostructures is some cases is enough to claim that selection can act on those structures. Regarding the fact that nanostructure type does not have effect on transmittance in this study (whereas nanostructure density has a strong effect), this may be caused by:</p><p>– limited statistical power due to small sample sizes for some types of nanostructures (only two species have ‘maze’ nanostructure type for example),</p><p>– the fact that nanostructure type is highly correlated to nanostructure density (phylogenetic ANOVA on nanostructure density with nanostructure type as factor: F = 26.26, p-value = 0.001, see Supplementary files 3d and e). Since nanostructure density (which is a quantitative variable therefore having the power to follow more closely quantitative variations in transmittance) comes out in the model, there is hardly any variation to explain left for nanostructure type.</p><p>The remark of reviewer #3 on nanostructure type/density led us to test for convergence on nanostructure density, which has an effect on mean transmittance, among co-mimetic species. For each pair of species, we calculated the difference in nanostructure density and we used the same test for convergence as for chromatic and achromatic distances. The results presented in Figure 4 and in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 show that overall, nanostructure density is convergent among co-mimetic species. When looking more closely at each mimicry rings, we find convergence in nanostructure density in 3 mimicry rings out of 10, and we find that nanostructure density is more similar than expected at random for one mimicry rings which comprises closely related species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strength:</p><p>The authors have generated an exciting comparative dataset of the micro- and nanoscale scale features that may be involved in transparency in Lepidoptera. Datasets comprised of this many species are uncommon in biophotonics. Further quantification of these structures paired with accurate transmittance data could provide a number of insights into the structural basis of terrestrial transparency, a less well understood phenomenon than aquatic transparency.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your appreciation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My primary recommendation for improving the manuscript center around the collection of transmittance data. To reduce the effects of scattering and refraction on the measurement, it is necessary to reduce the distance between the emitting and collecting probes to as little as possible. Over a 7cm distance, even small errors (2 degrees or less) can drastically affect the result. Another potential option is to use integrating spheres on both sides of the wing to collect transmittance regardless of whether light was scattered or not.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we show that our spectrophotometer measurements are reliable and that distance between fibres barely affects the results. Regarding integrating spheres, we insist on the fact that we are interested in transparency, which is defined as specular transmission of light and which can be directly converted in visual impression by predators. We do not want to measure scattered light and measures with integrative spheres are therefore not appropriate for our study. Given these considerations, there is no point in changing our method to collect transmittance data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be useful to the reader to see a discussion of the differences between the pooled results and the convergence results within each mimicry ring. There are potentially interesting reasons for why one might find convergence in some groups and not others, but those are not explored in the manuscripts current form.</p></disp-quote><p>The overall convergence detected is indeed driven by some mimicry rings, but, as stated above, we think this already provides evidence that selection can act on components of transparency, and therefore that in those mimicry rings transparency is part of the aposematic signal. As mentioned above, we toned down the discussion and give explanations for the differences we observe between the pooled results and the convergence results within each mimicry ring. We also changed the title of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
