Here we report that the COPII coat subunit, SEC24C, works with the long form of the tubular ER-phagy receptor, RTN3, to target dominant-interfering mutant proinsulin <italic>Akita</italic> puncta to lysosomes. When the delivery of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta to lysosomes was disrupted, large puncta accumulated in the ER. Unexpectedly, photobleach analysis indicated that <italic>Akita</italic> puncta behaved as condensates and not aggregates, as previously suggested. <italic>Akita</italic> puncta enlarged when either RTN3 or SEC24C were depleted, or when ER sheets were proliferated by either knocking out Lunapark or overexpressing CLIMP63. Other ER-phagy substrates that are segregated into tubules behaved like <italic>Akita</italic>, while a substrate (type I procollagen) that is degraded by the ER-phagy sheets receptor, FAM134B, did not. Conversely, when ER tubules were augmented in Lunapark knock-out cells by overexpressing reticulons, ER-phagy increased and the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta was reduced. Our findings imply that segregating cargoes into tubules has two beneficial roles. First, it localizes mutant misfolded proteins, the receptor, and SEC24C to the same ER domain. Second, physically restraining condensates within tubules, before they undergo ER-phagy, prevents them from enlarging and impacting cell health.</p></abstract><kwd-group

polygonal network of interconnected sheets and tubules that extends from the nucleus to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). This unique, evolutionarily conserved, architecture has been extensively studied at a morphological and biochemical level, yet the functional advantage conferred by these distinct domains remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>). ER shape is dependent on the reticulons (RTN), atlastin (ATL), and lunapark (LNPK) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Craene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The reticulons are required to stabilize tubules, while the atlastins mediate tubule-tubule fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Craene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orso et al., 2009</xref>). LNPK, which resides at the junctions formed when two tubules fuse, regulates ER architecture by stabilizing nascent tubule junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of LNPK, ER junctions are destabilized, and as a consequence, the tubular network collapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). ER network organization may be important for cell health as mutations in ER-shaping proteins have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy and hereditary spastic paraplegias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Hu, 2016</xref>).</p><p>A major function of the ER is protein biogenesis. When errors in protein processing, protein folding, and protein complex assembly occur, ER proteostasis is disrupted and aberrant proteins accumulate in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). Cells use two major degradative mechanisms to restore homeostasis, the proteasome and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). Misfolded ER proteins can be retrotranslocated across the membrane into the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery where they are degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). Some misfolded proteins, however, are resistant to ERAD and must use other disposal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Brodsky, 2019</xref>). Autophagy is an alternate pathway that degrades organelles, pathogens, protein aggregates, and liquid protein condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamasaki et al., 2020</xref>). ER autophagy (termed ER-phagy) is a type of selective autophagy that targets a domain of the ER to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fregno and Molinari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilkinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chino and Mizushima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HÃ¼bner and Dikic, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferro-Novick et al., 2021</xref>). ER to lysosome degradation occurs via a double membrane vesicle called the autophagosome (macro-ER-phagy) or can be non-autophagosome mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fregno and Molinari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilkinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chino and Mizushima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HÃ¼bner and Dikic, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferro-Novick et al., 2021</xref>). ER-phagy uses receptors that connect the ER to the autophagy machinery via their ability to bind Atg8 in yeast or LC3 or GABARAP in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fregno and Molinari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilkinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chino and Mizushima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">HÃ¼bner and Dikic, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferro-Novick et al., 2021</xref>). To date, two ER-phagy membrane receptors have been identified in yeast and six in mammals. Additionally, several soluble receptors have recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferro-Novick et al., 2021</xref>). Different membrane ER-phagy receptors mark the distinct morphological domains of the ER. For example, in mammals, the autophagy receptor FAM134B resides in the curved edges of ER sheets, while the long form of the ER-phagy receptor RTN3 (herein called RTN3) localizes to the tubular ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that FAM134B and RTN3 are required for ER proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forrester et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schultz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fregno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunningham et al., 2019</xref>). These receptors contain reticulon homology domains that generate regions of high membrane curvature and have ER fragmenting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The delivery of ER tubules to lysosomes during ER-phagy also requires SEC24C in mammals and Lst1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). SEC24C, and its homologue Lst1, are COPII coat cargo adaptors that sort proteins into ER-derived transport carriers that traffic to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016</xref>). Here we have asked if SEC24C is also required for the targeting of mutant misfolded cargoes to lysosomes during ER-phagy. For our studies, we analyzed mutant proinsulin <italic>Akita</italic>, as well as misfolded prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (C28F POMC) and the mutant neuropeptide pro-arginine-vasopressin (G57S Pro-AVP). All three cargoes are dominant-interfering disease-causing proteins that are segregated into tubules before undergoing ER-phagy. In addition, we have used different methods to shift the distribution of ER between sheets and tubules and asked if restricting cargoes to tubules plays a role in ER proteostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SEC24C colocalizes with LC3B and RTN3 in Torin-treated cells</title><p>We previously showed that when autophagy is induced in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with the TORC1 kinase inhibitor, rapamycin, Lst1 associates with Atg8 and Atg40 to facilitate the packaging of ER into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2019</xref>).

In addition to large puncta, small <italic>Akita</italic> puncta were also observed in treated as well as untreated cells (see size range in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

The small puncta were also associated with tubules and were frequently seen at tubule junctions, as well as the tips of tubules (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These puncta moved with the tubules as they branched and fused, and some puncta appeared to change in size and shape as they traveled through the network (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In contrast, the larger puncta were mostly seen in sheet-like dense regions of the ER and moved more slowly (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

In contrast, a substrate of FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy, EGFP-hCOL1A1, behaved differently.

To determine the effect on <italic>Akita</italic> of shifting the distribution of ER from tubules to sheets, we analyzed puncta in LNPK KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of LNPK, fewer junctions are observed and the tubular network collapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The loss of tubules in the knock-out (KO) cells shifts the morphology of the ER to a more sheet-like network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). We found that ~76% of the LNPK KO cells contained large puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), while ~15% of the control cells and ~45% of the siRTN3 and siSEC24C-depleted cells contained large puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). A large fraction (~35%) of the LNPK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) also contained multiple large puncta. To examine the <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in more detail, we analyzed 3D reconstructions of deconvolved Z stacks of control and LNPK KO cells (see representative <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>, and frames in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). This analysis verified that the small puncta reside in tubules, while the large puncta are in ER sheets. To show by a second method that <italic>Akita</italic> puncta enlarge in ER sheets, we proliferated sheets by overexpressing the sheet producing protein, CLIMP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shibata et al., 2010</xref>). ER sheet proliferation, which was induced by CLIMP63 overexpression, increased the percentage of cells with large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), as well as the mean size of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). A similar increase in the mean size of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta per cell was also observed in LNPK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). The co-overexpression of CLIMP63 with RTN4, an ER protein that drives ER tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), decreased the percentage of cells with sheets as well as the number of large puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

In contrast to what was observed for <italic>Akita</italic>, we did not see an increased accumulation of hCOL1A1 puncta in LNPK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A and B</xref>).

Because hCOL1A1 behaved differently than <italic>Akita</italic> in LNPK KO cells, we also analyzed two other cargoes whose degradation is known to be dependent on RTN3; G57S mutation of pro-arginine-vasopressin (G57S Pro-AVP), and the C28F mutation in pro-opiomelanocortin (C28F POMC). G57S Pro-AVP is a mutant neuropeptide whose expression leads to an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder called neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spiess et al., 2020</xref>). C28F POMC is a mutant prohormone that causes early onset obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Creemers et al., 2008</xref>). Like <italic>Akita</italic>, large puncta of G57S Pro-AVP accumulated in the siSEC24C, but not siSEC24A, depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Furthermore, large puncta accumulation was more pronounced in LNPKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). Similar results were obtained with C28F POMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3E and F</xref>). In addition, a significant fraction (&gt;30%) of the LNPK KO cells that contained G57S Pro-AVP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3D</xref>) or C28F POMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3F</xref>) contained multiple large puncta. Together these studies have revealed that cargoes that are targeted for ER-phagy by the ER tubule receptor RTN3 form puncta that enlarge in sheet-like ER. A cargo that is targeted for ER-phagy by the ER sheets receptor, FAM134B, did not display this behavior.</p><p><italic>Akita</italic> is known to be cytotoxic in insulin-secreting Î² cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). It exerts a dominant-negative phenotype by trapping wild-type proinsulin in high-molecular-weight oligomeric complexes that are retained in the ER, thereby disrupting insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izumi et al., 2003</xref>). If <italic>Akita</italic> behaves in a similar manner in U2OS cells, it should trap proinsulin in large puncta when both proteins are coexpressed. Interestingly, when <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP and proinsulin-FLAG were co-transfected in control and LNPK KO cells, 100% of the large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta also contained proinsulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4A and B</xref>). The same was also observed when G57S Pro-AVP-FLAG and Pro-AVP-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4C and D</xref>), or C28F POMC and POMC-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4E and F</xref>) were co-transfected.

Together these findings suggest that <italic>Akita</italic>, G57S Pro-AVP, and C28F POMC behave similarly to the way they would in insulin-secreting or neuronal cells. As further evidence that our findings are physiologically relevant, we proliferated ER sheets by overexpressing CLIMP63 in insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 rat Î²-cells (INS1 hereafter). Although ER tubules and sheets are difficult to visualize in INS1 cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), the overexpression of CLIMP63 led to a significant increase in large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5AâD</xref>).

When we performed colocalization studies of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta with RTN3 puncta in control cells, only the small <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (&lt;0.12 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) associated with RTN3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Colocalizing puncta were mostly detected at the tips and junctions of ER tubules (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top), and also observed when autophagosome formation was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7A</xref>). Although the diffuse pool of <italic>Akita</italic> in the ER network colocalized with the pan ER marker SEC61 in the network, the SEC61 puncta that formed on the ER did not colocalize with <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Thus, the colocalization of small <italic>Akita</italic> puncta with RTN3 puncta was specific. In contrast to control cells, <italic>Akita</italic> puncta did not colocalize with RTN3 puncta in LNPK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, bottom). Large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (arrows) were largely seen in sheet-like dense regions of the ER, while RTN3 was frequently seen at the cell periphery in the KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom). The inability of small <italic>Akita</italic> puncta to colocalize with RTN3 puncta in LNPK KO cells was not a consequence of decreased puncta movement in the network as the velocity of the small puncta was not significantly altered in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7B</xref>). The large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in LNPK KO cells also did not colocalize with SEC61 puncta, but were frequently seen in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7C and D</xref>).

If the decrease in three-way junctions and the consequential collapse of the tubular polygonal network in LNPK KO cells is what leads to the increase in large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta, restoration of the network should decrease the number of puncta. To address this possibility, we partially restored the network in LNPK KO cells by overexpressing the reticulon proteins, RTN3 or RTN4, and then quantified the accumulation of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta. Overexpressed RTN3 increases the density of three-way ER junctions, while RTN4 drives ER tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu and Voeltz, 2021</xref>).

As the association of SEC24C with RTN3 is needed to target <italic>Akita</italic> to lysosomes, we conclude that SEC24C is an essential component of the RTN3-mediated ER-phagy pathway.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>Akita</italic> puncta do not enlarge in the tubules.</title><p><italic>ER-ph</italic>agy <italic>s</italic>ites (ERPHS) are formed when <italic>Akita</italic> puncta associate with RTN3 puncta, LC3B, and SEC24C on the tubules. The association of RTN3 with LC3B occurs in the absence of SEC24C. In LNPK KO cells, the tubular polygonal network collapses and large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta accumulate in sheet-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta also accumulate in siSEC24C and siRTN3 cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71642-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previous studies have shown that ERAD-resistant high-molecular-weight oligomeric forms of <italic>Akita</italic> are cleared from the ER by RTN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunningham et al., 2019</xref>). Because these oligomers pelleted on sucrose density gradients, they were suggested to be aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunningham et al., 2019</xref>). Our photobleach analysis of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta, showing that these structures behaved like liquid condensates and not aggregates, was surprising as condensates have not been observed within the ER before. This observation led us to discover that ER tubules play a critical role in restricting the size of condensates in the ER. Specifically, we found that the loss of ER tubules in LNPK KO cells resulted in a dramatic accumulation of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (â¥0.5 Âµm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The puncta not only failed to be degraded in the absence of tubules, they continued to enlarge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The overexpression of RTN4, a protein that promotes tubule formation, partially restored the tubular network in LNPK KO cells and reduced the number of large puncta. RTN4 overexpression also increased the delivery of <italic>Akita</italic> to lysosomes. Because the loss of LNPK could indirectly affect ER shape in a number of ways, we used a second method to proliferate ER sheets. Consistent with the proposal that the <italic>Akita</italic> puncta enlarged in sheet-like ER, and not tubules, the proliferation of ER sheets by CLIMP63 overexpression increased the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta and reduced the delivery of <italic>Akita</italic> to lysosomes. The co-transfection of CLIMP63 with RTN4 restored the tubular network in the CLIMP63-overexpressing cells and reduced the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta. In total, these findings indicate that ER tubules, which have a small outer radius of only ~44 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Georgiades et al., 2017</xref>), restrict the size of condensates. In a sheet, an <italic>Akita</italic> condensate can access the soluble milieu around its entire surface, while in a tubule, accessibility is limited to the ends facing the lumen. An <italic>Akita</italic> condensate is inaccessible to soluble oligomers in the area that is adjacent to the tubule wall. Therefore, although <italic>Akita</italic> condensates could expand along the length of tubules, their growth rate is limited by their reduced accessibility. Interestingly, other RTN3-SEC24C substrates (G57S Pro-AVP and C28F POMC) behaved like <italic>Akita</italic>, while a cargo that is targeted for lysosomal degradation in the sheets (hCOL1A1) did not. Together these findings imply that misfolded proteins, which form fluid condensates, are largely disposed of by ER-phagy in tubules.</p><p>Unlike aggregates, which are biologically inert, condensates have the ability to rapidly exchange their contents with the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noda et al., 2020</xref>). Our FRAP studies showing that <italic>Akita</italic> in puncta rapidly exchanged with <italic>Akita</italic> in the ER provide a possible explanation for how <italic>Akita</italic> can trap secretory cargo and disrupt the local environment of the ER. Consistent with our findings, a comparison of the toxicity of liquid and aggregated states of Î±-synuclein has suggested that soluble oligomers of mutant Î±-synuclein, and not aggregated forms, are the toxic species in Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winner et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in Alzheimerâs disease, soluble AÎ² oligomers and not amyloid fibrils have been shown to be neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walsh et al., 2002</xref>). As ER-phagy is induced slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2019</xref>), misfolded cargoes can accumulate in the ER before they are removed. The ability of tubules to restrict condensate size averts potentially toxic condensates from expanding in the ER while they are waiting to undergo ER-phagy. In total, our findings suggest that drugs that reduce the size of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in the ER could be of therapeutic value in the intervention of MIDY. We also speculate that the observations we have made here can be extended to a variety of other disorders that are associated with the accumulation of dominant-interfering, ERAD-resistant proteins in the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP (<italic>Akita</italic> fused to superfolder GFP) was a gift from Peter Arvan (University of Michigan Medical School). mAaus0.5-SEC24A, mCherry-SEC24A, and mCherry-SEC24C were generated by PCR amplification using pCS-6x-Myc-SEC24A or pC1-EYFP-SEC24C, respectively, as a template and then the PCR fragment was cloned into pC1 mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with a N-terminal mAaus0.5 tag or an N-terminal mCherry tag.

Either a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope (Observer Z1; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD camera (QuantEM 512SC; Photometrics), or a Nikon Ti2-E microscope was used. The Nikon microscope employed a Yokogawa X1 spinning disk confocal system with a 100Ã Apo TIRF 1.49 NA objective, MLC400B 4-line (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 647 nm) dual-fiber laser combiner (Agilent), Prime 95B back-thinned sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics), piezo Z-stage (Mad City Labs), and running NIS Elements software. Cells were imaged while in a stage top environmental chamber (Tokai Hit). To separate the emission of individual fluors, band-pass emission filters were used for each channel (450/50, 525/36, 605/52, and 705/72). To optimally acquire 3D images, Z-planes were collected with 150 nm Z-steps. The resulting images were then deconvolved using the RichardsonâLucy algorithm with automatic detection and setting of the SNR and optimal iteration number.</p><p>For the experiments where ER-phagy was induced with Torin, cells were treated for 3.5 hr with 250 nM Torin 2 (Sigma-Aldrich; SML1224; St. Louis, MO) that was solubilized in DMSO. DMSO-treated cells were used as a control. To inhibit autophagy, cells were treated with 2 ÂµM of MRT68921 (Tocris; 5780; Bristol, UK) for 3.5 hr or 6 hr before imaging.</p><p>For immunofluorescence experiments, the cells were cultured on glass-bottom dishes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). The fixed cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), incubated in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 15 min at RT, and then washed again with PBS. Subsequently, cells that were imaged for <italic>Akita</italic>, Pro-AVP, or POMC were incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS) for 10 min at RT, washed with PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) for 1 hr at RT before they were washed with PBS. Samples were then incubated with primary antibody for 12â16 hr at 4Â°C, washed with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated for 1 hr with Alexa Fluor 488/594 labeled secondary antibody at RT. Before imaging, the samples were washed in washing buffer and rinsed with PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of <italic>Akita</italic> delivery to lysosomes</title><p>For analyzing <italic>Akita</italic> inside LAMP1 structures, cells expressing <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP and LAMP1-mCherry were treated with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich; B1793) for 1.5â4 hr before they were imaged. To inhibit autophagy, the cells were treated with MRT68921 for 6 hr and bafilomycin A1 was added during the last 90 min of the incubation. Samples were fixed with 4% PFA for 6 min at RT, washed with PBS, incubated in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 8 min at RT, washed with PBS, and imaged as described in the previous section. Relative pixel intensity was plotted. The relative pixel intensity for each condition is the mean intensity of <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP in the pixels that overlap with LAMP1. The data was normalized to the mean intensity obtained in the siCtrl condition. Approximately 1â2% of the total <italic>Akita</italic> in the cell is delivered to the lysosome via ER-phagy. This number was estimated by dividing the area of <italic>Akita</italic> that overlaps with LAMP1 by the total <italic>Akita</italic> in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>To quantitate the colocalization of two proteins, we employed an object overlap method in ImageJ v2.0. Briefly, an individual cell was cropped using an enclosing rectangular region of interest (ROI), and the resulting two-channel image was split into two images, one for each color channel. Each image was then subjected to uniform and unbiased auto-thresholding using the Yen algorithm to produce binary black-and-white images with black objects displaying the labeling pattern for each protein. This particular thresholding algorithm captured isolated spots as well as punctate accentuations on larger objects such as tubules, making it ideal for quantitation of ERPHS proteins. The Image Calculator was then used to create an intersection image of the two binary images using the Boolean AND operator. This binary image represents all labeled objects that are common to both proteins. The Analyze Particles command was then used to determine the total object count of all three binary images individually. The object count of the intersection image was then divided by the object count of one of the source images to generate percent colocalization. For example, for two proteins (A and B), the percent colocalization of A with B = [count of A AND B]/[count of A] Ã 100%.</p><p>To measure the intensity of a protein localized to specific sites, individual channel component images were created from a two-color image as described above. One of the component images was used as the site of interest, for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, LAMP1 was used to mark lysosomes and autolysosomes. The site image was then subjected to auto-thresholding to produce a binary image as described above. The Analyze Particles command was then used to obtain a mask of the objects, and the Create Selection command was used to capture all the objects as a single ROI, which was then moved into the ROI Manager. A rectangular background ROI was drawn by hand in a dark extracellular region and moved into the ROI Manager. The two ROIs were then applied consecutively to the non-binary component image (e.g., <italic>Akita</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the Measure command was used to obtain mean intensities. The pixel intensity (in arbitrary units) of the measured protein at the sites of interest = [mean intensity of sites ROI] â [mean intensity of background ROI]. This value collected from each condition was then divided by the mean pixel intensity from the control condition to produce relative pixel intensity for each condition.</p><p>For determination of the size of puncta, the binary black-and-white image was generated as described above and the Analyze Particles command was used to create a mask of the images (size criteria of &lt;0.12, 0.12â0.24, &gt;0.24, or â¥0.5 Âµ<sup>2</sup> and circularity criteria of 0.5â1). The cells with puncta of size â¥0.5 Âµm<sup>2</sup> were quantified as the cells with large puncta. To determine the size-based colocalization of <italic>Akita</italic> with different proteins, the masks of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta of indicated size ranges were generated as described above and Image Calculator was then used to create an intersection image of the two proteins using the Boolean AND operator. Colocalization was then determined as described above.</p><p>To calculate the mean size of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta per cell, the Yen thresholding algorithm was first used to identify puncta of all sizes. Then, the number and area of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta were calculated using the Analyze Particles command in ImageJ. An average <italic>Akita</italic> puncta size for each cell was calculated as follows: total area of all <italic>Akit</italic>a puncta/total number of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in the cell.</p><p>To quantify the percent of cells with multiple <italic>Akita</italic> puncta colocalizing with either SEC24C, SEC24A, or LC3B, the images were analyzed for colocalization as described above using ImageJ, and the cells showing two or more colocalizing puncta were divided by the total number of cells analyzed and then multiplied by 100%.</p><p>To calculate the percentage of cells with mostly sheet-like ER, cells that largely contained sheets were blindly scored as positive for the appearance of sheets by two independent observers and divided by the total number of cells scored. The data from the two independent observers was then averaged for each experiment.</p><p>Immunofluorescence was also performed to measure the transient and stable expression levels of fluorescently tagged SEC24C, RTN3, LC3B, and RTN4, relative to the endogenous levels of these proteins. For these experiments, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min at RT and then incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin in PBS) for 1 hr. Subsequently, the samples were incubated for 12â16 hr at 4Â°C with either anti-SEC24C, RTN3, LC3B, or RTN4 antibody prepared in blocking buffer, and then treated with secondary antibody. The expression of each fluorescently tagged protein was estimated in the following way. Transfected versus non-transfected cells were identified in the color channel of the fluorescently tagged protein. Then, using the immunofluorescence image channel, an ROI was drawn around the entire cytoplasmic area of each cell to be analyzed, and the ROI was used to obtain the mean intensity. Approximately 10â15 transfected and non-transfected cells were examined for each marker protein in three separate experiments. The mean intensity of each transfected cell was divided by the mean of all non-transfected cells for each marker to obtain the fold overexpression for each transfected cell. Please note that highly overexpressing transient or stably expressing fluorescent cells were excluded in our colocalization studies and therefore also excluded from these estimates. For the markers that were introduced into cells by transient transfection (see list above), no more than twofold average overexpression was observed. For the mCherry-RTN3 stable cell lines, approximately 4â5.5-fold overexpression was observed. With the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, all experiments shown in the article with mCherry-RTN3 were performed with stable cell lines. In addition, all colocalization experiments with the mCherry-RTN3 stable cell lines were confirmed with transiently transfected mCherry-RTN3 cells. Identical results were obtained with stable versus transfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Time-lapse imaging and analysis of the velocity of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta</title><p>U2OS cells were transfected with <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP and seeded on a glass-bottom culture dish 24 hr after transfection. Before the cells were imaged, the culture medium was changed to OPTI-MEM medium. Time-course images were captured without a delay using a Nikon spinning disc confocal microscope described above. The motility and velocity of the <italic>Akita</italic> puncta were tracked and measured using MTrackJ software. The velocity of the puncta was calculated as calibrated total (not net) linear distance of travel per unit time of the recording. The movies were generated using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay</title><p>U2OS cells transfected with <italic>Akita</italic>-sfGFP were imaged using a Nikon C2 confocal microscope attached to a Ti2-E with a Plan Apo 100Ã 1.45 NA objective. The C2 used a four-line (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm) LUN-4 laser engine and a DUV-B tunable emission dual-GaAsP detector. To increase imaging speed to two frames per second, images were taken at 256 Ã 256 pixels with a zoom set to create 0.15 m pixels. The pinhole was fully opened to allow for optimal detection of emitted photons. For scanning, the 488 nm laser was set to 1%, and for bleaching the laser intensity was set to 100%. Six prebleached images were acquired without a delay; postbleaching images were taken continuously for 30 s and with 2 s intervals for the subsequent 2 min. The Time Measurement tool within NIS Elements was used to quantify the intensity of the bleached ROIs as well as the entire cell after the background intensity was subtracted from the images. FRAP quantitation was performed according to the method of Pfair and Misteli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phair and Misteli, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>p-Values were calculated using the Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Endoplasmic reticulum tubules limit the size of misfolded protein condensates&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. Although we judge the work to be of considerable merit, each of the three reviewers had comments that we believe would require more than 2 months to address. The detailed comments of the reviewers follow this comment but in summary: Reviewer #1 had a significant concern (No.3); reviewer #2 had a significant concern (No.1 and 2); reviewer #3 had general concerns how the ectopic overexpression of several key proteins and the use of cell lines that do not necessarily relate to the physiological context of the Akita mutant and the normal process of insulin secretion. Should you be in a position to address these concerns, we would welcome a new submission of this work which we will endeavor to have reviewed by the same referees.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Parashar et al. present interesting results on the organization of a specialized zone of the endoplasmic reticulum, ER tubules, that appear to organize the autophagic engulfment and diversion to the lysosome of a mutant, misfolded form of proinsulin, the Akita mutant protein. This specialized zone correlates to the localization of an ER membrane protein, RTN3, known to promote membrane tubulation and also to cytoplasmic subunits, SEC24C and SEC23A, of a coat protein complex that participates in sorting of membrane proteins destined to traffic the ER. In contrast to what had been assumed of aggregated forms of the Akita mutant proinsulin, the authors find that puncta of the accumulated protein remain in a fluid state, characteristic of protein condensates rather than of a more rigid protein aggregate.</p><p>Parashar et al. have investigated the localization and fluid properties of mutant Akita that accumulates in the ER and is subject to a process of turnover in the lysosome termed ER-phagy. The work relies on live cell imaging of transfected forms of fluorescnety tagged forms of Akita, of wild type prolinsulin, collagen, RTN3, Sec24C and mutant forms of other prohormones. The broad conclusions are consistent with and extend previous observations on the role of RTN3 in formation of ER tubules in relation to the ER-phagy of other misfolded proteins subject to lysosomal degradation.</p><p>The novel conclusions the authors make are that the Akita mutant protein is in a fluid protein condensate state rather than as an aggregate and that ER-phagy operates selectively on tubular membrane marked by their content of RTN3 in the membrane and SEC24C on the cytoplasmic face of the tubular membrane.</p><p>I have several concerns that could be addressed by additional experimental work and a few small issues with the text.</p><p>1. All of the conclusions of this work rely on visual inspection of fluorescently-tagged over-expressed proteins. At the very least, this should be expressed as a limitation of the analysis but it would help support the strength of the conclusions if at least some of the work was repeated by another approach. One such additional approach would be to use immunoprecipitation of RTN3 to detect a a possibly selective association with SEC24C under conditions that promote ER-phagy in non-transfected cells. If the endogenous level of these two proteins is too low, the authors might consider a proximity labeling approach with APEX-tagged Akita, RTN3 or SEC24C.</p><p>2. How is the Akita protein retained in proximity to RTN3 in the membrane? Is there a direct interaction or is the Akita condensate anchored by some other means to the putative tubular regions of the ER?</p><p>3. The claim of tubular ER vs. sheets of ER is not supported in a convincing manner.</p><p>Previous work certainly has established that RTN3 functions in membrane tubulation and the role of lunapark in the organization of tubular membranes has also been made in other work. However, the confocal images in this manuscript do not clearly and independently justify the conclusions of tubular vs. sheet ER membrane localization. These claims should be justified by serial confocal or super resolution microscopy reconstruction of images to more clearly document the claim of tubular vs ER sheet localization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 :</italic></p><p>Previous work from this group showed that some ER-phagy requires SEC24C and RTN3 (PMID: 31273116). The present study reveals these proteins are necessary for degradation of regions of the ER containing accumulations of Akita, a dominant interfering mutant of proinsulin. It also shows that the puncta are probably protein condensates rather than aggregates as had been thought. The condensates become enlarged when SEC24C and RTN3 are depleted, consistent with the idea that Akita condensates are degraded by ER-phagy. This part of the study is well done and convincing. The study goes on to argue that ER structure plays an important role in targeting Akita condensates for degradation by ER-phagy; decreasing the abundance of tubular ER reduces Akita condensate degradation, while restoring ER tubules promotes degradation. The authors suggest ER tubulation promotes Akita condensate degradation by facilitating their interaction with SEC24C and by physically limiting condensate growth, preventing them from becoming too large for degradation by ER-phagy. If true, this is an important conceptual advance in our understanding of how ER shape promotes protein segregation, affects condensate formation, and plays a role in quality control of ER proteins. However, additional work is necessary to make a stronger case for the model.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-done, largely convincing study. It demonstrates that ER-phagy requiring SEC24C and RTN3 degrades Akita condensates in the ER. However, the idea that the extent of ER tubulation is a major determinant of condensate size or targeting to sites of ER-phagy requires additional evidence.</p><p>1. The only way ER structure is altered is knockout of Lunapark, which could affect ER function in ways beyond altering structure. The study would be stronger if it were shown that increasing ER sheets by another method affected Akita degradation similarly to knockout of Lunapark. For example, ER sheets could be induced by overexpression of Climp63 [PMID: 21111237]. It is not necessary to repeat all the work with the Lunapark knockout, but it should be shown that increasing ER sheets by another mechanism causes an increase the percent of cells with large Akita puncta (as in Figure 4A) and reduces Akita degradation in LAMP1-positive structures (as in Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A,B)</p><p>2. Deletion of Lunapark could affect Akita condensates in ways unrelated to changes in ER tubulation. Condensate formation is probably largely determined by the concentration of Akita in the ER, which could increase if the volume of the ER is reduced in cells lacking Lunapark or if Akita abundance increases in these cells. ER shape might also affect condensate mobility in the ER, which could alter the rate of coalescence of small condensates into larger ones. It also possible that the number or distribution of SEC24C puncta is altered in cells lacking Lunapark, which could reduce degradation of akita condensates. In short, there are a number of ways deletion of Lunapark could affect condensate size that are unrelated to the amount of tubulation of the ER. The study would be stronger if these other possibilities were ruled out but, at a minimum, they should be acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>3. The idea that ER tubules restrict the size of condensates seems implausible. What would stop condensates from expanding along the length of the tubule?</p><p>4.

It now uses a second method to increase ER sheets (Climp63 overexpression) and finds this leads to the accumulation of large Akita puncta and decreases deliver of Akita to lysosomes.

Together, these results strengthen support for a correlation between the extent of ER tubulation and Akita condensate degradation rate. However, there are still concerns about how the microscopy results are quantified.</p><p>1. ER shape and condensate formation are quantified as &quot;% cells with sheet-like ER&quot; and &quot;% cells with large Akita puncta&quot; (Figure 5D, Figure 5 Sup1 CD). This makes it hard to see how well condensate abundance and size correlate with ER sheet volume. It would be better if the mean % of ER in sheets and the mean size of Akita condensates per cell were determined. This will help make it clearer that there is a good correlation between ER sheet abundance and condensate size and number.</p><p>2. The claim that Akita condensates are specifically enriched near RTN3 but not SEC61 is still not convincing. Rev 1 had related concerns (point 1). In response to my comments about how Akita colocalized with RTN3 is assessed, the rebuttal letter states &quot;only RTN3 [and not SEC61] concentrated in puncta colocalize with the small Akita puncta in tubules&quot; (Figure 6D), but Akita seems to be all over the ER, together with RTN3 and SEC61. This issue can be addressed in two ways. First, clearly define what counts as an Akita punctum (condensate) and what distinguishes them from the rest of the Akita signal. Second, use an objective measure of colocalization or association. Also, as Rev 1 suggests, it also would be good if condensate association with RTN3 were confirmed by a second method (e.g., by IPs as in ref 32).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In their response letter and revised version of the manuscript &quot;Endoplasmic reticulum tubules limit the size of misfolded protein condensates&quot; by Parashar et al., the authors have responded to all points raised and have made modifications to improve data reporting and interpretation, especially regarding the expression levels of the cellular models used.

This specialized zone correlates to the localization of an ER membrane protein, RTN3, known to promote membrane tubulation and also to cytoplasmic subunits, SEC24C and SEC23A, of a coat protein complex that participates in sorting of membrane proteins destined to traffic the ER. In contrast to what had been assumed of aggregated forms of the Akita mutant proinsulin, the authors find that puncta of the accumulated protein remain in a fluid state, characteristic of protein condensates rather than of a more rigid protein aggregate.</p><p>Parashar et al. have investigated the localization and fluid properties of mutant Akita that accumulates in the ER and is subject to a process of turnover in the lysosome termed ER-phagy. The work relies on live cell imaging of transfected forms of fluorescnety tagged forms of Akita, of wild type prolinsulin, collagen, RTN3, Sec24C and mutant forms of other prohormones. The broad conclusions are consistent with and extend previous observations on the role of RTN3 in formation of ER tubules in relation to the ER-phagy of other misfolded proteins subject to lysosomal degradation.</p><p>The novel conclusions the authors make are that the Akita mutant protein is in a fluid protein condensate state rather than as an aggregate and that ER-phagy operates selectively on tubular membrane marked by their content of RTN3 in the membrane and SEC24C on the cytoplasmic face of the tubular membrane.</p><p>I have several concerns that could be addressed by additional experimental work and a few small issues with the text.</p><p>1. All of the conclusions of this work rely on visual inspection of fluorescently-tagged over-expressed proteins. At the very least, this should be expressed as a limitation of the analysis but it would help support the strength of the conclusions if at least some of the work was repeated by another approach. One such additional approach would be to use immunoprecipitation of RTN3 to detect a a possibly selective association with SEC24C under conditions that promote ER-phagy in non-transfected cells. If the endogenous level of these two proteins is too low, the authors might consider a proximity labeling approach with APEX-tagged Akita, RTN3 or SEC24C.</p></disp-quote><p>In support of our localization studies is an earlier study from Ivan Dikicâs lab that reported the interactome for RTN3L and RTN3S during starvation induced ER-phagy (Grumati et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2017). The long form of RTN3 (RTN3L) is required for ER-phagy, while the short form (RTN3S) is not. RTN3L, but not RTN3S, specifically co-precipitated with the endogenous copy of SEC24C during starvation. Additionally, endogenous SEC24C, and not other SEC24 isoforms, co-precipitated with RTN3L. While the IP experiments with RTN3L and RTN3S were performed with stably-transfected cells, and the expression levels of ectopic RTN3L and RTN3S in these cell lines was not reported, the specificity of these IPs indicates that they are physiologically relevant. Additionally, all the co-precipitating proteins in the interactome were endogenously expressed proteins. These findings are now described in the text (see Results section entitled âSEC24C colocalizes with LC3B and RTN3 in Torin-treated cellsâ). Please note that our localization studies with RTN3 and SEC24C are totally consistent with what we observed in yeast when we analyzed the endogenous copy of these homologues (see Cui et al. Science 2019). This is also mentioned in the text. In addition, see our response to Reviewer #3 (first and second response) about the expression levels of the proteins we used in our studies, and the physiological relevance of our studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How is the Akita protein retained in proximity to RTN3 in the membrane? Is there a direct interaction or is the Akita condensate anchored by some other means to the putative tubular regions of the ER?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. RTN3 does not have a luminal domain, therefore, it is unlikely that it binds directly to <italic>Akita</italic>. A possible scenario is that RTN3 interacts with <italic>Akita</italic> via a transmembrane chaperone that has a luminal domain. We plan to use a variety of approaches to address this point, but currently, a molecular answer to this question is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The claim of tubular ER vs. sheets of ER is not supported in a convincing manner.</p><p>Previous work certainly has established that RTN3 functions in membrane tubulation and the role of lunapark in the organization of tubular membranes has also been made in other work. However, the confocal images in this manuscript do not clearly and independently justify the conclusions of tubular vs. sheet ER membrane localization. These claims should be justified by serial confocal or super resolution microscopy reconstruction of images to more clearly document the claim of tubular vs ER sheet localization.</p></disp-quote><p>To show that the large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta accumulate in ER sheets, while the small puncta are present in tubules, we captured Z-slices and performed a 3D reconstruction of the <italic>Akita</italic> puncta from control and LNPK KO cells, as well as control cells transfected with Climp63 or Climp63 and RTN4 (see Figure 5B-C and movies S3 and S4; Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 and movies S5 and S6). These data demonstrate that the large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta are present in the sheets, while the small puncta are in tubules. Representative images are shown in Figure 5B-C and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Previous work from this group showed that some ER-phagy requires SEC24C and RTN3 (PMID: 31273116). The present study reveals these proteins are necessary for degradation of regions of the ER containing accumulations of Akita, a dominant interfering mutant of proinsulin. It also shows that the puncta are probably protein condensates rather than aggregates as had been thought. The condensates become enlarged when SEC24C and RTN3 are depleted, consistent with the idea that Akita condensates are degraded by ER-phagy. This part of the study is well done and convincing. The study goes on to argue that ER structure plays an important role in targeting Akita condensates for degradation by ER-phagy; decreasing the abundance of tubular ER reduces Akita condensate degradation, while restoring ER tubules promotes degradation. The authors suggest ER tubulation promotes Akita condensate degradation by facilitating their interaction with SEC24C and by physically limiting condensate growth, preventing them from becoming too large for degradation by ER-phagy. If true, this is an important conceptual advance in our understanding of how ER shape promotes protein segregation, affects condensate formation, and plays a role in quality control of ER proteins. However, additional work is necessary to make a stronger case for the model.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-done, largely convincing study. It demonstrates that ER-phagy requiring SEC24C and RTN3 degrades Akita condensates in the ER. However, the idea that the extent of ER tubulation is a major determinant of condensate size or targeting to sites of ER-phagy requires additional evidence.</p><p>1. The only way ER structure is altered is knockout of Lunapark, which could affect ER function in ways beyond altering structure. The study would be stronger if it were shown that increasing ER sheets by another method affected Akita degradation similarly to knockout of Lunapark. For example, ER sheets could be induced by overexpression of Climp63 [PMID: 21111237]. It is not necessary to repeat all the work with the Lunapark knockout, but it should be shown that increasing ER sheets by another mechanism causes an increase the percent of cells with large Akita puncta (as in Figure 4A) and reduces Akita degradation in LAMP1-positive structures (as in Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A,B)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now proliferated ER sheets by overexpressing Climp63 and shown that this leads to the accumulation of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in the ER (see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1), and a decrease in the delivery of <italic>Akita</italic> to lysosomes (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A-B). Furthermore, we showed that the co-overexpression of Climp63 with RTN4, a protein that drives ER tubulation, decreased the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Thus, by using two different methods to proliferate ER sheets, LNPK KO cells and Climp63 overexpression, we obtained the same outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Deletion of Lunapark could affect Akita condensates in ways unrelated to changes in ER tubulation. Condensate formation is probably largely determined by the concentration of Akita in the ER, which could increase if the volume of the ER is reduced in cells lacking Lunapark or if Akita abundance increases in these cells. ER shape might also affect condensate mobility in the ER, which could alter the rate of coalescence of small condensates into larger ones. It also possible that the number or distribution of SEC24C puncta is altered in cells lacking Lunapark, which could reduce degradation of akita condensates. In short, there are a number of ways deletion of Lunapark could affect condensate size that are unrelated to the amount of tubulation of the ER. The study would be stronger if these other possibilities were ruled out but, at a minimum, they should be acknowledged and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is very difficult to address if the loss of LNPK reduces the volume of the ER, or changes the ER in ways that are unrelated to tubulation, we have performed several experiments to address the concerns stated above. First, we proliferated ER sheets by a second method, the overexpression of Climp63 (see new data added in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 to the Results section entitled â<italic>Akita</italic> puncta enlarge in sheet-like ERâ and the discussion). Large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta accumulated in Climp63 overexpressing cells when ER sheets increased. The observation that two different methods, used to proliferate ER sheets, has the same outcome on <italic>Akita</italic> puncta size strengthens our proposal that <italic>Akita</italic> puncta enlarge in ER sheets. Second, we have shown that the number of SEC24C puncta is not reduced in LNPK KO cells (see Figure 5-supplement 6B and Results section entitled âThe association of <italic>Akita</italic> with RTN3 is required for the formation of ERPHSâ). Finally, we also measured the velocity of the <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in LNPK KO cells and found that the velocity of the small puncta was unaltered compared to control cells (Figure 5âfigure supplement 7B and Results section âThe association of <italic>Akita</italic> with RTN3 is required for the formation of ERPHSâ). The velocity of larger <italic>Akita</italic> puncta is slightly increased in LNPK KO cells, but this was also observed for large puncta in cells when autophagosome formation was blocked with the ULK1/2 inhibitor, MRT68921 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A). In total, our findings indicate that ER shape plays an important role in ER quality control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The idea that ER tubules restrict the size of condensates seems implausible. What would stop condensates from expanding along the length of the tubule?</p></disp-quote><p>The rate of condensate expansion is proportional to the surface area that is accessible to the high MWT <italic>Akita</italic> oligomers in solution. In a sheet, a condensate would be accessible along its entire equatorial circumference. In a tubule, accessibility of the condensate would be limited to the ends facing the tubule lumen. A condensate in the tubule is inaccessible to the soluble <italic>Akita</italic> oligomers in the area adjacent to the wall. Thus, a condensate could expand along the length of a tubule, but its growth rate would be limited by its reduced accessibility. This is now explained in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

All localization experiments in the manuscript were performed by transient transfection, except for the experiments with RTN3, which were performed with stable cell lines as well as transient transfection. The results we obtained for RTN3 by both methods were the same, and except for Figure 1C-D, only the results with the stable cell line are shown in the manuscript (see legends for more info). Despite the Ë5 fold overexpression, the results we obtained with the stable RTN3 cell lines are physiologically relevant as we observed an increased colocalization of RTN3 with SEC24C in response to ER-phagy induction by Torin. This increased colocalization was specific for SEC24C, and was not seen with SEC24A, SEC13 and SEC16.

He has shown that Proinsulin has a juxtanuclear localization that colocalizes with the early Golgi marker, p115, in U2OS cells (see Haataja et al. J Biol Chem 2013). We have also observed Proinsulin near the nucleus (see the first paragraph of the Results section entitled â<italic>Akita</italic> colocalizes with SEC24C-SEC23A and RTN3-LC3Bâ). In addition, previous studies have shown that <italic>Akita</italic> is retained in the ER in insulin and non-insulin secreting cells and is not in a juxtanuclear pool (Haataja et al. J Biol Chem 2013). We have observed a similar localization of <italic>Akita</italic> in U2OS cells and shown that the diffuse pool of <italic>Akita</italic> in the ER network colocalizes with ER markers (see Figure 5). We also report small <italic>Akita</italic> puncta in the ER tubules that colocalize with RTN3 puncta (see Figure 5D-E).

This is a strong proposition that should be consolidated with additional experiments. Proteins that form phase separated condensates show dose-dependency and are sensitive to increases in NaCl concentration in vitro (PMID: 32895492). Can this be demonstrated for the Akita insulin? Is this modified by the presence of WT proinsulin? If not further developed, authors should reconsider the use of &quot;condensates&quot; term in the title of the article. In addition, it is unclear why the photobleaching experiments in Figure 3F are done only MRT68921-treated cells and untreated controls are not included.</p></disp-quote><p>The criteria we have used to conclude <italic>Akita</italic> puncta are condensates are those established in Banani et al. 2017 <italic>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol</italic> 18, 285-298. This is now explained more clearly in the text (see last paragraph of Results section entitled âSEC24C colocalizes with small, highly mobile <italic>Akita</italic> punctaâ). We also consulted with experts in the condensate field (Michael Rosen, UT Southwestern; James Shorter, U of Penn) to ensure we were interpreting the literature correctly. For these reasons, we feel it is appropriate to use the term âcondensatesâ in the title.</p><p>We performed photobleach experiments using a variety of conditions. For example, MRT68921-treated cells, LNPK KO cells and siRTN3 depleted cells (Figure 3-supplement 1, Figure 5-supplements 8 and 9) were used for the FRAP experiments. We used MRT68921-treated cells for the FRAP studies because it increased the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta, which facilitated the FRAP analysis of these puncta. The large puncta that form in MRT68921-treated cells do not appear to behave differently from the large puncta in control cells (i. e. puncta movement was the same in the absence and presence of MRT68921-see Figure 3-supplement 1A). Furthermore, the FRAP data of the large puncta in LNPK KO cells and siRTN3 cells was the same as with MRT68921-treated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The experiments in Figure 6 are difficult to interpret since the overexpression levels achieved for RTN3 and RTN4 are not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The level of RTN3 and RTN4 overexpression are now reported in the Materials and methods (see section entitled âImage Analysisâ). But, please note that we are intentionally overexpressing these proteins to change ER shape. The data in Figure 6C confirms that overexpressing RTN3 and RTN4 in LNPK KO cells changed the shape of the ER. The overexpression of the tubule forming protein, RTN4, is commonly used to convert ER sheets to tubules. The consequence of RTN3 overexpression was also examined in our studies as a control. As RTN3 is an ER-phagy receptor, that is needed to clear <italic>Akita</italic> from the ER, the overexpression of RTN3 should decrease the number of large <italic>Akita</italic> puncta. Although RTN3 is not a tubule forming protein, RTN3 overexpression increases the density of three-way conjunctions in the ER (see Wu and Voeltz Dev Cell 2021 vol 56, 52-66). In LNPK KO cells, where fewer junctions are present, RTN3 overexpression also drives the conversion of sheets to tubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Introduction.

All SEC24 isoforms are found in a complex with SEC23. A key function of SEC23 in the COPII coat is to recruit the COPII coat outer shell, SEC31-SEC13, which does not appear to be required for ER-phagy in mammalian cells or yeast (see Cui et al. Science 2019). This observation implies that SEC23 associates with ERPHS, due to its stoichiometric association with SEC24C, and does not directly contribute to ER-phagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Results.

It now uses a second method to increase ER sheets (Climp63 overexpression) and finds this leads to the accumulation of large Akita puncta and decreases deliver of Akita to lysosomes. These changes are reversed by also overexpressing RTN4, which increases ER tubulation. Together, these results strengthen support for a correlation between the extent of ER tubulation and Akita condensate degradation rate. However, there are still concerns about how the microscopy results are quantified.</p><p>1. ER shape and condensate formation are quantified as &quot;% cells with sheet-like ER&quot; and &quot;% cells with large Akita puncta&quot; (Figure 5D, Figure 5 Sup1 CD). This makes it hard to see how well condensate abundance and size correlate with ER sheet volume. It would be better if the mean % of ER in sheets and the mean size of Akita condensates per cell were determined. This will help make it clearer that there is a good correlation between ER sheet abundance and condensate size and number.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E and F for the new presentation of the data as the mean size of <italic>Akita</italic> puncta per cell that this reviewer requested. The following samples were analyzed: Control, CLIMP63 and CLIMP63 +RTN4 overexpressing cells (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E); Control, LNPK KO and LNPK KO+RTN4 overexpressing cells (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F). The explanation for how this data was calculated can be found in the Materials and methods in the section entitled âImage Analysisâ.</p><p>We do not feel we can objectively calculate the mean % of ER in sheets per cell using the current images, as suggested in the decision letter. An objective calculation would likely require serial thin section electron microscopy or tomography. In brief, since we could not find examples in the literature on how to calculate the numbers the reviewer requested, we tried different thresholding methods to capture tubules and sheets. We then deleted by hand individual tubular objects, leaving only what we considered sheets. This process involved making many arbitrary decisions for each cell we quantitated. In the end, we found this method to be far less objective than the method that is currently reported in the manuscript. To do the analysis that is reported in the manuscript (% cells with mostly sheet-like ER), we used visual pattern recognition to bin cells as either mostly sheet-like or mostly tubular. This methodology is standard in the field, and routinely used in the laboratories of Tom Rapoport and Gia Voeltz (for an example see Figure 8B and legend in Wang et al. 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> 5:e18605).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The claim that Akita condensates are specifically enriched near RTN3 but not SEC61 is still not convincing. Rev 1 had related concerns (point 1). In response to my comments about how Akita colocalized with RTN3 is assessed, the rebuttal letter states &quot;only RTN3 [and not SEC61] concentrated in puncta colocalize with the small Akita puncta in tubules&quot; (Figure 6D), but Akita seems to be all over the ER, together with RTN3 and SEC61. This issue can be addressed in two ways. First, clearly define what counts as an Akita punctum (condensate) and what distinguishes them from the rest of the Akita signal. Second, use an objective measure of colocalization or association. Also, as Rev 1 suggests, it also would be good if condensate association with RTN3 were confirmed by a second method (e.g., by IPs as in ref 32).</p></disp-quote><p>In a cell, <italic>Akita</italic> is uniformly distributed throughout the ER tubules and sheets, as well as concentrated in puncta.
