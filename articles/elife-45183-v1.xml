Through an analysis of more than 3000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in three leading medical journals (the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine), we have identified 396 medical reversals.

Such practices can result in physical and emotional harm, undermine public trust in medicine, and have both an opportunity cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Korenstein et al., 2018</xref>) and a financial cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaudin-Seiler, 2016</xref>). Identifying and eliminating low-value medical practices will, therefore, reduce costs and improve care.</p><p>Medical reversals are a subset of low-value medical practices and are defined as practices that have been found, through randomized controlled trials, to be no better than a prior or lesser standard of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Prasad et al., 2011</xref>). It can, however, be difficult to identify medical reversals. For example, Cochrane reviews provide high-quality evidence on medical practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garner et al., 2013</xref>), but each review focuses on only one practice and many practices have not been reviewed by Cochrane. The Choosing Wisely initiative in the US maintains a list of low-value medical practices, but it relies on medical organizations to report such practices and often includes only those practices where there is a high degree of consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaudin-Seiler, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we report how a systematic search of randomized controlled trials in three leading medical journals – the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) – identified 396 medical reversals. It is our hope that, by building on previous efforts in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>), this list will help others to eliminate the use of these practices.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We reviewed JAMA and the Lancet between 2003 and 2017, and NEJM between 2011 and 2017, and identified a total of 7036 original articles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; 2911 in JAMA, 2624 in the Lancet, and 1501 in NEJM). There were 3017 articles reporting the results of randomized control trials regarding a medical practice, and these articles were further coded for novelty/establishment and whether the outcomes were positive, negative, or inconclusive. After excluding studies that were novel (n = 1373) or established with positive or inconclusive outcomes (n = 1229), there were 415 (14%) studies identified as tentative medical reversals. After a search of systematic reviews to refute these tentative reversals, 19 were excluded, leaving a total of 396 medical reversals (6% of all original articles and 13% of all randomized trials).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45183.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of selection process to identify included randomized trials.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45183-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Many of these 396 reversals had been the subject of systematic reviews: in 209 cases (53%) the systematic review confirmed that the medical practice in question was indeed a medical reversal; in 109 cases (28%) the results of the systematic review were inconclusive; and for 78 cases (20%) there was no systematic review. 154 of the reversals (39%) were found in JAMA, 129 (33%) were found in NEJM, and 113 (29%) were found in Lancet.</p><p>Reversal study characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Cardiovascular disease was the most common medical category (20%, n = 80), followed by public health/preventive medicine (12%, n = 48), and critical care (11%, n = 45). Regarding the type of intervention, medication was the most common (33%, n = 129), followed by a procedure (20%, n = 81), vitamin/supplement (13%, n = 53), device (9%, n = 35) and system intervention (8%, n = 30). The breakdown of funding categories were as such (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>): 253 (63.9%) were from non-industry sources only; 88 (22.2%) were from a combination of industry and non-industry sources; 36 (9.1%) from industry only sources; and 3 (0.8%) from non-industry sources plus insurance company (n = 2) or a development bank (n = 1).

This treatment is frequently prescribed by physicians to treat lumbar stenosis and other conditions, with an estimated 25% of the Medicare population and 74% of patients at the Veteran’s Administration being prescribed this treatment. As the usage of glucocorticoid injections increased to treat various ailments, so did the cost.

Traditionally, surgeons performed surgery on the arrested heart, on-pump CABG, which allowed for increased surgical precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shroyer et al., 2009</xref>). However, surgeons grew concerned that the cross clamping of the aorta, necessary for the on-pump CABG procedure, may be harmful to patients and increase mortality and risk of stroke or other systemic embolic events in these patients. The off-pump method, operating on a beating heart, was developed to decrease the perioperative risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grover, 2012</xref>). However, the clinical literature reported different results about the relative efficacy of off-pump CABG as compared with on-pump CABG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamy et al., 2012</xref>). The CORONARY trial (n = 4752) compared on-pump and off-pump CABG surgery in patients with coronary heart disease. This follow up study on the results of the CORONARY trial found the after 4 years, patients who underwent on-pump and off-pump CABG has similar rates of outcomes of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and repeat revascularization (23.1%% and 23.6%, respectively; hazard ratio with off-pump CABG, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–1.10; p=0.72). The costs between the two treatments was similar as well.

Based on the current evidence, on-pump CABG should continue to be the standard surgical treatment.

This procedure is frequently done in the United States; one estimate is that more than 465,000 patients receive this procedure annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozic et al., 2012</xref>). Given the frequency and cost of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and lack of concrete evidence on the clinical benefit of the procedure, the METEOR trial was designed to assess the efficacy of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery as compared with a physical-therapy for increasing physical function of patients with a meniscal tear and moderate osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katz et al., 2013</xref>). METEOR found that there was not a significant decrease in the WOMAC score—a measure of physical function in which a higher score means worse physical function—between the patients undergoing surgery and those receiving initial physical therapy. The WOMAC score after 6 months was 20.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.9 to 23.9) in the surgical group and 18.5 (95% CI, 15.6 to 21.5) in the physical-therapy group (mean difference, 2.4 points; 95% CI, −1.8 to 6.5). The authors conclude that the finding of the METEOR trial advocates for an initial nonoperative strategy for treatment.

This list represents practices from all disciplines of medical care. These practices add to a previously reported list of 146 medical reversals published during years 2001–2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Efforts to identify low-value practices are numerous. In the US Choosing Wisely initiative began by asking members of each medical specialty to provide a list of the top five diagnostic tests or treatments that are expensive and have evidence showing a lack of benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schpero, 2014</xref>): similar initiatives have been implemented in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vries et al., 2016</xref>). Some have performed systematic searches of the scientific databases using key words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vries et al., 2016</xref>). Others have used a multiplatform attempt, consisting of searching the peer-reviewed literature, insurance and health organization databases, and opportunistic samplings of knowledgeable experts in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elshaug et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these ways to identify medical reversals or low-value practices has advantages and disadvantages, but identifying these practices can be challenging because of their heterogeneity, the lack of established methods to identify these practices, the difficulty in applying them to the correct population or subpopulation, and the obstacle of prioritizing which practices are more or less low-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elshaug et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Prior work by Schwartz and colleagues approximated the financial costs of 26 low-value services that are more commonly used in the older adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). They estimated that spending for these services in the Medicare population was between $1.9 and $8.5 billion during 2008–2009, which was between 0.6% and 2.7% of Medicare Parts A and B spending. In their analysis, at least 25% of Medicare beneficiaries received low-value services during 2008–2009. These results are especially notable considering the authors only used the 26 most commonly used low-value services. In contrast, the ubiquity of medical reversals has been previously reported upon in the NEJM, where 146 practices were identified as medical reversals over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we hope to add to the prior efforts of others in providing a larger and more comprehensive list (396 practices in total) for clinicians and researchers to guide practice as they care for patients more effectively and more economically.</p><p>We found reversals in a variety of medical sub-fields and types of devices, procedures, or practices. These reversals had been practiced and tested in high-income as well as low- to middle-income countries, although the highest percentage of reversals was in high-income countries, likely because most randomized trials are performed in this setting. In countries like the US, where there was a 20% increase in spending between 2013 and 2015, and drug prices alone surpassed the increase in aggregate health care spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kesselheim et al., 2016</xref>), the identification and disuse of costly and ineffective (or possibly harmful) medications and practices are especially important. For example, bevacizumab (Avastin) was approved in 2008 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US for metastatic breast cancer under the accelerated approval program, but was later shown to not improve overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vitry et al., 2015</xref>), even though the cost to each patient was $88,000 per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Selyukh, 2011</xref>). Consequently, the FDA approval for that indication was withdrawn in November 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vitry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Reversals were not just limited to practices performed by physician or health care providers only. Many reversals involved practices where the physician was a ‘gatekeeper’ to access these practices, but some were practices where the patient could access on their own, such as behavioral practices (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness interventions), complementary or non-traditional practices (e.g., acupuncture), dietary supplements (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids or vitamin A supplementation), community practices (e.g., programs to prevent teenage pregnancy or self-poisoning), or wearable technology. Wearable technology has become especially popular among people who are interested in tracking their physical activity in an effort to lose weight. A study on the use of wearable technology, however, found that weight loss was significantly less among the group that had access to wearable technology, compared to the group that did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jakicic et al., 2016</xref>). With increasing availability of healthcare interventions that are readily accessible to everyone without a prescription, there needs to be greater discussion on whether these work between patients and physicians, as well as discussion on the regulation of these interventions.</p><p>13% of all randomized trials were medical reversals: this is slightly higher than a previous report based on an analysis of just one journal. There was some variation in the percentage of trials published in each journal that reported on practices considered as a medical reversal, ranging from 29% (113/396) for Lancet to 39% (154/396) for JAMA.</p><p>Finally, reversals highlight the importance of independent, governmental and non-conflicted funding of clinical research. The majority of reversal studies we found were funded by such sources (63.9%), with a minority funded solely by the industry (9.1%). Conversely, industry funded research represented between 35–49% of trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during years 2006 through 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ehrhardt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are several strengths and limitations to this paper. First, we looked at just three journals (each of which has a high impact factor). Results may not be broadly generalizable to all journals or fields, and reversals in our list could be affected by the editors’ decision to publish or not publish a given article. Second, documented evidence of the use of a newer practice was sometimes easier to find because it had come about during a time when there was more internet use. Conversely, documented evidence of an older practice was sometimes easier to find because there had been more historical commentary about its use. Because of this, newer or more recent practices may be more or less likely to be categorized as established than older or less recent practices. Third, others may categorize results differently, depending on background expertise of the investigators.</p><p>To help overcome this limitation, physicians in the clinical setting from a range of backgrounds were invited to review and comment on practices identified as reversals. Our dataset is presented in full in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. It is inevitable that others may feel differently and choose to reclassify some of our examples. We hope our work may serve to enhance and expand upon other efforts to identify and disincentivize low-value practices. Fourth, we relied on the study authors’ point of view on whether the results were positive or negative, and there may be reasonable differences of opinion regarding the interpretation of some studies. Fifth, we did not evaluate the quality of the meta-analysis used to confirm or refute the medical reversal. However, we tried to find the most recent review that was published in either Cochrane or medical journal (for that specialty) to confirm or refute the reversal. Finally, our definition of established may be broad in that we did not limit established practices to only those that were being used widespread, in part because once a practice has been adopted, even intermittently, it is difficult to get patients and patients to abandon this practice. We did, however, maintain that proof of establishment needed to codified into guidelines or be one for which we could prove use outside of a clinical trial or clinical protocol. Additionally, multiple physicians reviewed each practice to confirm that these practices were indeed reversals.</p><p>Our primary research objective was to compile a comprehensive review of medical reversals for the benefit of both medical professionals and lay persons. This type of work is fundamentally descriptive and does not seek to test a binary hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are a number of concepts and lessons that may be realized from the results. The breadth of reversals across the various fields of medicine emphasize the importance of conducting randomized trials for both novel and established practices. While it may impractical, if not impossible, to test every medical practice in a randomized setting, there are many testable practices that are adopted based on nonrandomized data or bio plausibility. There is a danger in expediting treatments into practice without data proving their efficacy. Once an ineffective practice is established, it is difficult to convince practitioners to abandon its use; eliminating a reversal from standard practice occurs slowly and with resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prasad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tatsioni et al., 2007</xref>). By aiming to test novel treatments before they are widespread, we can reduce the number of reversals in practice and prevent harms to patients and to the reputation of the medical field. We hope these findings propel medical professionals to critically evaluate their own practices and, going forward, demand high-quality research before adopting a practice, especially for practices that are costlier and/or more aggressive than standard of care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified 396 medical reversals spanning different types of medical disciplines, types of interventions, and populations.

We excluded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that did not concern a medical practice (e.g. a RCT that tested a biological question, such as the effect of testosterone on muscle mass) or that were individual-level patient meta-analyses.</p><p>We then excluded trials of novel practices, defined as practices only used in the confines of clinical trials. Established practices were included and defined as those used regularly outside of research trials. This could include off-label use or use outside of the US.</p><p>Next, we excluded trials that reached positive or inconclusive results. An article was considered positive if the trial met its primary endpoint and negative if it failed to meet the primary outcome or if the study measured a hard endpoint (quality of life, mortality, etc.) and failed to show statistical superiority over a prior or lesser standard of practice in the control arm. For non-inferiority or equivalence studies, meeting the pre-specified margin would be considered positive. For studies comparing two established interventions, the more expensive intervention needed to show benefit to be considered positive. Studies were deemed inconclusive if they demonstrated neither clear benefit nor harm (e.g., improved overall survival but no improvement in functional capacity in patients who have had a stroke) or the study was stopped early for reasons other than futility or adverse events.</p><p>For each tentative reversal in our dataset, we performed a two-part search to find a systematic review. Meta analyses and/or systematic reviews (MA/SRs) were sought for each RCT designated as a ‘reversal’ to determine whether the established practice was found to be ineffective across multiple studies. MA/SRs were found by searching, in this order: review articles that cited that trial in Pubmed.gov; review articles that cited the trial in Google Scholar; and then using search terms in Google Scholar. In some cases, MA/SRs were found using the journal website under ‘citing articles’. Because of the high-quality review process, Cochrane reviews were first choice for reviews on the article’s subject, but if there was no Cochrane review, a meta-analysis from another high-quality journal was used. More recent meta-analyses were prioritized over older meta-analyses on the same topic, and meta-analyses that population-weighted their analyses were prioritized over ones that did not. MA/SRs were categorized as 1) confirming reversal, 2) refuting reversal, 3) insufficient data on reversal, or 4) no MA/SR found. MA/SRs needed to include the RCT in order to be considered as a confirmation of a reversal, and the conclusions needed to be based on results from RCTs only (not on observational or nonrandomized studies).

editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Comprehensive Analysis of Recent Medical Reversals that includes 396 Low-Value Practices in the Biomedical Literature&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eduardo Franco acting as Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor.</p><p>As standard practice in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another in an online panel moderated by the Reviewing Editor. After consensus was reached, the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to identify low-value care or medical reversals from randomized controlled trials (RCT) published in three top-tier medical journals from 2003 to 2017. RCTs were included if they were on an established practice, and then whether the trial had negative results. The authors classified the type of intervention and discipline, and searched for a systematic review on the practice. Identification of medical reversals across disciplines is an enormous task and the authors have done well to carry this out systematically, and created a valuable resource (the list of 396 medical services) for de-adoption efforts. This paper partly overlaps with, but greatly extends the group's previous work building a sample of medical reversals.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Main issue: All reviewers raised concerns about lack of clarity on the aims of your work. Was your goal to identify practices that could be targeted for de-implementation? If that is the main purpose, this could be stated more clearly and the Discussion could better explain next steps. For example, would there be an additional layer of review before de-implementation campaigns? Are there additional questions that would need to be addressed to advance some of these treatments into a concerted de-implementation plan? The manuscript ended a bit abruptly and there might be a missed opportunity to discuss issues on evidence and whether/how these &quot;396 medical reversals&quot; indicate a problem.</p><p>1) The title could be more specific in referring to JAMA, Lancet, NEJM. It is a comprehensive analysis of those three journals, not 'the biomedical literature' which of course is far broader. The appropriate title can be discussed with the Features Editor.</p><p>2) General: Why was the BMJ not included as the fourth highest general medical journal? The BMJ has a strong track record of publishing work that aligns with the reversal agenda. Also, NEJM and JAMA tend to be very US-centric but both Lancet and BMJ (albeit UK based) tend to me more outward looking to the rest of the world. Given the degree of publication bias that works against reversals coming to light, the BMJ might offer high marginal yield and the fact that it was excluded may have been a missed opportunity. Please elaborate in more detail in the Discussion the choice of journals.</p><p>3) General: Is it possible that the definition of reversals was overly permissive? What might be more compelling is if the authors can document that interventions had been recommended in clinical practice guidelines at some point before the trial result. Or at least- it would be nice if evidence were presented that the intervention was in widespread use. It is possible that some interventions that &quot;reversed&quot; were not actually in widespread use and/or recommended.</p><p>4) Abstract: &quot;This may serve as a starting point for de-adoption efforts and the study of the utilization of these practices.&quot; This may be one starting point but with the proliferation of other lists (e.g., Choosing Wisely [CW]) this is a parallel or adjunct starting point. While this is likely a more robust starting point, the reality is CW lists are front and center right now so are attracting more attention than they probably warrant from an evidentiary basis.</p><p>5) Introduction: Readers would benefit from a definition of reversal as used in this study, and in particular if the focus is on interventions in toto, or their application by/to patient subgroups (e.g., accounting for heterogeneity of treatment effect), or both. This might be gleaned from Table 2 but it needs addressing upfront in main text (probably Introduction).</p><p>6) Introduction: &quot;…and identifying these practices is a starting point in for reducing cost and improving care.&quot; Again, with this framing you are missing an opportunity for this paper. There are so many lists of LVC now that identification is less of a challenge, prioritization from the lists perhaps more so, particularly for policymakers. The robust method you have undertaken and results offer as much if not more of a prioritization opportunity, than an identification opportunity. In short, taken in isolation it is identification, but viewed through the bigger picture it offers a prioritization angle, particularly given CW approaches by individual societies have used less formal methods.</p><p>7) Introduction, paragraph two: This paragraph is a bit confusing. It may be difficult to name (or identify?) these practices for many reasons beyond issues with the scope of the Cochrane review database. This should be expanded on.</p><p>8) Introduction, paragraph three:. This paragraph hints at some of the good reasons to go 'beyond' the CW lists to identify medical reversals, but these probably aren't obvious to readers unfamiliar with the campaign and I think really important to justify why a broader search strategy is necessary to identify low-value practices.</p><p>9) Introduction, paragraphs five and six: Referencing and focusing on the earlier study on the identified NEJM RCTs would make more sense here, rather than focus so much on the Schwartz 2014 study since the current article has very different aims/results compared to this paper.</p><p>10) Methods: For the second step (search out of systematic reviews)- how did the authors handle quality of SR/MA as well as instances where SR/MA's came to conflicting conclusions?</p><p>11) Results: The aim of the article was to compile a list of medical reversals. This is a challenge for the Results section, because there are many possible descriptive statistics from this list that the authors could choose to present (Table 1) – none of which is specific to the aim of the article. The Results (and/or Methods) section could improve with justification of why specific results were included.</p><p>12) Results: the paper does not appear to have been driven by a particular hypothesis- which makes it feel more like a gallery or reference work than a research report. It would have helped to give context if hypotheses were articulated and perhaps some relationships tested. For example, one wondered: who funded the &quot;reversal&quot; studies? How large were the reversals – did they tend to barely pull SR estimates over the null, or did they exert decisive effects?</p><p>Related to the above- it is not immediately clear to the reader what the message is here. Clearly, it is sometimes important to run randomized trials, since there can be residual uncertainty about efficacy. But there is no point in running trials if something is already proven. So the manuscript leaves lots of questions unanswered- are too many treatments reversed? Is there not enough research aimed at reversals? Does too much time pass between uptake and reversal? What types of interventions are at greater risk of an extended period of &quot;reversal latency?&quot; A better concluding paragraph would help pull the piece together. Right now it sort of ends abruptly.</p><p>13) Table 2 (and also the supplementary file 2 with all reversals) would be improved if they clearly stated the authors' classification of the medical discipline and intervention type. The authors stated this as a potential limitation and potential disagreement/debate with readers in the Discussion, so including these in Table 2 would at least give some insight into the authors' logic.</p><p>14) The authors also state that they hope the full list of reversals would be a resource for &quot;de-adoption efforts&quot;, so why not include the medical discipline in the supplementary file. This seems like an easy step to make it much more useful to specialists and policy-makers interested in disinvestment in their area.</p><p>15) It is also not clear how the supplementary file is organised. Why is there a split between the tables and references after intervention 57, 81 and so on? It would be helpful to have some headings or descriptions here. PubMed IDs (PMID) should be added to every entry for ready reference.</p><p>16) Discussion, paragraph three: Makes a really good point about the patient 'accessed' low-value care/reversals, which hasn't been discussed much in the literature before. Adding something about the need for direction/further research here would be useful to highlight this point more (such as how the public accesses or could be more aware of this evidence).</p><p>17) Strengths and limitations: &quot;Studies were deemed inconclusive if they demonstrated neither clear benefit nor harm.&quot; The qualifier 'inconclusive' may not be accounting for poor cost-effectiveness (e.g., inconclusive but at a cost, possibly more than a comparator). And harm is poorly measured in RCTs, certainly in relation to the trial evaluation and definitely in relation to its real world use, i.e., harms are incomprehensively measured, particularly those downstream harms (and costs). An 'inconclusive' label should place the burden of proof back on the intervention champions/sponsors to prove safety and effectiveness, rather than let it be perceived as benign. Also the Methods section does not speak to trials that involved measures of equivalence or non-inferiority. If an intervention was found clinically equivalent/non-inferior did it evade further scrutiny in this study? An obvious concern here is marginal cost-effectiveness (i.e., EQ/NI but more expensive) or questions about sufficient measuring and reporting of harm. Please clarify.</p><p>18) &quot;…and the conclusions needed to be based on results from RCTs only (not on observational or nonrandomized studies). Articles with MA/SRs refuting the reversal were excluded from the final analysis.&quot; But all RCTs are not created equal. Did you carry out quality appraisal and critique? Were RCTs with higher degrees of design rigour (adequate blinding, sham arms, use of appropriate comparator/s etc) offered more weight than those of less rigour? If not then might this mean your methods are quite conservative and therefore specific? (i.e., some of your excluded studies might be false negatives?) The last sentence in 'limitations' indicates no quality appraisal was conducted. If so this heightens the risk of false negatives, and this would be a major limitation of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45183.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Main issue: All reviewers raised concerns about lack of clarity on the aims of your work.

While there is the possibility that our coding of established is overly permissive, we attempted to minimize this. We did so by defining an ‘existing practice’ to be one that is codified into practice by guidelines, or one for which we could prove use outside of a clinical trial or clinical protocol. Of course, this definition is broad, and the degree to which a practice is used may range from some use to near total use. The solution to this would be to perform an administrative database search for every practice we considered. While this was not in the scope of the current work, it will be done for selected reversals in years to come.

Our intent was to highlight the financial ramifications of low-value medical practices. Since the Schwartz paper only looked at the 26 most common practices, the financial outcomes of 396 practices could be even greater. However, because a financial analysis was out of the scope of our study and we were not able to calculate the total costs, we discussed the work by Schwartz and colleagues. We did augment this part of the Discussion by bringing in prior medical reversal findings by Prasad and colleagues (2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Methods: For the second step (search out of systematic reviews)- how did the authors handle quality of SR/MA as well as instances where SR/MA's came to conflicting conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not do a formal analysis of the quality of the systematic reviews. Our preference was to use Cochrane Reviews because they are recognized for their high-quality methods in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Of the reversals that were confirmed by a review, 147 (70%) were confirmed by a Cochrane review. In cases where there was no Cochrane review and there were multiple reviews, we used ones that were newer and ones that population weighted their analysis.

An obvious concern here is marginal cost-effectiveness (i.e., EQ/NI but more expensive) or questions about sufficient measuring and reporting of harm. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points by the reviewer. Inconclusive does consider cost-effectiveness as far as the practice works or does not work, although our coding did not explicitly use cost to judge these practices. Reversals are things that did not improve important outcomes, and so we were most interested in the effectiveness of an intervention instead of the cost value of it. Some entities did not make our list if they offered real benefits even tremendous marginal cost. In other words, there may be non-reversals that are not cost effective. However, in many of the studies where there were notable cost differentials between the two treatments, the more expensive intervention was also the novel intervention. There were a few studies that compared two established interventions, where one was the more expensive of the two. In this case, the newer, albeit established, and more expensive would have had to have shown greater benefit for the results to be considered positive. Also, we took our results and took them in the context in which the study was framed. If the study was a noninferior or equivalence study and the intervention met the noninferiority margin, it was considered positive. We have added a few sentences to the Methods section for clarification. As for measuring harm, we did find that some interventions were harmful in a statistically significant way, these studies were coded as negative because they did not meet their primary endpoint. The studies that were coded as inconclusive were ones that may have met their primary endpoint, but other endpoints were as or more meaningful to the patient as the primary endpoint. Such is the case with alteplase for survivors of stroke, where it did prolong overall survival but did not improve functional scores. In this case, there is debate about which outcome is the better one on which to make a conclusive decision about benefits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) &quot;…and the conclusions needed to be based on results from RCTs only (not on observational or nonrandomized studies). Articles with MA/SRs refuting the reversal were excluded from the final analysis.&quot; But all RCTs are not created equal. Did you carry out quality appraisal and critique? Were RCTs with higher degrees of design rigour (adequate blinding, sham arms, use of appropriate comparator/s etc) offered more weight than those of less rigour? If not then might this mean your methods are quite conservative and therefore specific? (i.e., some of your excluded studies might be false negatives?) The last sentence in 'limitations' indicates no quality appraisal was conducted. If so this heightens the risk of false negatives, and this would be a major limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail of how the MA/SR were selected. We did not perform a formal evaluation of the quality of SR/MA. Our preference was to use a Cochrane Review because the quality of their reviews is well established, and in most cases, we were able to do so. In a number of instances, there was only one SR/MA to confirm or refute the reversal. In instances where there were multiple reviews, our methods were to use a Cochrane review first, then another review from a high-quality journal, with newer reviews having priority over older reviews, and reviews that population-weighted their analysis over ones that did not. As for the quality of the individual RCTs, we deferred to the SR/MA to report that.</p></body></sub-article></article>
