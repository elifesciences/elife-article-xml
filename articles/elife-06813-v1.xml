When the first <italic>Peromyscus</italic> specimens were shipped to European systematicists in the late 18th century, their resemblance to the local wood mouse prompted the designation <italic>Mus sylvaticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hooper, 1968</xref>). At the time, little was known of the diversity of rodents worldwide and most were assigned the generic term <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linnaeus, 1758</xref>). The name <italic>Peromyscus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gloger, 1841</xref>) was first employed, albeit narrowly, in the middle of the 19th century. <italic>Quadrupeds of North America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audubon and Bachman, 1854</xref>) recognized only three species now known to belong to <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, and <italic>Mammals of North America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baird, 1859</xref>) included a mere 12. But by the turn of the 20th century, <italic>Peromyscus</italic> included 143 forms, 42 of which represented monotypic or good biological species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Osgood, 1909</xref>). The genus saw several additional revisions throughout the 20th century as North American mammalogy matured and natural history collections expanded. Today 56 species are recognized, the most widespread and diverse being <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Musser and Carleton, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Thus, although not immediately appreciated, <italic>Peromyscus</italic> includes more species than any other North American mammalian genus and, apart from <italic>Mus</italic> and <italic>Rattus</italic>, more is known concerning its biology in the laboratory than any other group of small mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">King, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kirkland and Layne, 1989</xref>). Several disciplines including ecology, evolution, physiology, reproductive biology and behavioral neuroscience have all employed <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, inspiring its label as ‘the <italic>Drosophila</italic> of North American mammalogy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dewey and Dawson, 2001</xref>). Arguably, the emergence of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> as a model system was propelled by our cumulative knowledge of its fascinating and varied natural history.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06813.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified phylogeny depicting the relationships among muroid rodent model organisms.</title><p><italic>Peromyscus</italic> belong to the Cricetidae family, which includes voles (<italic>Microtus</italic>), hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus</italic>), and New World rats and mice.

Members of the genus are distributed from the southern edge of the Canadian Arctic to the Colombian border of Panama (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Various demographic and biogeographic factors (e.g., Pleistocene glacial and pluvial cycles, population expansions, mountain range elevations and sea-level changes) have influenced the diversity and distribution of deer mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sullivan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Riddle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dragoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalkvik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">López-González et al., 2014</xref>). The result is a mosaic of widespread and restricted species ranges shaped by both dispersal and vicariance events. Our knowledge of the distributions, home ranges and habitat preferences of deer mice comes primarily from the trapping data and field notes of early natural historians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sumner, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dice, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blair, 1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">1951</xref>). Osgood's influential 1909 taxonomic revision was built on examinations of more than 27,000 specimens from diverse locales that were collected primarily by the US Biological Survey. Today, more than 120,000 <italic>Peromyscus</italic> specimens are accessioned in Natural History museums across North America and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These invaluable collections document more than a century of dynamic relationships between deer mice and their environment. For example, by comparing past and present-day collecting locales, shifts in the distributions of deer mice have been linked to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moritz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rowe et al., 2014</xref>), and morphological analyses of these museum specimens reveal how deer mice respond to changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grieco and Rizk, 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06813.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>North American distributions of eight <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species currently maintained as outbred laboratory stocks (based on data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hall, 1981</xref>).</title><p>Some ranges are narrow and others are extensive, with many overlapping to a large extent.

The question of whether continuous (or quantitative) traits are subject to the same rules of inheritance as discrete characters was central to the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis.</p><p>Between 1914 and 1930, Sumner carefully measured several quantitative traits—most notably coat color—that varied among geographically distinct subspecies of <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, which he then crossed in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sumner, 1930</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dobzhansky (1937)</xref> highlighted these data as empirical support for the multiple gene hypothesis for the inheritance of quantitative traits.
