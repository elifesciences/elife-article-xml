While the related factors Helios and Eos have defined roles in regulatory T cells (Treg), a role for Ikaros has not been established. To determine the function of Ikaros in the Treg lineage, we generated mice with Treg-specific deletion of the Ikaros gene (<italic>Ikzf1</italic>). We find that Ikaros cooperates with Foxp3 to establish a major portion of the Treg epigenome and transcriptome. Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibit Th1-like gene expression with abnormal production of IL-2, IFNg, TNFa, and factors involved in Wnt and Notch signaling. While <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-Treg-cko mice do not develop spontaneous autoimmunity, Ikaros-deficient Treg are unable to control conventional T cell-mediated immune pathology in response to TCR and inflammatory stimuli in models of IBD and organ transplantation. These studies establish Ikaros as a core factor required in Treg for tolerance and the control of inflammatory immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI065881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Struan FA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006458</institution-id><institution>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Struan FA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI059881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Foxp3 and Ikaros, two transcription factors genetically linked to autoimmune disease in humans, cooperate to establish the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of regulatory T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The zinc finger DNA binding protein Ikaros is expressed in hematopoietic precursors, where it regulates genes involved in antigen receptor recombination, hemoglobin synthesis, and genome stability by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgopoulos, 2002</xref>). Germline deletion of <italic>Ikzf1</italic> in mice results in arrested erythroid and lymphoid development, leading to immunodeficiency and immature B and T cell leukemia. In conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Ikaros functions as a transcriptional repressor of inflammatory cytokine genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O’Brien et al., 2014</xref>).

While Ikaros is required for induction of Foxp3 by TGF-B in conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heller et al., 2014</xref>), thymic-derived Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibited normal Foxp3 expression. Instead, loss of Ikaros activity results in significant dysregulation of the Treg gene expression program, including pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes normally not expressed by Treg (e.g. <italic>Ifng, Tnf, Il3, Il12rb, Tlr2</italic>), and genes required for normal Treg function (e.g. <italic>Tcf7, Lef1, Satb1, Nr4a1</italic>). Many of these dysregulated genes are Foxp3 targets, and we show that Foxp3 cooperates with Ikaros to occupy the majority of Foxp3 binding sites in Treg.</p><p>Mice with Treg lineage-specific loss of Ikaros occupancy showed an accumulation of activated regulatory and helper T cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues, but no evidence for increased T cell infiltration into organs or frank autoimmunity. This might be explained by the fact that Treg isolated directly ex vivo showed elevated expression of many genes that promote Treg function, potentially balancing the dysregulated program predicted to have deleterious effects on Treg homeostasis and function. However, upon TCR stimulation, <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient Treg induce a set of inflammatory Th1, Notch, and Wnt pathway genes normally repressed in Treg, and fail to control in vivo cellular and humoral immune responses mediated by conventional T cells. Importantly, our results show that the loss of suppressive function in vivo is not due to failure of Treg to home to sites of tissue inflammation. The lack of spontaneous inflammation or autoimmunity in <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-Cre mice is similar to mice with Treg-specific deletion of <italic>Prdm1 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bankoti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cretney et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Icos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rubtsov et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>Mef2d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Giorgio et al., 2020</xref>).

Moreover, deletion of <italic>Mef2d, Blimp1, Icos,</italic> or <italic>Il10</italic> in Treg does not impact their suppressive activity in vitro, but impairs their function in vivo in the context of inflammation.</p><p>Although the literature is not in complete agreement, Eos and Helios are considered to be necessary for Treg function through their contribution to the Treg gene expression program. Eos, like Ikaros, is required to repress inflammatory gene expression by Treg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gokhale et al., 2019</xref>), and Eos can cooperate with Foxp3 to strengthen a core Treg gene expression program when ectopically co-expressed in conventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of Helios function in Treg has the primary effect of destabilizing <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Getnet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sebastian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and also contributes to core Treg gene expression when ectopically co-expressed with Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these functions, neither Eos, Helios, nor Aiolos were able to compensate for the loss of Ikaros, despite the fact that <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient Treg express all these proteins at comparable or higher levels as compared to wild-type Treg. The availability of Helios ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) and Helios-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yates et al., 2018</xref>) data allowed us to compare Ikaros and Helios genome occupancy and gene regulatory programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Of the 1838 Helios binding sites and 5477 Ikaros binding sites detected in Treg open chromatin, 64 are shared, representing only ~3.5% of Helios binding sites and ~1% of Ikaros binding sites. Similarly, we found a statistically significant overlap between the Ikaros-dependent set of 660 genes and the Helios-dependent set of 147 genes, but this consisted of only nine genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). For five of these genes, Ikaros and Helios have the same effect on expression, while Ikaros and Helios have the opposite effect on expression of the other four genes.

Briefly, 5×10<sup>6</sup> purified cells were fixed in a medium for 15 min at room temperature using complete cell fixative solution prepared using formaldehyde and cell fixative solution from the kit. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/20 media volume of stop solution, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and a cell pellet was stored at –80°C for later use or cells were lysed in chromatin preparation buffer cells as described in the protocol. The cell pellet was resuspended in ChIP buffer and chromatin was sonicated by a QSonica Q800R sonicator with settings: amplitude 20%, pulse for 30 s on, 30 s off, for a total of 30 cycles. For input DNA preparation, 25 ul of the sonicated sample was removed and DNA was isolated as suggested in the protocol. An agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis was performed for DNA isolated from the input fraction to determine the sonication efficiency. ChIP-validated anti-mouse Ikaros antibody (cat #39355) and H3K27Ac antibody (cat #39133) were purchased from Active Motif. For Foxp3 ChIP-seq, eBioscience anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (cat#14-5773-82) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The volume of the sheared chromatin was adjusted to 200 ul using ChIP buffer, and to which was added 5 ul of Protease inhibitor, and a mix containing ChIP antibody (4 ug) and 5 ul of blocker, mixed and pre-incubated at room temperature for a minute. Final volume of the ChIP reaction was 240 ul, which was incubated at 4°C overnight on a rotator. Antibody-precipitated chromatin immune complexes were collected using washed protein G agarose beads and immune complexes were washed 5X in ChIP filtration columns using wash buffer, and eluted the DNA with elution buffer. The eluted DNA was reverse cross-linked and further purified through DNA purification columns. ChIP’d DNA was eluted from the column using 30 ul of DNA purification elution buffer. All ChIP-seq and input DNA libraries were made using a ThruPLEX DNA-Seq kit (cat #R400674, Takara Bio, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the fragmented DNA obtained from ChIP reaction or input DNA was end-repaired to generate blunt ends, to which stem-loop adaptors with blocked 5’ ends are ligated. Libraries were amplified through high-fidelity amplification buffer mix and Takara dual indexing primers (cat# R400407). Finally, the amplified dual-indexed libraries were purified using AMpure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat # A63880) at 1:1 ratio. The purified DNA was recovered from the beads using 20 ul of TE buffer. The library quality was checked on a bioanalyzer using a high sensitivity DNA Chip. Library DNA concentration was determined using Qubit. Dual-indexed ChIP-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Reads were aligned to mm9 using bowtie2 and duplicated reads were marked using Picard with parameters VALIDATION_STRINGENCY = LENIENT and ASSUME_SORTED = true and removed samtools. Library quality was accessed using samtools flagstat to assess library complexity and strand cross correlation to assess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kharchenko et al., 2008</xref>). Peaks were called using MACS2 with the parameters -g mm9 –nomodel –p 0.01 –keep-dup_all with the – extsize estimated fragment size from the strand cross-correlation for each replicate of H3K27ac, Ikaros, or Foxp3 with matching input sample. Reads were subsequently filtered by the ENCODE mm9 blacklist regions. Within the condition peaks were filtered to ones found in at least two replicates. Binary comparison between different ChIP peaks and ATAC-seq was performed using the R package GenomicRanges (1.46.1) findOverlaps function. For differential comparisons of H3K27ac ChIP signal, reads were normalized against background (10 K bins) using csaw (v1.28, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html</ext-link>). Peaks with a cpm value less than 3.0 were removed from further differential analysis. Differential analysis was performed using glmQLFit approach in edgeR (v3.36.0) with the normalization scaling factors calculated from csaw. FDR &lt;0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance. Signal reproducibility between replicate samples was accessed using pairwise Pearson correlation tests and principal component analysis. Significant OCR overlapping with H3K27ac peaks were annotated as enhancers. Correlations between enhancer accessibility, H3K27ac ChIP signal, and expression of nearest gene were computed using Pearson correlation coefficient implemented in the R function cor.test. Super-enhancers were called using the rank ordering of super-enhancer (ROSE) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly OCR called by ATAC-seq were used as input regions and clustered by genomic coordinates with a 12.5 kb stitching window. Merged replicates of WT and Ikzf1-cko H3K27ac signal and input were used as a measure of enhancer activity. The signal is represented as input subtracted reads per million per basepair and then are ranked-ordered. The position in the ranked list where the change in signal (slope when x-axis is the super-enhancer rank and y- axis is signal) equals 1 is used to define super-enhancers by the rapid increase in enhancer activity. Super-enhancers were defined independently for WT and Ikzf1-cko H3K27ac data. ChIP peaks were annotated to their nearest gene based on linear genomic distance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA-seq library generation and analysis</title><p>Total CD4+ T cells isolated from individual WT YFP Cre+ and Ikzf1-Treg-cko mice (three biological replicates) were sorted for YFP+ Tregs on a FACS-Jaz sorter. For stimulation, Tregs were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (1 ug/ml each) for 4 hrs. Total RNA was isolated from the unstimulated and stimulated Tregs using Direct-zol RNA micro prep kit (Zymo Research). Quality of the DNase-treated total RNA was checked on a bioanalyzer. Ribosomal RNA was depleted from the total RNA using QIAseq fast select multi-RNA removal kit for mouse RNA (Qiagen) and then RNAseq libraries were made using NEB Next Ultra II Directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina. RNAseq library quality was checked on a high sensitivity bioanalyzer and dual indexed libraries were sequenced to 51 bp reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The pair-end fastq files were mapped to genome assembly mm9 by STAR (v2.6.0c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) for each replicate. Ensembl v67 mm9 annotation was used for gene feature annotation and the unadjusted read count for gene feature was calculated by htseq-count (v0.6.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) with parameter settings -f bam -r pos -s reverse -t exon -m union. The gene features annotated as rRNAs were removed from the final sample-by-gene read count matrix. The differential analysis was performed in R (v3.3.2) using the edgeR package (v3.16.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, the raw reads on gene features with total CPM (read counts per million) value of less than 3.66 (the bottom 25% gene features when comparing the highest count per condition across all samples) were removed from differential analysis. The trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method were used to calculate normalization scaling factors and quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear (glmQLFit) approach was applied to the count data and through pairwise comparisons of stimulated and unstimulated IK cko and WT. The differential expression genes (DEGs) between were identified with cut-off FDR&lt;0.05 and absolute logFC&gt;1. TPM values were calculated for differentially expressed genes and scaled expression values (across rows) were depicted using the R package ComplexHeatmap (2.10.0). Immunologic signature gene sets annotated in MSigDB (v7.0) were used for gene set enrichment analyses. Statistical significance of gene set enrichment for up and down regulated were determined using the hypergeometric test (one-tailed), implemented in the R phyper function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ATAC-seq library generation and analysis</title><p>YFP + Tregs were FACS sorted from Foxp3-YFP-Cre and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice. Half were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 +anti-CD28 for 4 hr and half were left unstimulated. One hundred thousand cells were lysed with 50 ul of cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and centrifuged at 550 g for 10 min at 4 C. Supernatants were discarded and nuclear pellets were subjected to Tn5 transposition using Nextera DNA preparation kits (cat #1502812). DNA was purified from transposition reaction using Qiagen Min-Elute PCR purification kits. Transposed DNA fragments were PCR amplified and indexed using Nextera index kits. PCR reaction products were size selected using AMpure-XP beads and DNA fragments were re-suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl. DNA concentration was determined by Qubit, and ATAC seq library quality was checked on a bioanalyzer. Dual-indexed libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Open chromatin peaks were called using the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/">https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/</ext-link>). Briefly, pair-end reads from three biological replicates for each cell type were aligned to hg19 genome using bowtie2, and duplicate reads were removed from the alignment. Narrow peaks were called independently for each replicate using macs2 (-p 0.01 <monospace>--nomodel</monospace> <monospace>--shift </monospace>–75 <monospace>--extsize</monospace> 150 -B <monospace>--SPMR</monospace> <monospace>--keep-dup</monospace> all <monospace>--call-summits</monospace>) and ENCODE blacklist regions (ENCSR636HFF) were removed from peaks in individual replicates. Peaks from all replicates were merged by bedtools (v2.25.0) within each cell type and the merged peaks present in less than two biological replicates were removed from further analysis. Finally, ATAC-seq peaks from both cell types were merged to obtain reference open chromatin regions. Quantitative comparisons of wild-type and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-cko open chromatin landscapes were performed by evaluating read count differences against the reference OCR set. De-duplicated read counts for OCR were calculated for each library and normalized against background (10 K bins of genome) using the R package csaw (v1.8.1). OCR peaks with less than 3.6 CPM support in the top 25% of samples were removed from further differential analysis. Differential analysis was performed independently using edgeR (v3.16.5). Differential OCR between cell types were called if FDR &lt;0.05 and absolute log2 fold change &gt;1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Transcription factor motif enrichment</title><p>Enrichment of known transcription factors binding motifs was determined for the differential sets of OCRs using the R package PWMEnrich (v4.30.0). Enrichment of differential OCRs were calculated using all OCRs in the background model. Sequences were extracted from the bioconductor genome reference BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.masked (v1.3.99) using the R package Biostrings (v2.62.0). We used JASPAR2020 position-weight matrix database as the motif reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fornes et al., 2020</xref>). P values were adjusted using FDR. Transcription factor footing improves the confidence of TF binding over pure sequencing matching. We identified putative Ikaros and Foxp3 footprint using HINT-ATAC (<underline>H</underline>mm-based <underline>I</underline>de<underline>N</underline>tification of <underline>T</underline>ranscription factor footprints). HINT-ATAC corrects for Tn5 cleavage bias using a HMM based-approach to identify de novo TF footprints. Replicate deduplicated ATAC-seq bam files were merged and used as input to identify TF footprints located in the consensus set of OCRs. The de novo TF footprints were then matched to known TF PWMs in the JASPAR2020 database.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>DNA methylation analysis</title><p>To assess the natural thymic or peripheral origin of Treg, Foxp3 TSDR region which is fully demethylated in natural Tregs, was analyzed for CpG methylation by sodium bisulfite sequencing method. DNA methylation level at IFNg intronic enhancer was also analyzed. Briefly, 1 ug of DNA extracted from FACS sorted CD4+YFP+ Treg, or CD4 conventional T cells was bisulfite converted following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>. The converted DNA was desalted using the Wizard DNA clean-up system (Promega), desulphonated, neutralized, and precipitated with ethanol. The Foxp3 CNS2-TSDR, the IFNg promoter, and the IFNg intronic enhancer regions were PCR amplified from bisulfite-converted DNA using nested PCR primers as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Floess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Northrop et al., 2006</xref>).

CD4+CD25-negative conventional T cells and Treg were purified from the splenic and lymph node lymphocytes of male WT YFPCre +or Ikzf1-fl-Foxp3-Cre+ mice. Batches of Rag1 KO male mice consisting of 5 mice per group were received retro-orbital injection of 1 million WT CD4+ Tconv along with (0.25X106) WT or Ikaros-deficient Treg. Recipient mice were weighed three times a week and observed for various IBD induced-clinical symptoms. Mice were sacrificed after 40 days of T cell transfer, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and colon were removed. Small pieces of tissue were cut from the lower part of colon and were fixed in formal fixative for histopathological analysis. Single cell suspension was made from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes from individual mice, lymphocyte cell density was estimated using a hemocytometer. Lymphocytes were stained for CD4, CD8, CD25, CD44, and Foxp3 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Absolute T cell count was estimated using hemocytometer count and cell frequency derived from the flow cytometry analysis. Variation in weight curve between groups were statistically analyzed by ANOVA (GraphPad Prism).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cardiac transplantation</title><p>Fully MHC-mismatched BALB/c hearts (H-2d) were transplanted heterotopically into Foxp3-YFP-Cre and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice by anastomosis of the donor ascending aorta and pulmonary artery to the recipient infrarenal aorta and pulmonary artery. On days 0, 2, and 4 of posttransplant, the transplant recipient mice were given i.p injection of CTLA4 Ig fusion protein (200 ug) and CD154 (200 ug). A separate batch of cardiac recipient mice were administered donor-specific transfusion (DST) with Balb/c splenocytes (5 million cells/recipient) and a single dose of MR1 (250 ug). Cardiac graft survival was determined by abdominal palpation, and cessation of cardiac contraction was considered as rejection of the graft. Grafts were monitored for 100 days, and graft survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meir/log-rank methods. For histopathological analysis, a separate batch of mice consisting of 3 mice per group were subjected to same transplant procedure for a short duration and then these recipient mice were sacrificed, grafts were removed before rejection, fixed in 1 X formal solution, and analyzed by standard histopathological methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cardiac histopathology and intragraft gene expression analysis</title><p>For histopathologic analysis of cardiac graft and colon from IBD experiments, portions of tissues were fixed in Shandon formal-Fixx solution (1X), Thermo Scientific.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4 and Foxp3 by the CHOP Pathology cores. Blinded histopathological evaluations were performed by a histopathologist. For intragraft gene expression analysis and histopathological analysis, a separate batch of mice consisting of 3 mice per group were subjected to same transplant procedure with a duration of 19 days for CTLA4Ig and MRI-treated mice and a duration of 14 days for MRI and DST-treated mice, based on the weakness of transplant heart palpitation. These transplant recipient mice were sacrificed, graft was removed, a portion of the cardiac graft was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and a second portion of the graft tissue was fixed in 1X formal solution and analyzed by standard histopathological methods. Total RNA was extracted from the homogenized graft tissue using Trizol. One microgram of RNA was treated with DNase to avoid DNA contamination.

We appreciate that the reviewers and editors recognize the strength and comprehensive nature of our in vivo, cellular, biochemical, and genome-wide molecular studies, which are well-organized in the manuscript. The acknowledgment of the complementary functional experiments in two models of inflammatory disease is also encouraging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weakness:</p><p>The authors claim that the mice have no pathologic signs of autoimmune disease even at a relatively old age, yet mice have an increased number of activated CD4+ T cells and T-follicular helper cells (even at the age of 6 weeks) as well as reduced naïve T-cells. Thus, immune homeostasis is perturbed in these mice even at a young age and the eXect of inflammatory microenvironments on cellular functions cannot be ruled out. Further, clear conclusions from the genome-wide studies are lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewers' comment regarding the absence of overt autoimmune pathologies in Ikzf1-fl/fl-Foxp3-Cre+ mice, despite the increased frequency of activated CD4+ T cells, TFH cells, and apparent perturbation of lymphocyte homeostasis, even at a young age. It is noteworthy that while Ikaros is implicated in various autoimmune diseases, our specific mouse model in which Ikaros expression is lost only in Tregs, may not lead to a strong autoimmune phenotype in part due to the controlled environment of an extra-clean, pathogen-free animal facility. This aligns with a related study by Ana et al (2019, J. Immunol: doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1801270) in Ikzf1-fl/fl-dLck-Cre+ mice with loss of Ikaros expression in all mature CD4+ T cells, including Tregs, that exhibit no overt signs of overt autoimmune disease. Moreover, our transcriptomic studies reveal that increased expression of inflammatory genes in Ikzf1-deficient Treg is coupled with the simultaneous upregulation of genes with positive roles in Treg function. This balance suggests a compensatory mechanism within Ikaros-deficient Tregs that maintains their suppressive function until encountering an inflammatory immune challenge, which eventually leads to loss of Treg suppressive function in Treg-specific Ikaros-deficient mice. Our studies clearly show that Ikaros has cell-intrinsic effects in Treg that also lead to cell-extrinsic effects mediated by secreted factors that are likewise regulated by Ikaros. This can be said about the function of any transcription factor in any cell type. Our data clearly support the conclusion from the genome-wide studies that Ikaros plays a major role in establishing the active chromatin landscape, gene expression profile, and function of regulatory T cells in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following recommendations consolidate the views of the three reviewers of the manuscript.</p><p>The experiments suggested and, in some instances, fresh analysis, are thought necessary, so that the evidence of Ikaros-Foxp3 interactions regulating T-regulatory cell biology is comprehensive and solid. We hope the comments are useful to strengthen the comprehensive analysis reported in this submission.</p><p>The primary concern is that the indications of inflammation in the mice (see points 1 &amp; 2 below) do not reflect in the experiments or consequent conclusions. The gap in the data should be addressed by testing these interactions in an appropriate context for which suggestions are included.</p><p>Please note that the title of the manuscript may be modified to reflect the use of mice as the system of study for this work.</p><p>(1) The evidence of inflammation (increased CD4 and T follicular cells) reported in the work requires new experiments to rigorously examine the relationship between Ikaros and Foxp3 to rule out the possible impact of the (inflammatory) microenvironment of the mice (Please see: Zemmour et al., Nat. Immunology 22, 607, 2021). Two possible experimental systems in mice are suggested.</p><p>a) The use of heterozygous female mice, which should be phenotypically normal due to the presence of 50% normal Treg. Or,</p><p>b) The generation of bone chimeras between wild-type and deficient mice using congenic markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that immune dysregulation that develops in the mice with age or during an inflammatory insult due to loss of Ikaros function in the Treg lineage is an important part of the phenotype of the animals. Our studies show that loss of Ikaros function in Treg influences the gene expression program such that Treg now produce inflammatory cytokines and ligands capable of engaging receptors expressed on Treg and other cells. This likely results in autocrine and paracrine signaling that induces further metabolic and gene expression differences not observed in wild-type mice. Indeed, we report in the manuscript that a sizable fraction of the differentially expressed genes do not appear to be direct Ikaros targets, but rather are downstream of Ikaros target genes such as Il2, Ifng, Notch, and Wnt. The mosaic experiments suggested will be a useful topic of future studies. Importantly, we argue that no gene expression study involving modulation of transcription factor activity in an organism- or cell-based system can be designed to measure only the direct effects of that transcription factor in a manner isolated from any indirect, downstream effects on the expression of other genes. We suggest that our current data remain highly valuable, as they reveal real and relevant biology in physiologic in vivo systems that do not depend upon the use of heterologous models. The fact that loss of Ikaros has an effect not only on its direct targets, but on gene programs driven in turn by the indirect effects of Ikaros-regulated factors, has been acknowledged in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figs. 7 and S5 show accumulation of CD4 cells (activated, memory, Tfh, Tfr) in LNs and spleens of the Ikaros KO over time. This is accompanied by elevated Igs but without overt autoimmune disease. KO Tregs had equivalent suppressive activity as WT Tregs against WT TeX in vitro. However, TeX from KO mice were resistant to the suppressive eXects of WT or KO Tregs. The authors interpret this as due to the increased percentage of memory cells within the KO TeXs, although they did not formally prove this point. Figs. 9 and S6 show that Ikaros KO mice are unable to be tolerized for cardiac allograft survival using two diXerent standard tolerogenic regiments. The rejecting allografts are accompanied by increased T-cell infiltration and upregulation of inflammatory genes. The authors suggest there is increased alloantibody, but alloantibody does not seem to have been measured.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are currently exploring in more detail the dysregulation of humoral immunity in the Ikzf1-deficient Treg model and plan to report these results in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Linked to the above, a comparison of the chromatin occupancy of Ikaros in resting and activated Tregs would inform on whether and how Ikaros occupancy changes with the activation status of Tregs. Since the authors use in vitro stimulation for RNAseq and ATAC seq, ChIP seq analyses under these matching conditions will greatly add to the quality of the study. Since &quot;Foxp3-dependent&quot;, ie. diXerential gene expression in the Foxp3GFPKO cells (PMID: 17220874) gene expression has been shown to be not entirely the same as Treg signature (i.e. gene expression or Tregs compared to Tnv), it will be worth correlating Ikaros, Foxp3 co-occupied genes and the corresponding fate of their expression with Foxp3-dependent and independent Treg signature gene sets.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The prior study by Gavin et al. referred to above used duplicate samples instead of the standard three or more replicates required for a robust differential analysis of gene expression. The two samples in this study are variable, and no statistically significant differential gene expression was found between the experimental groups when we subjected these data to current analysis methods. For this reason, we have elected not to compare these prior data with our current data, which are robust, reproducible, and analyzed using current statistical methods. Furthermore, the mice used for the prior study develop a fatal inflammatory disease (scurfy) and therefore the Treg examined in this study would be subject to a much stronger extrinsic inflammatory environment than the Treg in our study, as our mice show no overt disease even with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the consequence of the cooperation between the two transcription factors that can be inferred from the experiments in the study remains unclear. It is suggested that the authors could first consider the ChIP seq data from Foxp3, Ikaros co- and diXerentially occupied genes, and then correlate with the ATAC seq and gene expression data to comment on the consequence of this cooperation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We find that Ikaros binding at a given region has a strong effect on accessibility, as reported in the manuscript, but that Foxp3 occupancy has less consequence, consistent with a prior study suggesting that Foxp3 largely utilizes the open chromatin landscape already present in the conventional CD4 T cell lineage (PMID:23021222). Our data suggest that the dominant effect of Ikaros on Foxp3 is at the level of chromatin occupancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the comparative analyses of Ikaros and Foxp3 co-occupied regions and gene expression outcome, the authors mention &quot;A total of 4423 Foxp3 binding sites were detected in the open chromatin landscape of wild-type Treg (Supplementary Table 9), and this ChIP-seq signal was enriched at accessible Foxp3 motifs.&quot; It is unclear whether the authors focused on the ATAC seq data and only examined the open chromatin regions for this analysis. In that case, it is unclear why. More so because the Ikaros footprint is more apparent in regions where accessibility is reduced upon deletion of Ikaros.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Foxp3 has been shown to bind primarily at open chromatin shared between Tconv and Treg, unlike the pioneer activity of other Fox family members (PMID: 23021222, biorXiv <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.06.561228v2.full.pdf">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.06.561228v2.full.pdf</ext-link>). Consistent with this, we found the majority of peaks were in open chromatin. The motif analysis is quantitative, not binary, and takes into account Foxp3 binding sites at regions considered open in either condition, which is why we can see enrichment of Foxp3 motifs at sites going from more open to less open in the absence of Ikaros.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Comments on figures:</p><p>The authors use MFI repeatedly in many of the figures for quantitation of antigen expression. This is misleading as several of the target antigens are normally expressed on a subpopulation of cells, e.g., Eos. Percent positive and MFI would be more relevant. Cytokine production should be presented by intracellular staining (e.g., IL-2, IFNg) as Elisa data does not allow one to determine the percentage of abnormally producing cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We show both ICS and ELISA in this paper, preferring ELISA because it is much more quantitative than ICS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suppl. Fig. 1c - the panels do not correspond precisely to the legend or the text. At least one panel is missing. In Supp fig 1c, the authors plotted eXector Tregs, which are by definition CD62LloCD44hi, but the Y axis says CD44hiCD62Lhi. Is this a typo? Also on page 4, describing this data the authors mentioned Tfr, but the data is not shown in the Supp fig 1c.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for catching these mistakes. We have corrected the typo in the figure panel for Supplementary Figure 1c. Follicular Treg data are indeed presented in Figure 7h, not Supplementary Figure 1, and we have corrected the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 2, which lists the diXerent categories of diXerentially expressed genes, it will be helpful if the authors add two columns indicating fold change and FDR values.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: These values are included in Table S1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 3c, the resolution of the histograms in the inset should be enhanced.</p><p>Fig. 3d, a histogram of representative CTV dilution plots, and an explanation of how the quantifications were done may be included.</p><p>Fig. 3e - not well labeled.

The data are a little hard to understand as the color scale is so subtle and the colors so close to one another that it is not entirely clear which gene expressions are increased vs decreased. Other than the simple statement that the Ikaros KO causes numerous changes, there does not seem to be a more consistent message from this data panel.</p><p>Fig. 4a, in addition to the bar graphs, it will be better to show the plots in a histogram, gated on Foxp3+ Tregs in WT and KO groups, with representative MFI indicated on top. The resolution of the scatter plots in this figure, as well as some others throughout the manuscript, may be improved. Please increase the resolution wherever necessary.</p><p>Fig. 4b should include representative plots for cytokine production gated in Tconv (CD4+Foxp3-) cells.</p><p>Figs. 5a-h, S2-3a-d, and Suppl. Tables S4-8 show a comprehensive ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analysis of genes and chromatin occupied or regulated by Ikaros, comparing Tconv vs Treg, stimulated vs naïve, and WT vs KO cells. It is a comprehensive tour-de-force analysis, again showing the major eXects of Ikaros on the entire Treg landscape of gene regulation.</p><p>Fig. S5h-j should be explained or labeled in more detail.

We also indicate in the figure legends that full gene lists are to be found in the supplementary tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8, &quot;Regions that exhibit reduced accessibility in Ikzf1 cko compared to wild-type Treg are enriched for the binding motif for Ikaros and the motif for TCF1 (Figure 5g).... &quot;. Is this Fig. 5i or 5g?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This statement is correct and is referring to data depicted in Figure 5g.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 6e, Flag-Ik7 is not visible in any of the inputs. The co-IP between Foxp3 and Runx1 (presumably a positive control) is not eXicient in this experimental condition. Co-IP experiments performed in primary cells upon retroviral transduction of the tagged proteins to confirm observations in cell lines are suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Runx1 is shown to co-precipitate with Foxp3 as expected, although the band is not intense, and the data depicted are representative of 3 experiments. Ik7 was included in this transient transfection experiment as a redundant control, and the referee is correct that Ik7 did not express well in this experiment and cannot be seen in this exposure. We showed these blots intact in the spirit of not digitally altering the data, and because the low Ik7 expression did not impact our ability to demonstrate specific co-precipitation of Foxp3 with full length Ikaros (Ik1). The images include nearly the entire mini-blots, and we have added molecular weight markers for clarity. As indicated in the legend, the cytokine and ChIP data in 6f are from a separate model of retrovirally Foxp3/Ik7transduced T cells that we and others have used in multiple prior studies (e.g. Thomas JI 2007, Thomas JI 2010). The interpretability of these experiments is not impacted by the transient transfection data from figure 6e. It should be noted that a prior study by Rudra et al. that is cited and referred to in the manuscript used a similar approach to also establish that Foxp3 and Ikaros form a complex in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 6f, the authors state that Foxp3 overexpression in CD4 cells results in promoter occupancy of both IL2 and IFNg, however, data shows only IL2. Also in 6f, Foxp3 overexpression reduces IL2 and IFNg secretion, measured by ELISA, which is recovered by IkDN. However, the eXect of Foxp3 along with WT Ikaros (which should not modulate, and if anything, further repress IL2, IFNg production) is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The reviewer is correct that ectopic expression of Ikaros leads to repression of cytokine gene expression, which we and others have shown in prior studies. Because the focus of this study was on loss of Ikaros function in Treg, we did not elect to overexpress full-length Ikaros. However, we completely agree that Ikaros GOF in Treg is an important topic for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 7e-g, how is %suppression calculated? Can representative CTV dilution plots for the suppression assays be shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Cell division was quantified as described previously (see ref 50), and percent suppression represents the reduction in cell division measured by Tconv in the presence of Treg compared to in the absence of Treg. This has been clarified in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 8 and the supplementary figures the representative colon pictures (Fig. S6a-c) do not show convincing diXerences in colon morphology even though all the other histology and clinical parameters are clear. Are the figures mislabeled?</p><p>In Fig 8c-e and other histology figures scale bars should be shown.</p><p>Fig. 8c-e, the Alcian blue staining among the groups appears similar; perhaps this is due to the low power magnification.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have edited this figure for clarity</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>Fig 10 is explained in the discussion section for the first time. The authors may want to consider including this when introducing Ikzf1 ChIPseq data for the first time in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The reviewer raises a valid point but we have elected to retain the current organizational structure of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more complete characterization of the activated conventional cells including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for cytokine production during aging may be considered, as it is highly likely that abnormalities in cytokine production will be observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree and are planning additional such experiments in future studies focusing on in vivo models of tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The failure of suppression of T cell proliferation which the authors claim is due to the presence of activated memory T cells can be better documented by using naive responder cells from the cKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree and are planning additional such experiments in a future study focusing on further aspects of cellular immunobiology impacted by Ikaros, but we will give preference to in vivo models of tolerance in such studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
