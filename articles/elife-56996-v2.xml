It involves a unique reductional cell division, known as meiosis, to generate highly specialized cells: the gametes. Indeed, the outcome of meiosis is the production of oocytes and spermatozoa, which are the most distinctive cells of an adult organism and are essential for the faithful transmission of the genome across generations.</p><p>The meiotic division is an orderly process that results in the pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes and crossover (CO) formation, which ultimately enable homologous chromosomes segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loidl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). In mammals, pairing of homologs is dependent on the repair of self-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase I by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Handel and Schimenti, 2010</xref>) and it leads to the intimate alignment of homologous chromosomes (synapsis) through the zipper-like synaptonemal complex (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cahoon and Hawley, 2016</xref>). The SC is a proteinaceous tripartite structure that provides the structural framework for DSBs repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>), as epitomized by the tight association of the recombination nodules (RNs, multicomponent recombinogenic factories) and the axial elements of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic DSBs repair is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that is highly regulated to promote the formation of at least one CO per bivalent. This chromosome connection between bivalents through chiasmata is required for a correct reductional division. As other DNA repair processes, proper meiotic recombination is essential for genome stability and alterations can result in infertility, miscarriage and birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Benavente, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Handel and Schimenti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Webster and Schuh, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Infertility refers to failure of a couple to reproduce and affects 10–15% of couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isaksson and Tiitinen, 2004</xref>). Infertility can be due to female factors, male factors, a combination of both or to unknown causes, each category representing approximately 25% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isaksson and Tiitinen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matzuk and Lamb, 2008</xref>). There are several underlying causes and physiological, genetic and even environmental and social factors can play a role. Forward and reverse genetic analyses in model organisms have identified multiple molecular pathways that regulate fertility and have allowed to infer reasonable estimates of the number of protein-coding genes essential for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Rooij and de Boer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schimenti and Handel, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a major cause of female infertility and affects about 1–3% of women under 40 years of age. It is characterized by cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. POI results from a depletion of the ovarian follicle pool and can be isolated or syndromic. Genetic causes of POI account for approximately 20% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). Although infertility-causing pathogenic variants are inherently unlikely to spread in a population, they can be observed within families, especially when there is consanguinity. Such cases provide crucial insights into the function of the genes and molecular mechanisms that they disrupt. Over the last decade, causative variants in several genes have been found using whole exome sequencing in ‘POI pedigrees’. In particular, pathogenic variants in genes involved in DNA replication, recombination or repair, such as <italic>STAG3, SYCE1, HFM1, MSH5</italic> and <italic>MEIOB</italic> have been formally implicated in this condition by ourselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caburet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caburet et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Vries et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Collaboration et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have identified in a consanguineous family with POI the candidate S167L missense variant in <italic>HSF2BP</italic>, an essential yet poorly studied meiotic gene. <italic>HSF2BP</italic> encodes an interactor of the heat-shock response transcription factor HSF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshima et al., 1998</xref>). During the course of this work and, in agreement with our results, two independent groups showed that HSF2BP is essential for meiotic recombination through its ability to interact with BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandsma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we report that the introduction of the missense variant HSF2BP-S167L in mouse leads to subfertility and DNA repair defects during prophase I. In addition, we identified a protein complex composed of BRCA2, HSF2BP, and the as yet unexplored C19ORF57/BRME1 (meiotic double-stranded break BRCA2/HSF2BP complex associated protein) as a key component of the meiotic recombination machinery. Our studies show that a single substitution (S167L) in HSF2BP leads to a reduced loading of both BRME1 and HSF2BP at the RNs. Furthermore, our results suggest that meiotic progression requires a critical threshold level of HSF2BP/BRME1 for the ulterior loading of the recombinases to the RNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical cases</title><p>The parents are first-degree cousins of Israeli Arab origin. Of the five daughters, three are affected with POI and presented with early secondary amenorrhea. They had menarche at normal age (at 13–14) but with irregular menses that stopped around 25. Only one of the patients affected by POI could have a child with the help of a fertility treatment (see pedigree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In order to identify the genetic basis of this familial POI case, we performed whole exome sequencing on genomic DNA from two POI patients, III-2 and III-3, and their fertile sister III-10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Variants were filtered on the basis of (i) their homozygosity in the patients, (ii) their heterozygosity or absence in the fertile sister, (iii) their absence in unrelated fertile in-house controls and (iv) a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.01 in all available databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). This filtering process led to the identification of a missense substitution located in the <italic>HSF2BP</italic> gene: rs200655253 (21:43630396 G &gt; A, GRCh38). The variant lies within the sixth exon of the reference transcript ENST00000291560.7 (NM_007031.2:c.500C &gt; T) and changes a TCG codon into a TTG (NP_008962.1:p.Ser167Leu). It is very rare (Variant Allele Frequency/VAF 0.0001845 in the GnomAD database and 0.0005 in the GME Variome dedicated to Middle-East populations) and absent in a homozygous state from all available databases. The variant was verified by Sanger sequencing and was found to segregate in a Mendelian fashion within the family: the affected twin III-1 was homozygous for the variant and both parents and fertile siblings were heterozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, there was no homozygous males identified in this family, preventing the analysis of the impact of this variant on male fertility. Serine 167 is a highly conserved position and the S167L variant is predicted to be pathogenic or deleterious by 11 out of the 18 pathogenicity predictors available in dbNSFP 3.5.

III-1 became amenorrheic at age 24 and III-2 at age 25, both after irregular menstruations since menarche.

Her g-banding karyotyping was normal 46, XX (500 bands) and variants in FMR1 gene were ruled out. III-2 displays a normal secondary sexual development with no dysmorphic sign. Clinical investigation confirmed POI, with normal 46, XX karyotype (500 bands and SKY spectral karyotyping). The elder sister III-3 was also diagnosed with POI, with no further clinical information. She is 160.5 cm. She had one normal pregnancy with the help of ‘fertility treatment’, and a second unsuccessful attempt.

HSF2BP has been shown to bind BRCA2, an essential protein for meiotic homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharan et al., 2004</xref>), by a direct interaction that involves Arg200 in HSF2BP and the Gly2270-Thr2337 region within the C-terminal fragment of BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandsma et al., 2019</xref>). Given the impossibility to detect endogenous BRCA2 by immunofluorescence in mouse spermatocytes, we carried out co-localization/interaction assays in a heterologous system by transfecting BRCA2-C (i.e. its C-term) and HSF2BP in U2OS/HEK293T. Our results showed that BRCA2-C co-immunoprecipitates with both HSF2BP-WT and HSF2BP-S167L in similar ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In single transfections, HSF2BP localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas BRCA2-C showed nuclear localization. This pattern changed drastically to a nuclear dotted pattern when co-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

The analysis of the clones with putative interactors revealed that 19 out of 98 analyzed clones matched the uncharacterized gene 4930432K21Rik, which corresponds to human C19ORF57, hereby dubbed BRME1 for Break Repair Meiotic recombinase recruitment factor 1. This HSF2BP interactor consists of 600 amino acids with a high content of acidic residues, has no recognizable functional domains and is intrinsically disordered. The interaction was validated by transiently transfecting plasmids driving the expression of HSF2BP and BRME1. Both HSF2BP-S167L and WT interacted with BRME1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We further validated this interaction in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of both proteins from mouse whole testis extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). To identify the regions required for this interaction, we split the BRME1 protein into three fragments (N-terminal, central region and C-terminal). We mapped the HSF2BP/BRME1-interacting domain to the C-term fragment of BRME1 (spanning residues 475–600 of the murine protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

Transfected HSF2BP was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>). However, when HSF2BP was co-overexpressed with BRME1, its pattern changed to an intense nucleoplasm staining with nuclear invaginations that resemble nucleoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malhas et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, such invaginations were reduced when BRME1 was co-transfected with HSF2BP-S167L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>).

Taken altogether and given the low protein expression of BRME1 in the <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup>, these results suggest a functional interdependence between BRME1 and HSF2BP that leads to their lower protein stability/expression in mutant meiocytes, which might induce recombination defects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using exome sequencing, we identified the S167L missense variant in <italic>HSF2BP</italic> in a consanguineous family with three cases of POI with secondary amenorrhea. All affected family members are homozygous for the variant, and the healthy relatives are heterozygous carriers. The causality of the HSF2BP-S167L variant is supported by the meiotic phenotype and the subfertility observed in <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> female mice. Furthermore, the DNA repair defects in murine <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> meiocytes, displayed by the reduced number of RAD51/DMC1 foci on DSBs and the subsequent reduction in the number of COs, provide evidence that this missense variant alters meiotic recombination. This conclusion was further supported by the comparative analysis of the S167L allele with the <italic>Hsf2bp</italic> null allele, which revealed that the missense variant can be considered as a hypomorphic allele. This is in agreement with the secondary amenorrhea observed in the patients, and the residual (medically-assisted) fertility in one of the affected sisters. Our identification of <italic>HSF2BP</italic> as a gene implicated in POI is in line with recent reports of POI-causing variants in genes that are required for DNA repair and recombination, such as <italic>MCM8, MCM9, SYCE1, MSH4, PSMC3IP, FANCM</italic> or <italic>NBN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AlAsiri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlosama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Vries et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fouquet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tenenbaum-Rakover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tucker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wood-Trageser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zangen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic mouse mutants often exhibit sexually dimorphic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahoon and Libuda, 2019</xref>). These differences can have a structural basis, given that the organization of the axial elements is known to be different between sexes. This is supported by the difference in length of the axes and by the essential role that the meiotic cohesin subunit RAD21L plays in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrán et al., 2011</xref>). In general, meiotic recombination mutants appear to proceed further in female than in male, because in males the asynapsis of the sex bivalent leads to a loss of silencing of the Y chromosome, and perhaps also because of the presence of less stringent checkpoints in oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunt and Hassold, 2002</xref>). A sexually dimorphic phenotype is also observed here in our HSF2BP-S167L mutant mice. Both sexes show a significant decrease in the number of COs and consequently an increase in the frequency of meiocytes showing bivalents without CO. This leads to a significant reduction of spermatozoa in the epididymis, while the number of oocytes and their distribution in the follicular pool are not affected in females. Our failure to detect any significant impact of the variant on male fertility could be due to the high variability in litter frequency and size in our study. However, it is known that a strong reduction of the spermatozoa count (up to 60%) does not affect male mouse fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schürmann et al., 2002</xref>), which would explain the normal fertility of male mice bearing the HSF2BP-S167L variant despite the presence of overt meiotic alterations. By contrast, female mice with the HSF2BP-S167L variant show a mild sub-fertility phenotype with a reduction of litter frequency. This can be due to the very much fewer gametes available for fertilization in females in comparison to males but also to molecular differences in the meiotic recombination process in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahoon and Libuda, 2019</xref>), as displayed by the absence of RPA accumulation or the more pronounced decrease in DMC1 foci observed in HSF2BP-S167L oocytes.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude that a POI-like phenotype would appear over time in HSF2BP-S167L female mice, the sub-fertility observed in HSF2BP-S167L females appears to be milder in comparison to the phenotype of the human patients. This could be explained by a lower sensitivity of mice to hypomorphic alleles compared to humans, in a similar manner to the known lower gene dosage sensitivity of the former in the context of genes that are haploinsufficient in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Veitia, 2003</xref>). In addition, the initial events of human female meiosis appear to be more error-prone than in mice, or even than human males, as evidenced by the increased incidence of synaptic defects in the human oocytes or the fact that MLH1 foci appear much earlier in prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassold et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that human oocytes exhibit a specific CO maturation inefficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, despite a higher total number of COs in women, the frequency of bivalents without CO is paradoxically higher in women than in men. Altogether, these observations could explain the stronger phenotype of the human POI patients compared to the <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> female mice.</p><p>The absence of homozygous male carriers in the consanguineous family studied here prevents the direct comparison of the impact of the HSF2BP-S167L variant on fertility phenotypes between human and mouse males. Although future studies might identify infertile men homozygous for the S167L variant, it is interesting to note that another variant of HSF2BP (G224*) was shown to affect recombination rate in males and that two siblings homozygous for this HSF2BP variant in the analyzed Icelandic population were healthy but without descendants, suggesting they were infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halldorsson et al., 2019</xref>). This reinforces a conserved function of HSF2BP in human male fertility.</p><p>We have shown through a biochemical analysis that BRME1 immunoprecipitates mainly with its partner HSF2BP (constituting or belonging to a complex) but also with PALB2, RAD51, RPA and BRCA2 (in testis extracts). These interactions could possibly be mediated by the multidomain hub protein BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siaud et al., 2011</xref>) as HSF2BP interacts directly with BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandsma et al., 2019</xref>) and with BRME1 (this work). In addition, BRCA2 also directly interacts with the DSBs recruiter PALB2, with the recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 (through different specific domains), and with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siaud et al., 2011</xref>). This BRCA2-containing complex participates in the orderly orchestration of events at DSBs such as the initial binding of RPA to the resected DNA, the exchange of RPA by RAD51/DMC1, and the loading of the MEIOB-SPATA22 complex to the RPA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, genes with recently identified variants in POI patients are implicated in the repair of induced DSBs at the early stages of meiosis and encode BRCA2-interacting factors, such as <italic>MEIOB, DMC1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caburet et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caburet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caburet et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2018</xref>). This highlights the crucial importance and the high sensitivity of this particular meiotic step, and the hub role of BRCA2 as a tightly regulated platform for correct meiotic recombination.</p><p>We have also shown by several complementary approaches that the proteins HSF2BP/BRME1 constitute in vivo a functional complex in which both subunits are essential for meiotic recombination and for their mutual protein expression and/or stability in vivo. Accordingly, the genetic depletion of BRME1 or HSF2BP leads to similar if not identical phenotypes in which oogenesis is altered with severe defects in chromosome synapsis that promotes premature loss of ovarian follicles and spermatogenesis is arrested at zygotene-like stage resulting in a lack of spermatozoa. These meiocytes are not able to load the recombinases RAD51/DMC1, impairing the proper repair of DSBs leading to the generation of no COs or very few in males and females, respectively. As a consequence, zygonema-like spermatocytes accumulate the single strand binding proteins SPATA22 and RPA, whereas oocytes accumulates only SPATA22. During the course of the reviewing of this work, three <italic>Brme1</italic> knockouts have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takemoto et al., 2020</xref>). All the described male mutants show strong fertility defects and similar molecular alterations although with different severity. In females, the two works that address their analysis (Shang et al. and Takemoto et al.), describe normal fertility which is in contrast with the strong reduction in the follicle pool and meiotic defects observed in our <italic>Brme1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females. The higher severity of our male and female mutants could be explained on the basis of the different genetic background of the mice given that all of them are apparently similar.</p><p>The S167L human recessive POI variant behave as a hypomorphic allele in mice, which results in a reduction of the protein expression/stability of itself and of its partner BRME1 in vivo and in transfected cells. As a consequence, both male and female <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167</sup> mice show a similar but milder phenotype than that of the <italic>Hsf2bp<sup>-/-</sup></italic>or <italic>Brme1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, consisting in a reduction in the spermatozoa count while being fertile and a subtle reduction in female fertility. Molecularly, the reduction observed in the meiocytes of the mutant <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> mice of RAD51/DMC1, the reduction of COs (both in males and females), the accumulation of RPA (only in males) and SPATA22 (in males and females) are also weaker than in the null mutant. The observed accumulation of RPA in males is likely to occur at the early stages of recombination because SPATA22 loading to the DSBs is also increased in the mutants of HSF2BP and BRME1. RPA, as part of a trimeric replication protein complex (RPA1-RPA2-RPA3), binds and stabilizes ssDNA intermediates that form during DNA repair. In meiosis, RPA is also forming a complex with two other essential meiotic players MEIOB (homologue of RPA) and SPATA22. However, the loading of this complex to DSBs is RPA-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). It has been postulated that RPA functions in meiosis at two different stages; (i) during the early recombination stages when the DSBs ends are resected by the MRN complex and (ii) during the strand invasion into the homologous duplex that is carried out by RAD51/DMC1 and ssDNA is generated at the displacement loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). The observed lack of DNA-binding ability of HSF2BP/BRME1 points towards a model in which the absence of the complex HSF2BP/BRME1 through a direct interaction with BRCA2 impairs the replacement of RPA by RAD51/DMC1 in the foci that form on the DSBs of the spermatocytes. Similarly, the reduced expression at the protein level of HSF2BP/BRME1 as a consequence of the POI variant, which does not affect their heterodimerization, would make them less proficient in replacing RPA in the spermatocytes by the recombinases RAD51/DMC1 leading to a lower frequency of COs. Given the unknown function that RPA plays in vivo during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the role of RPA in mediating the replacement of RAD51/DMC1 in female meiosis would be carried out by another protein complex such as SPATA22/MEIOB in a HSF2BP/BRME1-dependent manner.</p><p>Very recently, a high-resolution genome-wide recombination map revealed novel loci involved in the control of meiotic recombination and highlighted genes involved in the formation of the SC (SYCE2, RAD21L, SYCP3, SIX6OS1) and the meiotic machinery itself as determinants of COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halldorsson et al., 2019</xref>). Within the second category, variants of the SUMO ligase RNF212 and the ubiquitin ligase HEI10 have been largely documented as genetic determinants of the recombination rate in humans and, importantly, so were variants of HSF2BP. Consequently, gene dosage of RNF212 and HEI10 affects CO frequency through their activity in CO designation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lake and Hawley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). We found that both BRME1 and HSF2BP localization are unaffected in the loss-of-function mouse mutants of <italic>Rnf212</italic> and <italic>Hei10 (Ccnb1ip1)</italic>. This observation together with the proper co-localization of BRME1/HSF2BP with RPA allows us to map these proteins upstream in the recombination pathway.</p><p>It is worth noting that some of the genes affecting the recombination rate have also been described as ‘fertility genes’, such as <italic>SYCP3, HFM1</italic> and <italic>HSF2BP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Benavente, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Collaboration et al., 2014</xref> and this work). Altogether, we propose that different variants of the same meiotic gene (alleles responsible for mild or strong phenotypes) can give rise to either an altered genome-wide recombination rate with no detrimental effect, or cause infertility when the decreased recombination rate falls below the lower limit of one COs per bivalent. In the present POI family, the S167L variant in HSF2BP seems to be below that limit. To our knowledge, HSF2BP is one of the very few human genes with variants known to affect both the genome-wide recombination rate in the human population and meiotic chromosome missegregation (fertility) through a reduction of the recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halldorsson et al., 2019</xref>). Along similar lines, it is conceivable that variants with additive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schimenti and Handel, 2018</xref>) can lead to a genome-wide reduction of the recombination rate and thus to aneuploidy and infertility. Specifically, variants in genes involved in meiotic recombination and SC constituents could be responsible for a large fraction of genetic infertilities. These variants should be under purifying selection and would be removed or substantially reduced from the population. However, this is not the case for genes with sexual phenotypic dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gershoni and Pietrokovski, 2014</xref>) as is apparent for a wide number of meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cahoon and Libuda, 2019</xref>), including HSF2BP and BRME1, where individuals of one of the sexes are fertile carriers.</p><p>In summary, we describe for the first time a human family where POI co-segregates with a genetic variant in HSF2BP (S167L) in a Mendelian fashion. Humanized mice reveal that the HSF2BP variant is a hypomorphic allele that promotes the lower protein expression and/or stability of the HSF2BP/BRME1 complex and phenocopy in a milder manner the meiotic defects observed in mice lacking either HSF2BP or its direct interactor BRME1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole exome sequencing</title><p>Written informed consent was received from participants prior to inclusion in the study and the institutions involved.

for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maria Jasin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) case study, proband and affected family members with a unique genetic variant in HSF2BP. To examine the functional consequences of this variant, they generated a mouse mutant with the equivalent allele (S167L). Despite ostensibly normal numbers of follicles, Hsf2bp- S167L female mice showed reduced fertility in females. The authors also identify an interaction partner of HSF2BP named MIDAP and provide evidence that these two proteins function interdependently to facilitate BRCA2-mediated assembly of RAD51/DMC1 strand-exchange complexes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, while there are a lot of data in this paper, the quality of some experiments is questionable and lack rigorous quantification. The text is often inaccurate, sometimes not correct and requires major clarification and improvement.</p><p>Below are mentioned essential points and important point to revise, that include new data, formatting figures, text modification and reorganization.</p><p>1) One essential issue is to validate the conclusion that the case of human POI is caused by a variant of HSF2BP. Thus, the mouse mutant Hsf2bp167L requires additional analysis.</p><p>2) Another major problem is order and clarity of data presentation.</p><p>a) When presenting the phenotype of the Hsf2bp point mutant, the authors should clarify first the already published phenotype of the null mutant. They can add the data of their own null mutant as comparison.</p><p>b) Order of data:</p><p>Males and female data are not presented in a consistent way for the analysis of Hsf2bp mutant (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5): Best would be to present male and female in parallel: Figure 3 (RPA), Figure 4 (DMC1, RAD51), Figure 5 (Mlh1). RAD51 data for female is required.</p><p>MIDAP localization in Hsf2bp mutants should be presented along with its colocalization with HSF2BP in wt.</p><p>Analysis of SPATA22 should be moved to main figures.</p><p>3) Removing poorly informative data</p><p>The in vitro assay fails to detect DNA binding activity of MIDAP or HSF2BP. This negative result obtained with non-purified proteins of undetermined concentration and molar ratio with the substrate do not allow to conclude on the DNA binding property of those proteins.</p><p>Only part of the co-transfection analysis (Figure 10) should be maintained (see details below).</p><p>4) The localization of HSF2BP/MIDAP at DSB repair foci is not shown in this study. This should be clarified either by referring to the previous study or by doing colocalization analysis (with RPA or DMC1 or RAD51).</p><p>5) Clarifying interpretations.</p><p>Many issues in the text are reported below.</p><p>Importantly the protein levels of HSF2BP and MIDAP is the mutants (Midap and Hsfp2bp) should be tested (in extracts from juvenile to avid confounding effect of cellular composition). Any coIP and western blot analysis from mouse testis to validate the interactions? and also the one with BRCA2? This would be expected given the Mass/spec data.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Fertility and rigorous follicle (at different stages) counting for Hsf2bp-S167L mice at different ages. One prediction is that oocyte reserve should decreased at least at advanced ages.</p><p>Mutants with decreased ovarian reserves generally activate normal numbers of follicles and thus can look normal, but pools will deplete faster. Oocyte counts using immunohistochemistry of ovaries from mice of different ages with an appropriate marker (e.g. MVH) is required.</p><p>1(D) – please provide quantification of testis weights corrected for animal body weight (mean {plus minus} standard deviation).</p><p>1(F) – Epididymis histology for Hsf2bp-S167L requires quantification. An easier approach would be to present sperm counts using standard methods. Scale bars in Figure 1B and 1C should be the same size to facilitate comparison. Also, it is difficult to see follicles, especially in (B). Immunostaining should be performed to identify follicles.</p><p>1(H). Spreads are not appropriate to quantify apoptotic cells. How was apoptosis monitored? The legend is incorrect: &quot;(H).…spread preparations from Hsf2bp-/- and Hsf2bpS167L/S167L mice.&quot; It should be +/+ and S167L/S167L.</p><p>Figure 1 legend is much too long.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>2 (A) – HSF2BP staining intensity -- were graphs showing HSF2BP staining intensity normalized against Sycp3 intensity? Were exposure times constant between images and samples? Please provide more details regarding image acquisition. This comment applies to other figures as well.</p><p>There is no information about image analysis in the Materials and methods section? How were foci counted? Was background subtracted? Which software? Which parameters?</p><p>2 (A,B). Which test was used, meaning of stars?</p><p>2 (C). A non-specific band of unknown origin cannot be used as loading control. Please add a proper loading control. The extracts should be from juvenile to interpret the result since wt and mutant do not have the same testicular cell composition.</p><p>What is the mouse background for the -/- and S167L/S167L mice? Are they the same? Differences in strain background (especially mixed versus inbred) can affect the penetrance of meiotic mutants.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>H2AX plots Y axis: add γ</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>(A) – right hand side graph is missing a y-axis label. Labels should be more explicit, e.g. &quot;number of DMC1 foci&quot;.</p><p>(B) In the right graph there is extraneous text (&quot;S167L&quot;) under the data points.</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>(a) The evidence for XY univalent is weak. One may indeed consider the long univalent axis as X, but the smaller one could be any chromosome. This is only a deduction (On Figure 1G, impossible to tell). This observation needs further analysis: is the recombination defect (CO defect and univalent) mostly impacting the X and Y? Please, analyze the distributions of MLH1 foci, specifically the fraction of pachytene SCs that lack MLH1 foci.</p><p>(B,C) – Please comment on the observation that RPA counts are similar between control and mutant, while DMC1 counts are significantly lower. RAD51 counts should be analyzed in S167L females.</p><p>SPATA22 which appears to give a strong phenotype in MIDAP mutant should be tested in male and female Hsf2bp mutants.</p><p>Identification and analysis of MIDAP</p><p>The acronym MIDAP is not the best choice: It's unclear how MIDAP is an acronym for &quot;meiotic double- stranded break BRCA2/HSF2BP complex associated protein&quot;. Where is the &quot;I&quot; from, and how is BRCA2/HSF2BP part of the acronym? What is the expression profile of MIDAP? And if the gene is not meiotic-specific it should not be labeled as such. Moreover, it's not clear that its major function is through BRCA2. Please indicate that C19ORF57 is the name of the human not the mouse gene (thus in the yeast two hybrid screen the gene identified was not C19ORF57; was the cDNA overlapping with the domain identified as interacting by CoIP?).</p><p>One learns very little from the study of the MIDAP internal deletion. Thus, this could be removed or added as supplementary information. In addition, this mutant allele does not show that the interaction domain is sufficient as the mutant protein is much larger than the interaction domain.</p><p>Midap∆/∆: we would suggest adding a number such as ∆6. Otherwise, it can be easily thought that this allele is a full deletion.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>(A): Add MW markers (and check this for all western blots)</p><p>(C) – IP with Δ475-600 – please provide evidence that IP worked – western blot for protein used for setting up IP reaction must be also provided in all cases. Which fraction of input, of IP was loaded? (these comments apply to all CoIPs).</p><p>(D) – The authors cannot conclude on a perfect colocalization without quantification. Please quantify. Squares indicating areas being magnified are not being reproduced properly. Also, these areas are not magnified very much- please make them larger! The insets are shifted, this should be mentioned.</p><p>Figure 7. Depletion of follicle pool in Midap-/- females should be quantified.</p><p>Males: provide evidence for the stage IV arrest; in the text explain what is stage IV for non specialist. Asterisks are barely visible, change color.</p><p>(E): 5 nuclei are shown. The four upper nuclei show various levels of synapsis defects. It is not clear what information is provided with the nucleus in the lower part which does not seem to be a pachytene but more likely a diplotene nucleus. Unless a specific conclusion is reached from this nucleus, it could be removed.</p><p>Figure 8:</p><p>(A) – Absence of HSF2BP staining in the Midap-/- mutant could be due to protein destabilization. See comment above; legend, Quantification is HSF2BP foci not MIDAP.</p><p>Figure 9. The absence of MIDAP foci should also be quantified in the Hsf2bp null mutant even if the number of foci is close to 0.</p><p>Figure 10:</p><p>(A) – and in general and for all western blots, the labeling of IPs is confusing and</p><p>ambiguous. It is unclear what the arrows are supposed to highlight. Best is to indicate which antibody was used to probe the blots, and to add arrows to identify proteins when required.</p><p>The comparison of Hsf2bp wt and S167L does not make sense in such overexpression system since the property of S167L reported above was a potential lower stability and/or level. Transfection with Hsf2bpS167L should be removed.</p><p>Overall, the information gained is the CoIP between the three proteins, the nuclear localization and stabilization of Hsf2Bp in the presence of MIDAP. Note that there is no evidence for a multimeric complex from this study. This would require performing sequential IP.</p><p>The one and half page paragraph should be reduced to half a page, which would improve the quality of the paper.</p><p>The legend should be reduced.</p><p>Figure 1: Please include the genotypes for the sequenced individuals. From the text, it appears as if the brother is heterozygous, so there does not appear to be a male homozygote to comment on human male fertility. This should be clearly stated early in the manuscript (see comment below).</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1(A) legend: &quot;Thin (non-coding) and thick (coding sequences) lines under exons represent the expected transcript derived from wild-type and Hsf2bp edited allele.&quot; There are no such lines in panel (A).</p><p>Figure 7—figure supplement 6 – What stage are these WT spermatocytes and approximate stage-matched mutants? Late zygonema?</p><p>Figure 8—figure supplement 1C. Please show the whole membrane. Any truncated protein detected? Where are the epitopes of the antibody?</p><p>Interpretation and discussion of the Hsf2bpS167L mutant</p><p>Subsection “Mice with the HSF2BP S167L variant show a partial reduction of fertility” &quot;male and female mice were able to reproduce but females showed a significant reduction in the number and size of litters (Figure 1A) whilst males only showed a slight non-significant reduction in fertility (Figure 1A).This is in agreement with the fertility defects observed in Hsf2bp-/- mice (Figure 1C,E-F and (Brandsma et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,2019)), and suggests that the S167L variant might impact more specifically female fertility.&quot;</p><p>There are several problems with this statement:</p><p>a) This is not in agreement with the two published papers, but rather the opposite, since the published papers describe a more pronounced defect in males. Thus, this text needs to be changed.</p><p>b) However, importantly also, the authors appear to have a more pronounced phenotype in their female knockouts compared to the published reports. This needs to be discussed, included how the knockout alleles vary for the 3 knockouts that have now been generated.</p><p>c) Males with S167L have more variability in litter frequency and size, and so with the small numbers it is difficult to draw a conclusion about fertility. Moreover, testis weights and histology of tubules, which show a clear male defect.</p><p>Related to this in Subsection “Mice with the HSF2BP S167L variant show a partial reduction of fertility”: &quot;These results suggest that mice bearing the POI-causing variant only partially phenocopy the human disease and fits well with the exacerbated sexual phenotypic dimorphism observed in the Hsf2bp-/- mice which might be less pronounced or absent in humans.&quot;</p><p>As above, no conclusion can be made about human male fertility. The lack of follicle counts/breeding over time in females makes it difficult to conclude about POI in mice. Moreover, what sexual dimorphism in -/- mice is this referring to? Both males and females are completely devoid of gametes in the HSF2BP-null.</p><p>Subsection “Mice with the HSF2BP S167L variant show a partial reduction of fertility”: &quot;Overall, male and female Hsf2bpS167L/S167L mice show similar molecular alterations although with different severity&quot;.</p><p>There are obvious differences in molecular alterations between males and females:</p><p>- There is a dramatic increase in RPA foci in males during pachynema while no difference in RPA foci in females during pachynema.</p><p>- DMC1 is virtually unchanged in males (perhaps slight reduction in EZ), but greatly reduced in females.</p><p>- MLH1 is reduced 20-30% in males, but only ~5% (and not significant) in females.</p><p>- γ-H2AX is greatly increased during pachynema in males, but these data do not exist for females.</p><p>- RAD51 is decreased through zygonema to early pachynema with the biggest decrease seen in late zygonema, but these data don't exist for females.</p><p>- The only similarity is with DMC1, but even this is misleading as the defect in males is quite mild, but quite severe in females.</p><p>Supplementary file 1G, Supplementary file 1H</p><p>What are the two antibodies (Ab1 and Ab2) used for mass spec? What is the control sample (IP with IgG?). The Materials and methods section indicates the IP was performed with two antibodies R1 and R2 (against HSF2BP and MIDAP)? This is very confusing.</p><p>Please can you specify how many peptides of MIDAP identified in this screen.</p><p>With the large number of figures and different mutants examined, a summary table should be provided.</p><p>Comments on the Discussion section</p><p>The discussion is unfocused with no clear link back to the POI of the human family. Also, the data are generally over-interpreted into specific molecular mechanisms. This should be toned down and the authors should clarify when they are speculating.</p><p>Where is the evidence for a supramolecular complex? In the absence of validation this should also be removed from the abstract (&quot;the higher order macromolecular structure&quot;).</p><p>Where is the evidence for direct interaction between HSF2BP and BRCA2 and MIDAP ?</p><p>Where is the evidence that the supramolecular (?) complex participate to the binding of RPA?</p><p>The known roles of DSS1 should be introduced noting that meiotic functions are not characterized.</p><p>&quot;strongly suggesting a parallelism in the early recombination pathway where HSF2BP/MIDAP work&quot; – this is unclear. Please rephrase.</p><p>&quot;In general, meiotic recombination mutants seem to proceed further in female than in male meiosis perhaps because of the presence of less stringent checkpoints (Hunt and Hassold, 2002).&quot;</p><p>But also, recombination mutants often show more severity in males due to X-Y asynapsis.</p><p>&quot;importantly also of HSF2BP&quot; – please rephrase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56996.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, while there are a lot of data in this paper, the quality of some experiments is questionable and lack rigorous quantification.

We have also incorporated the data of our null mutant for a straight comparison. The added paragraph is:</p><p>“During the course of this work, two independent groups showed that HSF2BP is essential for meiotic recombination through its ability to interact with the armadillo repeats of BRCA2 (Zhang et al., 2019; Brandsma et al., 2019). Both groups showed that genetic disruption of <italic>Hsf2bp</italic> in mouse leads to the accumulation in the chromosomes axes of DNA repair proteins such as γH2AX (ATR-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX marks DSBs) and the single stranded-DNA binding protein RPA, a strong reduction of the recombinases DMC1 and RAD51 at the RNs and a lack of COs as labelled by MLH1 (Baker et al., 1996). The end result is male sterility (Brandsma et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, loss of HSF2BP in female mice showed a milder meiotic phenotype (Zhang et al., 2019 and our own data, see below) and a weak albeit non statistical significant reduction of fertility (Brandsma et al., 2019) despite all of the mutants are nulls though in different genetic backgrounds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Order of data:</p><p>Males and female data are not presented in a consistent way for the analysis of Hsf2bp mutant (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5): Best would be to present male and female in parallel: Figure 3 (RPA), Figure 4 (DMC1, RAD51), Figure 5 (Mlh1).

However, our experiments have been performed with purified protein extracts obtained from in vitro transcription and translation (TNT) and the protein concentration on each condition was estimated by loading the same amount of protein (estimated from the western blot signal) to avoid substantial differences on the molar ratio with the substrate. We have included the well-known DNA-binding activity of RPA as a positive control. This assay based on TNT produced proteins has been validated previously in several publications (Souquet et al., 2013 ; Loregian et al., 2004). We thus consider that these results point towards HSF2BP and MIDAP lack DNA binding activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only part of the co-transfection analysis (Fig10) should be maintained (see details below)</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the modification (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The localization of HSF2BP/MIDAP at DSB repair foci is not shown in this study.

We have carried out a new co-localization experiment by IF analysis of HSF2BP and MIDAP with RPA and DMC1 as well as the corresponding quantification.

Any coIP and western blot analysis from mouse testis to validate the interactions? and also the one with BRCA2? This would be expected given the Mass/spec data.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this criticism, we have analysed the protein levels of HSF2BP and MIDAP in juvenile mutants as suggested by the editor/referees and replaced the former WBs by the new ones (Figure 3C, Figure 7H and Figure 8H). The new results have been included in the MS: “Western blot analysis of WT, <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> and <italic>Hsf2bp<sup>-/-</sup></italic> in whole testis extracts from 13 days post-partum (dpp) animals (Figure 3C) revealed that the reduced labelling observed by immunofluorescence correlated with a reduced protein expression level, suggesting that the mutation leads to a reduced expression and/or stability.”</p><p>We have analysed the protein levels of MIDAP in the <italic>Hsf2bp</italic> mutants (S167L variant and knock-out) revealing a drastic reduction of MIDAP expression in <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> and <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>-/-</sup>spermatocytes. The new results have been included in the MS: “Western blot analysis also revealed a drastic reduction of MIDAP expression in <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>S167L/S167L</sup> and <italic>Hsf2bp</italic><sup>-/-</sup>spermatocytes, suggesting an HSF2BP-dependent stabilization of MIDAP (Figure 7H).”</p><p>We also have analysed the protein level of HSF2BP in MIDAP mutants by Western blot analysis of 13 dpp testis extracts. The new results have been included in the manuscript: “Western blot analysis of HSF2BP in 13 dpp testis extracts from <italic>Midap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed a strong reduction in comparison with the WT control (Figure 8H), suggesting again that MIDAP is necessary for HSF2BP protein stabilization.”</p><p>Additionally, we have carried out Co-IP experiments from mouse testis between HSF2BP and MIDAP to demonstrate the interaction in vivo. The results show positive co-IP and have been included in the MS: “We further validated this interaction in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of both proteins from mouse whole testis extracts (Figure 7B).”</p><p>In the case of BRCA2, we would like to point out that we have not been able to detect endogenous BRCA2 with any antibody neither by immunofluorescence (this is a universal problem) nor by WB. Thus, in our hands, such an experiment is not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1</p><p>Fertility and rigorous follicle (at different stages) counting for Hsf2bp-S167L mice at different ages.

We have immunized two independent rabbits with HSF2BP (HSF2BP-R1 and HSF2BP-R2) and two additional rabbits with MIDAP (MIDAP-R1 and MIDAP-R2). For the mass spec analysis, we performed two IP (one with MIDAP-R1 and another with MIDAP-R2). The control sample was IgGs from rabbit. We have explained this point as follows:</p><p>Subsection “Immunocytology and antibodies”:</p><p>“Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HSF2BP and MIDAP were developed by ProteintechTM against a fusion protein of poly-His with full length HSF2BP or MIDAP (pUC57 vector) of mouse origin.

We have also paid particular attention to make it clear in the text when we are speculating. In brief, at first, we link our results of the mutant mice of HSF2BP (null and knock-in) to the human POI and discuss why the human HSF2BP-S167L variant is more severe in humans than in mouse attending to the fertility severity. We then discuss how the fertility defects in the mutant mice can be explained by the role of HSF2BP, together with its new identified partner MIDAP, in meiotic DSB repair and their relationship with other meiotic players involved in the recombination pathway. Finally, we speculate how HSF2BP gene variants, one of them recently known to modify human meiotic recombination rate genome wide (Halldorson et al., 2019), could also cause infertility by decreasing the recombination rate much below the lower limit of one CO per bivalent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where is the evidence for a supramolecular complex?

Our evidence of direct interaction between HSF2BP and MIDAP comes from our experiments (Y2H, co-IP Figure 7A and testis IP Figure 7B). We have not detected direct interaction between MIDAP and BRCA2 (Figure 10A). However, we have observed that BRCA2 and MIDAP co-immunoprecipitates (Figure 10B) when HSF2BP is present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where is the evidence that the supramolecular (?) complex participate to the binding of RPA?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already replied to this point at the beginning of this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The known roles of DSS1 should be introduced noting that meiotic functions are not characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We eliminated any mention relative to DSS1 given that nothing is known about its meiotic function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;strongly suggesting a parallelism in the early recombination pathway where HSF2BP/MIDAP work&quot; – this is unclear.

We have included this concept in the text: “In general, meiotic recombination mutants appear to proceed further in female than in male, because in males the asynapsis of the sex bivalent leads to a loss of silencing of the Y chromosome, and perhaps also because of the presence of less stringent checkpoints in oogenesis (Hunt and Hassold, 2002).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;importantly also of HSF2BP&quot; – please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
