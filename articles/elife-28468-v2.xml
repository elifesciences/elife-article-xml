pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28468.001</object-id><p>The diversity of life on Earth is a result of continual innovations in molecular networks influencing morphology and physiology. Plant specialized metabolism produces hundreds of thousands of compounds, offering striking examples of these innovations. To understand how this novelty is generated, we investigated the evolution of the Solanaceae family-specific, trichome-localized acylsugar biosynthetic pathway using a combination of mass spectrometry, RNA-seq, enzyme assays, RNAi and phylogenomics in different non-model species. Our results reveal hundreds of acylsugars produced across the Solanaceae family and even within a single plant, built on simple sugar cores. The relatively short biosynthetic pathway experienced repeated cycles of innovation over the last 100 million years that include gene duplication and divergence, gene loss, evolution of substrate preference and promiscuity. This study provides mechanistic insights into the emergence of plant chemical novelty, and offers a template for investigating the ~300,000 non-model plant species that remain underexplored.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28468.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are about 300,000 species of plant on Earth, which together produce over a million different small molecules called metabolites. Plants use many of these molecules to grow, to communicate with each other or to defend themselves against pests and disease. Humans have co-opted many of the same molecules as well; for example, some are important nutrients while others are active ingredients in medicines.</p><p>Many plant metabolites are found in almost all plants, but hundreds of thousands of them are more specialized and only found in small groups of related plant species. These specialized metabolites have a wide variety of structures, and are made by different enzymes working together to carry out a series of biochemical reactions.</p><p>Acylsugars are an example of a group of specialized metabolites with particularly diverse structures. These small molecules are restricted to plants in the Solanaceae family, which includes tomato and tobacco plants. Moghe et al. have now focused on acylsugars to better understand how plants produce the large diversity of chemical structures found in specialized metabolites, and how these processes have evolved over time.</p><p>An analysis of over 35 plant species from across the Solanaceae family revealed hundreds of acylsugars, with some plants accumulating 300 or more different types of these specialized metabolites. Moghe et al. then looked at the enzymes that make acylsugars from a poorly studied flowering plant called <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic>, partly because it produces a large diversity of these small molecules and partly because it sits in a unique position in the Solanaceae family tree. The activities of the enzymes were confirmed both in test tubes and in plants. This suggested that many of the enzymes were “promiscuous”, meaning that they could likely use a variety of molecules as starting points for their chemical reactions. This finding could help to explain how this plant species can make such a wide variety of acylsugars. Moghe et al. also discovered that many of the enzymes that make acylsugars are encoded by genes that were originally copies of other genes and that have subsequently evolved new activities.</p><p>Plant scientists and plant breeders value tomato plants that produce acylsugars because these natural chemicals protect against pests like whiteflies and spider mites. A clearer understanding of the diversity of acylsugars in the Solanaceae family, as well as the enzymes that make these specialized metabolites, could help efforts to breed crops that are more resistant to pests. Some of the enzymes related to those involved in acylsugar production could also help to make chemicals with pharmaceutical value. These new findings might also eventually lead to innovative ways to produce these chemicals on a large scale.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic></kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>specialized metabolism</kwd><kwd>trichome</kwd><kwd>enzyme evolution</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic reconstruction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM110523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leong</surname><given-names>Bryan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1025636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daniel Jones</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MICL-02143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daniel Jones</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-PGRP-1546617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daniel Jones</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrative analysis of a specialized metabolic pathway across multiple non-model species illustrates mechanisms of emergence of chemical novelty in plant metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the first proto-life forms arose on our planet some four billion years ago, the forces of mutation, selection and drift have generated a world of rich biological complexity. This complexity, evident at all levels of biological organization, has intrigued humans for millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tipton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayr, 1985</xref>). Plant metabolism, estimated to produce hundreds of thousands of products with diverse structures across the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiehn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afendi et al., 2012</xref>), provides striking examples of this complexity. Plant metabolism is traditionally divided into primary and secondary/specialized, the former referring to production of compounds essential for plant development and the latter encompassing metabolites documented as important for plant survival in nature and metabolites of as yet unknown functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pichersky and Lewinsohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>). While primary metabolism generally consists of highly conserved pathways and enzymes, specialized metabolic pathways are in a state of continuous innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milo and Last, 2012</xref>). This dynamism has produced numerous lineage-specific metabolite classes such as steroidal glycoalkaloids in Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wink, 2003</xref>), benzoxazinoid alkaloids in Poaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutartre et al., 2012</xref>), betalains in Caryophyllales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockington et al., 2015</xref>) and glucosinolates in Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>). The structural diversity produced by lineage-specific pathways makes them exemplary systems for understanding the evolution of novelty in the living world.</p><p>Previous studies investigating the emergence of lineage-specific metabolite classes uncovered the central role of gene duplication and diversification in this process: for example in biosynthesis of glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edger et al., 2015</xref>), acylsugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>), the saponin avenacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qi et al., 2004</xref>) and various alkaloid types such as benzoxazinoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutartre et al., 2012</xref>), acridone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohlmann et al., 1996</xref>) and pyrrolizidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ober and Hartmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaltenegger et al., 2013</xref>). Duplications of members of enzyme families (e.g. cytochromes P450, glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases, BAHD acyltransferases) also play major roles in generating chemical novelty, with biosynthesis of &gt;40,000 structurally diverse terpenoids — produced partly due to genomic clustering of terpene synthases and cytochrome P450 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutanaev et al., 2015</xref>) — as an extreme example. These duplicate genes, if retained, may experience sub- or neo-functionalization via transcriptional divergence and evolution of protein-protein interactions as well as via changes in substrate preference, reaction mechanism and allosteric regulation to produce chemical novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leong and Last, 2017</xref>). In this study, we sought to understand the molecular processes by which a novel class of plant-defense related metabolites — acylsugars — emerged and diversified in the Solanaceae family.</p><p>Acylsugars are lineage-specific plant specialized metabolites detected in multiple genera of the Solanaceae family including <italic>Solanum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kroumova and Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Datura</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forkner and Hare, 2000</xref>) and <italic>Nicotiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kroumova and Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kroumova et al., 2016</xref>). These compounds, produced in the tip cell of trichomes on leaf and stem surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>), typically consist of a sucrose or glucose core esterified to groups derived from fatty acid or branched chain amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Despite these simple building blocks, the combinations of the sugar cores and the different acyl chains can generate diverse structures. For example, ~81 acylsugars were detected across just two accessions of the wild tomato <italic>Solanum habrochaites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple studies performed under controlled lab settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Puterka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simmons et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luu et al., 2017</xref>) or in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weinhold and Baldwin, 2011</xref>) demonstrated that acylsugars mediate plant-insect and plant-fungus interactions, and hence acylsugar production has been a target for tomato breeding efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodríguez-López et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smeda et al., 2016</xref>). Under lab conditions, the diversity of acyl chains and the sugar cores has been shown to be functionally important in deterring insects such as spider mites, thrips and whiteflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Puterka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>). In ecological settings, ants living near <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> plants that produced hexanoic acid-containing acylsugars were significantly more attracted to the smell of hexanoic acid, compared to ants growing near <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> whose acylsugars lacked hexanoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weinhold and Baldwin, 2011</xref>). This suggests that acyl chain diversity may be of functional consequence in the wild. However, the contribution of the large number of acylsugar structural variants in plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions is still an open question.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28468.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acylsugars in solanaceae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example acylsugar from tomato. The nomenclature of acylsugars and the ASAT enzymes responsible for acylation of specific positions are described.

Previous research from our lab showed that cultivated tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) and its wild relatives produce these compounds in the tip cell of the long glandular secreting trichomes using a set of enzymes called acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs). These enzymes catalyze sequential addition of specific acyl chains to the sucrose molecule using acyl CoA donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). ASATs are members of Clade III of the large and functionally diverse BAHD enzyme family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">St Pierre and Luca, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Auria, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite their evolutionary relatedness, <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> ASATs (SlASATs) are only ~40% identical to each other at the amino acid level. ASATs exhibit different activities across wild tomatoes due to ortholog divergence, gene duplication and neo-functionalization, leading to divergence in acceptor and donor substrate repertoire of ASATs between wild tomato species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). For example, a recent study showed that the acyl CoA preference of the ASAT2 enzyme orthologs in closely related <italic>Solanum</italic> species is influenced by a single amino acid change, resulting in accumulation of different acylsugar products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). Similarly, duplication of the ASAT3 enzyme followed by retention and duplicate gene divergence led to the emergence of different acylsugar chemotypes across different accessions of <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, loss of the ASAT4 enzyme activity in northern accessions of <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> leads to accumulation of acylsugars lacking R2 position acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Changes that alter acylsugar profiles can also occur upstream of the biosynthetic pathway — duplication of the isopropylmalate synthase enzyme involved in amino acid biosynthesis and divergence of the duplicate was shown to alter the acyl chain composition in different accessions of <italic>S. pennellii</italic>, presumably due to changes in the acyl CoA pools in trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). These evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to emergence of novel acylsugar phenotypes were studied in closely related wild tomato species and demonstrate the plasticity of the acylsugar biosynthesis in this clade of <italic>Solanum</italic>. Acylsugar biosynthesis and diversity, although studied very recently in <italic>Petunia axillaris</italic> (Petunia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), is relatively underexplored in the broader Solanaceae family, prompting the question of how the pathway evolved over a much longer time period.</p><p>In this study, we sought to understand the timeline for emergence of the ancestral ASAT activities and to explore the evolution of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway since the origin of the Solanaceae. Typically, significant hits obtained using BLAST searches are analyzed in a phylogenetic context to understand enzyme origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ober and Hartmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>). However, ASAT orthologs can experience functional diversification due to single amino acid changes and/or duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>), precluding functional assignment based on sequence similarity. Thus, we inferred the origins and evolution of the pathway with a bottom-up approach; starting by assessing the diversity of acylsugar phenotypes across the family using mass spectrometry. Our findings not only catalogue the diversity of acylsugars in different plants of the family but also illustrate the varied mechanisms by which the specialized metabolic pathway evolved. These results have broader implications for the study of chemical novelty in the plant kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diversity of acylsugar profiles across the Solanaceae</title><p>While the Solanaceae family comprises 98 genera and &gt;2700 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olmstead and Bohs, 2007</xref>), there are extensive descriptions of acylsugar diversity reported for only a handful of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Severson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shinozaki et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we sampled vegetative tissue surface metabolites from single plants of 35 Solanaceae and four Convolvulaceae species. These species were sampled at the New York Botanical Gardens and Michigan State University (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>), and acylsugar profiles were obtained using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with collision-induced dissociation (CID; see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016b</xref>).

Plant extracts without detectable acylsugars generally lacked glandular trichomes (Fisher Exact Test p=2.3e-6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1B</xref>). In addition, the acylsugar phenotype is quite dynamic and can be affected by factors such as developmental stage, environmental conditions and the specific accession sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>). These factors may also influence the detection of acylsugars in some species.</p><p>The suite of detected acylsugars exhibited substantial diversity, both in molecular and fragment ion masses. Most species accumulated acylsugars with mass spectra consistent with disaccharide cores — most likely sucrose — esterified with short- to medium-chain aliphatic acyl groups, similar to previously characterized acylsugars in cultivated and wild tomatoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). However, <italic>S. nigrum</italic> acylsugar data suggested exclusive accumulation of acylhexoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with fragmentation patterns similar to previously analyzed <italic>S. pennellii</italic> acylglucoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>). Mass spectra of <italic>S. quitoense</italic> acylsugars also revealed acylsugars with features distinct from any known acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and structures of these will be described in detail in a separate report. In total, more than 100 acylsucroses and at least 20 acylsugars of other forms were annotated with number and lengths of acyl groups based on pseudomolecular and fragment ion masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Several hundred additional low-abundance isomers and novel acylsugars were also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). For example, in Salpiglossis alone, &gt;300 chromatographic peaks had <italic>m/z</italic> ratios and mass defects consistent with acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This acylsugar diversity is notable when compared to ~33 detected acylsucroses in cultivated tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mass spectra also revealed substantial diversity in the number and lengths of acyl chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on negative ion mode data, the number of acyl chains on the sugar cores ranged from two to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), with chain lengths from 2 to 12 carbons. Across the Solanaceae, we found species that incorporate at least one common aliphatic acyl chain in all their major acylsugars: for example chains of length C5 in <italic>A. belladonna</italic>, C4 in <italic>P. viscosa</italic>, and C8 in <italic>P. alkekengi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Longer C10 and C12 chain-containing acylsugars were found in multiple species (<italic>P. viscosa</italic>, <italic>A. belladonna</italic>, <italic>H. niger</italic>, <italic>S. nigrum</italic> and <italic>S. quitoense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mass spectra consistent with acylsugars containing novel acyl chains were also detected. While we could not differentiate between acyl chain isomers (e.g. <italic>iso</italic>-C5 [iC5] vs. <italic>anteiso</italic>-C5 [aiC5]) based on CID fragmentation patterns, our data reveal large acyl chain diversity in acylsugars across the Solanaceae. Such diversity between species can result from differences in the intracellular concentrations of acyl CoA pools or divergent substrate specificities of individual ASATs. A previous study from our lab identified allelic variation in the enzyme isopropylmalate synthase 3, which contributes to differences in abundances of iC5 or iC4 chains in acylsugars of <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and some <italic>S. pennellii</italic> accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>ASAT</italic> gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>), gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and single residue changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>) also influence chain diversity in acylsugars, illustrating the various ways by which acylsugar phenotypes may be generated in the Solanaceae.</p><p>Published data from <italic>S. pennellii</italic> and <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> revealed differences in furanose ring acylation on acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>). Ring-specific acylation patterns can be evaluated using positive mode mass spectrometry and CID, which generates fragment ion masses from cleavage of the glycosidic linkage. We found furanose ring acylation in almost all tested species in Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–E</xref>); however, the lengths of acyl chains on the ring varied. All tri-acylsucroses analyzed using positive mode CID data bore all acyl chains on one ring, likely the pyranose ring — as evidenced by neutral loss of 197 Da (hexose plus NH<sub>3</sub>) from the [M+NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> ion — unlike <italic>S. lycopersicum,</italic> which bears one acyl chain on the furanose ring. However, the substituents varied among tetra- and penta-acylsugars of different species, with some (e.g.: <italic>N. alata</italic>), showing up to four chains on the same ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), and others (e.g.: <italic>H. niger</italic>, Salpiglossis) revealing spectra consistent with acylation on both pyranose and furanose rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>).</p><p>These findings illustrated that species across the family show very diverse acylsugar profiles, prompting us to quantify the overall surface metabolite diversity using Shannon Entropy (see Materials and methods). We found that acylsugar producing species had significantly higher entropies compared to non-producing species [Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test p=2e-18], indicative of the qualitative and quantitative variation in acylsugar profiles in the producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also found that different tissues sampled from the same species shared a substantial proportion of peaks, however, peaks were generally unique between species — a finding supported by manual annotation of acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Acylsugar producing species, although sharing a smaller proportion of peaks, shared relatively more peaks with other acylsugar producing species than with non-producers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>). Inferences derived from additional parameters, namely peak specificity and tissue specialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), were consistent with these observations suggesting a high degree of specificity of surface metabolites in Solanaceae species.</p><p>These results demonstrate the substantial acylsugar diversity across the Solanaceae family, most of which is unique to any given species.

This aiC6 acylation reaction is in concordance with the observed <italic>in planta</italic> acylation pattern at the R3 position — aiC6 is present at this position in the majority of <italic>S. sinuata</italic> acylsugars. Surprisingly, the enzyme did not use aiC5 CoA, despite the identification of S3:15(5,5,5) and likely its acylated derivates [S4:20(5,5,5,5), S4:17(2,5,5,5), S5:22(2,5,5,5,5) and S5:19(2,2,5,5,5)] from <italic>S. sinuata</italic> extracts. SsASAT3-dependent R3 position acylation was further confirmed by testing the tri-acylated product with PaASAT4, which acylates at the R6 position of the pyranose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nadakuduti et al., 2017</xref>). The successful R6 acylation by PaASAT4 is consistent with the hypothesis that SsASAT3 acylates the R3 position.

However, we identified another enzyme, which we designate SsASAT5, that showed three activities acetylating tri-, tetra- and penta-acylsucroses (see Materials and methods). SsASAT5 can perform furanose ring acetylation on tri- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8A,B</xref>) and tetra-acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), and both furanose as well as pyranose ring acetylation on penta-acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8C–F</xref>).

Our observation that SsASAT5 can perform pyranose ring acetylation — albeit weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8D,F</xref>) — is at odds with NMR-characterized structures of a set of 16 purified Salpiglossis acylsugars, which show all acetyl groups on the furanose ring.

Multiple enzymes in this region of the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; light blue clade) are involved in <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of diverse substrates for example indole alkaloid 16-epivellosimine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer et al., 2004</xref>), the phenylpropanoid benzyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Auria et al., 2002</xref>) and the terpene geraniol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shalit et al., 2003</xref>). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>O</italic>-acetylation activity was present in ancestral enzymes within this region of the phylogenetic tree.</p><p>Gene tree reconciliation with known relationships between plant families and orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) was used to infer acylsugar pathway evolution in the context of plant evolution. We used historical dates as described by Särkinen and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Särkinen et al., 2013</xref>) in our interpretations, as opposed to a recent study that described a much earlier origination time for the Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilf et al., 2017</xref>). Based on known relationships, Convolvulaceae is the closest sister family to Solanaceae; however, we found no putative ASAT orthologs in any searched Convolvulaceae species. The closest Convolvulaceae homologs were found in the <italic>Ipomoea trifida</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>) in the red subclade. This suggests that the blue and red subclades arose via a duplication event before the Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae split, estimated to be ~50–65 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Särkinen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, this duplication event predates the whole genome triplication (WGT) event ancestral to all Solanaceae that occurred after the Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bombarely et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This inference is also consistent with our findings based on synonymous substitution rate (dS) distributions of homologs between cultivated tomato and Petunia. Specifically, we identified all orthologs and paralogs in the two species and obtained a distribution of all dS values (black histogram/red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), as in a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bombarely et al., 2016</xref>). We then specifically identified the syntenic paralogs in tomato — likely derived from the polyploidization events — and overlaid their dS values on the previous distribution (yellow curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This analysis differentiated the paralogs derived via ancestral WGD events from those derived via the Solanaceae-specific WGT event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bombarely et al., 2016</xref>). Two BAHDs — SlASAT1 (Solyc12g006330) and Solyc07g043670 — in the blue subclade (bold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) were found to be whole genome duplicates of each other. These genes lie in a syntenic block that spans multiple gene pairs on chromosomes 12 and 7, respectively, a majority of which are derived from the Solanaceae-specific WGT event (blue curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). These observations were useful in annotating the duplication node separating SlASAT1 and Solyc07g043670 in the BAHD gene tree as the Solanaceae-specific WGD node (#5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We can then also infer that the duplications giving rise to the different ASAT1,2,3 clades occurred prior to this Solanaceae-specific WGT event.</p><p>The lack of ASAT orthologs in Convolvulaceae could indicate that Convolvulaceae species with an orthologous acylsugar biosynthetic pathway were not sampled in our analysis. Alternatively, the absence of orthologs of the blue subclade enzymes in the Convolvulaceae, coupled with the lack of acylsugars in the sampled Convolvulaceae species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), leads us to hypothesize that ASAT orthologs were lost early in Convolvulaceae evolution.</p><p>The known phylogenetic relationships between species can help assign a maximum age for the duplication event leading to the blue and red subclades. Database searches identified homologs from species in the Boraginales (<italic>Ehretia</italic>, <italic>Heliotropium</italic>) and Gentianales (<italic>Coffea, Catharanthus</italic>) orders that clustered outside Group #2, in a monophyletic group with high bootstrap support (Group #1, pink branches, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Boraginales is sister to the Lamiales order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead, 2014</xref>), and although Boraginales putative orthologs were identified through BLAST searches, no orthologs from Lamiales species were detected. The closest Lamiales (<italic>Sesamum, Lavandula, Mimulus</italic>) homologs were more closely related to SsASAT5 than to the ASATs in the blue subclade (purple squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation for these observations is that the duplication event that gave rise to the blue and red subclades occurred before the Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae split 50–65 mya but after the Solanales-Boraginales/Lamiales orders diverged 75–100 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Consistent with this model, we did not find any acylsugar-like peaks in leaf surface extracts of eleven species in these orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>These findings, which provide insights into the origin of acylsugar biosynthesis, can be interpreted under the three-step model of evolution of biological innovation, involving potentiation, actualization and refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount et al., 2012</xref>) (Figure 8). We propose that the ASAT enzymes catalyzing sucrose acylation first emerged (or actualized) between 30–80 mya. Events prior to the emergence of this activity — including the existence of alkaloid biosynthetic BAHDs and the duplication event 60–80 mya that gave rise to the blue and the red subclades — potentiated the emergence of the ASAT activities. Presumably, acylsugars provided a fitness advantage to the ancestral plants, leading to the refinement of ASAT activities over the next few million years. For acylsugar production to emerge, these steps in enzyme evolution would have been complemented by other innovations in ASAT transcriptional regulation leading to gland cell expression as well as production of precursors (i.e., acyl CoA donors and sucrose) in Type I/IV trichomes.</p><p>Overall, these observations support a view of the origins of the ASAT1,2,3 blue subclade from an alkaloid biosynthetic ancestor via a single duplication event &gt;50 mya, prior to the establishment of the Solanaceae. This duplicate underwent further rounds of duplication prior to and after the Solanaceae-specific WGT event to generate the multiple ASATs found in the blue subclade. Thus, a logical next question is ‘what was the structure of the acylsugar biosynthetic network early in the Solanaceae family evolution?’ To address this, we focused on ASAT evolution across the Solanaceae family.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Evolution of acylsugar biosynthesis in the Solanaceae</title><p>ASAT enzymes in the blue subclade represent the first three steps in the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. The likely status of these three steps in the Salpiglossis-Petunia-Tomato last common ancestor (LCA) was investigated using the gene tree displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Mapping the pathway enzymes on the gene tree suggests that the LCA likely had at least three enzymatic activities, which we refer to as ancestral ASAT1 (aASAT1), ASAT2 (aASAT2) and ASAT3 (aASAT3); these are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> as red, dark blue and yellow squares, respectively.

Counter to the second hypothesis, we found no evidence of aASAT2 ortholog duplication in the genomic datasets; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of recent polyploidy or tandem duplication in extant species producing duplicate genes with divergent functions. We explored the more parsimonious hypothesis that functional divergence between orthologs led to the aASAT2 functional switch.</p><p>Functional divergence between aASAT2 orthologs may have occurred by one of two mechanisms. One, it is possible that aASAT2 orthologs had some sucrose acylation activity prior to aASAT1 loss. Alternatively, sucrose acylation activity arose completely anew after the loss of aASAT1. We sought evidence for acceptor substrate promiscuity in extant species by characterizing the activity of additional orthologous aASAT2 enzymes from <italic>H. niger</italic> and <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) using aiC6 and nC12 as acyl CoA donors. HnASAT2 — like SsASAT2 — only performed the ASAT2 reaction (acylation of mono-acylsucrose), without any evidence for sucrose acylation under standard testing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). However, both SnASAT1 and SlASAT1 could produce S1:6(6) and S1:12(12) from sucrose. These findings suggest that until the Atropina-Solaneae common ancestor, the aASAT2 ortholog still primarily conducted the ASAT2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, at some point, the aASAT2 ortholog moved in reaction space towards being ASAT1, and this activity shift was likely complete by the time the <italic>S.nigrum-S.lycopersicum</italic> lineage diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), given that aASAT2 orthologs in both species utilize sucrose.</p><p>These results point to a second round of major innovation in the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. This round involved the following three steps: (i) Potentiation: the similarity in activities of aASAT1,2 and 3, allowing changes in substrate preferences with relatively few amino acid changes. In fact, aASAT1 and aASAT2 appear to be clustered together in the gene tree, perhaps making the aASAT2 activity switch more likely. (ii) Actualization: this refers to the first instance of the emergence of the ASAT1 activity in aASAT2 orthologs. It is unclear whether this switch occurred prior to aASAT1 loss or after. (iii) Refinement: after the actualization of the ASAT1 activity, this activity was likely refined over time to the SlASAT1 activity we see today. To understand the specific order of the events in aASAT2 evolution in the Solanaceae, ASAT1 and ASAT2 enzymes from additional species between <italic>H. niger</italic> and <italic>Solanum</italic> will need to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We performed experimental and computational analysis of BAHD enzymes from several lineages spanning ~100 million years, and characterized the emergence and evolution of the acylsugar metabolic network. We identified four biosynthetic enzymes in <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic>, the extant species of an early emerging Solanaceae lineage, characterized in vitro activities, validated <italic>in planta</italic> roles of these ASATs and studied their emergence over 100 million years of plant evolution. These results demonstrate the value of leveraging genomics, phylogenetics, analytical chemistry and enzymology with a mix of model and non-model organisms to understand the evolution of biological complexity.</p><p>We uncovered a large diversity of acylsugars across the family, all of which is based on two simple types of components - a sugar core (mostly sucrose) and acyl chains (C2-C12). Previous studies indicate that acylation is possible on all eight hydroxyls on the sucrose core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). A simple calculation (see Materials and methods) considering only 12 aliphatic CoA donors typically found in Solanaceae acylsugars suggests &gt;6000 theoretical possible structures for tetra-acylsugars alone. This estimate does not include estimates of tri-, penta-, hexa-acylsugars nor does it consider non-aliphatic CoAs such as malonyl CoA, esters of other sugars such as glucose or positional isomers. Although the theoretical possibilities are restricted by availability of CoAs in trichome tip cells and existing ASAT activities, we still observe hundreds of acylsugars across the Solanaceae, with &gt;300 detectable acylsugar-like chromatographic peaks in single plants of Salpiglossis and <italic>N. alata</italic>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) including very low abundance hepta-acylsugars and acylsugars containing phenylacetyl and tigloyl chains. The acylsugar composition is typically similar between trichomes on different plant tissues of the same individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, it varies at multiple taxonomic levels - that is between populations of a single species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>) and between species across the Solanaceae (this study). This structural diversity is reminiscent of other diverse lineage-specific metabolite classes such as glucosinolates in Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsen et al., 2016</xref>), betalains in Caryophyllales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan and Giridhar, 2015</xref>), acridone alkaloids in Rutaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>), resin glycosides in Convolvulaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereda-Miranda et al., 2010</xref>) and pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Boraginaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Shazly and Wink, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Does structural diversity within the same metabolite class in a single individual provide a fitness advantage? The neutral theory of evolution serves as a null hypothesis, predicting that diversity does not confer a fitness advantage and is merely a result of drift. Indeed, the structural diversity in a single individual could be a reflection of promiscuous enzyme activities, given large enzyme families such as BAHDs, cytochrome P450s, glycosyltransferases play a role in the biosynthesis of several specialized metabolite classes. It is also possible that only a few specific metabolites belonging to the metabolite class — rather than the entire repertoire of the class — are consequential in imparting fitness advantage to an individual. Alternatively, such structural diversity may generate a meta-property, such as stickiness — in the case of acylsugars — or synergistic antimicrobial or insect protective action that may provide a fitness advantage. A related possibility is that metabolite diversity in a single individual and, subsequently, between populations of the same species, provides the standing variation that may be acted upon by natural selection in the future, as the environment of the species changes. This was postulated to be the case for the existence of aliphatic glucosinolate diversity in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>). A previous study also showed that accession-level glucosinolate diversity is maintained in European populations of Arabidopsis by the differences in relative abundance of two aphid species in different parts of the range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of acylsugar diversity, we have no evidence for one or more of these hypotheses, because most studies on the importance of acylsugar structural diversity were performed in lab settings. Thus, a significant opportunity exists to characterize the importance of the structural diversity in acylsugar and other plant specialized metabolite classes in ecologically relevant settings.</p><p>Our results revealed the involvement of gene duplication and divergence, enzyme promiscuity, gene loss and functional divergence between orthologs in the evolution of the relatively compact acylsugar biosynthetic network. The process of gene loss in ASATs and other BAHDs may also have been influenced by the fractionation process occurring in the Solanaceae genomes after the Solanaceae-specific polyploidization event. Our results also point to factors such as acyl CoA pools, trichome developmental programs and genotype by environment interactions that may affect the evolution of metabolic pathways. Previous results from closely related <italic>Solanum</italic> species also revealed regulatory divergence of ASATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and neo-functionalization of duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ning et al., 2015</xref>) in influencing the phenotypes produced by this pathway. These findings highlight the striking plasticity of the acylsugar biosynthetic network and illustrate the complexity that underlies the evolution of novel chemical phenotypes. Our results also reveal the important role played by tandem and whole genome duplications as well as gene loss in evolution of specialized metabolic pathways.</p><p>The discovery of multiple routes to biochemical innovation in our study was facilitated by the use of a highly integrative approach. Recent studies have utilized similar integrative approaches in deciphering the molecular evolution of plant-butterfly interactions in the Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edger et al., 2015</xref>) and evolution of herbivore-induced defense signaling in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Deployment of such strategies on a large scale is increasingly possible due to improvements in small molecule mass spectrometry and nucleic acid sequencing, establishment of transient knockdown protocols such as VIGS that do not require stable plant transformation, establishment of new gene editing techniques, broadly representative genome and transcriptome sequence databases and significantly better data storage and analysis abilities. Approaches such as VIGS are even more important for deciphering metabolic pathways in non-model species because of the lack of stable transformation protocols and involvement of enzyme families in specialized metabolism, which frequently requires <italic>in planta</italic> validation. Overall, such broad studies can provide a multi-dimensional view of the evolution of metabolite diversity because of the ability to integrate insights derived from different approaches into a single framework. In addition, phylogeny-guided studies that integrate comparative metabolomics and transcriptomics, such as co-expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wisecaver et al., 2017</xref>), can also be used for pathway discovery in non-model organisms, thus creating a robust platform for studying different aspects of biological evolution, for example co-evolutionary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edger et al., 2015</xref>). Discovery of novel enzymatic activities, coupled with recent advances in genome editing technologies, can also benefit synthetic biology of natural products, for example as described by Ignea and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ignea et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we primarily focused on Salpiglossis because of a unique acylsugar profile and its phylogenetic position. <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> is the flagship species of the Solanaceae family, and we were able to apply the insights derived with this crop as a foundation to discover novel enzymes in related species. Our investigations in Salpiglossis were also aided by the availability of ASATs and NMR structures of their products in Petunia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nadakuduti et al., 2017</xref>), which is more closely related to Salpiglossis than tomato. ‘Anchor species’ such as Petunia, which are phylogenetically distant from flagship/model species, can enable study of a different region of the phylogenetic tree of the clade of interest. Development of limited genomic and functional resources in such anchor species, coupled with integrative, comparative approaches can offer more efficient routes for the exploration of biochemical complexity in the ~300,000 plant species estimated to exist on our planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mora et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant acylsugar extractions and mass spectrometric analyses</title><p>Acylsugar extractions were carried out from plants at the New York Botanical Gardens and from other sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

In our calculation, we assumed that each acyl chain has the same probability of being incorporated into the acylsugar, with the core being a sucrose core. Under these assumptions, there are eight acyl chains that could be incorporated at three positions on a tetra-acylsugar and 12 acyl chains on the fourth position.

The strengths of the manuscript are the chemistry and the analysis of the acyl-sugar involved genes. There are some weaknesses that should be addressed. The first is the vague use of diversity for multiple meanings throughout the manuscript as described below. The second is that there is no evidence that this diversity has in planta mechanistic function. This could have been solved by testing the SsASAT lines for biotic activity but this was not done.</p><p>The authors work on acylsugars that in general have been linked to anti-herbivore activities but as of yet, there has been little evidence showing that the diversity in acyl sugar structures leads to different in planta biotic activities as has been shown directly for glucosinolates in the Brassicales and DIMBOA compounds in Maize. In the third paragraph of the Introduction, the authors say that there is evidence that the diversity is functionally important. But these citations, Puterka and Leckie, only looked at purified acyl sugars using in vitro studies and do not really allow the claim that this diversity matters in a real plant. This generates a central weakness in this study that there is no in planta evidence that this diversity really matters using single gene manipulations. There is a similar level of diversity in the glycosylated flavonols throughout the plant kingdom where the hexose pattern on a single compound like Kaempferol leads to a massive structural diversity. Yet this structural diversity has yet to be given a biological reason to exist. A simple solution to this would have been testing the transgenic lines with simpler acylsugar patterns for biotic resistance. As this was not done, it seems a lot to ask to include in an already large paper. A better solution is to give a more realistic accounting that the diversity of structure in this pathway has little to no evidence of activity and this needs to be tested in the future. The present Introduction and Discussion left this reader thinking that there was proven in planta activity for this diversity but a reading of the citations showed that this was not the case. As the strength is the family level analysis of gene level creation of structural diversity, there is no reason to hide this weakness. All that happens is that the follow-up study showing the biological role looks less impressive.</p><p>For Figures like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and others, there are direct measures like Shannon Entropy that can be used to directly quantify structural diversity and use that number in statistical analysis. This would allow the authors to directly show that the acyl sugar pattern is becoming simpler in the SsASAT2 lines. This is a classic tool to look at ecosystem diversity in ecology and has a long history. If the claim is truly about diversity, then it would seem to be best to directly test diversity.</p><p>There is a recurring confusion about the term diversity within this manuscript that is a central weakness to this reader. This has several foundations. One is that the authors interchange diversity across multiple levels (within individual, within species and between species) without ever clarifying or even distinguishing these three. For example, the authors say that Prasad et al. 2012 shows that glucosinolate diversity influences fitness in the wild. Yet this paper is not between species or within individual diversity but about two different alleles that simply alter the structure between two individuals (within species) and showing that one allele is better than another. This then is directly compared to the Macel citation which is not about within species but between species comparisons. And finally, this is compared to Weinhold and Baldwin, 2011; Leckie et al., 482 2016; and Luu et al., 2017 papers that are about the possible mechanistic function of O-acyl sugars in general without delving into the role of diversity directly. As such, these three citation sets are not directly comparable as they do not discuss the same diversity.</p><p>Furthering this confusion is that diversity is interchangeably used to mean the blend of structures possible at all levels (individual, species and family) while simultaneously meaning the differences between these groupings. Yet these are very different meanings with the blend of structures representing potential and the individual composition meaning actuality. For example, the Prasad citation talks about two different groups of structures in glucosinolates and the plant has to choose between one or the other and cannot have both in that particular situation. As such, it is essential to qualify all the different meanings of diversity in a paper that discusses chemical structures, genetic variation within and between species and even between family.</p><p>As a side on the topic of diversity and fitness, there are papers by Kerwin and Zust on glucosinolates that show that diversity of structures within species is beneficial to the species wherein one allele is optimal in one environment and an alternative is optimal in another using direct assays of individual biosynthetic genes effect on field fitness. These specifically address the fluctuating selection/bet-hedging model of secondary metabolism whereby the genetic diversity to chemical diversity link provides a unique solution to fluctuating biotrophic attack.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Conclusion”, the authors state &quot;Based on our findings, the acylsugar phenotype across the Solanaceae is &quot;hyper-diverse&quot;, meaning there is large diversity within and between closely related species&quot;. What is hyper-diverse? This is not a quantitative nor qualitative definition as there is no comparison to other species and other compound classes. The authors then compare this to other species/compounds, but this is not an easy comparison as most of these other compound classes have not been targeted with LC-MS platforms with the sensitivity as used in this manuscript. A fundamental question that this raises is what is the benefit of saying hyper-diverse beyond some inherent claim that our pathway is more structurally (key) diverse than yours.</p><p>The Moghe and Last citation in use for glucosinolates is presently out of date as there have been recent papers showing the role of whole genome duplications and tandem gene duplications that enabled the evolution of the whole pathway beyond the single isopropylmalate synthase event. Part of the reason for this is that in the glucosinolate pathway, the duplications allowed the old structures to be kept when making the new ones but in the acylsugar pathway, this does not seem to be the case. As this manuscript is working to discuss a similar level of genomic/family level evolution that was worked out last year in Glucosinolates, the authors should directly cite the relevant primary literature. Especially as there is no limit on citations for <italic>eLife</italic>, it makes sense to give credit to the people who found all of the evidence in the second paragraph of the Introduction. Equally, isn't Ohno, the book that came up with the idea, a better citation for sub- and neo-functionalization?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors claim that &quot;this study provides mechanistic insights into the emergence of a plant chemical novelty, and offers a template for investigating the 300,000 non-model plant species that remain underexplored.&quot; While I do not doubt the biochemical experiments, the template provided misses the mark on evolutionary analyses, and does not take advantage of any new network methods. Some brief comments:</p><p>1) Experimental Design. A reference phylogeny is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for the Solanaceae; however, the manuscript wants to address the evolution of the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway across the orders Solanales, Lamiales, and Boraginales also. If this was the case, why not use an expanded phylogeny to guide collecting representatives from across these orders and within the Solanaceae (with matched tissue for both metabolomics and transcriptomics)?</p><p>2) Phylogenetics. Given that the authors gathered transcriptome data, why not create transcriptome phylogenies based on thousands of nuclear genes to confirm species identity and investigate the gene families of interest at the same time? These could have been generated initially, but otherwise it is easy enough to mine the transcriptomes from the OneKP project. Futhermore, BLAST is only one way to use transcriptome data which can now be anchored to related genomes. This is now a well-established methodology in the plant genomics community (see Brockington et al. 2015 cited by the authors, but also many other studies, including ones that specifically look at metabolism in both model and non-model systems).</p><p>Also, the neighbor joining analyses used <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> were abandoned in the mid-1990s for more sophisticated likelihood and Bayesian analyses.</p><p>3) Evolution of duplicates. The authors make claims about evolution and duplication; however, they do not use the genomic resources to phylogenetically evaluate whether the duplicates being considered are from whole genome duplication (WGD or polyploidy) vs. small scale duplication (SSD). Given that Solanaceae have a WGD, it would seem important to investigate the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway in this context. Several papers not cited on the origins of metabolic pathways have confronted this link directly (for example; Edger et al. 2015 PNAS 112: 8362; Zhou et al. 2016 <italic>eLife</italic>, 5: e19531). Without such analyses, it is not clear what claims can be made about the nature of gene and genome duplication.</p><p>4) Reconstructing pathways using synteny and/or network approaches. Given the genomic resources of the Solanales and related orders, the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway should be evaluated using synteny (and there are online tools to do so, such as COGE). Similarly, the authors miss an opportunity to engage the debate about the origins of metabolic pathways and tools to investigate this (for example, Wisecaver et al. 2017. Plant Cell &quot;A global co- expression approach for connecting genes to specialized metabolic pathways in plants.&quot;). The novelty of the manuscript would be elevated if newer methods were utilized.</p><p>5) Novelty. Not being familiar with the author's previous work, it would be helpful to state up front what is known from their recent work (Ning et al. 2015, Fan et al. 2016a, b, Schilmiller et al. 2016, etc.) and what is explicitly new here. As far as this reviewer can tell, the main methodological novelty of the paper is the development of VIGS for the non-model genus Salpiglossis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a highly interesting and well carried out study that documents a logical extension to previous work in the Last lab albeit one carried out on a massive scale. I would like to start my review with the admission that large sectors of the evolutionary analysis are beyond my ability to evaluate – the authors conclusions seem reasonable to me however I cannot comment deeper on these aspects. The metabolite analysis which I can comment in detail on is exemplary and the transcriptome analysis also. One thing that I feel is lacking however is the quantitative data for the metabolites I think this should be available and probably be subjected to a deeper statistical characterization than they currently are. I agree this is not needed to support the current manuscript but believe that it would render the manuscript a more powerful reference resource.</p><p>My other comments concern the writing style which, on occasion, I feel is exaggerated. This starts with the first word of the title – I admit I am not a fan of the &quot;word&quot; omics but feel that multi-omics should probably be toned down for this study. Many other sentences claim the generality of the study to metabolism across the plant kingdom. I am not sure these are quite substantiated and therefore suggest that they modify such claims to make them more accurate to what they actually show or clearly indicate when they are speculating. In line with this I would have liked to see a slightly longer perspective as to what doors such broad studies offer i.e. do they provide a platform to assess the drivers of the evolution of chemical diversity and hence the fitness of plants acquiring new chemical tools to their arsenal. Whilst hints as to this are included in the text it would be nice if the authors could distill this in a more clear fashion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28468.057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers all agree that there were three key points that should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The question of whole genome duplications in this process should be assessed as best as possible given the available transcriptomic and/or genomic sequences. Especially given the known WGD in the Solanaceae.</italic> </p><p>In the previous version of our manuscript, we discussed two duplication events:</p><p>i) A duplication event that gave rise to the ASAT clade (blue subclade – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>): This event occurred before Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae divergence, in contrast to the WGT event, which occurred after the divergence between the families (Bombarely et al., Nature Plants, 2016). We have now clarified this in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The evolutionary origins of acylsugar biosynthesis”.</p><p>ii) Duplication events that gave rise to the multiple ASATs: We have now performed additional analyses that suggest the many duplications that gave rise to the major BAHD clades in the blue subclade also occurred prior to the Solanaceae-specific WGT event (subsection “The evolutionary origins of acylsugar biosynthesis”, fifth paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We used the same framework as described in Supplementary Note 5 of Bombarely et al., Nature Plants, 2016, using within- and between-genome syntenic blocks and synonymous substitution rate to identify the timing for the Solanaceae-specific WGT event and the order of duplications in the blue subclade.</p><p><italic>2) Metabolite diversity should be directly tested using any of the available statistical approaches used in ecology and evolution to test variation in diversity.</italic> </p><p>We have now used the approach described in Li et al., PNAS, 2016 to calculate Shannon Entropy and degree of specialization for different acylsugar profiles. These results are now shows as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>.

We have now made it clearer in the manuscript in the Introduction section (third paragraph) and in the Conclusions section (third paragraph).</p><p>In our opinions, the most compelling study discussing the ecological roles of acylsugars comes from the Baldwin lab (Weinhold and Baldwin, PNAS, 2011) and we cited this study in the initial submission. We have now expanded upon its results for describing the ecological importance of acyl chain diversity in acylsugars.</p><p>The VIGS lines generated in our study possess only a transient knockdown of the ASAT enzymes. Hence, we did not consider them optimal for rigorously testing the importance of acylsugar diversity. Additional experiments that use stable knockdowns/knockouts and gene editing (e.g. RNAi, CRISPR-Cas9) would be useful for clearly addressing this question and would require development of transformation in Salpiglossis and other species.</p><p><italic>For Figures like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and others, there are direct measures like Shannon Entropy that can be used to directly quantify structural diversity and use that number in statistical analysis.

This is a classic tool to look at ecosystem diversity in ecology and has a long history. If the claim is truly about diversity, then it would seem to be best to directly test diversity.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We calculated Shannon Entropy of acylsugar-like peaks in acylsugar producing species, where we originally made claims about diversity. The results of this analysis are described in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Diversity of acylsugar profiles across the Solanaceae”, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. The approach is described in detail in the Materials and methods section. We found that Salpiglossis and <italic>Nicotiana alata</italic> have the highest entropy of surface metabolite profiles and that the profiles are generally very specific to the plant and tissues sampled.</p><p>With regards to diversity in the VIGS lines, our focus was primarily total acylsugar levels (SsASAT1, SsASAT2) and specific types of acylsugars produced (SsASAT3, SsASAT5) in the knockdowns that may inform us about the likely position of the perturbed enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. We previously performed detailed analyses of these two aspects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref> and the associated figure supplements, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to identify and describe specific, significant differences.</p><p><italic>There is a recurring confusion about the term diversity within this manuscript that is a central weakness to this reader. This has several foundations. One is that the authors interchange diversity across multiple levels (within individual, within species and between species) without ever clarifying or even distinguishing these three.

We attempt to use this word only to refer to diversity of chemical structures (e.g. diversity of acylsugars, sugar cores, acyl chains, glucosinolate structures). We have also attempted, to the best of our abilities, to make the taxonomic level clear at multiple places where diversity is discussed, especially in the Conclusions section (third paragraph). As noted below (in our sixth response), we also re-worded the section on acylsugar profiles being hyper-diverse.</p><p><italic>As a side on the topic of diversity and fitness, there are papers by Kerwin and Zust on glucosinolates that show that diversity of structures within species is beneficial to the species wherein one allele is optimal in one environment and an alternative is optimal in another using direct assays of individual biosynthetic genes effect on field fitness. These specifically address the fluctuating selection/bet-hedging model of secondary metabolism whereby the genetic diversity to chemical diversity link provides a unique solution to fluctuating biotrophic attack.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for suggesting the Kerwin and Zust papers. We now include these points in the third paragraph of the subsection “Conclusions”.</p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Conclusion”, the authors state &quot;Based on our findings, the acylsugar phenotype across the Solanaceae is &quot;hyper-diverse&quot;, meaning there is large diversity within and between closely related species&quot;. What is hyper-diverse? This is not a quantitative nor qualitative definition as there is no comparison to other species and other compound classes. The authors then compare this to other species/compounds, but this is not an easy comparison as most of these other compound classes have not been targeted with LC-MS platforms with the sensitivity as used in this manuscript. A fundamental question that this raises is what is the benefit of saying hyper-diverse beyond some inherent claim that our pathway is more structurally (key) diverse than yours.</italic> </p><p>We replaced the word hyper-diverse in the title, Abstract and text with a more accurate description of the phenotype. Specifically, we use the words “large diversity” or “highly diverse”. We removed the comparisons between the different metabolite classes and now simply say that the acylsugar diversity is reminiscent of metabolite diversity in other lineage-specific metabolite classes.</p><p><italic>The Moghe and Last citation in use for glucosinolates is presently out of date as there have been recent papers showing the role of whole genome duplications and tandem gene duplications that enabled the evolution of the whole pathway beyond the single isopropylmalate synthase event. Part of the reason for this is that in the glucosinolate pathway, the duplications allowed the old structures to be kept when making the new ones but in the acylsugar pathway, this does not seem to be the case. As this manuscript is working to discuss a similar level of genomic/family level evolution that was worked out last year in Glucosinolates, the authors should directly cite the relevant primary literature. Especially as there is no limit on citations for eLife, it makes sense to give credit to the people who found all of the evidence in the second paragraph of the Introduction. Equally, isn't Ohno, the book that came up with the idea, a better citation for sub- and neo-functionalization?</italic> </p><p>We added relevant citations at the statements noted by the reviewer. We also cite Ohno 1970 (sub-functionalization) and Force, 1999 (neo-functionalization) in the second paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors claim that &quot;this study provides mechanistic insights into the emergence of a plant chemical novelty, and offers a template for investigating the 300,000 non-model plant species that remain underexplored.&quot; While I do not doubt the biochemical experiments, the template provided misses the mark on evolutionary analyses, and does not take advantage of any new network methods. Some brief comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Experimental Design. A reference phylogeny is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for the Solanaceae; however, the manuscript wants to address the evolution of the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway across the orders Solanales, Lamiales, and Boraginales also. If this was the case, why not use an expanded phylogeny to guide collecting representatives from across these orders and within the Solanaceae (with matched tissue for both metabolomics and transcriptomics)?</italic> </p><p>In response to the suggestion we sampled additional plants in the Lamiales, Boraginales and Gentianales orders. Specifically, we performed extraction of leaf surface metabolites from 11 species in these orders. Our results are consistent with published results that surface acylsugars are restricted to the Solanaceae. It is also consistent with our finding that the duplication event that gave rise to the ASAT clade occurred after the node that separates Solanales and Lamiales/Boraginales orders. Results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>In our study, we used metabolite profiling as a way to screen for plants to be used for RNA-seq. We selected plants in the Solanaceae family – the family of most interest to us – that were phylogenetically dispersed and showed interesting acylsugar profiles. We originally did not sample families beyond Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae because there was no evidence in literature of acylsugars beyond Solanaceae, and because of absence of any ASAT homologs in BLAST searches beyond the family.</p><p><italic>2) Phylogenetics. Given that the authors gathered transcriptome data, why not create transcriptome phylogenies based on thousands of nuclear genes to confirm species identity and investigate the gene families of interest at the same time? These could have been generated initially, but otherwise it is easy enough to mine the transcriptomes from the OneKP project. Futhermore, BLAST is only one way to use transcriptome data which can now be anchored to related genomes. This is now a well-established methodology in the plant genomics community (see Brockington et al. 2015 cited by the authors, but also many other studies, including ones that specifically look at metabolism in both model and non-model systems).</italic> </p><p>The reviewer has proposed an analysis that can be very useful to the field, but the original focus of our studies – for both scientific and budgetary reasons – was Solanaceae, given absence of evidence for acylsugars in non-Solanaceae species.</p><p>With regards to the OneKP database, we indeed searched the transcriptomes of all Solanales, Lamiales, Boraginales and Gentianales species in the OneKP project as mentioned in the Materials and methods (subsection: “Similarity searches using BLAST”), however, we did not find any close ASAT homologs through this search. The results of this BLAST are now provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we have used multiple genome sequences in the relevant lineages, including <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> (Gentianales – used for making orthologous groups), <italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic> (Lamiales – used in BLAST searches for identifying ASAT homologs), <italic>Ipomoea trifida</italic> (Convolvulaceae – used in BLAST searches for identifying ASAT homologs) as well as <italic>Petunia axillaris, Capsicum annuum, Solanum phureja</italic> (Solanaceae – used for studying genome synteny using MCScanX). These analyses are described in the Materials and methods and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and the associated supplemental figures and source data.</p><p><italic>Also, the neighbor joining analyses used <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> were abandoned in the mid-1990s for more sophisticated likelihood and Bayesian analyses.</italic> </p><p>We have now re-made the figures using Maximum Likelihood.</p><p><italic>3) Evolution of duplicates. The authors make claims about evolution and duplication; however, they do not use the genomic resources to phylogenetically evaluate whether the duplicates being considered are from whole genome duplication (WGD or polyploidy) vs. small scale duplication (SSD). Given that Solanaceae have a WGD, it would seem important to investigate the acylsugar biosynthesis pathway in this context. Several papers not cited on the origins of metabolic pathways have confronted this link directly (for example; Edger et al. 2015 PNAS 112: 8362; Zhou et al. 2016 eLife, 5: e19531). Without such analyses, it is not clear what claims can be made about the nature of gene and genome duplication.</italic> </p><p>We performed additional analysis to determine the role of whole genome duplication and tandem duplications in the evolution of acylsugar biosynthesis, as described previously. Results of this analysis are described in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “The evolutionary origins of acylsugar biosynthesis”, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. We have also cited the two suggested papers, which highlight the role of WGD and tandem duplications in evolution of plant defense metabolism.</p><p><italic>4) Reconstructing pathways using synteny and/or network approaches. Given the genomic resources of the Solanales and related orders, the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway should be evaluated using synteny (and there are online tools to do so, such as COGE). Similarly, the authors miss an opportunity to engage the debate about the origins of metabolic pathways and tools to investigate this (for example, Wisecaver et al. 2017. Plant Cell &quot;A global co- expression approach for connecting genes to specialized metabolic pathways in plants.&quot;). The novelty of the manuscript would be elevated if newer methods were utilized.</italic> </p><p>We performed MCScanX analysis among the sequenced genomes in the Solanaceae family, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. The approach is described in the Materials and methods section. In this new version, we also performed additional genome-synteny based analyses, as described above, to determine the involvement of WGT in the evolution of acylsugar biosynthesis. We did not include non-Solanaceae species in our synteny analyses because no ASAT homologs could be detected in those species.</p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we expanded our discussion on the evolution of metabolic pathways, and how the multi-omic approach as described in this study and other studies (e.g. Edger et al., PNAS, 2015; Zhou et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016) can be used to understand the evolution of biological complexity (subsection “Conclusions”, fourth and fifth paragraphs).</p><p><italic>5) Novelty. Not being familiar with the author's previous work, it would be helpful to state up front what is known from their recent work (Ning et al. 2015, Fan et al. 2016a, b, Schilmiller et al. 2016, etc.) and what is explicitly new here. As far as this reviewer can tell, the main methodological novelty of the paper is the development of VIGS for the non-model genus Salpiglossis.</italic> </p><p>Previous work from our lab has focused on identifying the acylsugar biosynthetic enzymes in cultivated tomato and understanding their evolution in two closely related species <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> and <italic>S. pennellii</italic> (~5 million years since speciation). In this study, we (i) discovered biosynthetic enzymes in Salpiglossis, <italic>Hyoscyamus niger</italic> and <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> and (ii) expanded our understanding of acylsugar pathway evolution up to 100 million years of plant evolution. In the process, we discovered interesting metabolite profiles and evolutionary dynamics that occurred within the pathway, which serve as foundations for future research on the topic.</p><p>The reviewer is right in stating that Salpiglossis VIGS is a methodological novelty of this paper. In addition, we believe that the scope of the study, the integrative approach and the biological insights derived are also novel. For example, our manuscript explores the evolution of the entire pathway in contrast to most other studies that typically explore only one enzyme central to the pathway. We also attempted to emphasize the importance of and the relative ease with which an integrative approach such as ours (and other studies cited above) can be deployed in under-studied plant lineages, for understanding plant metabolic diversity. We emphasized these points in the “Conclusions” subsection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a highly interesting and well carried out study that documents a logical extension to previous work in the Last lab albeit one carried out on a massive scale. I would like to start my review with the admission that large sectors of the evolutionary analysis are beyond my ability to evaluate – the authors conclusions seem reasonable to me however I cannot comment deeper on these aspects. The metabolite analysis which I can comment in detail on is exemplary and the transcriptome analysis also. One thing that I feel is lacking however is the quantitative data for the metabolites I think this should be available and probably be subjected to a deeper statistical characterization than they currently are. I agree this is not needed to support the current manuscript but believe that it would render the manuscript a more powerful reference resource.</italic> </p><p>We thank Dr. Fernie for his encouraging words and suggestions. To address his concerns regarding quantitative data for metabolites, we have now performed an analysis of Shannon entropy to depict the diversity of acylsugars in the Solanaceae using the approach described previously (Li et al., PNAS, 2016).</p><p><italic>My other comments concern the writing style which, on occasion, I feel is exaggerated. This starts with the first word of the title – I admit I am not a fan of the &quot;word&quot; omics but feel that multi-omics should probably be toned down for this study. Many other sentences claim the generality of the study to metabolism across the plant kingdom. I am not sure these are quite substantiated and therefore suggest that they modify such claims to make them more accurate to what they actually show or clearly indicate when they are speculating.</italic> </p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestions, we have edited the title to remove the words “Multi-omics” and “hyper-diverse”. We also significantly re-worded our discussion on acylsugar phenotype being hyper-diverse. We have also reviewed our manuscript to state our findings more modestly.</p><p><italic>In line with this I would have liked to see a slightly longer perspective as to what doors such broad studies offer i.e. do they provide a platform to assess the drivers of the evolution of chemical diversity and hence the fitness of plants acquiring new chemical tools to their arsenal. Whilst hints as to this are included in the text it would be nice if the authors could distill this in a more clear fashion.</italic> </p><p>We expanded our discussion on the broader implications of this approach (subsection “Conclusions”, last three paragraphs). Specifically, we discuss the utility of this integrative approach in discovering specialized metabolic pathways in non-model species, and understanding how the constituent enzymes have evolved. Understanding the principles that govern enzyme activity change in nature can also aid the cause of synthetic biology for e.g. by providing novel cassettes for production of natural products, as demonstrated for labdane-type diterpenoids (Ignea et al., Metab Eng, 2015).</p></body></sub-article></article>
