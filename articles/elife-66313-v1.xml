(IZUMO1R) interaction plays a critical role in mammals. Although a set of factors involved in this process has recently been identified, no common factor that can function in both vertebrates and invertebrates has yet been reported. Here, we first demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved factors dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 1 (DCST1) and dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 2 (DCST2) are essential for sperm–egg fusion in mice, as proven by gene disruption and complementation experiments. We also found that the protein stability of another gamete fusion-related sperm factor, SPACA6, is differently regulated by DCST1/2 and IZUMO1. Thus, we suggest that spermatozoa ensure proper fertilization in mammals by integrating various molecular pathways, including an evolutionarily conserved system that has developed as a result of nearly one billion years of evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>spermatozoon</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>gamete fusion</kwd><kwd>gamete interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18H02453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Naokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17K07311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wada</surname><given-names>Ikuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Naokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007106</institution-id><institution>Gunma University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Naokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian fertilization is accomplished through integrating various molecular pathways that include evolutionarily conserved factors, DCST1 and DCST2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gamete recognition and fusion in mammals are considered to occur through a complex intermolecular interaction in which izumo sperm–egg fusion 1 (IZUMO1), sperm acrosome associated 6 (SPACA6), transmembrane protein 95 (TMEM95), fertilization influencing membrane protein (FIMP) and sperm–oocyte fusion required 1 (SOF1) on the sperm side and JUNO (also known as IZUMO1 receptor) and cluster of differentiation 9 (CD9) on the ovum side are all involved in membrane fusion, as proven by gene disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaji et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le Naour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyado et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Noda et al., 2020</xref>).

Previously, these factors have been shown to be essential for fertilization. In fact, phylogeny analysis revealed that DCST1 and DCST2 belong to different clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This supports the finding that DCST2 appears to be closer to ancestor molecules than DCST1, because DCST1 is considered to have arisen after branching from DCST2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alignments of dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 1 (DCST1) and dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 2 (DCST2) amino acid sequences, and mRNA expression profiles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignments of DCST1 in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (human; GenBank: NP_689707.2), <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse; GenBank: NP_084250.1), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (nematode; GenBank: NP_001343858.1), and <italic>Drosophila guanche</italic> (fruit fly; GenBank: XP_034122086.1) are shown.

When eggs were collected from the oviducts of the female mice 8 hr after coitus with a <italic>Dcst1</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> male, many zona-penetrated spermatozoa that had not been fertilized, and possessed a normal IZUMO1 localization upon acrosome reaction, were seen in the perivitelline space of oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). There was no difference in sperm motility between the <italic>Dcst1</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type mice (motility was measured 120 min after incubation by computer-assisted sperm motility analysis in CEROS; mean ± s.e.m = 97.0 ± 0.73% in wild-type [1522 spermatozoa, six individuals] and 96.8 ± 0.87% in <italic>Dcst1</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> [1425 spermatozoa, six individuals]). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are no disturbances in sperm migration into the oviduct, acrosome reaction, and zona penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). More precisely, gamete fusion assay showed that <italic>Dcst1</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> spermatozoa were capable of binding to the plasma membranes of oocytes, but no <italic>Dcst1</italic>/<italic>2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> spermatozoa had fused with the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

From these results, we conclude that both DCST1 and DCST2 are required for establishing the gamete fusion leading to embryogenesis.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-66313-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>6 hr after insemination of <italic>Dcst1/2</italic>-disrupted spermatozoa.</title><p>The first and second half of the video show <italic>Dcst1/2</italic> heterozygous and homozygous KO spermatozoa insemination, respectively.</p></caption></media><p>Finally, we investigated a protein profile of sperm factors such as IZUMO1 and SPACA6, which are essential factors for gamete recognition and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Noda et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, in <italic>Izumo1</italic>, <italic>Spaca6</italic>, <italic>Dcst1/2</italic>, <italic>Dcst1,</italic> and <italic>Dcst2</italic>-deficient spermatozoa, SPACA6 typically disappears from the mature spermatozoa, whereas the IZUMO1 protein remains, except in <italic>Izumo1</italic>-null spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, loss of SPACA6 was recovered by <italic>Izumo1</italic> complementation (<italic>Izumo1</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Izumo1</italic>-TG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, IZUMO1 and SPACA6 are likely to be cooperative factors.

In this context, it is interesting that DCST1 has a ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that precise temporal expression of putative substrates negatively regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation by DCST1/2 during spermatogenesis has to be required for SPACA6 protein stability, which could have been impaired in the <italic>Dcst1/2</italic> complementation.</p><p>It should be emphasized that DCST1/2 are the first identified well-conserved factors from human to nematode or fruit fly that are actively involved in gamete recognition and fusion. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms underlining gamete recognition and fusion are still unknown, new insight into molecular behavior and interaction through DCST1 and DCST2 involvement would greatly advance our understanding of elaborate common molecular mechanisms in mysterious fertilization in a sexually reproducing organism.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dcst1/2</italic> KO</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Deposited in RIKEN BRC (ID RBRC05733)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dcst1</italic> KO</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Deposited in RIKEN BRC (ID RBRC10275)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dcst2</italic> KO</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Deposited in RIKEN BRC (ID RBRC10366)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Spaca6</italic> KO</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Deposited in RIKEN BRC (ID RBRC10367)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Izumo1</italic> KO</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue et al., 2005</xref></td><td>RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI_3576518">MGI_3576518</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dcst1</italic> TG</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Deposited in RIKEN BRC (ID RBRC05856)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Dcst2</italic> TG</td><td>This article</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Izumo1</italic> TG</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue et al., 2005</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse SPACA6 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>(WB: 1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse IZUMO1 (rat monoclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inoue et al., 2013</xref></td><td>Mab125</td><td>Gift from Dr. Ikawa <break/>(IF: 0.5 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse IZUMO1 (rat monoclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Inoue et al., 2015</xref></td><td>Mab18</td><td>(WB: 1 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse FR4 (JUNO) (rat monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>TH6, RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1027724">AB_1027724</ext-link></td><td>(IF: 0.25 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse CD9 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>MZ3, RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1279321">AB_1279321</ext-link></td><td>(IF: 0.5 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse EMMPRIN (BASIGIN) (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>G-19, RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2066959">AB_2066959</ext-link></td><td>(WB: 0.2 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Plasmid pX330 vector</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_42230">Addgene_42230</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Primers</td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Detailed in 'Materials and methods'</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>SPACA6<sub>46-139</sub></td><td>This article</td><td/><td>Detailed in 'Materials and methods'</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6, B6D2F1, and ICR mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) were purchased from Japan SLC Inc, and IZUMO1 knockout and transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>) were kindly provided by Osaka University.

The emerging picture is that the proteins required for the steps that culminate in sperm-egg fusion show surprising conservation. The first clear case was reported by Nishimura et al. (2015) Curr. Biol. 25: 3225 where they showed a portion of mouse Izumo1 protein can functional replace its SPE-45 ortholog in C.elegans and the resulting chimeric protein allows fertility in nematodes. A shortcoming of that work was that no clear connection of Izumo1/SPE-45 was established in insects. Earlier work in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> established that DC-STAMP proteins are important in their respective organisms and showed that promising homologs expressed in testes existed in mammals. The current work conclusively shows that knockout of the two DC-STAMP protein-encoding genes studied in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cause completely penetrant sterility in mice. This is a major advance and is currently the best example showing the surprising conservation of the fertilization machinery across nearly 1 billion years of animal evolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Fertilization requires several steps of sperm-egg interactions that culminate in fusion. Previously, mouse OC/DC-STAMP proteins were shown to be required for osteolastogenesis when mononucleated osteoclasts fuse to form multinucleated osteoclasts. In parallel, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> spe-42 and spe-49 genes were shown to encode multi-pass transmembrane proteins containing DC-STAMP &quot;domains&quot;. Loss of function in either spe-42 or spe49 leads to male infertility. These mutants belong to what is termed the spe-9 class of genes where mutant sperm have normal morphology, motility, migration to the site of fertilization and contact with oocytes, yet fusion/fertilization of gametes does not occur. In this manuscript Inoue et al. identify DC-STAMP domain-containing homologues of spe-42 and spe-49 as well as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sneaky (Snky) gene. These proteins are called DCST1 and DCST2. The authors created knockout mice for DCST1 and DCST2 and DCST<sub>1/2</sub> double knockout mice. In all cases males are completely or almost completely sterile with essentially the same mutant phenotype as the worm mutants (morphologically normal sperm that cannot fuse with the plasmamembrane of the egg. The authors also explore potential interactions with previously known mammalian fertilization molecules and find that DCST<sub>1/2</sub> status impacts the stability of the sperm immunoglobulin superfamily protein SPACA6. This paper will be of highly significant impact since it shows conserved sperm molecular functions with clear genetic validation between invertebrates (fly and worm) and mammals separated by about 700 million to one billion years of evolution from a common ancestor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66313.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please complete the following revisions to make your manuscript acceptable for publication in eLife:</p><p>Figure 1 of the paper shows protein alignments of DC-STAMP proteins DCST1 and DCST2 with humans, mouse, worms (SPE-42 and SPE-49) and the fly (Snky) (Figure 1A).
