All mutations are heterozygous and result in changes to one of two amino acids: arginine 132 in IDH1, or either arginine 172 or arginine 140 in IHD2. Wild-type IDH1 catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). The arginine mutations abolish its normal activity and instead mutant IDH1 and IDH2 reduce α-KG to generate the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ward et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn affects the function of multiple α-KG dependent dioxygenases, including the TET family of 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) hydroxylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7a">Kinney and Pradhan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">McKenney and Levine, 2013</xref>). In their <italic>Cancer Cell</italic> 2011 paper, Xu and colleagues examined the effects of excess production of 2-HG on downstream processes that could affect cancer progression. They showed that 2-HG could act as a competitive inhibitor for α-KG-dependent DNA demethylases, specifically Tet2. Ectopic expression of the mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2 inhibited histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. Examination of glioma samples from patients also showed that mutations in IDH1 were associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In Supplemental Figure 3I, Xu and colleagues demonstrated that transfection of U-87 MG cells with the mutant IDH1<sup>R132H</sup> increased the amount of 2-HG in the cells, as compared to transfection with wild-type IDH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). This is evidence that mutant IDH1 changes the physiological levels of 2-HG, and is replicated in Protocol 1.</p><p>Xu and colleagues first showed that 2-HG can occupy the same binding pocket as α-KG in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> KDM7A, indicating it acts as a competitive inhibitor of α-KG. Importantly, they also presented evidence that 2-HG may outcompete α-KG, since 2-HG levels affected many enzymatic functions normally dependent on α-KG. In Figure 3A, they treated U-87 MG cells with cell permeable versions of α-KG and 2-HG, and examined levels of histone methylation by Western Blot. Treatment with increasing amounts of 2-HG led to increases in H3K9me2 and H3K79me2, consistent with the idea that 2-HG inhibited histone demethylases. This effect was abolished by co-treatment with α-KG, confirming a competitive relationship between the two metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). This experiment is replicated in Protocol 2. Xu and colleagues also examined the effect of 2-HG on the TET family of 5 mC hydroxylases using an in vitro system of purified TET2 and double-stranded oligos containing a 5mC restriction digestion site in Figure 8A. Adding increasing concentrations of 2-HG abolished the ability of TET2 to convert 5 mC to 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 5.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating that the metabolite 2-HG can affect the activity of α-KG-dependent enzymes, Xu and colleagues showed that treatment with mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2 resulted in similar outcomes. In Figure 3D, they transfected U-87 MG cells with IDH1<sup>R132H</sup> and assessed levels of histone methylation by Western blot. Transfection with IDH1<sup>R132H</sup> increased histone methylation, and treatment with α-KG abolished this increase in histone methylation, consistent with the idea that α-KG and 2-HG are competitive metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3. In Figure 7B, they also examined TET activity in the presence of mutant IDH1. While 5hmC levels are normally undetectable in HEK293 cells, transfection with TET catalytic domain (CD)-expressing plasmids increased 5hmC levels to detectable amounts. Co-transfection of TET-CD and wild-type IDH1 or IDH2 increased levels of 5hmC, as expected, while co-transfection of TET-CD with mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2 decreased 5hmC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). This experiment is replicated in Protocol 4.</p><p>The work of Xu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), along with work from Figueroa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>) and Lu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lu et al., 2012</xref>), has generated much interest in the role of altered metabolites in the changing methylation patterns seen in various types of cancer. Using a different cell line than Xu and colleagues, Lu and colleagues demonstrated that mutations in IDH2, similar to mutations in IDH1, also generated abnormal levels of 2-HG which correlated with increased global methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Kernystsky and colleagues, Duncan and colleagues and Turcan and colleague have also shown that expression of exogenous mutated IDH genes in immortalized human cancer cell lines or in erythroid progenitor cells caused increased production of 2HG and increased levels of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Duncan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Turcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kernytsky et al., 2015</xref>). Sasaki and colleagues extended these inquiries by generating conditional knock-in IDH1 mutant mice. These mice displayed elevated serum levels of 2HG and similar patterns of hypermethylation as observed in AML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). Akbay and colleagues generated IDH2 mutant mice and also observed an increase in global methylation in heart tissue. They also demonstrated that mice carrying IDH mutant xenograft tumors displayed higher serum levels of 2HG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbay et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, 2-HG production has also been associated with MYC activation in some breast cancers, which also displayed increased levels of methylation as compared to tumors with lower levels of 2-HG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Terunuma et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), Irwin Davidson (Reviewing editor), and four reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers of this paper have raised several issues and we would ask you to specifically take into account the comments concerning the statistical analyses.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article outlines the detailed protocol to reproduce a report published in <italic>Cancer</italic> Cell linking mutations in IDH1/2 to cellular levels of Ketoglutarate and changes in histone and DNA methylation. This initial work had a major impact on linking metabolites to chromatin, but also raised a number of questions that justify a rigorous replication.</p><p>Overall, the proposed study covers the major aspects with the required detail and rigour.</p><p>Specific points to address are:</p><p>1) The referees suggest that the authors consider using mass spectrometry to measure 5hmC in addition to immune dot-blot. Mass spectrometry is a more quantitative measure and while it would go beyond replicating the published findings it might give a clearer answer.</p><p>2) In protocol 1 a 2-way ANOVA is proposed, however as 2 quantitative variables are measured and there is only one qualitative factor (with three possible values) influencing these measures, an MANOVA would be more suited.</p><p>3) There may be confusion between groups and variables in setting the degrees of freedom for ANOVA analyses. In protocol 1, how was (2, 6) obtained? The same question applies to protocols 3, 4 and 5.</p><p>4) In addition to <italic>t</italic>-tests for the comparison of means where both variances are equal, F-tests should be added when variances are significantly different.</p><p>5) Referees raised concerns about null variances that appear in the power calculation tables. Although these values are not always available, variance values can change the conclusion of the tests. When variances are not available, preliminary experiments in order to estimate them are proposed. More generally, variance values used in this paper are estimated from published figures using a low number of replicates, so they are not robust. A way to increase robustness would be to increase measured values by a pre-determined factor and then relax the expected power if too many replicates are required.</p><p>Also, non-rounded computed sample sizes are requested to have an idea of how close we are to the theoretical value after rounding.</p><p>6) For protocol 2, in subsection “Confirmatory analysis plan”, a MANOVA is proposed, whereas a one-way ANOVA is suggested for the same protocol in subsection “Test family”. Please correct this inconsistency.</p><p>7) Protocol 5: a mean across several groups is compared with the mean of a single group. This should not be done with a simple <italic>t</italic>-test to take into account the fact that the number of measures is different in the two groups being compared.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07420.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The referees suggest that the authors consider using mass spectrometry to measure 5hmC in addition to immune dot-blot. Mass spectrometry is a more quantitative measure and while it would go beyond replicating the published findings it might give a clearer answer</italic>.</p><p>We agree mass spectrometry analysis would be a more quantitative approach to measure 5hmC levels, however feel it is beyond the scope of this project, which is to perform a direct replication of the original experiment(s). Aspects of an experiment not included in the original study are occasionally added to ensure the quality of the research, but by no means is a requirement of this project; rather, it is an extension of the original work. We know that the exclusion of certain experiments limits the scope of what can be analyzed by the project, but we are attempting to identify a balance of breadth of sampling for general inference with sensible investment of resources on replication projects to determine to what extent the included experiments are reproducible.</p><p><italic>2) In protocol 1 a 2-way ANOVA is proposed, however as 2 quantitative variables are measured and there is only one qualitative factor (with three possible values) influencing these measures, an MANOVA would be more suited.</italic></p><p>We agree and have included this in the confirmatory analysis section. However, as we do not have the raw data needed to perform a power calculation for the MANOVA test, we performed it with a 2-way ANOVA to estimate the needed sample size and adjusted the alpha error for the planned contrasts that will be performed to ensure the sample size is sufficient.</p><p><italic>3) There may be confusion between groups and variables in setting the degrees of freedom for ANOVA analyses. In protocol 1, how was (2, 6) obtained? The same question applies to protocols 3, 4 and 5</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for catching these inconsistencies, we have checked and adjusted each protocol in regards to degrees of freedom. Some of the analysis sections have changed to address other questions below, but a link to all scripts has been provided below and in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In addition to</italic> t<italic>-tests for the comparison of means where both variances are equal, F-tests should be added when variances are significantly different</italic>.</p><p>We have added a note in the analysis section that at the time of analysis, we will assess the normality and homoscedasticity of the data. If necessary, we will perform the appropriate transformation in order to proceed with the proposed statistical analysis. We will note any changes or transformations made. We have updated the manuscript to address this point.</p><p><italic>5) Referees raised concerns about null variances that appear in the power calculation tables.

In many cases the reason for the null variance was due to normalization to a common factor within each replicate – thus making the variance zero on purpose. In some cases we will need to repeat this as well (protocol 3, 4, and 5). In other cases (protocol 1 and 2) we used the other variances that were reported as an estimate for the null variances. And where possible (protocol 2) we included additional analysis to allow a direct comparison to the original analysis.</p><p>Full details of all power calculations are available through the study’s page on the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gnsti/?view_only=f3a48d5a355f429fa2264ee7c17e9705">https://osf.io/gnsti/?view_only=f3a48d5a355f429fa2264ee7c17e9705</ext-link>). Unfortunately, the program we use to calculate sample sizes, G*Power, only returns whole integers for recommended sample sizes.</p><p><italic>6) For protocol 2, in subsection “Confirmatory analysis plan”, a MANOVA is proposed, whereas a one-way ANOVA is suggested for the same protocol in subsection “Test family”. Please correct this inconsistency</italic>.</p><p>The Confirmatory analysis plan is in reference to the proposed statistical analyses of the replication data. However, as we do not have the raw data needed to perform a power calculation for the MANOVA test, we performed it with a 2-way ANOVA to estimate the needed sample size and adjusted the alpha error for the planned contrasts that will be performed to ensure the sample size is sufficient.</p><p><italic>7) Protocol 5: a mean across several groups is compared with the mean of a single group. This should not be done with a simple</italic> t<italic>-test to take into account the fact that the number of measures is different in the two groups being compared</italic>.</p><p>We had originally intended to perform a weighted planned contrast by comparing several groups to a single group – and agree an F test is properly suited. However, in the revised manuscript we are including multiple independent <italic>t</italic>-tests and one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (due to the necessary normalization described in point 5 above) to more thoroughly analyze the data as originally reported and interpreted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
