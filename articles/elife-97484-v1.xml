Consequently, they have been extensively studied for more than half a century. Based on the ATP-dependent ammonium assimilation generating glutamine, GS expression and activity are strictly regulated in all organisms. In the methanogenic archaeon <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, it has been shown that the metabolite 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) directly induces the GS activity. Besides, modulation of the activity by interaction with small proteins (GlnK<sub>1</sub> and sP26) has been reported. Here, we show that the strong activation of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GS (GlnA<sub>1</sub>) by 2-OG is based on the 2-OG dependent dodecamer assembly of GlnA<sub>1</sub> by using mass photometry (MP) and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of purified strep-tagged GlnA<sub>1</sub>. The dodecamer assembly from dimers occurred without any detectable intermediate oligomeric state and was not affected in the presence of GlnK<sub>1</sub>. The 2.39 Å cryo-EM structure of the dodecameric complex in the presence of 12.5 mM 2-OG demonstrated that 2-OG is binding between two monomers. Thereby, 2-OG appears to induce the dodecameric assembly in a cooperative way. Furthermore, the active site is primed by an allosteric interaction cascade caused by 2-OG-binding towards an adaption of an open active state conformation. In the presence of additional glutamine, strong feedback inhibition of GS activity was observed. Since glutamine dependent disassembly of the dodecamer was excluded by MP, feedback inhibition most likely relies on the binding of glutamine to the catalytic site. Based on our findings, we propose that under nitrogen limitation the induction of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GS into a catalytically active dodecamer is not affected by GlnK<sub>1</sub> and crucially depends on the presence of 2-OG.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Methanosarcina mazei</kwd><kwd>glutamine synthetase</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>2-oxoglutarate</kwd><kwd>nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schm1052/20-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmitz</surname><given-names>Ruth Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHU 3364/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuller</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/101075992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuller</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The central nitrogen-metabolite 2-oxoglutarate directly promotes glutamine synthetase activity by inducing its dodecameric assembly and priming the active sites, representing a novel mechanism of regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen is one of the key elements in life and it is essentially required in the form of ammonium for biomolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. Two major pathways of ammonium assimilation in bacteria and archaea are known. Under nitrogen (N) sufficiency, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is active and generates glutamate from 2-OG and ammonium (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Heeswijk et al., 2013</xref>). Under N limitation however, low ammonium concentrations lead to an inactive GDH as a result of its low ammonium affinity, whereas the expression of GS is strongly induced in response to N limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunka and Commichau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stadtman, 2001</xref>). Consequently, under low ammonium conditions, GS together with glutamate synthase (GOGAT) are responsible for ammonium assimilation via the GS/GOGAT pathway, one of the major intersections in central carbon and N metabolism. Accordingly, GS present across all domains of life plays a central role in cellular N assimilation under low N availability. The enzyme, its structure, and regulation have been investigated in detail in different organisms for more than half a century (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">dos Santos Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stadtman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolfolk and Stadtman, 1967</xref>).</p><p>Most of the GS are grouped into three major classes based on their monomeric size and oligomerization properties (overview in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">dos Santos Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). GSI and GSIII, both found in bacteria and archaea, mostly form dodecamers, whereas GSII found in Eukaryotes form decamers of smaller subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">dos Santos Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valentine et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Rooyen et al., 2011</xref>). The GSI class can be further grouped into Iα-type GS and Iβ-type GS based on their amino acid sequence and respective molecular mechanisms of activity regulation. Iß-type GS contain a conserved adenylylation site (Tyr397 residue near the active site), that allows for covalent modification of Iβ-type GS and leads to inactivation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magasanik, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shapiro and Stadtman, 1970</xref>). Iα-type GS on the other hand are not covalently modified and mainly show feedback inhibition by end products of the glutamine metabolism, including glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunka and Commichau, 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>GS regulation on transcriptional level</title><p>Since in contrast to GDH, GS-catalyzed generation of glutamine requires ATP, most organisms strictly regulate the expression of GS in response to the nitrogen availability on the transcriptional level. In gram-negative bacteria, mainly transcriptional activation of the coding gene (<italic>glnA</italic>) under low nitrogen availability occurs via a transcriptional activator (e.g. NtrC in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>). For several gram-positive bacteria however, the mechanism of regulation is a de-repression of <italic>glnA</italic> transcription under N limitation, which has also been shown for methanoarchaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen-Kupiec et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fedorova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher and Wray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hauf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weidenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weidenbach et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas in gram positives the signal perception is complex and often also involves protein interactions of GS with transcriptional regulators (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunka and Commichau, 2012</xref>), signal perception and transduction in methanoarchaea occurs directly via the small effector molecule 2-OG, which increases under N limitation. It has been shown that binding of 2-OG to the global N repressor protein NrpR significantly changes the repressor conformation resulting in dissociation from its respective operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weidenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wisedchaisri et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to expression regulation, the activity of GS is also strictly regulated in all organisms in response to changing N availabilities, however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of inhibition significantly differ for the various GS classes and in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reitzer, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Regulation of GS activity: Highly diverse and often complex in various organisms</title><p>An extensive repertoire of cellular control mechanisms regulating GS activity in response to N availability has been observed in different organisms. Inhibitory mechanisms in response to an N upshift range from feedback inhibition by e.g. glutamine or other end products of the glutamine metabolism (e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stadtman, 2004</xref>), <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deuel et al., 1970</xref>), yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Legrain et al., 1982</xref>), proteolytic degradation (yeast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Legrain et al., 1982</xref>), covalent modification by adenylylation of the 1ß-type GS subunits (e.g. enterobacteriaceae), thiol-based GS regulation (e.g. in soybean nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masalkar and Roberts, 2015</xref>), inhibition by regulatory proteins (e.g. in gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Travis et al., 2022</xref>), inhibition by interactions with small proteins (e.g. inhibitory factors in cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">García-Domínguez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klähn et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klähn et al., 2018</xref>), to directly effecting the activity through the presence or absence of the small metabolite 2-OG, which has been shown for the first time for <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, often several of the different regulatory mechanisms for GS activity are reported for one organism. For example, yeast GS (ScGS) is regulated via feedback inhibition by glutamine and additionally is susceptible to proteolytic degradation under N starvation. It was also found to assemble into nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2009</xref>) and under advanced cellular starvation into inactive filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the activity of the Iß-type GS (EcGS) is controlled by cumulative feedback inhibition and covalent modification (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reitzer, 2003</xref>). It has been shown that each of the 12 subunits can be modified by adenylylation (Tyr397) resulting in an inactivation of the respective subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stadtman, 1990</xref>). Moreover, the adenlylylation of single subunits makes the other subunits more susceptible to cumulative feedback inhibition by various substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stadtman, 1990</xref>). These substances either bind the glutamine-binding pocket or have an allosteric binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liaw et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolfolk and Stadtman, 1967</xref>). The dodecameric structure of EcGS has been known for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almassy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamashita et al., 1989</xref>). However, when artificially exposed to divalent cations (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>), it randomly aggregates and produces long hexagonal tubes (paracrystalline aggregates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valentine et al., 1968</xref>). The detailed structural information on the mechanisms of this reversible GS-filament formation to an inactive form of EcGS, often associated with stress responses, has only recently been described by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GS has been shown to be feedback regulated. In addition, binding of the transcriptional repressor GlnR to the feedback inhibited complex not only activates the transcription repression function of GlnR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher and Wray, 2008</xref>), but also stabilizes the inactive GS conformation potentially changing from a dodecamer into a tetradecameric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Travis et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>M. mazei,</italic> a mesophilic methanoarchaeon which is able to fix N<sub>2</sub>, regulation of the central N metabolism has been studied extensively on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jäger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prasse and Schmitz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Veit et al., 2005</xref>). A central role of 2-OG for the perception of changes in N availabilities has been proposed, as has been demonstrated for cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forchhammer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrero et al., 2001</xref>). The activity of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GS, encoded by <italic>glnA<sub>1</sub></italic>, is regulated by several different mechanisms. GlnA<sub>1</sub> is not covalently modified in response to N availability and thus represents an Iα-type-GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>). It has been proposed, that GlnA<sub>1</sub> is directly activated under N starvation by the high intracellular concentrations of the metabolite 2-OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>). 2-OG represents the internal signal for N limitation, since the internal 2-OG level significantly increases due to missing consumption by GDH under N starvation (<italic>M. mazei</italic> contains the oxidative TCA part, anabolic). The increased cellular 2-OG concentration has been shown to be directly perceived by GlnA<sub>1</sub>, most likely by direct binding resulting in strong activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>). Besides, we showed first evidence that two small proteins interact with <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub>, the PII-like protein GlnK<sub>1</sub> and small protein sP26 comprising 23 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutt et al., 2021</xref>). The presence and potential interaction of both small proteins showed small effects on the GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity. However, those small effects might be neglectable compared to the strong 2-OG stimulation, particularly taking into account that the indirect GS activity assay shows high deviations in the low activity range. Moreover, initial complex formation analysis by a pull-down approach indicated that in the absence of 2-OG, the GlnA<sub>1</sub>/GlnK<sub>1</sub> complexes are more stable than in the presence of high 2-OG. This led to the conclusion that due to the shift to N sufficiency after a period of N limitation, GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity is reduced due to the lower 2-OG concentration, but also due to a potential inhibitory protein interaction with GlnK<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>). Very recently, the first structural analysis of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> was reported, showing GS complexes with GlnK<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>). Based on their findings, Schumacher et al. propose a regulation of GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity by oligomeric modulation, with GlnK<sub>1</sub> stabilizing the dodecameric structure and the formation of GlnA<sub>1</sub> active sites. Since that work is entirely missing the effects of 2-OG on GlnA<sub>1</sub> structure and activity, we here aimed to study the regulation of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> in more detail by evaluating oligomerization and complex formation between GlnA<sub>1</sub>, GlnK<sub>1</sub> and sP26 in dependence of 2-OG. This was achieved by employing mass photometry (MP), allowing the measurement of the molecular weight distribution of single complexes in solution, and by high resolution cryo-EM, whilst also performing activity assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2-OG is responsible for GlnA<sub>1</sub>-dodecamer formation in <italic>M. mazei</italic></title><p>The strep-tagged purified GlnA<sub>1</sub> was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the presence of 12.5 mM 2-OG, demonstrating that GS is exclusively present in a dodecameric structure, no other oligomers were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To investigate the effects of 2-OG on <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> in more detail, we employed MP, a method that allows to measure the molecular weight distribution of particles in solution. Strep-tagged purified GlnA<sub>1</sub> (after SEC) was dialyzed into a 2-OG free HEPES buffer (see Materials and Methods) and subsequently analyzed by MP, demonstrating that in the presence of low 2-OG concentrations (0.1 mM) all of the <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> was nearly exclusively present as dimers with no higher molecular weight complexes present. After the addition of 12.5 mM 2-OG, the size distribution shifted towards a higher molecular weight complex of 630–700 kDa (calculated based on the measured dimer size in each measurement; expected molecular weight of dodecamer: 634 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This molecular weight corresponds to a fully assembled dodecamer species, the same oligomeric structure that is adapted in GS from other prokaryotes. Using 2-OG concentrations varying between 0.1 and 12.5 mM, complex analysis showed that up to 62% of all particles were assembled in a dodecamer. This allowed to determine the effective concentration of 2-OG for dodecamer assembly to be EC50=0.75 ± 0.01 mM 2-OG (based on two biological replicates, calculated with the percentage of dodecamer) as described in Materials and Methods, and further verified that no other intermediate oligomeric complexes were detectable during dodecameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Notably, GlnA<sub>1</sub> did not reach 100% dodecamer assembly after removal and re-addition of 2-OG, although only dodecameric GlnA<sub>1</sub> was used for dialysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). We conclude that GlnA<sub>1</sub> is rather unstable in the absence of 2-OG and some of the protein lost its ability to oligomerize after 2-OG was removed by dialysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GlnA<sub>1</sub>-dodecamer assembly is induced by 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) without detectable oligomeric intermediates.</title><p>Oligomerization states of purified strep-tagged GlnA<sub>1</sub> were assessed in dependence of 2-OG by mass photometry as described in MM using a Refeyn TwoMP mass photometer (Refeyn Ltd., Oxford, UK).

The EC50 for GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity was determined to be 6.3 mM 2-OG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Moreover, most likely in addition to the dodecameric assembly, 2-OG is required for a further 2-OG-induced conformational switch of the active site, since saturated GlnA<sub>1</sub> activities are not reached in the presence of 5 mM 2-OG, when most of the GlnA<sub>1</sub> is in a dodecameric structure.

Consequently, we next tested the effects of GlnK<sub>1</sub> on GlnA<sub>1</sub> oligomerization in the presence of 2-OG. Performing the MP analysis under the tested conditions as before but in the presence of purified GlnK<sub>1</sub>, demonstrated that (i) in the absence of 2-OG varying ratios between GlnA<sub>1</sub> and GlnK<sub>1</sub> (20:1, 2:1, 2:10 calculated based on monomer mass) did not result in any dodecamer assembly of GlnA<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), (ii) no difference in the GlnA<sub>1</sub> dodecameric assembly in the presence of 2-OG was obtained in the presence of purified GlnK<sub>1</sub> (ratio 2:1), (iii) nor was binding of GlnK<sub>1</sub> to GlnA<sub>1</sub> detected by a respective increase in the mass of the higher oligomeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

R87' and its loop undergo a dramatic flip to coordinate 2-OG and D170 of helix α3 (residues 167–181) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This, combined with the action of other coordinating residues, initiates a motion that is propagated through the entire protein. Notably, helix α3 shifts forward, causing F184 to flip over and facilitate a T-shaped aromatic interaction with F202. The resulting pull on F202 causes F204 to flip, allowing π-stacking with the purine moiety of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This series of structural changes primes the active site for ATP binding by already adopting the side chain conformations that are observed in analog (Met-Sox-P-ADP)-bound structure (transition state) (PDB: 8tfk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>), thus facilitating nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the D50' loop adopts a position similar to the transition state in a catalytic competent conformation.

In addition, Asp 57' moves deeper into the binding site, facilitating the proton abstraction of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and preparing for its attack on the phosphorylated glutamate. Similar to the ATP/ADP binding site, these catalytic elements are primed to ideally stabilize the tetrahedral open active state.

Here, we demonstrated the importance of 2-OG as the major regulator of <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity by using independent methods, MP and cryo-EM, to detect and structurally characterize single complexes with high resolution and quantify different oligomeric states of GlnA<sub>1</sub>. We have found mainly dimeric GlnA<sub>1</sub> (apo GlnA<sub>1</sub>) to be inactive and crucially require 2-OG to form an active dodecameric complex. Moreover, this dodecameric conformation is the only active state of GlnA<sub>1</sub>. In the first step, 2-OG assembles the dodecamer by binding at the interface of two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and functions as a molecular glue between neighboring subunits. The assembly upon 2-OG addition observed using MP appears to be cooperative, fast, and without any detectable intermediate states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Only immediately after thawing a frozen purified GlnA, and in case no additional SEC was performed prior to MP analysis, samples showed additional octameric complexes in MP with low abundancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, octameric complexes were never observed in cryo-EM or detected by SEC analysis of frozen purified GlnA<sub>1</sub> samples. Consequently, octamers are most likely broken or disassembled GlnA<sub>1</sub>-dodecamers or dead-ends in assembly with no physiological function, rather than an incomplete dodecamer during assembly. Thus, our findings are contrary to the assembly model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>.</p><p>As a second step of activation, the allosteric binding of 2-OG causes a series of conformational changes in GlnA<sub>1</sub> protomers, which prime the active site for the transition state and hence catalysis of the enzyme. This conformational change of the ATP-binding pocket of the dodecameric GlnA<sub>1</sub> upon 2-OG binding goes hand in hand with the observed increased activity at higher 2-OG concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparing our 2-OG-bound GlnA<sub>1</sub> dodecameric structure and the dodecameric <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> transition state (PDB: 8tfk) and apo structures (PDB: 8ftb) reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>, clearly demonstrates that 2-OG transfers GlnA<sub>1</sub> into its open active state conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The conformation of our 2-OG-bound dodecamer resembled the transition state conformation (ADP-Met-Sox-bound complex) reported by Schumacher et al., even though in our case no ATP was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A reconfiguration of the active site upon 2-OG-binding has also been reported for GS in <italic>Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2024</xref>). In this report, which does not delineate dodecamer assembly at all, it was demonstrated that binding of 2-OG in one protomer-protomer interface of a dodecameric GS causes a cooperative domino effect in the hexameric ring of <italic>M. thermolithotrophicus</italic> GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2024</xref>). A 2-OG bound protomer undergoes a conformational change and thereby induces the same shift in its neighboring protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2024</xref>). This is comparable to our observed cooperativity of <italic>M. mazei</italic> dodecamer assembly at low 2-OG concentrations (EC50=0.75 mM, calculated based on the percentage of dodecamer). On the other hand, <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> reaches maximal activity only at much higher 2-OG concentrations (EC50=6.3 mM 2-OG) and likely requires a fully 2-OG-occupied dodecamer for maximal activity. The difference between the two EC50 values strongly points towards the dodecamer assembly being induced by only one 2-OG per hexameric ring, whilst the maximum activity requires one 2-OG in every 2-OG binding site (in agreement with roughly sixfold higher EC50). The here obtained high activities by 2-OG saturation (up to 9 U/mg), in comparison with previously described <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> activities in the absence of 2-OG in a significantly lower range (mU/mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>), support our conclusion that 2-OG is substantial for the GlnA<sub>1</sub> active state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity is further regulated by feedback inhibition, small proteins, and possibly filament formation</title><p><italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub> belongs to the group of Iα-type GS, which are known to be feedback inhibited.

Moreover, in previous reports, GlnK<sub>1</sub> was shown to interact with GlnA<sub>1</sub> in vivo after a nitrogen upshift by pull-down approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehlers et al., 2005</xref>), pointing towards an inhibitory function of GlnK<sub>1</sub> under shifting conditions from N limitation to N sufficiency. However, in the present study, neither an interaction with GlnK<sub>1</sub>, nor GlnK<sub>1</sub> effects on GlnA<sub>1</sub> complex formation analyzed by MP, nor an effect of GlnK<sub>1</sub> on GlnA<sub>1</sub> activity was detectable under the conditions used at varying 2-OG concentrations (0.1–12.5 mM) and ratios of GlnK<sub>1</sub> to GlnA<sub>1</sub> (20:1, 2:1, 2:10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the addition of GlnK<sub>1</sub> did not result in a change of the EC50 of 2-OG for the dodecamer GlnA<sub>1</sub> assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, we could not determine a cryo-EM structure including sP26 despite adding a large excess of the small protein either obtained by co-expression or by addition of a synthetic peptide. Because these attempts were unsuccessful, we speculate that yet unknown cellular factor(s) might be required for an interaction of GlnA<sub>1</sub> with both small proteins, GlnK<sub>1</sub> and sP26, which however is difficult to simulate under in vitro conditions with purified proteins. Taking this into account, we speculate about a potential function of the two small proteins beyond GlnA<sub>1</sub> inactivation or activation. Since the GlnA<sub>1</sub> reaction is coupled to the GOGAT reaction (GS/GOGAT system) and the products of the two reactions replenish the substrates for one other, it is tempting to speculate that GlnA<sub>1</sub> and GOGAT experience metabolic coupling by sP26 and/or GlnK<sub>1</sub>, e.g., by being involved in recruiting or separating GOGAT from GlnA<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Finally, higher oligomeric states of GS enzymes have been known for a long time for organisms like yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valentine et al., 1968</xref>).

Neither in cyanobacteria, enterobacteria or <italic>Bacillus</italic> has 2-OG been reported as the sole direct activator of the enzyme, nor is complex (dis-)assembly a mode of regulating GS activity in any other of these model organisms. This is further supported by the absence of up to three of those four arginines, which are coordinating 2-OG in <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA<sub>1</sub>, in these organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The analysis of the acquired data was performed with the DiscoverMP software by applying a pre-measured standard (Refeyn Ltd., Oxford, UK). Counts were visualized in mass histograms as relative counts, which were calculated for the Gaussian fits of the measured peaks. For the determination of EC50-values and creating sigmoidal fitted curves, RStudio (RStudio Team (2020). RStudio: Integrated Development for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA URL) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cryo-electron sample preparation and data collection</title><p>Purified GS at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL was rapidly applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil grids, blotted with force 4 for 3.5 s, and vitrified by directly plunging in liquid ethane (cooled by liquid nitrogen) using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) at 100% humidity and 4 °C. To overcome the preferred orientation bias, 0.7 mM CHAPSO was added to prevent water-air interface interactions, consequently the concentration of the protein was increased to 6 mg/ml. We added purified commercially synthesized sP26 (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany) to all samples, but the peptide did not stably bind under the observed conditions. Data was acquired with EPU in EER-format on an FEI Titan Krios G4 (Cryo-EM Platform, Helmholtz Munich) equipped with a Falcon IVi detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) with a total electron dose of ~55 electrons per Å<sup>2</sup> and a pixel size of 0.76 Å. Micrographs were recorded in a defocus range of –0.25 to –2.0 μm.

Micrographs were processed on the fly (motion correction, CTF estimation). Using blob picker, 878,308 particles were picked, 2D-classified, and used for ab initio reconstruction. Iterative rounds of ab initio and heterogenous refinement were used to clean the particle stacks.

While previous studies have indicated 2-OG's ability to enhance GS activity, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Initially, the authors utilized biophysical characterization, primarily employing a nanomolar-scale detection method called mass photometry, to explore the molecular assembly of Methanosarcina mazei GS (M. mazei GS) in the absence or presence of 2-OG. Similar to other GS enzymes, the target M. mazei GS forms a stable dodecamer, with two hexameric rings stacked in tail-to-tail interactions. Despite approximately 40% of M. mazei GS existing as monomeric or dimeric entities in the detectable solution, the majority spontaneously assemble into a dodecameric state. Upon mixing 2-OG with M. mazei GS, the population of the dodecameric form increases proportionally with the concentration of 2-OG, indicating that 2-OG either promotes or stabilizes the assembly process. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals that 2-OG is positioned near the interface of two hexameric rings. At a resolution of 2.39 Å, the cryo-EM map vividly illustrates 2-OG forming hydrogen bonds with two individual GS subunits as well as with solvent water molecules. Moreover, local sidechain reorientation and conformational changes of loops in response to 2-OG further delineate the 2-OG-stabilized assembly of M. mazei GS.</p><p>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:</p><p>The investigation studies into the impact of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) on the assembly of Methanosarcina mazei glutamine synthetase (M mazei GS). Utilizing cutting-edge mass photometry, the authors scrutinized the population dynamics of GS assembly in response to varying concentrations of 2-OG. Notably, the findings demonstrate a promising and straightforward correlation, revealing that dodecamer formation can be stimulated by 2-OG concentrations of up to 10 mM, although GS assembly never reaches 100% dodecamerization in this study. Furthermore, catalytic activities showed a remarkable enhancement, escalating from 0.0 U/mg to 7.8 U/mg with increasing concentrations of 2-OG, peaking at 12.5 mM. However, an intriguing gap arises between the incomplete dodecameric formation observed at 10 mM 2-OG, as revealed by mass photometry, and the continued increase in activity from 5 mM to 10 mM 2-OG for M mazei GS. This prompts questions regarding the inability of M mazei GS to achieve complete dodecamer formation and the underlying factors that further enhance GS activity within this concentration range of 2-OG.</p><p>Moreover, the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis provides additional support for the biophysical and biochemical characterization, elucidating the precise localization of 2-OG at the interface of two GS subunits within two hexameric rings. The observed correlation between GS assembly facilitated by 2-OG and its catalytic activity is substantiated by structural reorientations at the GS-GS interface, confirming the previously reported phenomenon of &quot;funnel activation&quot; in GS. However, the authors did not present the cryo-EM structure of M. mazei GS in complex with ATP and glutamate in the presence of 2-OG, which could have shed light on the differences in glutamine biosynthesis between previously reported GS enzymes and the 2-OG-bound M. mazei GS.</p><p>Furthermore, besides revealing the cryo-EM structure of 2-OG-bound GS, the study also observed the filamentous form of GS, suggesting that filament formation may be a universal stacking mechanism across archaeal and bacterial species. However, efforts to enhance resolution to investigate whether the stacked polymer is induced by 2-OG or other factors such as ions or metabolites were not undertaken by the authors, leaving room for further exploration into the mechanisms underlying filament formation in GS.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>My comments have been addressed adequately.</p><p>I recognize that determining the structure of the GS complex bound to ATP and/or other ligands would enhance this study by offering a more comprehensive understanding of 2-oxoglutarate-mediated dodecameric assembly and activation. However, I accept the authors' explanation for not including this aspect in the current work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97484.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The current manuscript investigates the effect of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) as modulator of glutamine synthetase (GS).

The previously recognized small proteins GlnK1 and Sp26 seem to play a subordinate role in GS regulation, which is in good agreement with previous data. Although these data are quite clear now, there remains one major open question: how does 2-OG further increase GS activity once the full dodecameric state is achieved (at 5 mM)? This point needs to be reconsidered.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not entirely clear, how very high 2-OG concentrations activate GS beyond dodecamer formation.</p><p>The data presented in this work are in stark contrast to the previously reported structure of M. mazei GS by the Schumacher lab. This is very confusing for the scientific community and requires clarification. The discussion should consider possible reasons for the contradictory results.</p><p>Importantly, it is puzzling how Schumacher could achieve an apo-structire of dodecameric GS? If 2-OG is necessary for dodecameric formation, this should be discussed. If GlnK1 doesn't form a complex with the dodecameric GS, how could such a complex be resolved there?</p><p>In addition, the text is in principle clear but could be improved by professional editing. Most obviously there is insufficient comma placement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for the professional evaluation and raising important points. We will address those comments in the updated manuscript and especially improve the discussion in respect to the two points of concern.</p><p>(1) How can GlnA1 activity further be stimulated with further increasing 2-OG after the dodecamer is already fully assembled at 5 mM 2-OG.</p><p>We assume a two-step requirement for 2-OG, the dodecameric assembly and the priming of the active sites. The assembly step is based on cooperative effects of 2-OG and does not require the presence of 2-OG in all 2-OG-binding pockets: 2-OG-binding to one binding pocket also causes a domino effect of conformational changes in the adjacent 2-OG-unbound subunit, as also described for <italic>Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus</italic> GS in Müller et al. 2023. Due to the introduction of these conformational changes, the dodecameric form becomes more favourable even without all 2-OG binding sites being occupied. With higher 2-OG concentrations present (&gt; 5mM), the activity increased further until finally all 2-OG-binding pockets were occupied, resulting in the priming of all active sites (all subunits) and thereby reaching the maximal activity.</p><p>(2) The contradictory results with previously published data on the structure of <italic>M. mazei</italic> by Schumacher et al. 2023.</p><p>We certainly agree that it is confusing that Schumacher et al. 2023 obtained a dodecameric structure without the addition of 2-OG, which we claim to be essential for the dodecameric form. 2-OG is a cellular metabolite that is naturally present in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the heterologous expression host both groups used. Since our main question focused on analysing the 2-OG effect on GS, we have performed thorough dialysis of the purified protein to remove all 2-OG before performing MP experiments. In the absence of 2-OG we never observed significant enzyme activity and always detected a fast disassembly after incubation on ice. We thus assume that a dodecamer without 2-OG in Schumacher et al. 2023 is an inactive oligomer of a once 2-OG-bound form, stabilized e.g. by the presence of 5 mM MgCl2.</p><p>The GlnA1-GlnK1-structure (crystallography) by Schumacher et al. 2023 is in stark contrast to our findings that GlnK1 and GlnA1 do not interact as shown by mass photometry with purified proteins. A possible reason for this discrepancy might be that at the high protein concentrations used in the crystallization assay, complexes are formed based on hydrophobic or ionic protein interactions, which would not form under physiological concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Herdering et al. introduced research on an archaeal glutamine synthetase (GS) from Methanosarcina mazei, which exhibits sensitivity to the environmental presence of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG).

Initially, the authors utilized biophysical characterization, primarily employing a nanomolar-scale detection method called mass photometry, to explore the molecular assembly of Methanosarcina mazei GS (M. mazei GS) in the absence or presence of 2-OG. Similar to other GS enzymes, the target M. mazei GS forms a stable dodecamer, with two hexameric rings stacked in tail-to-tail interactions. Despite approximately 40% of M. mazei GS existing as monomeric or dimeric entities in the detectable solution, the majority spontaneously assemble into a dodecameric state. Upon mixing 2-OG with M. mazei GS, the population of the dodecameric form increases proportionally with the concentration of 2-OG, indicating that 2-OG either promotes or stabilizes the assembly process. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals that 2-OG is positioned near the interface of two hexameric rings. At a resolution of 2.39 Å, the cryo-EM map vividly illustrates 2-OG forming hydrogen bonds with two individual GS subunits as well as with solvent water molecules. Moreover, local side-chain reorientation and conformational changes of loops in response to 2-OG further delineate the 2-OG-stabilized assembly of M. mazei GS.</p><p>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:</p><p>The investigation studies the impact of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) on the assembly of Methanosarcina mazei glutamine synthetase (M mazei GS). Utilizing cutting-edge mass photometry, the authors scrutinized the population dynamics of GS assembly in response to varying concentrations of 2-OG. Notably, the findings demonstrate a promising and straightforward correlation, revealing that dodecamer formation can be stimulated by 2-OG concentrations of up to 10 mM, although GS assembly never reaches 100% dodecamerization in this study. Furthermore, catalytic activities showed a remarkable enhancement, escalating from 0.0 U/mg to 7.8 U/mg with increasing concentrations of 2-OG, peaking at 12.5 mM. However, an intriguing gap arises between the incomplete dodecameric formation observed at 10 mM 2-OG, as revealed by mass photometry, and the continued increase in activity from 5 mM to 10 mM 2-OG for M mazei GS. This prompts questions regarding the inability of M mazei GS to achieve complete dodecamer formation and the underlying factors that further enhance GS activity within this concentration range of 2-OG.</p><p>Moreover, the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis provides additional support for the biophysical and biochemical characterization, elucidating the precise localization of 2-OG at the interface of two GS subunits within two hexameric rings. The observed correlation between GS assembly facilitated by 2-OG and its catalytic activity is substantiated by structural reorientations at the GS-GS interface, confirming the previously reported phenomenon of &quot;funnel activation&quot; in GS. However, the authors did not present the cryo-EM structure of M. mazei GS in complex with ATP and glutamate in the presence of 2-OG, which could have shed light on the differences in glutamine biosynthesis between previously reported GS enzymes and the 2-OG-bound M. mazei GS.</p><p>Furthermore, besides revealing the cryo-EM structure of 2-OG-bound GS, the study also observed the filamentous form of GS, suggesting that filament formation may be a universal stacking mechanism across archaeal and bacterial species. However, efforts to enhance resolution to investigate whether the stacked polymer is induced by 2-OG or other factors such as ions or metabolites were not undertaken by the authors, leaving room for further exploration into the mechanisms underlying filament formation in GS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the detailed assessment and valuable input. We will address those comments in the updated manuscript and clarify the message.</p><p>(1) The discrepancy of the dodecamer formation (max. at 5 mM 2-OG) and the enzyme activity (max. at 12.5 mM 2-OG). We assume that there are two effects caused by 2-OG: 1. cooperativity of binding (less 2-OG needed to facilitate dodecamer formation) and 2. priming of each active site. See also Reviewer #1 R.(1). We assume this is the reason why the activity of dodecameric GlnA1 can be further enhanced by increased 2-OG concentration until all catalytic sites are primed.</p><p>(2) The lack of the structure of a 2-OG and ATP-bound GlnA1. Although we strongly agree that this would be a highly interesting structure, it seems out of the scope of a typical revision to request new cryo-EM structures. We evaluate the findings of our present study concerning the 2-OG effects as important insights into the strongly discussed field of glutamine synthetase regulation, even without the requested additional structures.</p><p>(3) The observed GlnA1-filaments are an interesting finding. We certainly agree with the referee on that point, that the stacked polymers are potentially induced by 2-OG or ions. However, it is out of the main focus of this manuscript to further explore those filaments. Nevertheless, this observation could serve as an interesting starting point for future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review)</bold>:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The current manuscript investigates the effect of 2-oxoglutarate and the Glk1 protein as modulators of the enzymatic reactivity of glutamine synthetase. To do this, the authors rely on mass photometry, specific activity measurements, and single-particle cryo-EM data.</p><p>From the results obtained, the authors convey that glutamine synthetase from Methanosarcina mazei exists in a non-active monomeric/dimeric form under low concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate, and its oligomerization into a dodecameric complex is triggered by higher concentration of 2-oxoglutarate, also resulting in the enhancement of the enzyme activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Glutamine synthetase is a crucial enzyme in all domains of life. The dodecameric fold of GS is recurrent amongst prokaryotic and archaea organisms, while the enzyme activity can be regulated in distinct ways. This is a very interesting work combining protein biochemistry with structural biology.</p><p>The role of 2-OG is here highlighted as a crucial effector for enzyme oligomerization and full reactivity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Various opportunities to enhance the current state-of-the-art were missed. In particular, omissions of the ligand-bound state of GnK1 leave unexplained the lack of its interaction with GS (in contradiction with previous results from the authors). A finer dissection of the effect and role of 2-oxoglurate are missing and important questions remain unanswered (e.g. are dimers relevant during early stages of the interaction or why previous GS dodecameric structures do not show 2-oxoglutarate).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for the expert evaluation and inspiring criticism.</p><p>(1) Encouragement to examine ligand-bound states of GlnK1. We agree and plan to perform the suggested experiments exploring the conditions under which GlnA1 and GlnK1 might interact. We will perform the MP experiments in the presence of ATP. In GlnA1 activity test assays when evaluating the presence/effects of GlnK1 on GlnA1 activity, however, ATP was always present in high concentrations and still we did not observe a significant effect of GlnK1 on the GlnA1 activity.</p><p>(2) The exact role of 2-OG could have been dissected much better. We agree on that point and will improve the clarity of the manuscript. See also Reviewer #1 R.1.</p><p>(3) The lack of studies on dimers. This is actually an interesting point, which we did not consider during writing the manuscript. Now, re-analysing all our MP data in this respect, GlnA1 is likely a dimer as smallest species. Consequently, we will add more supplementary data which supports this observation and change the text accordingly.</p><p>(4) Previous studies and structures did not show the 2-OG. We assume that for other structures, no additional 2-OG was added, and the groups did not specifically analyse for this metabolite either. All methanoarchaea perform methanogenesis and contain the oxidative part of the TCA cycle exclusively for the generation of glutamate (anabolism) but not a closed TCA cycle enabling them to use internal 2-OG concentration as internal signal for nitrogen availability. In the case of bacterial GS from organisms with a closed TCA cycle used for energy metabolism (oxidation of acetyl CoA) like e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>, the formation of an active dodecameric GS form underlies another mechanism independent of 2-OG. In case of the recent <italic>M. mazei</italic> GS structures published by Schumacher et al. 2023, the dodecameric structure is probably a result from the heterologous expression and purification from <italic>E. coli</italic>. (See also Reviewer #1 R.2). One example of methanoarchaeal glutamine synthetases that do in fact contain the 2-OG in the structure, is Müller et al. 2023.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>L 141: 2-OG levels increase due to slowing GOGAT reaction (due to Gln limitation as a consequence of N-starvation)....

The GS activity assay used is the classical assay by Shapiro &amp; Stadtman 1970 and is a coupled optical test assay (coupling the ATP consumption of the GS activity to the oxidation of NADH by lactate dehydrogenase). Based on the coupled test assay the measurements of low activities show a high deviation. We now added this information in the revised MS respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L: 177: arguing about 2-OG affinities: more precisely, the 0.75 mM 2-OG is the EC50 concentration of 2-OG for triggering dodecameric formation; it might not directly reflect the total 2-OG affinity, since the affinity may be modulated by (anti)cooperative effects, or by additional sites... as there may be different 2-OG binding sites involved... (same in line 201)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable input. We changed KD to EC50 within the entire manuscript. Concerning possible additional 2-OG binding sites: we did not see any other 2-OG in the cryo-EM structure aside from the described one and we therefore assume that the one described in the manuscript is the main and only one. Considering the high amounts of 2-OG (12.5 mM) used in the structure, it is quite unlikely that additional 2-OG sites exist since they would have unphysiologically low affinities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this respect, instead of the rather poor assay shown in Figure 1D, a more detailed determination of catalytic activation by different 2-OG concentrations should be done (similar to 1A)...

Binding of 2-OG only occurs in one specific allosteric binding-site.

The differences in the forms of GS seen in SEC and MP suggest that GS can indeed form a stable dodecamer when the concentration of GS is high enough, as shown in Figure S1B. I strongly suggest using an additional biophysical method to explore the connection between GS and 2-OG in terms of both assembly and activity, to truly understand 2-OG's role in the process of assembly and catalysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if we did not present this clear enough, however the MP analysis of GlnA1 in the absence of 2-OG showed always (monomers/) dimers, dodecamers were only present in the presence of 2-OG. The SEC analysis in (Fig. 1 - Fig. Suppl. 2B). has been performed in the presence of 12.5 mM 2-OG, we realized this information is missing in the figure legend - we now added this in the revised version. The 2-OG is in addition visible in the Cryo EM structure. Thus, we do not agree to perform additional biophysical methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As for the other experimental findings, they appear satisfactory to me, and I have no reservations regarding the cryoEM data.</p><p>(1) Mass photometry is a fancy technique that uses only a tiny amount of protein to study how they come together. However, the concentration of the protein used in the experiment might be lower than what's needed for them to stick together properly. So, the authors saw a lot of single proteins or pairs instead of bigger groups. They showed in Figure S1B that the M. mazei GS came out earlier than a 440-kDa reference protein, indicating it's actually a dodecamer. But when they looked at the dodecamer fraction using mass photometry, they found smaller bits, suggesting the GS was breaking apart because the concentration used was too low. To fix this, they could try using a technique called analytic ultracentrifuge (AUC) with different amounts of 2-OG to see if they can spot single proteins or pairs when they use a bit more GS. They could also try another technique called SEC-MALS to do similar tests. If they do this, they could replace Figure 1A with new data showing fully formed GS dodecamers when they use the right amount of 2-OG.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this input. In MP we looked at dodecamer formation after removing the 2-OG entirely and re-adding it in the respective concentration. We think that GlnA1 is much more unstable in its monomeric/dimeric fraction and that the complete and harsh removal of 2-OG results in some dysfunctional protein which does not recover the dodecameric conformation after dialysis and re-addition of 2-OG. Looking at the dodecamer-peak right after SEC however, we exclusively see dodecamers, which is now included as an additional supplementary figure (Fig. 1 - Fig. Suppl. 2C). Consequently, we did not perform additional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Building on the last point, the estimated binding strength (Kd) between 2-OG and GS might be lower than it really is, because the GS often breaks apart from its dodecameric form in this experiment, even though 2-OG helps keep the pairs together, as seen with cryoEM. What if they used 5-10 times more GS in the mass photometry experiment? Would the estimated bond strength stay the same? Could they use AUC or other techniques like ITC to find out the real, not just estimated, strength of the bond?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the term KD is not suitable. We have changed the term KD to EC50 as suggested by reviewer #1, which describes the effective concentration required for 50 % dodecamer assembly. Furthermore, we disagree that the dodecamer breaks apart when the concentrations are as low as in MP experiments. The actual reason for the breaking is rather the harsh dialysis to remove all 2-OG before MP experiments. Right after SEC, the we exclusively see dodecamer in MP (Fig. 1 - Fig. Suppl. 2C). See also #2 (1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The fact that the GS hardly works without 2-OG is interesting. I tried to understand the experiment setup, but it wasn't clear as the protocol mentioned in the author's 2021 FEBS paper referred to an old paper from 1970. The &quot;coupled optical test assay&quot; they talked about wasn't explained well. I found other papers that used phosphometry assays to see how much ATP was used up. I suggest the authors give a better, more detailed explanation of their experiments in the methods section. Also, it's unclear why the GS activity keeps going up from 5 to 12.5 mM 2-OG, even though they said it's saturated. They suggested there might be another change happening from 5 to 12.5 mM 2-OG. If that's the case, they should try to get a cryo-EM picture of the GS with lots of 2-OG, both with and without ATP/glutamate (or the Met-Sox-P-ADP inhibitor), to see what's happening at a structural level during this change caused by 2-OG.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the GS assay was not explained in detail (since published and known for several years). However, we now added the more detailed description of the assay in the revised MS, which also measures the ATP used up by GS, but couples the generation of ADP to an optical test assay producing pyruvate from PEP with the generated ADP catalysed by pyruvate kinase present in the assay. This generated pyruvate is finally reduced to lactate by the present lactate dehydrogenase consuming NADH, the reduction of which is monitored at 340 nm.</p><p>The still increasing activity of GS after dodecamer formation (max. at 5 mM 2-OG) and the continuously increasing enzyme activity (max. at 12.5 mM 2-OG): See also public reviews, we assume that there are two effects caused by 2-OG: 1. cooperativity of binding (less 2-OG needed to facilitate dodecamer formation) and 2. priming of each active site.</p><p>The suggested additional experiments with and without ATP/Glutamate: Although we strongly agree that this would be a highly interesting structure, it seems out of the scope of a typical revision to request new cryo-EM structures.

After removing all 2-OG as we did before MP-experiments, GlnA1 doesn’t reach full dodecamers anymore when 2-OG is re-added. This is not because the 2-OG amount is not enough to trigger full assembly, but because the protein is much more unstable in the absence of 2-OG, so we predict that some GlnA1 breaks during dialysis.

GlnA1 is unstable without 2-OG and it was dialysed against buffer without 2-OG before MP measurements.

However, we would like to point out that, although not shown in the figure, GlnA1 is always mainly present as dimers as the smallest entity. As suggested earlier, we have added the amount of monomers/dimers to Figure 1A, which shows low monomer-counts at all 2-OG concentrations (Fig.1A).

Line 713 corresponds to Figure 1A, where we indeed plotted the percentage of dodecamer against the 2-OG-concentration. Thereby, the percentage of dodecamer corresponds to the percentage calculated from the Gaussian Fit of the MP-dodecamer-peak.

This is key to fully understand and connect the results to the previous observations. For example, if the GlnK1 used was bound to ADP but not to ATP, then the added 2-OG might indeed only be able to affect GlnA1 (leading to its activation/oligomerization). If this were true and according to the data reported, ADP would prevent GlnK1 from interacting with any oligomeric form of GlnA1. However, if GlnK1 bound to ATP is the form that interacts with GlnA1 (potentially validating previous results?) then, 2-OG would first bind to GlnK1 (assuming a higher affinity of 2-OG to GlnK1), eventually causing its release from GlnA1 followed by binding and activation of GlnA1.</p><p>These experiments need to be done as they are essential to further understand the process. Given the ability of the authors to produce the protein and run such assays, it is unclear why they were not done here. As written in line 203, in this case, &quot;under the conditions tested&quot; is not a good enough statement, considering what is known in the field and how many more conclusions could easily be taken from such a setup.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the encouragement to investigate the ligand-bound states of GlnK1. We agree and plan to perform the suggested mass photometry experiments exploring the conditions under which GlnA1 and GlnK1 might interact in future work. In GlnA1 activity test assays, when evaluating the presence/effects of GlnK1 on GlnA1 activity, however, ATP was always present in high concentrations and still we did not observe a significant effect of GlnK1 on the GlnA1 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2D legend claims that the graphic shows the percentage of dodecameric GlnA1 as a function of the concentration of 2-OG. This is not what the figure shows; Figure 2D shows the dodecamer/dimer (although legend claims monomer was used, in line 732) ratio as a function of 2-OG (stated in line 736!). If this is true, a ratio of 1 means 50 % of dodecamers and dimers co-exist. This appears to be the case when GlnK1 was added, while in the absence of GlnK1 higher ratios are shown for higher 2-OG concentration implying that about 3 times more dodecamers were formed than dimers. However, wouldn´t a 50 % ratio be physiologically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the partially incorrect and also misleading figure legend and corrected it. Indeed, the ratio of dodecamers and dimers is shown. Furthermore, we did not use monomeric GlnA1 (the smallest entity is mainly a dimer, see Fig 1A), however, the molarity was calculated based on the monomer-mass. Concerning the significance of the difference between the maximum ratio of GlnA1 and GlnK1: The ratio does appear higher, but this is mostly because adding large quantities of GlnK1 broadens all peaks at low molecular weight. This happens because the GlnK1 signal starts overlapping with the signal from GlnA1, leading to inflated GlnA1 dimer counts. We therefore do not think that this is biologically significant, especially as the activities do not differ under these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Is it possible that the uncleaved GlnA1 tag is preventing interaction with GlnK1? This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is of course a very important point. We however realized that Schumacher et al. also used an N-terminal His-tag, so we assume that the N-terminal tag is not hampering the interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 228: Please detail the reported discrepancies in rmsd between the current protein and the gram-negative enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences in rmsd between our <italic>M.mazei</italic> GlnA1 structure and the structure of gram-negative enzymes is caused by (a) sequence similarity: E.g. <italic>M.mazei</italic> GlnA1 compared to <italic>B.subtilis</italic> GlnA have a sequence percent identity of 58.47; (b) ligands in the structure: The <italic>B.Subtilis</italic> structure contains L-Methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate, a transition state inhibitor, while the <italic>M. mazei</italic> structure contains 2OG; (c) Methodology: The structural determination methods also contribute to these differences. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GlnA was determined using X-ray crystallography, while the <italic>M. mazei</italic> GlnA1 structure was resolved using Cryo-EM, where the protein behaves differently in ice compared to a crystal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 747: The figure title claims &quot;dimeric interface&quot; although the manuscript body only refers to &quot;hexameric interface&quot; or &quot;inter-hexamer interface&quot; (line 224).

The information seems missing in light of how the sentence is built.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. According to previous studies both residues are likely involved in proton abstraction - first from ammonium, and then from the formed gamma-ammonium group. Additionally, they contribute in shielding the active site from bulk solvent to prevent hydrolysis of the formed phospho-glutamate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Why do the authors assume that increased concentrations of 2-OG are a signal for N starvation only in M. mazei and not in all prokaryotic equivalent systems (line 288)?</p></disp-quote><p>In line 288, we did not claim that this is a unique signal for <italic>M. mazei</italic>. It is also the central N-starvation signal in Cyanobacteria but not directly perceived by the cyanobacterial GS through binding directly to GS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should look into the residues that bind 2-OG and check if they are conserved in other GS. The results of this sequence analysis should be discussed in line with the variable prokaryotic glutamine synthetase types of activity modulation that were exposed in the introduction and Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to Fig. 7 - Fig. Suppl. 1, where we already aligned the mentioned glutamine synthetase sequences.

However, claiming that the oligomerization is fast is not correct when the experimental setup includes 10 minutes of incubation before measurements are done. Please correct this within the entire manuscript.</p><p>A (fast) continuous kinetic assay could have confirmed this point and revealed the oligomerization steps and the intermediaries in the process (maybe monomer/dimers, then dimers/hexamers, and then hexamers/dodecamers). Such assays would have been highly valuable to this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, but disagree. It is indeed a rather fast regulation (as activity assays without pre-incubation only takes 1 min longer to reach full activity, see the newly included Fig. 1 - Fig. Suppl. 4). Considering other regulation mechanisms like e.g. transcription or translation regulation, an activation that takes only 60 s is actually quite quick.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Line 305 (and elsewhere in the manuscript): the authors state that 2-OG primes the active site for a transition state. This appears incorrect. The transition state is the highest energy state in an enzymatic reaction progressing from substrate to product. Meaning, the transition state is a state that has a more or less modified form of the original substrate bound to the active site. This is not the case.</p><p>In line 366 an &quot;active open state&quot; appears much more adequate to use.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and changed accordingly throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(23) Line 330: Please delete &quot;found&quot;.
