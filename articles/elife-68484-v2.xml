activation. Here, we found upregulation of the metabolic adaptor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) is a feature of mouse NK cells during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in vivo. HIF1α-deficient NK cells failed to control viral load, causing increased morbidity. No defects were found in effector functions of HIF1αKO NK cells; however, their numbers were significantly reduced. Loss of HIF1α did not affect NK cell proliferation during in vivo infection and in vitro cytokine stimulation. Instead, we found that HIF1α-deficient NK cells showed increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and glucose metabolism was impaired during cytokine stimulation in vitro. Similarly, during MCMV infection HIF1α-deficient NK cells upregulated Bim and had increased caspase activity. Thus, NK cells require HIF1α-dependent metabolic functions to repress Bim expression and sustain cell numbers for an optimal virus response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIF1α</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>MCMV</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35ES028365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patti</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI131680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During pathogen infection, natural killer cells require hypoxia-inducible factor-1α for optimal metabolism to prevent apoptosis, thereby reducing viral load and protecting against morbidity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During infection with a cytolytic virus, such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), infected cells become sources of viral replication and succumb to viral cytopathology. Natural killer (NK) cells play an integral role in initiating and fine-tuning immune responses to provide protection against MCMV. NK cells carry out this role through two overlapping functional properties: (1) secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (2) direct killing of target cells. MCMV elicits non-specific NK cell activation through a strong host cytokine response but can also trigger specific NK cell activation in C57BL/6 mice. In particular, the Ly49H activation receptor recognizes the viral encoded protein m157 on infected cells, triggering cytotoxicity and cytokine production that can modulate subsequent immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biron and Tarrio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitrović et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pyzik and Vidal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). These non-specific and specific NK cell responses are integrated to provide optimal NK cell responses and protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dokun et al., 2001</xref>). Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cells subsequently acquire properties characteristic of adaptive immunity of expansion, contraction, and generation of memory-like responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, NK cells function as sentries during MCMV infection, controlling pathogen propagation and inflammation through their effector functions.</p><p>During inflammation, rapid energy consumption by cells for activation, biosynthesis, and the generation of reactive oxygen species results in hypoxia, a reduction in oxygen levels, even in the presence of environmental normoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α) is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor whose protein expression is determined in an oxygen-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham and Presnell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaelin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semenza, 2014</xref>). Briefly, when oxygen is readily available, hydroxylation of target residues on HIF1α results in ubiquitination and proteasome degradation while, during hypoxia this modification does not occur, allowing for protein accumulation and translocation into the nucleus. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1α targets genes that contain hypoxia-response elements (HREs) to initiate transcriptional changes for adaption, supporting multiple cellular processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schödel et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, HIF1α expression is directly associated with degree of oxygen levels and is necessary for adaption to hypoxia during inflammation.</p><p>Hypoxia is a fundamental characteristic of tumor environments and drives HIF1α protein expression in situ. HIF1α has been considered a potential mediator of suppressive effects in NK cells, which demonstrate impaired effector functions in hypoxia in vitro that mirror tumor-infiltrating NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baginska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balsamo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers and Matosevic, 2019</xref>). Indeed, deletion of HIF1α in NK cells resulted in an improved ability to reduce tumor burden in two independent studies, which was attributed to a dysfunctional VEGF axis or increased effector functions through IL-18 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzywinska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2020</xref>). HIF1α also supports metabolic adaptation to the tumor environment by upregulating key glycolysis genes to support cell proliferation and survival. Interestingly, Ni et al. showed that HIF1αKO NK cells had higher oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) after cytokine activation, presumably to compensate for poor glucose metabolism in the absence of HIF1α upregulated genes. However, measurements of glucose metabolism showed no differences compared to control mice. Using similar in vitro cytokine stimulation experiments, another study showed that glucose metabolism in NK cells was regulated by cMyc, and HIF1α was found to be dispensable and the absence of HIF1α had no effect on OXPHOS metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>). Regardless, as a caveat, the pro-inflammatory cytokines used are more associated with pathogen infection rather than a tumor environment. Therefore, the contribution of HIF1α to NK cell metabolism is incompletely understood, particularly during the pathogen infection.</p><p>In this paper, we utilized in vitro assays and MCMV infections to study the role of HIF1α in NK cells. Compared to control mice, the absence of HIF1α in NK cells resulted in susceptibility to infection, but this was not due to an impaired effector response. Instead, we show a previously unknown role for HIF1α in NK cells during MCMV infection, supporting survival rather than proliferation through efficient glucose metabolism that is required for an optimal host response to virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HIF1α is basally expressed in NK cells and is upregulated by MCMV infection</title><p>We found that HIF1α protein was readily detectable in splenic NK cells from naïve mice, immediately ex vivo using anti-HIF1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, there was essentially no HIF1α expression in other naïve lymphocytes directly ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, splenic and liver NK cells had similar HIF1α expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Under hypoxic conditions as compared to normoxia, HIF1α protein expression increased in NK cells cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, under normoxic conditions, IFNβ+ IL18 upregulated HIF1α expression to levels comparable to hypoxic conditions, though these cytokines did not further increase HIF1α expression under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, when we cultured splenocytes in IL-15 under normoxic conditions for 16, 24, and 48 hr, we found highest expression at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, HIF1α expression was not significantly upregulated after activation receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, NK cells constitutively express HIF1α immediately ex vivo that can be increased by hypoxia alone or cytokine stimulation in an oxygen-rich environment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) expression in natural killer (NK) cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HIF1α protein expression in splenic NK cells (black) ex vivo compared to FMO control (gray) by flow cytometry.

Expression of other functional markers and receptors, such as DNAM-1, KLRG1, NKG2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the Ly49 repertoire, was also normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data support previous findings that HIF1α is dispensable for normal NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzywinska et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>During MCMV infection, however, we found that 1αKO mice showed increased weight loss as compared to control FL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This increased morbidity was coupled with an impaired ability to control splenic viral load at day 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The number of NK cells in 1αKO mice declined at day 1.5 pi and was significantly reduced at day 3 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the kinetics of HIF1α expression in infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). While FL control mice showed the characteristic expansion and contraction of Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cells over 1 month of infection as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2009</xref>), the 1αKO mice displayed reduced Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

However, we found that HIF1αKO NK cells displayed normal activation and proliferation in response to MCMV but they did not normally expand in number. This defect was evident in another in vivo response, that is homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic mice, as well as with in vitro IL2 stimulation where there was normal cell division but impaired expansion. The 1αKO NK cells had an increase in apoptosis as a result of decreased expression of glycolytic genes and abnormal glucose metabolism that have been previously associated with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Mjiyad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacFarlane et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, HIF1α supports survival in NK cells through providing optimal glucose metabolism during pathogen infection.</p><p>While HIF1α protein function in NK cells during pathogen infection had not been detailed previously, it was recently explored in tumor-infiltrating NK cells in two studies with comparable results attributed to different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzywinska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2020</xref>). In mice with HIF1α-deficient NK cells, tumor control was enhanced either directly by increased IL-18 signaling that improved NK cell effector responses or indirectly through an absence of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, which altered the VEGF/VEGFR axis affecting productive angiogenesis. In contrast, our findings were the polar opposite to these reports in that mice with HIF1α-deficient NK cells showed reduced control of viral infection without alteration in NK cell activation or killing ability. While HIF1α-deficient NK cell numbers were normal in the naïve spleen, after MCMV infection there was a significant decrease in numbers with impaired expansion of Ly49H<sup>+</sup> cells that we attribute to apoptosis. While we used the same strain of HIF1α-FL mice, it is possible that there are subtle genetic differences due to backcrossing from the 129 genetic background to C57BL/6, as is the case with all backcrossed mice. In addition, another potential source of these disparities is that our Ncr1-cre mice differ than those used in the aforementioned studies. Nonetheless, the function of HIF1α in NK cells appears markedly different in pathogen responses as compared to NK cell responses to tumors.</p><p>Here we provide evidence that the absence of HIF1α affects survival in NK cells during a pathogen infection.

In the apoptosis pathway, constitutively expressed pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins antagonize each other to sustain viability in normal healthy cells, and when these proteins are unbalanced due to external or internal stimuli, pro-apoptotic proteins are preferentially activated and expressed, resulting in the initiation of programmed cell death via caspase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Mjiyad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iurlaro and Muñoz-Pinedo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). In tumor models, HIF1α can directly impact apoptosis by upregulating the pro-survival gene myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrington et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Piret et al., 2005</xref>). Mcl-1 was found to be highly expressed in normal NK cells, and genetic ablation of Mcl-1 in NK cells resulted in a dramatic loss of mature NK cells at baseline that spared immature populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sathe et al., 2014</xref>). This absence of NK cells impaired control of tumors as well as protection against lethal sepsis. Here Mcl-1 is unlikely to contribute to the HIF1α-deficient NK cell phenotype because we found no difference in transcript or protein levels of Mcl-1 in 1αKO compared to FL control NK cells, and there were no baseline differences in NK cell numbers. Another potential survival pathway regulated by HIF1α in tumor cells is through the increased expression of BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a component of autophagosomes that complexes with p62 LC3 complex proteins to initiate a survival mechanism of self-renewal. In MCMV infection, O’Sullivan et al. reported that BNIP3 supported memory formation in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O’Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Wild-type (WT) Ly49H + NK cells were transferred into Ly49H-deficient mice; upon infection, memory NK cells displayed levels of BNIP3 transcripts comparable to resting NK cells. However, in a competition experiment, <italic>Bnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells showed impaired survival during the contraction phase as compared to WT NK cells. The markers CytoID and LC3 that indicated active autophagy were comparable between resting and memory WT NK cells but autophagy was impaired in memory <italic>Bnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NK cells, which displayed higher CytoID expression. Interestingly, BNIP3 transcripts were reduced during the effector phase of the response, but this was not explored and the interplay between BNIP3 and HIF1α was not determined. In our studies, there were no differences in CytoID and p62 at 3 days post MCMV infection in 1αKO and FL NK cells, suggesting that this pro-survival axis is unaffected in the absence of HIF1α. Finally, when survival proteins are unaltered, a mechanism of subverting survival is the overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins. Multiple pathways converge on the potent inducer of apoptosis, Bim, which stimulates caspase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Mjiyad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iurlaro and Muñoz-Pinedo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Bim regulates NK cell survival and restrains the expansion of memory cells during MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Min-Oo et al., 2014</xref>). Bim can potentiate apoptosis even in the presence of sufficient pro-survival signals in NK cells, but the interplay between HIF1α and Bim was not previously explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goh et al., 2020</xref>). In our experiments, HIF1α-deficient NK cells had elevated levels of Bim as compared to controls during in vitro proliferation and MCMV infection. Furthermore, HIF1α-deficient NK cells showed a marked increase in caspase activity, a direct measurement of apoptosis, as compared to Flox controls at 3 days pi. Thus, in our studies we found that activated HIF1α-deficient NK cells upregulate the key pro-apoptotic protein Bim and its downstream targets during in vitro proliferative and pathogen infection responses to promote cell death while there was little evidence implicating other survival pathways.</p><p>Our studies indicate that HIF1α-deficient NK cells have impaired metabolism of glucose that provides fuel for glycolysis, critical for cellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Mjiyad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacFarlane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donnelly and Finlay, 2015</xref>). The importance of glycolysis in NK cells has been previously studied using glycolytic inhibitors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keppel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mah et al., 2017</xref> inhibited glucose metabolism during acute activation, and during MCMV infection that resulted in a reduction of IFNγ responses, and impaired proliferation and protective immunity, respectively. However, data from our studies here and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that HIF1α-associated glucose metabolism is dispensable for effective IFNγ responses in NK cells. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loftus et al., 2018</xref> reported that HIF1α was not required for NK cell activation, transcription of glycolytic genes, and glucose metabolism. Further, it was determined that cMyc was the potent regulator of glucose metabolism, leading to the conclusion that HIF1α was dispensable in NK cells for glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien and Finlay, 2019</xref>). One potential important caveat for these studies is that NK cells were expanded for 6 days in IL-15 in vitro then stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12 for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>). In another in vitro study, enriched HIF1α-deficient NK cells were IL-2 stimulated for 7 days in hypoxic conditions then stimulated for 4–6 hr with IL-12 and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2020</xref>); deletion of HIF1α in NK cells resulted in higher OXPHOS, presumably to compensate impaired glucose metabolism. However, in this same experiment, glucose metabolism was comparable in both HIF1α-deficient and -sufficient NK cells. In our studies here, we measured metabolism directly ex vivo and found increases in both glucose metabolism and OXPHOS in resting HIF1αKO NK cells compared to Flox controls. Thus, prior results were skewed by culture conditions that likely do not reliably represent in vivo effects of HIF1α on glucose metabolism in NK cells.</p><p>In further contrast to the aforementioned studies, we found that in the absence of HIF1α in NK cells, IL-2 stimulation resulted in a reduced glycolytic transcriptome and a subsequent reduction in glucose metabolism. These experiments coincide with other IL-2 stimulation assays we performed where pro-apoptotic Bim was upregulated at the gene and protein level. Importantly, reduced glucose metabolism has been directly associated with apoptosis via Bim-caspase-3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Mjiyad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacFarlane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iurlaro and Muñoz-Pinedo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, we speculate that poor glucose metabolism in HIF1α-deficient NK cells imitates glucose deprivation over the course of MCMV infection. Studies have shown that during glucose deprivation upregulation and activation of Bim can be induced by nutrient sensors AMPK and Akt, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Normally, MCMV infection causes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate and proliferate NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biron and Tarrio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitrović et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pyzik and Vidal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). To sustain ATP demands for activation and products for biosynthesis, we hypothesize that NK cells metabolically adapt through cellular respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham and Presnell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaelin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semenza, 2014</xref>). In turn, oxygen consumption causes stabilization of HIF1α and its translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schödel et al., 2011</xref>). In summary, expression of HIF1α gene targets is necessary to provide sufficient glucose metabolism to support survival by repressing Bim protein expression, thereby sustaining adequate numbers of NK cells for protective immunity.</p><p>Targeting HIF1α using small molecule inhibitors has drawn considerable interest over recent years for the treatment of multiple pathologies. However, HIF1α is ubiquitously expressed and has pleiotropic properties through targeting of multiple genes, as illustrated here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schödel et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, special care should be taken when considering the use of HIF1α inhibitors as they may compromise NK cell function under certain conditions such as pathogen infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Splenocytes were then RBC lysed with lysis buffer (1 M NH<sub>4</sub>NaCl, 1 M HEPES) for 2 min and washed with complete RPMI. Splenocytes were counted and cultured at 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml in complete RPMI, 10 μM non-essential amino acids, 0.57 μM 2-mercaptoethenol. When NK cell enrichment was used, NK cells were isolated from splenocytes using Stem Cell Technologies NK isolation kit (#19855) as described by the manufacturer. Cytokines were obtained from Peprotech: IL-15 (210-15), IL-18 (B002-5), Pestka Biomedical Laboratories assay science IFNβ (12401-1), and used as indicated in figure legends. Splenocyte cultures were incubated at 37°C in a normal incubator (20% O<sub>2</sub>) or hypoxic chamber (1% O<sub>2</sub>). For intracellular cytokine measurements, NK cells were cultured for 20 hr then brefeldin A was added for the last 4 hr. Liver NK cells were enriched using 35% Percoll in complete RPMI and centrifuged for 15 min at 25°C. Cells were subsequently RBC lysed for 2 min, washed once with complete RPMI, then stained for flow cytometry. Receptor stimulation was carried out by coating 96-well plates with 25 μg/ml of PK136 (NK1.1) or 0.5 μg/ml PMA (Sigma) and 4 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma), then 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes were added per well in the presence of brefeldin A (eBioscience) for 6 hr and analyzed. 24 hr cultures had no brefeldin A initially and 10 ng/ml of IL-15 added overnight, then fresh IL-15 and brefeldin A was added for the last 5 hr of culture. For homeostatic proliferation, 20 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFSE-labeled splenocytes from Flox or HIF1αKO mice were intravenously transferred into Rag-γRc mice. NK cell proliferation was measured from the spleen at 4 days post transfer and immune cell analysis on day 14 post transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Nutrient uptake analysis</title><p>For nutrient uptake analysis with LC/MS, enriched NK cells from FL and 1αKO mice were cultured in 96-well plate with media containing 2000 units of recombinant human IL-2. Media were refreshed on day 1. On day 3 after a further 48 hr incubation, the spent media were collected and analyzed. Known concentrations of U-<sup>13</sup>C internal standards (glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate; Cambridge Isotopes) were spiked into media samples before extraction. Extractions were performed in glass to avoid plastic contamination as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Media samples were measured by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis, with a method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). Samples were run on a Luna aminopropyl column (3 μm, 100 mm × 2.0 mm I.D., Phenomenex) in negative mode with the following buffers and linear gradient: A = 95% water, 5% acetonitrile (ACN), 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, 10 mM ammonium acetate; B = 95% ACN, 5% water; 100% to 0% B from 0 to 45 min and 0% B from 45 to 50 min; flow rate 200 μl/min. Mass spectrometry detection was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Plus coupled with ESI source. For each compound, the absolute concentrations were determined by calculating the ratio between the fully unlabeled peak from samples and the fully labeled peak from standards. The consumption rates were normalized by cell growth over the experimental time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Seahorse studies</title><p>NK cells were enriched from FL and 1αKO mice and 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were transferred into 96-well plate without any stimulation.

By using mice lacking hypoxia inducible factor-1α, the study unravels a previously unknown function of this factor in virus control by NK cells. It is shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1α supports survival of NK cells through efficient glucose metabolism required for optimal NK cell response to viral infection.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NK cell metabolic adaptation to infection promotes survival and viral clearance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

HIF1a deficient NK cells appear to be mostly functional in terms of effector functions and ability to proliferate with only subtle differences with WT NK cells. This was also observed in HIF1a deficient Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cells, yet in vivo Ly49H expansion is reduced in HIF1a KO mice. Response to IL-2 demonstrate that despite similar proliferation rate NK cell numbers were reduced indicating to the authors an NK cell survival issue. This was confirmed by measuring Bim and Bcl2, which were respectively decreased and increased. Increased cell death of HIF1a deficient NK cells during MCMV was confirmed. Mechanistically, the authors found that cell death was autophagy independent but due to an impaired glycolytic activity. The author concluded that in the absence of HIF1a, NK cells had an increase apoptosis due to abnormal glucose metabolism. Interestingly in tumor models two other reports (references #17 and 18) show that loss of HIF1a in NK cells is beneficial to the host. The authors try to speculate of why absence in HIF1a is beneficial in tumor models but detrimental during MCMV. Other differences were also noticed when compared to these 2 studies in vitro, which the authors attribute to culture conditions of NK cells. Overall, the experiments are well executed and are logical and the conclusions are supported by the data presented.</p><p>It is mentioned that the control mice used in this study do not express the transgene NcrCre and that instead floxed mice were used as controls. In general, it is recommended to use Cre mice as a control (see reference PMC5910175), but it is especially true for NKp46-iCre since expression of NKp46 an activating receptor is homozygote in the control while heterozygote in the ko. It would be reinsuring to show experiments with the appropriate controls especially given the differences with previous studies (references #17 and 18).</p><p>The differences with the 2 other studies are puzzling and the authors make reasonable assumptions and/or possible explanations. Because there is a direct NK cell activation during MCMV (M157/Ly49H) and presumably not in tumor models, could this explain the differences? Along the same line, how are the HIF1a deficient Ly49H negative NK cells behaving?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First paragraph of the introduction requires proofreading.</p><p>Part of the Methods referring to the Rag2-γRc mice transfer experiments is lacking.</p><p>The title does not highlight the contribution of HIF1a.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68484.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The presented findings are novel and relevant for the readers of eLife.

However, upon detailed examination of references #17 and #18, we found that our studies used identical controls as those papers (HIF1a-Flox mice). Therefore, the differences observed in references 17 and 18 compared to our studies are unlikely due to differences in these controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences with the 2 other studies are puzzling and the authors make reasonable assumptions and/or possible explanations.

Our data show that HIF1a expression is comparable between both Ly49H<sup>+</sup> and Ly49H- NK cells during MCMV infection (Figure 1F), suggesting an “antigen”-independent effect but this does not rule out the possibility that HIF1a may be playing different roles in the two subsets. Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cells dominate the MCMV response while Ly49H-negative subsets expand very little (Reference #6 Dokun et al.,). We provide new data here by evaluating Ly49H-negative NK cells, and found HIF1aKO-NK cell numbers were significantly reduced compared to Flox controls at day 3 and 7 but not at other time points (Figure 2E). In addition, we added more data looking at activation status and found a similar phenotype between Ly49H<sup>+</sup> and Ly49H-negative NK cell subsets (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). We suspect that metabolic requirements of Ly49H-negative NK cells normalize similar to Ly49H-positive NK cells. Thus, our data indicates that HIF1a has a global impact on overall survival of NK cells independent of “antigen” specificity. Any further in depth analysis of NK cells to make relevant conclusions would require additional supporting data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>First paragraph of the introduction requires proofreading.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, this text in paragraph 1 of the introduction was mistakenly shuffled at the end stages of manuscript preparation and has now been edited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Part of the Methods referring to the Rag2-γRc mice transfer experiments is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been added. “For homeostatic proliferation, 20x10<sup>6</sup> CFSE labeled splenocytes from Flox and HIF1aKO mice were intravenously transferred into Rag-γRc mice.
