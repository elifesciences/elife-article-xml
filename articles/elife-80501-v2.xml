The channel properties of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> MscS-Like (MSL)10 have been well studied, but how MSL10 signals remains largely unknown. To uncover signaling partners of MSL10, we employed a proteomic screen and a forward genetic screen; both unexpectedly implicated endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane contact sites (EPCSs) in MSL10 function. The proteomic screen revealed that MSL10 associates with multiple proteins associated with EPCSs. Of these, only VAMP-associated proteins (VAP)27-1 and VAP27-3 interacted directly with MSL10. The forward genetic screen, for suppressors of a gain-of-function <italic>MSL10</italic> allele (<italic>msl10-3G, MSL10<sup>S640L</sup></italic>), identified mutations in the <italic>synaptotagmin (SYT)5</italic> and <italic>SYT7</italic> genes. We also found that EPCSs were expanded in leaves of <italic>msl10-3G</italic> plants compared to the wild type. Taken together, these results indicate that MSL10 associates and functions with EPCS proteins, providing a new cell-level framework for understanding MSL10 signaling. In addition, placing a mechanosensory protein at EPCSs provides new insight into the function and regulation of this type of subcellular compartment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane contact sites</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>mechanosensitive ion channel</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmins</kwd><kwd>VAMP-associated proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>HHMI-Simons Faculty Scholar Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55108530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haswell</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1253103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haswell</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI-1548571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haswell</surname><given-names>Elizabeth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1745038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Codjoe</surname><given-names>Jennette M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>William H.

One such mechanism is the formation of membrane contact sites—subcellular locations where membranes of two organelles are held in close proximity by tethering proteins—which serve as sites of exchange, signaling, and organization in all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>). One type of membrane contact site is the enfdoplasmic reticulum (ER)–plasma membrane (PM) contact site (EPCS). Mammalian EPCSs are important sites for the metabolism and transport of phospholipids and allow for the coordination of ion fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zaman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In plants, EPCSs help maintain phospholipid homeostasis and cell integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schapire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz-Lopez et al., 2021</xref>), are hubs of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stefano et al., 2018</xref>) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and regulate cell–cell transport at plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishikawa et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several components of plant EPCSs are conserved across eukaryotes. The integral ER proteins synaptotagmins (SYTs) and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein (VAP)27s are homologous to tricalbins and Scs2/Scs22, respectively, in yeast, and to extended-synaptotagmins and VAPs, respectively, in mammals. In yeast, tricalbins and Scs2 and Scs22 additively contribute to tethering the ER and PM to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manford et al., 2012</xref>), and it is likely that plant SYTs and VAP27s also have a cooperative tethering function. Plant VAP27s may serve as a scaffold as they are known to interact with a variety of proteins and link EPCSs to endocytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stefano et al., 2018</xref>) and autophagic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) machinery as well as to the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zang et al., 2021</xref>). Plant SYTs are required to maintain plasma membrane integrity in the face of stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schapire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pérez-Sancho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz-Lopez et al., 2021</xref>), probably by transporting lipids between the ER and PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2022</xref>) like their yeast and mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> SYT1 changes localization and is required for cell integrity in response to mechanical pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pérez-Sancho et al., 2015</xref>), implicating EPCSs in the perception of mechanical stimuli. However, how mechanical information might be transmitted to or from EPCSs is completely unknown.</p><p>Organisms have evolved a variety of strategies to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. One kind of mechanosensory protein—the mechanosensitive (MS) ion channel—represents a particularly ancient strategy that most cells still use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnadóttir and Chalfie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth et al., 2015</xref>). Most MS ion channels open and conduct ions in response to lateral membrane tension, transducing mechanical stimuli like touch, vibration, swelling, or shearing into an electrochemical signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kefauver et al., 2020</xref>). There is some understanding of the stimuli that activate particular plant MS channels (cell swelling, cell shrinking, encountering a barrier) as well as the adaptive processes in which they participate (relieving cell swelling, enhancing salinity tolerance, root penetration, regulating organellar morphology) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Codjoe et al., 2022</xref>). What is less understood is how signals from MS channels are coordinated across cell compartments and transduced to trigger longer-term, plant-level adaptations.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MscS-Like (MSL)10 is a member of a conserved family of MS channels found in plants, bacteria, archaea, and some fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton et al., 2015</xref>). MSL10 is a bona fide MS ion channel and its tension-sensitive channel properties are relatively well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haswell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maksaev and Haswell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maksaev et al., 2018</xref>). MSL10 is plasma membrane-localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haswell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veley et al., 2014</xref>), and genetic studies have implicated it in a range of physiological roles. In response to hypo-osmotic cell swelling, MSL10 promotes a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the induction of <italic>TOUCH</italic> gene expression, and programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu and Haswell, 2020a</xref>). MSL10 also contributes to systemic electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moe-Lange et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>MSL10</italic> gain-of-function lines—including <italic>MSL10-GFP</italic> overexpressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veley et al., 2014</xref>) and the EMS-induced point mutant <italic>msl10-3G</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zou et al., 2016</xref>)—lead to constitutive growth inhibition and ectopic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2020b</xref>) through a pathway that requires the immune co-chaperone SGT1b/RAR1/HSP90 complex, although this is likely far downstream of MSL10 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2022</xref>). Earlier events in signal transduction by MSL10 remain largely unknown.</p><p>MSL10 has primarily been studied at the protein level or at the whole plant level, but its function at the subcellular level has not been addressed. To understand how MSL10 transduces mechanical information into whole-plant phenotypes, we searched for potential signaling partners through proteomic and forward genetic screens. Here, we describe how both approaches, in combination with live-imaging assays, reveal that MSL10 functions at EPCSs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry to identify the MSL10 interactome</title><p>We first searched for signaling partners that physically interact with MSL10 using an unbiased proteomic approach.

The interactome list led us to perform a meta-analysis comparing the proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with MSL10 or MSL10<sup>7D</sup> with three previously published interactomes generated with established EPCS components: SYT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishikawa et al., 2020</xref>), VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSOR OF TMM 1 (VST1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2016</xref>), and VAP27-1 and VAP27-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stefano et al., 2018</xref>), as well as an interactome of reticulon-like proteins RTNLB3 and RTNLB6, ER-shaping proteins found at plasmodesmata that interact with SYT1 and VAP27s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kriechbaumer et al., 2015</xref>). Twenty percent of the proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with MSL10-GFP were detected in at least one of these EPCS interactomes, strongly suggesting that MSL10 interacts with EPCSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, shown in red). For example, of the 10 proteins most enriched in the MSL10-GFP pulldowns (other than MSL10, the bait), five were previously known to be associated with plant EPCSs: SYT1, VAP27-1, VAP27-3, actin 8 (ACT8), and AT3G62360 (a predicted protein with a carbohydrate binding-like fold). Although no single protein was detected in all interactomes compared, MSL10 shared 23 interacting proteins with VST1, 15 with SYT1, and 14 with RTNLB3/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These interactomes may only partially overlap because they are incomplete, because protein complexes at EPCSs are large and difficult to fully survey, and/or because there are different EPCS complexes in different cell types or in different conditions. Nevertheless, these results indicat that MSL10 physically associates with protein complexes located at EPCSs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MSL10 directly interacts with VAP27-1 and VAP27-3</title><p>We next asked whether MSL10 directly interacts with a subset of its proteome.

MSL10 (the bait) and the candidate interactors (the prey) were tagged with the C- and N-terminal halves of ubiquitin, respectively, using orientations whereby each tag was predicted to face the cytosol.

To advance our understanding of the signaling function of MSL10, we used a combination of genetic, proteomic, and cell biological approaches in an attempt to identify MSL10’s signaling partners. We discovered previously unknown interactions between MSL10, which is localized to the plasma membrane, and proteins in the VAP27 and SYT families, which are integral ER membrane proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> outlines these results and provides a framework for the discussion below.

Subsequent mbSUS and FRET-FLIM assays support a direct interaction between MSL10 and VAP27-1 and VAP27-3, but not SYT1 or 11 other proteins tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

While we cannot exclude the possibility that a small population of MSL10 in another endomembrane compartment interacts with VAP27s, the data presented here support a model wherein a subpopulation of the MSL10 present in the PM interacts with VAPs, thereby forming EPCSs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of VAP27-1/3 interaction for MSL10 cell death signaling</title><p>The only components of our proteome (among 14 tested proteins) that interacted directly with MSL10 were VAP27-1 and VAP27-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, point 1). Broadly speaking, VAPs serve to recruit other proteins or protein complexes to the ER membrane. If the client protein is embedded in another organellar membrane, this interaction by definition leads to the formation of a membrane contact site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James and Kehlenbach, 2021</xref>).

The cytosolic domains of VAP27-1 and VAP27-3 can interact with phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stefano et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that they may not need to interact with a protein in another membrane to create a membrane contact site.</p><p>Here, we add another VAP27 interactor, one that is associated with mechanical signaling. MSL10 signaling is hypothesized to be activated by membrane tension-induced conformational changes that lead to its dephosphorylation and the activation of its signaling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2020b</xref>). One could imagine that such post-translational modifications disrupt the ability of MSL10 to interact with VAP27-1 and VAP27-3, thereby activating downstream responses. However, the fact that phosphomimetic (MSL10<sup>7D</sup>), phosphodead (MSL10<sup>7A</sup>), and gain-of-function <italic>msl10-3G</italic> (MSL10 S640L) versions all interacted with VAP27-1 and VAP27-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) implies that MSL10 signaling activation is independent of VAP binding. Rather, MSL10 and VAP27s are likely to interact constitutively, as they did so both in adult leaves, a tissue type in which MSL10-GFP overexpression promotes cell death signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veley et al., 2014</xref>) and in seedlings, a stage where MSL10-GFP overexpression has no effect under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu and Haswell, 2020a</xref>).</p><p>MSL10 channel and cell death signaling activities are separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maksaev et al., 2018</xref>), and VAP27-1 or VAP27-3 could influence either or both of these functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, point 2).

It will be interesting to test whether association with VAP27-1 or VAP27-3 alters channel properties of MS such as tension sensitivity.

This could affect the distance between the ER and PM and the transport of lipids between them, creating a novel lipid environment around MSL10 that might attenuate its ability to activate cell death signaling. Alternatively, the <italic>sdm</italic> mutations in SYT5 and SYT7 might alter the stoichiometry of other proteins at EPCSs, and in turn affect MSL10 function. To test these ideas, lipid transport, phospholipid binding, and interacting proteins should be compared between WT and mutant versions of SYT5 and SYT7.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>SYT1-EPCSs are expanded in <italic>msl10-3G</italic> plants</title><p>EPCSs in plant epidermal cells expand in response to environmental perturbations like cold and ionic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz-Lopez et al., 2021</xref>).

Both of these scenarios are consistent with the fact that we do not observe altered EPCSs in null <italic>msl10-1</italic> leaves.

Taken together, these unexpected genetic results may indicate that the stoichiometry of proteins at plant EPCSs is tightly balanced, and that when disturbed, perturbations of components even in opposing directions can be detrimental.

Thus, we interpret the synthetic lethality of <italic>MSL10</italic> alleles and VAP27-3 or SYT1 overexpression transgenes as additional evidence that MSL10 functions at plant EPCSs, and we speculate that the ectopic cell death observed in plants overexpressing MSL10-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2020b</xref>) may be a consequence of altered stoichiometry of EPCS proteins and/or dysfunction of EPCSs. Future studies should examine the dynamics of MSL10, SYTs, and VAP27s in the presence, absence, and overexpression of each other—similar to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siao et al., 2016</xref>—to begin to understand the influence they have on each other.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications of having a mechanosensitive ion channel at EPCSs</title><p>To our knowledge, MSL10 is the first mechanosensitive ion channel to be found in plant or animal EPCSs, but this may be an unsurprising location to find a mechanosensory protein in any system. It is hypothesized that plant EPCSs interact indirectly with the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). VAP27-1 and SYT1 are found at Hechtian strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), sites of connection between the PM and the cell wall, and the mobility of VAP27-1 is constrained by the presence of a cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, plant EPCSs link to the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zang et al., 2021</xref>), which might convey or transduce mechanical information to or from the ER-PM-cell wall interface. By placing the mechanosensitive ion channel MSL10 at EPCSs, our results indicate that EPCSs will be an important nexus for understanding plant mechanotransduction cascades in a cellular context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant lines and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines used in this study are in the Col-0 ecotype. <italic>msl10-3G (rea1</italic>) seeds were derived from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zou et al., 2016</xref>) and subsequently backcrossed twice (once to parental <italic>RAP2.6::Luc</italic> background and once to Col-0) to remove additional EMS-induced mutations.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dolf Weijers (Reviewer #1); Verena Kriechbaumer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers indicated that the study is novel and interesting. Although there is a large amount of data approaching the research question from various angles and applying different methodologies, both reviewers agreed that there is no clear evidence of a mechanism of action and that the model proposed is largely hypothetical.</p><p>The reviewers propose a few experiments be completed before resubmission to strengthen the results and support the conclusions. The following points must be addressed:</p><p>1) Better resolution, more pictures to demonstrate that MSL10 resides only in the plasma membrane and/or in the EPCS, clearer localizations of MAPPER, SYT1/5/7, VAP27, and colocalization of MSL10 with VAP27 using controls and analysed in cortical images.</p><p>2) functional analysis/ characterization of the MSL10 overexpressor and tagged line which was used to generate the proteomics. Other controls are suggested by reviewer 2.</p><p>3) Ideally, the authors will be able to generate and functionally analyze an MSL10 variant that does not localize to EPCSs or that can no longer interact with VAP27 or SYT1 (see reviewer 1). This data is essential to support the mechanism of action.</p><p>We hope you can provide the revisions proposed and look very much forward to reading your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few suggestions for improvement:</p><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, and particularly in the model in Figure 8, MSL10 is proposed to reside only in the plasma membrane. How well has this been established? Quite a bit of the interpretation of the manuscript's data rests on this. It would be important to clearly show this.</p><p>2. In the same vein, all localizations in the manuscript (MAPPER, SYT1/5/7, VAP27) are shown in small details of individual leaf epidermal cells. This makes it impossible to evaluate whether there are other cellular pools that may contribute to interaction and function.</p><p>3. The proteomics is performed on a line that overexpresses a tagged version of MSL10. Data showing the faithful behavior of tagged and overexpressed MSL10 protein are required to take the MS data at face value.</p><p>4. The colocalization of MSL10 with VAP27 in Figure 2D/E is difficult to interpret without an unrelated protein as a control. Is the correlation coefficient low or high? The fluorescence images themselves show very little colocalization.</p><p>5. While the localization of various markers is analysed in the msl10 mutant alleles, it appears that these are all static analyses, while EPCSs are not likely to be static. Did the authors address the dynamics of these markers in mutant backgrounds?</p><p>6. While the data strongly suggest a role for MSL10 at EPCSs, this is not directly demonstrated, nor is the relevance of protein-protein interactions for MSL10 function shown. While this may be challenging, any analysis of the function of an MSL10 variant that does not localize to EPCSs or that can no longer interact with VAP27 or SYT1 would be very helpful in inferring such relevance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I very much appreciate the variety of approaches and methods and the description of rather interesting data.</p><p>Some comments for improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>1) The abstract could be more informative and detailed about the results presented in the work. Here I also would avoid &quot;MSL10 can be found at EPSC&quot; as I don't think this is really shown in the manuscript but rather indirect by interaction with VAP/SYT.</p><p>2) line 98: instead of WT (Col0) seedlings, should it be &quot;microsomes&quot;?</p><p>3) In immunoprecipitation, a control using an unrelated/truncated plasma membrane protein and a GFP control would be advantageous over just a WT control. It would also be good to add the truncated list of 239 as a separate excel tab to source data 1.</p><p>4) In the further analysis and comparison RTN3 and 6 are included as EPCS proteins for which I don't think there is any evidence. They might even obstruct the comparative approach here. Why are the VAPs not included in figure 1B?</p><p>5) The co-localisation of MLS10 and VAP27 (Figure 2D) should be analysed in cortical images.</p><p>6) In figure 3, the order of images does not correspond to the order of images called out in the text (g and d should be swopped). Adding text (&quot;mapper&quot; and &quot;SYT&quot;) to B/C and E/F also would speed up the understanding of this figure to the reader. This is of course in the figure legend but this is quite extensive and it would be helpful in the figure as well.</p><p>7) A very brief summary of the data presented at the end of the results is always appreciated especially with an extensive dataset.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80501.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Better resolution, more pictures to demonstrate that MSL10 resides only in the plasma membrane and/or in the EPCS, clearer localizations of MAPPER, SYT1/5/7, VAP27, and colocalization of MSL10 with VAP27 using controls and analysed in cortical images.</p></disp-quote><p>We made several changes to the figures to address this suggestion:</p><p>1) To demonstrate that MSL10 resides only in the plasma membrane and/or in the EPCS: We have previously shown that MSL10-GFP localizes to the PM of root cells when expressed at native levels (Haswell et al., 2008). Previous publications detected MSL10 channel activity in the PM of root (Haswell et al., 2008) and callus (Tran et al., 2020) protoplasts. To better establish MSL10-GFP localization when transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells, we have moved panels 2D and 2E to a new figure 3 and added cortical images of VAP27/MSL10 co-localization in tobacco to Figure 3c. New equatorial images of the same cells in Figure 3d show clearly that MSL10 resides in the PM and VAP27-1/3 in the ER; their interaction should, by definition, create EPCSs. We now address this more explicitly in the discussion and add a caveat:</p><p>“As MSL10 localizes to the PM (Figure 3; Haswell et al., 2008; Veley et al., 2014), and VAP27-1 and VAP27-3 to the ER (Figure 3; Saravanan et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014), their interaction is predicted by definition to create EPCSs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that a small population of MSL10 in another endomembrane compartment interacts with VAP27s, the data presented here support a model wherein a fraction of the MSL10 present in the PM interacts with VAPs, thereby forming EPCSs.”</p><p>2) For localization of MAPPER, SYT1/5/7, and VAP27-1 shown in Figures 3, 6, and 7: All these images are projections of Z-stacks taken from the top of the epidermal cells to their equator; thus, they represent the entire cellular pools of these proteins. We have added text to the figure legends to clarify this point:</p><p>“Confocal Z-projections (maximum intensity projection of Z-slices from the top to the middle of cells) of abaxial leaf epidermal cells…”</p><p>In addition, we have replaced the images in Figures 4, 7, and 8 (previously Figures 3, 6, and 7) with zoomed-out versions that show more epidermal cell surface area.</p><p>3) For co-localization of MSL10 with VAP27, we have added cortical and equatorial images of these proteins co-expressed in tobacco leaves to Figure 3c and 3d. As discussed below, we have added text to clarify our interpretation that only a subpopulation of MSL10 co-localizes with VAP27s. Because we do not claim that most of MSL10 co-localizes with VAP27s, we do not think the addition of unrelated controls for co-localization would significantly alter this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Functional analysis/ characterization of the MSL10 overexpressor and tagged line which was used to generate the proteomics. Other controls are suggested by reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>MSL10-GFP overexpression lines have been characterized in previous publications from our group. In (Maksaev and Haswell, PNAS, 2012) we showed that adding a C-terminal GFP-tag to MSL10 does not alter its electrophysiological properties when expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. In Veley et al., 2014, we characterized the phenotypes of plants overexpressing MSL10-GFP and interpreted them as gain-of-function. In (Basu, et al., J Ex Bot, 2020), (Basu and Haswell, Current Biology 2020), and (Basu et al., Mol Plant Micro Interact, 2021) we showed that overexpression of MSL10-GFP has the same phenotypic effects as other gain-of-function alleles, including the one used for the genetic screen in this paper (msl10-3G). These phenotypes include dwarfing, ectopic cell death, elevated ROS production, altered gene expression, the induction of programmed cell death, and resistance to pathogens. We regret that these points were not made clear in the first version of the manuscript. We added a sentence to the introduction and to the results that establish the relationship between MSL10-GFP overexpression, the msl10-3G allele, and normal MSL10 function:</p><p>In the introduction: “MSL10 gain-of-function lines –including MSL10-GFP overexpressors (Veley et al., 2014) and the EMS-induced point mutant msl10-3G (Zou et al., 2016)–lead to constitutive growth retardation and ectopic cell death (Basu et al., 2020).”</p><p>In the results: “GFP-tagged MSL10, which has the same electrophysiological and cell death signaling properties as untagged MSL10 (Maksaev et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2020), was used as bait for immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ideally, the authors will be able to generate and functionally analyze an MSL10 variant that does not localize to EPCSs or that can no longer interact with VAP27 or SYT1 (see reviewer 1). This data is essential to support the mechanism of action.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an excellent experiment. Unfortunately, such a variant does not exist, and all our efforts to create one have so far failed. For example, preliminary data suggest that the N-terminus of MSL10 is required for its interaction with VAP27 in the yeast two-hybrid (data not shown), but this domain is required for normal trafficking in plant cells, so we were unable to validate this in planta. We hope that the reviewers and editors will appreciate the leap forward in understanding MSL10 function provided by the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We hope you can provide the revisions proposed and look very much forward to reading your revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few suggestions for improvement:</p><p>1.

In (Maksaev and Haswell, PNAS, 2012) we showed that adding a C-terminal GFP-tag to MSL10 does not alter its electrophysiological properties when expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. In Veley et al., 2014, we characterized the phenotypes of plants overexpressing MSL10-GFP and interpreted them as gain-of-function. In (Basu, et al., J Ex Bot, 2020), (Basu and Haswell, Current Biology 2020), and (Basu et al., Mol Plant Micro Interact, 2021) we showed that overexpression of MSL10-GFP has the same phenotypic effects as other gain-of-function alleles, including the one used for the genetic screen in this paper (msl10-3G). These phenotypes include dwarfing, ectopic cell death, elevated ROS production, altered gene expression, the induction of programmed cell death, and resistance to pathogens. We regret that these points were not made clear in the first version of the manuscript. We have added a sentence to the introduction and to the results that establish the relationship between MSL10-GFP overexpression, the msl10-3G allele, and normal MSL10 function:</p><p>In the introduction: “MSL10 gain-of-function lines –including MSL10-GFP overexpressors (Veley et al., 2014) and the EMS-induced point mutant msl10-3G (Zou et al., 2016)–lead to constitutive growth retardation and ectopic cell death (Basu et al., 2020).”</p><p>In the results: “GFP-tagged MSL10, which has the same electrophysiological and cell death signaling properties as untagged MSL10 (Maksaev et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2020), was used as bait for immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The colocalization of MSL10 with VAP27 in Figure 2D/E is difficult to interpret without an unrelated protein as a control. Is the correlation coefficient low or high? The fluorescence images themselves show very little colocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the degree of colocalization is low, but do not consider this a concern. Low co-localization between a VAP and a PM-localized protein, despite a direct protein-protein interaction, has previously been observed with Zea mays VAP27-1 and a PM-localized aquaporin (Fox et al., 2020). Their interpretation is the same as ours—that only a subpopulation of integral PM proteins interacts with VAP27s—a point we neglected to make in the first draft of the manuscript. We have added text to make this clear:</p><p>“Due to low endogenous expression of MSL10-GFP and cell wall autofluorescence, we could not obtain a cortical image of MSL10-GFP and mRFP-VAP27-3 co-localization in Arabidopsis. We could however examine co-localization in cortical and equatorial slices of tobacco leaf epidermal cells transiently overexpressing MSL10-GFP and mRFP-VAP27-3 or mRFP-VAP27-1 (Figure 3c-d). These images confirm what we observed in Arabidopsis—that only a small subpopulation of MSL10 co-localized with VAP27s, and vice versa. This is similar to what has been observed with the PM-localized aquaporin ZmPIP2;5 and ZmVAP27-1 (Fox et al., 2020). Additionally, they highlight that the majority of MSL10-GFP, even when overexpressed, traffics to the plasma membrane whereas mRFP-VAP27-1 and mRFP-VAP27-3 are found in the ER just below.”</p><p>We do not think that including an unrelated protein as a control would significantly alter the conclusions that (1) MSL10 and VAP27s can be found at the same subcellular locations to allow for an interaction and (2) that only a subpopulation of the proteins interact with each other. Because EPCSs by definition bring the ER and PM into proximity with each other, we anticipate that any ER and any PM protein will co-localize to some extent. In this case, we included evidence that MSL10 and VAP27s can be at the same subcellular location only to support the split-ubiquitin and FRET-FLIM assays establishing that MSL10 and VAP27s interact. We added the subheading “A subpopulation of MSL10 co-localizes with a subpopulation of VAP27-1 and VAP27-3” to the results to better make this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While the localization of various markers is analysed in the msl10 mutant alleles, it appears that these are all static analyses, while EPCSs are not likely to be static. Did the authors address the dynamics of these markers in mutant backgrounds?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this suggestion, we examined SYT1, SYT5, and SYT7 mobility in WT, <italic>msl10-1</italic> (loss-of-function) and <italic>msl10-3G</italic> (gain-of-function) backgrounds using FRAP. We did not find that <italic>MSL10</italic> had any obvious effect on SYT mobility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, we note that there was a large degree of variability between plants of the same genotype. SYT1 mobility is reduced by salinity (Lee et al., 2019); perhaps it was also influenced by another environmental factor that we were not controlling for. The large degree of variation in our experiments below may have obscured a subtle effect of <italic>MSL10</italic> alleles on SYT mobility. As a result, we don’t feel these data to be a compelling addition to the manuscript and have not included them there.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SYT1, SYT5, and SYT7 dynamics are not appreciably altered by MSL10.</title><p>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) curves for SYT1-GFP, SYT5-GFP, and SYT7-GFP in leaf epidermal cells of 4–5-week-old plants with the indicated <italic>MSL10</italic> genotypes.

While the data strongly suggest a role for MSL10 at EPCSs, this is not directly demonstrated, nor is the relevance of protein-protein interactions for MSL10 function shown. While this may be challenging, any analysis of the function of an MSL10 variant that does not localize to EPCSs or that can no longer interact with VAP27 or SYT1 would be very helpful in inferring such relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an excellent experiment. Unfortunately, such a variant does not exist, and all our efforts to create one have so far failed. For example, preliminary data suggest that the N-terminus of MSL10 is required for its interaction with VAP27 in the yeast two-hybrid (data not shown), but this domain is required for normal trafficking in plant cells, so we were unable to validate this in planta. We hope that the reviewers and editors will appreciate the leap forward in understanding MSL10 function provided by the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I very much appreciate the variety of approaches and methods and the description of rather interesting data.</p><p>Some comments for improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>1) The abstract could be more informative and detailed about the results presented in the work.

It would also be good to add the truncated list of 239 as a separate excel tab to source data 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including additional controls for co-IPs might have been useful, but we do not think the conclusions of this study would be considerably altered by including them. Perhaps different controls would have allowed us to exclude certain proteins from the 14 selected for further analysis if they, for example, interacted with GFP rather than MSL10. However, we were able to rule non-specific interactors out quite efficiently using yeast two-hybrid, and we did identify new and specific direct interactors of MSL10 using our approach.</p><p>We added the list of 239 selected proteins as a new tab in Figure 1- Source Data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the further analysis and comparison RTN3 and 6 are included as EPCS proteins for which I don't think there is any evidence.

Additionally, we consider plasmodesmata to be a specialized type of EPCS. However, to avoid over-interpretation we have changed the text to refer to RTNLB3/6 as “plasmodesmata-associated proteins” and “ER-shaping proteins found at plasmodesmata that interact with SYT1 and VAP27s”.</p><p>The VAP27s were not included in Figure 1B because a full proteome was not reported (Stefano et al., 2018).
