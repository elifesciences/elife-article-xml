neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, many TRPV1 agonists and antagonists produce thermomodulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials, limiting their utility. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and release proinflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, most notably the potent vasodilative neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, these body temperature effects may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs in vivo. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermomodulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanistically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>thermoregulation</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>CGRP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hanna Gray Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yue</surname><given-names>Wendy Wing Sze</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001692</institution-id><institution>Croucher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship for Postdoctoral Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yue</surname><given-names>Wendy Wing Sze</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

The capsaicin (vanilloid) receptor, TRPV1, is a nonselective cation channel expressed by a subset of small diameter unmyelinated (C) and medium diameter myelinated (Aδ) nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>). TRPV1 is activated by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>) and is modulated by inflammatory mediators, including extracellular protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tominaga et al., 1998</xref>) and bioactive lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), making it one of the key polymodal receptors for detecting noxious stimuli. Many studies have found that TRPV1 contributes not only to acute pain, but also to persistent pain conditions, particularly those associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julius, 2013</xref>). As such, TRPV1 has become an actively pursued drug target for analgesic therapy. Unfortunately, this pursuit has been stymied by the fact that many TRPV1 modulators produce core body temperature changes.</p><p>Injection or consumption of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers and a specific TRPV1 agonist, drives a range of thermoregulatory processes, including vasodilation, sweating, and panting, all of which promote a decrease in core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jancsó-Gábor et al., 1970a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Szolcsányi, 2015</xref>). Conversely, many TRPV1 antagonists, including drug candidates, induce hyperthermia both in animal models and in human clinical trials. For example, oral administration of AMG517 increases body temperature of some participants to 39–40°C for 1–4 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavva et al., 2008</xref>). Other TRPV1 antagonists, for example, ABT-102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Othman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rowbotham et al., 2011</xref>), AZD1386 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomtsyan and Brederson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quiding et al., 2013</xref>), and JNJ-39439335 (aka. Mavatrep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manitpisitkul et al., 2016</xref>), also produce varying degree of hyperthermia at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>It is unclear what site and mechanism of action underlie these thermoregulatory effects of TRPV1-selective drugs. While nociceptors are the main site of TRPV1 expression, functional channels are also found on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) within a subset of terminal arterioles in peripheral (but not central) vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Phan et al., 2020</xref>). The activation of vascular TRPV1 leads to vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Phan et al., 2020</xref>), which is generally thought to be associated with decreased blood flow and enhanced heat conservation. On the other hand, vasoconstriction at sites outside of thermoregulatory tissues may shunt blood flow into these areas and promote heat dissipation. Accordingly, it is unknown whether and how vascular TRPV1 participates in drug-mediated body temperature modulation, particularly in comparison with neuronal TRPV1. Also at issue is the relative contribution of the central versus peripheral consequences of the activation of primary afferents. Sensory neuron activation of central pathways involves spinal cord and trigeminal circuits that project to thermoregulatory centers in the brain, which can then mobilize adaptive physiological or behavioral programs, including the regulation of sympathetic outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alawi et al., 2015</xref>) for control of thermogenesis, vascular tone, etc. Once activated, subsets of primary sensory neurons also release transmitters peripherally. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is most relevant here as it elicits pronounced local vasodilation following activation of TRPV1 on perivascular sensory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argunhan and Brain, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zygmunt et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use genetic and pharmacological approaches to assess the relative contribution of TRPV1 on arterioles versus sensory neurons to agonist- or antagonist-evoked changes in core body temperature. We find that TRPV1 on sensory neurons predominates in mediating these actions, and furthermore, that this requires signal transmission to the central nervous system, but not peripheral release of CGRP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal TRPV1 is essential for drug-mediated changes in core body temperature</title><p>To determine whether drug-evoked body temperature change is mediated by TRPV1 in peripheral nociceptors versus vSMCs, we generated mice lacking TRPV1 in each of these locales.

Despite analgesic efficacy in some indications, such as osteoarthritic knee pain, two main ‘on-target’ adverse side effects have limited further development of these drugs for clinical use: diminished sensitivity to potentially injurious heat, and increased core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomtsyan and Brederson, 2015</xref>). Our current work addresses the mechanism underlying the latter adverse effect. Our findings show that the thermomodulatory responses of mice to acute systemic activation/inhibition of TRPV1 are mediated predominantly by the central projections of TRPV1-expressing nociceptors and thus likely involve output from thermoregulatory centers in the hypothalamus, which may recruit the sympathetic system, for example, with the engagement of adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alawi et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the concurrent and robust agonist-evoked hypothermia in smooth muscle-specific knockouts reveals an opposing action by vascular TRPV1 that may help constrain hypothermic responses within a tolerable temperature or temporal window. Incidentally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2008</xref> have implicated supraoptic hypothalamic expression of an N-terminal variant of TRPV1 in anticipatory vasopressin release during hyperthermia. Moreover, central injection of TRPV1 agonists have also been reported to trigger transient hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hori, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jancsó-Gábor et al., 1970b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muzzi et al., 2012</xref>) whereas intracerebroventricular injection of a TRPV1 antagonist prolonged hyperthermia induced by exposure to a 35°C environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yonghak et al., 2020</xref>). However, the precise site of action of such pharmacological manipulations has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Most importantly, our finding that ablation of the central projections of sensory neurons prevents the thermomodulatory side effects of pharmacological manipulation of TRPV1 argues that any hypothalamic expression is not sufficient to sustain these effects in vivo.</p><p>In addition, our results suggest a rationale for developing TRPV1 antagonists that would selectively or preferentially inhibit peripheral release of proinflammatory transmitters, without compromising the central pathway and thus thermoregulation. This idea is related to our recent analysis of a scorpion toxin that stabilizes the TRPA1 channel in a unique open state with a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin King et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the application of the toxin to nociceptors in vivo promotes neuronal transmission, but not the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of CGRP, hence eliciting pain without neurogenic inflammation. Similarly, mode-specific modulation of TRPV1 could, in principle, produce analgesia by preferentially inhibiting channel states with high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, thereby reducing neuropeptide release from peripheral terminals to diminish neurogenic inflammation. Interestingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> fraction of TRPV1 current is apparently smaller when the channel is activated by low pH, rather than by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samways et al., 2008</xref>), supporting the existence of mode-specific states. Moreover, recent generation of TRPV1 antagonists that do not block proton-evoked channel activation appear less likely to alter core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garami et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamps et al., 2021</xref> also for review). In fact, one such compound, NEO6860, has recently been tested on patients with osteoarthritis knee pain and found not to be hyperthermic, although its analgesic effect was marginal in this one trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsenault et al., 2018</xref>). Future clinical studies will determine whether such mode-specific drugs are efficacious in treating inflammatory pain while sparing acute heat sensitivity and thermoneutrality.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to protocols (AN192533 and AN183265) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCSF. <italic>Pirt<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice were kindly provided by Dr. Xinzhong Dong at Johns Hopkins University. <italic>Tg(Myh11-CreERT2)</italic>, <italic>Tg(Avil-CreERT2)</italic>, and <italic>Calca<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Calca<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> mice, in which the ATG translational initiator of the <italic>Calca</italic> gene is replaced by a CreERT2 sequence, were crossed to homozygosity to produce <italic>Calca<sup>−/−</sup></italic>.

inputs to the central nervous system are required for the effects on body temperature of TRPV1-acting agonists and antagonists, whereas the activity of TRPV1 channels in the vasculature is dispensable, as is the release of neuropeptides from the peripheral nociceptive terminals. This conclusion is achieved by combining genetic tools to selectively ablate channel expression from either nociceptors or the vasculature, behavioral assays, pharmacology, and calcium imaging. The results have relevant implications for the physiology of pain, thermoregulation, and inflammatory processes, as well as for the clinical development of TRPV1-targeted analgesics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80139.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>Susan D</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0220mzb33</institution-id><institution>King's College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.09.491211">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.491211v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Andrés Jara-Oseguera as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark A. Hoon (Reviewer #2); Susan D Brain (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers agreed that the data in the manuscript is interesting, relevant, and clearly presented, and that most conclusions of the study appear to be well supported by the experimental work.

There are many vasodilators beyond the Calca gene which may be released by activated nociceptors including Trpv1-expressing neurons. For instance, inflammation might also arise from products of the Calcb and Tac1 genes, and other neuropeptides and other small molecules might be involved either directly or indirectly. Although this is not a central point of the study, it should be acknowledged that the described studies with Calca knockout only provide evidence for this gene. I.e., where these claims are made, the text should be appropriately altered to explain the limitations of this experiment and/or wording toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

The main point is that TRPV1 is expressed only on a subset of arterioles, and while channel activation promotes vasoconstriction at these points, how this alters regional blood flow and perfusion of tissues is currently unknown. In other words, constricting the vasculature at these specific sites may increase or decrease blood flow to specific areas, including thermoregulatory zones such as the scalp, tail, ears, or other extremities. Thus, TRPV1 activation on arterioles could mediate hyper- or hypothermia, making vascular TRPV1 potentially relevant to the regulation of core body temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the in vitro assays on dissociated cells are reassuring, what additional steps were taken to validate the Trpv1 f/f allele leads to loss of Trpv1 expression?

As now shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, we demonstrate lack of TRPV1 immunostaining in DRG sections from neuronal-specific (<italic>Pirt-Cre</italic> or <italic>Avil-CreER</italic>), but not arteriole-specific knockout mice (<italic>Myh11-CreER</italic>). We were unable to carry out a similar immunohistochemical analysis of vascular tissues due to low level TRPV1 expression relative to sensory ganglia, which in previously publications has been demonstrated using Trpv1-plap or Trpv1-Cre mouse lines that amplify the signal. Unfortunately, we cannot employ this strategy here because it is incompatible with our floxed allele.</p><p>In response to the comment concerning the reduction in capsaicin sensitivity in <italic>Avil-CreER<sup>+</sup>;Trpv1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, we show that the percentage of capsaicin-sensitive DRG neurons drops to 11.1% from the control value of 42.2% (i.e., a ~75% reduction). These data are shown in Figure 2Ci and we have now modified the text to make this clear. Importantly, these results are qualitatively consistent with our new histochemical data described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What were the baseline real temperatures in the different strains of mice?

Moreover, we and others have shown that the vasodilatory actions of TRPV1 agonists are abrogated by CGRP receptor antagonists, making this agent especially relevant. But in any case, the most important result is that ablation of central projections of TRPV1-expressing neurons eliminates drug-evoked effects described here, ruling out a major contribution from peripherally released factors such as CGRP. Thus, we believe that these experiments, when taken together, support our main conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Are there any thermoneutral TRPV1 antagonists available yet?

Further clinical studies have apparently been planned to test higher dosages. Interestingly, this new drug has a differential action on capsaicin versus proton-evoked channel activation, which is consistent with a hypothesis raised in our discussion. We now describe these observations in our revised manuscript and refer the reader to a recent review that discusses, in greater detail, progress in TRPV1 antagonist development.
