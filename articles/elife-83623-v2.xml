to 10 µm). When applied to vitrified samples, serial FIB/SEM is also a means to target specific structures in cells and tissues while maintaining constituents’ hydration shells for in situ structural biology downstream. However, the application of serial FIB/SEM imaging of non-stained cryogenic biological samples is limited due to low contrast, curtaining, and charging artefacts. We address these challenges using a cryogenic plasma FIB/SEM. We evaluated the choice of plasma ion source and imaging regimes to produce high-quality SEM images of a range of different biological samples. Using an automated workflow we produced three-dimensional volumes of bacteria, human cells, and tissue, and calculated estimates for their resolution, typically achieving 20–50 nm. Additionally, a tag-free localisation tool for regions of interest is needed to drive the application of in situ structural biology towards tissue. The combination of serial FIB/SEM with plasma-based ion sources promises a framework for targeting specific features in bulk-frozen samples (&gt;100 µm) to produce lamellae for cryogenic electron tomography.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HeLa cells</kwd><kwd>Vero cells</kwd><kwd>mouse tissue (brain)</kwd><kwd>mouse tissue (cardiac)</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>R. rubrum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220526/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naismith</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218579/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

However, this technique is almost exclusively applied to fixed, resin-embedded, and stained samples. There are only a few studies demonstrating application of this technique to vitrified, frozen-hydrated material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schertel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Vitrified (as opposed to fixed) samples are required where volumetric information is to be used for further in situ structural studies by cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET). Cryo-ET can determine protein structures in the context of a cell at pseudo atomic resolution but requires locating regions of interest (ROIs) within the experimental specimen (known as a lamella) sufficiently thin to be transparent to transmitted electrons (&lt;300 nm). Lamellae are most often fabricated with cryo focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopes (cryo-FIB/SEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bäuerlein and Baumeister, 2021</xref>). Combining ROI targeting and serial FIB/SEM analysis of biological volumes is an attractive approach to multi-scale imaging.</p><p>The process of thinning (milling) requires a focussed ion beam; the current state of the art uses Ga<sup>+</sup> ion beams. For lamella preparation, ensuring the ROI is contained within the lamella commonly employs correlative light microscopy (cryo-CLEM) relying on fluorescent markers (usually a tagged protein) prior to, and during milling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeRosier, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mahamid et al., 2015</xref>). However, fluorescence microscopy under cryogenic conditions suffers from poor axial resolution (&gt;300 nm), reducing its effectiveness as a targeting tool for lamella preparation. Moreover, the shuttling between machines can introduce alignment/handling errors. As structural biology moves to human tissue, developing approaches that do not depend on fluorescence to identify ROIs will be critical. An idealised approach would identify structural features in real time during milling and thus enable localisation of the ROI within 50 nm (thus ensuring the ROI is contained even in the thinnest lamella).</p><p>There are two alternatives to cryogenic fluorescence imaging: cryo-soft-X-ray tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kounatidis et al., 2020</xref>) and serial FIB/SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schertel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spehner et al., 2020</xref>). Cryo-soft-X-ray tomography can image volumes up to 10 µm thick at 40 nm resolution or 1 µm thick at 25 nm and has been successfully combined with fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kounatidis et al., 2020</xref>). However, soft X-ray tomography requires a synchrotron and the resulting X-ray-induced beam damage can adversely affect the sample, damaging higher resolution features and precluding cryo-ET experiments.</p><p>Serial FIB/SEM is a well-known volumetric imaging technique: a layer from the sample surface is removed by the FIB and the newly exposed surface imaged by SEM in a repeated cycle (hence serial). For this to be useful for localisation of ROI for cryo-ET, it needs to be carried out on vitrified samples. Current cryo-FIB/SEM approaches can be extended further through the introduction of an inductively coupled plasma FIB (pFIB) generated from gases as an alternative to Ga<sup>+</sup> ions. Such pFIB ion sources can be operated at higher currents than Ga<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>), thus allowing sufficiently rapid ablation rates needed to remove the large volumes of material found in tissue samples (as opposed to single cells). A potential further advantage is a reduction in ion implantation into the sample which is known to occur when Ga<sup>+</sup> FIB is used with solid-state chemical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eder et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Imaging native contrast of biological material using serial FIB/SEM is difficult. The interaction with low atomic number elements results in fewer backscattered and consequently secondary electrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reimer and Tollkamp, 1980</xref>) and therefore images have inherently low sample contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reimer and Tollkamp, 1980</xref>). Sample contrast has traditionally been improved by sample fixation and staining with heavy metal. However, this leads to ultrastructural changes and dehydration, such that constituent proteins cannot be analysed to near-atomic resolution. Therefore, increasing the contrast generated from native samples is important to extend its application to a cryo-ET workflow. For insulating materials, such as biological materials, there are two primary electron energies where the secondary electron yield is equal to the number of incident electrons – so called crossover energies. Imaging at these energies stabilises the potential of the surface and reduces charging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joy and Joy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seiler, 1983</xref>). Therefore, implementing acquisition schemes that utilise these crossover energies, while imaging with a short working distance electrostatic lens, may lead to greater contrast and suitability of serial FIB/SEM for targeting.</p><p>Here, we report serial cryogenic plasma FIB/SEM (cryo-serial pFIB/SEM) analysis of vitrified hydrated biological specimens. We evaluated different plasma gases for their suitability and obtained serially generated volumes with high biological contrast. We describe an automated data collection routine that maximises image contrast and feature localisation. Using this approach we imaged a range of samples from bacteria, cells, and tissue demonstrating the ability of the technique applied to vitrified material to generate subcellular information that may be suitable for targeting. For photosynthetic bacteria, we were able to observe nascent chromatophores, in mammalian cells we quantified the extent of membrane contact sites (MCS) and mitochondrial network, in vitrified mouse brain we observed synapses and synaptic contents, while in mouse heart we were able to observe the cellular organisation of sarcomeres and other organelles within the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plasma FIB characterisation for FIB/SEM on plunge-frozen samples</title><p>SEM imaging is extremely sensitive to variations in surface topography, with even small changes giving rise to features parallel to the milling direction due to differential milling (known as curtains which appear as vertical lines on an SEM image). These features obscure the underlying structure and thus their presence should be minimised. We assessed the degree to which curtaining occurred on vitreous cellular samples during milling with plasma operating at different currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We determined the curtaining propensity (expressed as % score) at three ion currents (high, medium, and low) to analyse this relationship for four different gases (argon, xenon, nitrogen, and oxygen) at two different voltages (30 and 20 kV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).

Variations in the curtaining showed a trend towards greater curtaining propensity at high currents vs. low currents. The notable exception to this is nitrogen at 20 kV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nitrogen and oxygen plasmas exhibit the greatest proportion of curtaining artefacts compared to xenon and argon at high, medium, and low currents. Plasmas generated from xenon and argon produce the smoothest surfaces for bulk milling and pFIB/SEM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both argon and xenon have a curtaining propensity under 10% at low (around 0.2 nA) pFIB/SEM imaging currents while argon shows a lower propensity for curtaining at greater currents than xenon during bulk milling. During automated serial pFIB/SEM on cells and tissues we did not observe any trends in the accumulation of curtains or detectable changes in curtaining propensity over time.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The curtaining score (higher is greater [worse] curtaining) for the different plasma sources at different currents.</title><p>Plunge-frozen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>-infected HeLa cells were milled for each current and each gas. 15 windows of 2 × 2.5 × 2 μm<sup>3</sup> were milled at different measured currents at 30 kV acceleration voltage for xenon, oxygen, and nitrogen and 20 kV for argon gas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).

For oxygen a double image is always formed irrespective of the imaging mode. With nitrogen, we observed the formation of double images when imaging in ‘immersion’ mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This double image caused issues tracking the milled surface during serial pFIB/SEM, limiting the volume that could be obtained and leading to abortive runs.

The brain tissue imaged volume was 844.4 µm<sup>3</sup> (20.7 × 13.8 × 3 µm<sup>3</sup>) and therefore permits observation of a range of cell types including neurons and oligodendrocytes. Cellular interactions were observed, including the envelopment of axons by oligodendrocytes (visible as black contrast in images due to the high myelin [lipid] content). These features appear as elongated (oblique plane milling) or ‘horseshoe’ (transverse plane milling) features. The diameter of these myelinated neurons ranged from ~0.53 to ~2.8 µm (longest cross-section, mean 1.02±0.73 µm) demonstrating that these can be highly variable. Within cells we clearly observed nuclei and mitochondria (approx. 87 in the acquired volume), including the visualisation of their cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Other membrane-bound compartments of varying size and diverse morphology were identified within the tissue (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).

At 90° these features are circular.</p><p>Although obvious visually, we sought to determine a more quantitative assessment of the improvement in image quality. We therefore implemented a Fourier ring correlation (FRC) approach based on the one-image FRC used in fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In one-image FRC, a single image is split into two by taking even and odd pixels in a checkerboard pattern and comparing the two. Patches of 256×256 pixels on the image were generated for assessment, producing maps of local resolution across the whole FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>When estimating the resolution improvement due to the difference in the angle, other imaging parameters were kept constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). SEM imaging at 52° produced a global image resolution on average over a whole FOV of 76±19 nm, while using the same assessment with SEM imaging at 90° gave a resolution of 47±7 nm over the whole FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Manual imaging at 52° with optimisation of focus improved the reported resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, the bacterial outer membrane is now more visible at 52° than before. However, visual analysis of features including the outer membrane show that even with manual control, 90° imaging yields more detail and higher contrast due to differences in electron collection efficiency which is maximal when normal to the SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wells, 1975</xref>). This could be measured observing the minimum and maximum values as well as the standard deviation of the pixel intensity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>).</p><p>Stage movement can introduce image shifts which in turn can introduce complexity and errors in downstream analysis. We measured the <italic>XY</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> shift using 1 µm beads that were imaged at 52° (no movement) or at 90° following stage movement. The <italic>XY</italic> shift was calculated as the shift between features and measured to be 52±38 nm without stage movement, and 96±71 nm with stage movement. Thus, stage movement results in twofold increase in drift, however the absolute magnitude of the drift is small, representing under 1% of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). This small increase in drift will have little (if any) effect on the alignment. For potential <italic>Z</italic> shift, we used the sphericity (and thus change in diameter with depth) of the beads to determine discrepancies between the programmed milling step size and the actual step size (derived by measuring diameters). For a targeted milling step of 50 nm, the observed steps were 48.1±1.4 nm without stage movement and 48.9±4 nm with stage movement. <italic>Z</italic>-drift is therefore minimal and not increased by the tilting regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, D</xref>). Moreover, this experiment confirms the targeted <italic>Z</italic> step (50 nm) is achievable under cryogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan and Chason, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Finalyy, the depth of field is of interest as it informs how much volume can be milled without the need for autofocus correction methods whilst retaining image quality. At both 1 and 2kV imaging energy, this was found to be ~20 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Using a slice thickness of 50 nm, a focus correction will be needed after around 400 slices. Fully automating focus corrections would be desirable for thicker samples.

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) within cells permitting us to visualise their organisation within the cell, with 138 NPCs being visible within the data. The mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2022</xref>) was also characterised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and D</xref>) with isolated mitochondria (mitochondria 16 and 17), small mitochondrial networks (12 and 14), and large networks (2 and 7) identifiable. We calculated the volume taken up by mitochondria, ER and LDs within the imaged volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), and quantified the number and size of contacts of the ER with LDs or with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and E</xref>). In Vero cells, we identified 26 LD-to-ER contacts and 48 mitochondria-to-ER MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giacomello and Pellegrini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacquemyn et al., 2017</xref>). MCS vary in length (membrane to membrane contact) and distance between the two organelles. In our analysis, we kept a constant distance between organelles (25 nm which is the maximum separation between membranes). Therefore, the analysis is independent of the intermembrane variation and includes all MCS. Both LD-ER and mitochondria-ER MCS have a similar volume (1–5 × 10<sup>–3</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and Gaussian distribution. Consequently, ER contact sites measures vary depending on how long and how spread those contacts are. Interestingly, the distribution is the same, suggesting a limit in the extent of which the ER can track and contact an organelle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Vero cells imaged using serial plasma focussed ion beam (pFIB)/scanning electron microscopy (SEM) normal to surface.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Serial pFIB/SEM volume acquired of a Vero cell, using nitrogen plasma for milling.

To validate this, we generated lamellae of <italic>R. rubrum</italic> and human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE-1) and imaged them using SEM during fabrication and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after fabrication. The final milling steps for lamella preparation and subsequent cryo-ET analysis generally employed lower currents than those used for cryo-serial pFIB/SEM imaging (60 pA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2023</xref>] vs. 200 pA). Two-hundred pA was initially used for serial pFIB/SEM, followed by final step of milling at 60 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video1">Figure 9—video 1</xref>). The SEM and TEM images of the same lamella demonstrated that it was possible to correlate features, such as subcellular structures. Where a short milling step performed after SEM imaging there will be physical differences between the lamella imaged by SEM and that which was imaged by TEM for example, the size of the LD or compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even without a final milling step, differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). These differences arise from the distinctive physics of the techniques; SEM images regions with approximately 25 nm depth at the surface, whereas the entire thickness of the lamella (up to 300 nm) is imaged by TEM. Thus, when imaging a small organism such as <italic>R. rubrum</italic>, the SEM images contain only part of a bacterium whereas in TEM essentially the complete cell is visualised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video2">Figure 9—video 2</xref>).

In future, a more refined version of this measure could be used on-the-fly to automatically adjust milling parameters to prevent (and eliminate) curtaining during data acquisition.</p><p>The use of diatomic gasses (O, N) to generate the plasma led to double images which, as we showed, can be (to an extent) corrected for but required more manual operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) as there was a high failure rate of automation (&gt;80% vs. &lt;10% for argon). The use of oxygen plasma on resin-embedded and stained samples has been reported to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorelick et al., 2018</xref>) but a success rate was not reported. Since our goal was to develop automated procedures for vitrified samples, we did not pursue oxygen or nitrogen gases further. Ar and Xe have similarly low curtaining propensity at low current; thus, both are strong candidates for exploitation in this workflow. At high currents Ar performed better, as demonstrated by its reduced curtaining score and visual lack of curtains. We focussed argon to demonstrate the potential of our approach.</p><p>The use of pFIB to fabricate lamella has been demonstrated with plunge-frozen vitrified materials as part of a high-resolution high-throughput cryo-ET workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2023</xref>). The cryo-ET workflow study indicated that milling with Ar plasma (30 kV, 60 pA) beam adversely affected the resolution of sub-tomographically averaged ribosomes within around 45 nm of the surface. This effect was present despite the ‘smooth’ surface of the lamella and was attributed to damage introduced by argon ions colliding with and penetrating the sample. Thus, while a lack of curtaining is a necessary condition for SEM imaging, it does not necessarily indicate a lack of damage. For serial pFIB/SEM, the Wattage used for argon is twofold higher than that used for the final step of lamella polishing (200 pA at 20 kV vs. 50 pA at 30 kV). Intuitively, we would expect damage (not just curtaining) to increase with increasing current, although this has not been established. When we compared cryo-serial pFIB/SEM (low current) images of Vero (milled with nitrogen plasma) and HeLa (argon plasma) cells, nitrogen showed higher resolution. It is possible that damage may be dependent on the plasma not simply on its current and such damage may not simply correlate with curtaining, but further investigation is required. SEM imaging itself will damage the sample; the greatest dose we employed during data acquisition was under 10<sup>–2</sup> e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> over the whole scanned image, even with the smallest pixel sizes used for imaging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This is a lower dose than those used during cryo-ET imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2023</xref>). SEM damage would be expected to be confined to the interaction depth, less than 50 nm, and therefore, we would expect that SEM-induced damage would be contained within the same volume (close to the surface) as the FIB damage, which is approximately 45 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2023</xref>). However, further experimentation may disclose unexpected effects.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Serial plasma focussed ion beam (pFIB)/scanning electron microscope (SEM) parameters used for the different biological samples.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sample</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Milling gas</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Acceleration voltage (kV)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Target current (nA)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Software</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">SEM imaging angle (°)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Pixel size (nm)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">SEM voltage (kV)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">SEM current (pA)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Dwell time (ns)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Line integration</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gain (%)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Offset voltage (V)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Electron dose (e<sup>−</sup>/A<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Argon</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TFS ASV</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">52</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.745</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">62.9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–12</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">8.24×10<sup>–4</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vero</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nitrogen</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">30</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.27</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serial FIB</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">90</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.927</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">56.45</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–8.4</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">9.84×10<sup>–3</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rubrum</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Argon</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serial FIB</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">90</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.942</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">36</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–3.37</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">9.94×10<sup>–3</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Argon</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TFS ASV</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">52</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.745</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">40.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–4.37</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">8.24×10<sup>–4</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Heart</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Argon</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TFS ASV</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">90</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5.62</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.25</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">45.42</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">–4.41</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">1.19×10<sup>–4</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Formula from current measured using Faraday cup.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Using low current, we were able to mill in a highly controlled manner, accurately ablating a 50 nm layer reliably. Importantly, the absolute size of the beam spot is not necessarily the limiting factor for milling resolution – fine control of the beam (homogeneity of beam current), careful placement of milling boxes, and a steep beam profile can enable slice thickness or final lamella thickness smaller than the beam diameter. Therefore, for plasma ion beams we expect it will be possible to ablate thinner layers. Since SEM images are projections which lack depth information the ideal milling step will match the depth of penetration (electron interaction) of the SEM; estimated to be between 20 and 30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanaya and Okayama, 1972</xref>). Moreover, the depth of penetration is a function of the elements involved and will vary by sample. In this study 50 nm was chosen as a compromise since smaller steps require more time and potentially introduce cumulative electron damage. We did not notice obvious vertical discontinuities due to excessive electron dose (SEM) and features were tracked across the FOV in serial images. The rate limiting step in the automated workflow was the SEM imaging (6–7 min), with 30 s on average taken for milling of a 20×4 µm rectangle using Ar. Thus, using a plasma which mills faster at low power currently would have no significant improvement in the overall time taken for cryo-serial pFIB/SEM. However, increasing the speed of SEM would be extremely beneficial. Scanning multiple lines concomitantly and/or software solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Haan et al., 2019</xref>) would enable the analysis of larger volumes and would improve the integration of serial pFIB/SEM into other pipelines.</p><p>The quality of the resulting cryo-serial pFIB/SEM images was excellent even with sub-optimal SEM imaging geometry. Using an algorithm derived from fluorescent imaging we calculated the local resolution across the image. This varies between samples and data acquisition parameters. Most importantly, and not surprisingly, the pixel size is critical. In our experiements, patch size was maintained at 256 x 256 for all pixel sizes, which may lead to more 'optimistic' resolution estimates. Therefore, smaller patch sizes and robust local analyses will make this approach more robust. Nonetheless, our observation of macromolecular assemblies/features is consistent with the calculated resolution of better than 50 nm.</p><p>By imaging 500 slices of 50 nm depth from HeLa cells, we were able to identify macromolecular complexes, such as NPCs and centrioles. We found two centrosomes indicating a cell in prophase but did not observe the spindle microtubules. In Vero cells, we delineated the mitochondrial network in exquisite detail and were even able to quantify the ER to organelle contacts. In mouse brain tissue, we visualised complete synapses including pre-synaptic vesicles (approx. 30–50 nm), identified myelin sheaths, and cell-cell interactions. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schertel et al., 2013</xref>) using SEM on high-pressure frozen cryogenic samples have demonstrated the applicability of SEM to visualise subcellular structures, including the perinuclear space. Our approach was able to identify large macromolecular complexes even within tissues, representing a significant improvement in the power of the approach.</p><p>Serial pFIB/SEM images could be correlated with fluorescence and TEM images showing promise for a correlated workflow. For targeting-specific ROIs within cells or tissues, SEM imaging at lower resolutions may be possible and would increase throughput of targeting ROIs on the fly. We have yet to determine the consequence of the highest milling currents upon the quality of TEM imaging. We did not observe devitrification in the mammalian cells or bacteria we imaged. Poor vitrification was observed in the media surrounding the bacteria. Comparison to non-milled samples showed that the poor vitrification resulted from sample preparation (David Farmer, personal communication, 2022).</p><p>In all samples, we did observe sample charging. This was most severe on lipid-rich regions. We implemented a software mitigation approach that reduced the effect of charging on the surrounding data, though this was unable to recover information that was otherwise lost due to charging. Of course, preventing or reducing these artefacts during acquisition of data would be preferable.</p><p>Applying an automated, machine learning segmentation software to a serial pFIB/SEM data dataset resulted in a predicted segmentation with a Dice score of 0.87. This segmentation was largely in agreement with the manually segmented ‘ground truth’ but was less accurate in locations where artefacts such as charging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) were present. The enhanced contrast from imaging the sample perpendicular to the SEM paired with the post-processing charge removal allowed for volumes to be segmented automatically. Serial pFIB/SEM can thus be utilised to provide quantitative information on the subcellular organisation within tissues.</p><p>A systematic comparison of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells showed clear improvements in the definition of the ultrastructure imaging perpendicular to the surface. This was most clearly seen in the sharpness of the bacterial inner and outer membranes with the infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The difference in quality between the imaging regimes was reduced but not eliminated by careful manual optimisation of the working distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The perpendicular imaging regime does require additional movements of the stage which for a highly repetitive process can lengthen the time taken and introduce compounding errors in stage position. However, the additional time was insignificant, and we demonstrated that these additional movements have a negligible effect on the stage. We were able to segment both mature and separately developing chromatophores in the photosynthetic bacteria, <italic>R. rubrum</italic>. We also imaged unstained (but fixed) mouse heart. We were able to measure the <italic>Z</italic>-disc to <italic>Z</italic>-disc distance as being ~1.68 µm, which could reflect the heart being in diastole, but more likely demonstrates that the sarcomeres had undergone contraction post-mortem where typical length in vivo is ~1.7–2.3 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Tombe and ter Keurs, 2016</xref>). The images allowed accurate assessment of the mitochondrial density in this tissue and quantitative comparison with the brain tissue. The ability to visualise protein assemblies and ultrastructure in vitrified unstained tissue with laboratory-based equipment has potential applications in pathology, where early identification of disease mechanisms remains an unmet challenge.</p><p>Cryo-serial pFIB/SEM is a useful addition to the structural biology toolbox. We have shown that it can accurately determine biological ultrastructural arrangements from simple bacteria to complex tissue. The approach can generate a 3D map of biological materials. The approach has several key advantages: it is highly controllable, it is relatively rapid, can be done in a laboratory, and it is compatible with subsequent imaging modalities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mammalian cells</title><p>HeLa cells (CCL-2, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in high glucose DMEM with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (P/S; Gibco) 1% (v/v) glutamine (200 mM stock, Gibco).

To protect the leading edge while milling and to reduce surface topography, an organic platinum layer (trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV)) of ~1–2 µm was deposited on the sample using a gas injection system (GIS). To reduce charging the sample was coated with two sputter-coated layers (before and after the organic platinum GIS layer) of platinum ions using an in-built platinum mass as a sputter target; removal of platinum from the mass deposits platinum vapour onto the sample. The mass is placed at the end of a small rod that can be inserted into the path of the ion beam (16 kV and ~1 µA, with full view of the rod). Thickness of the sputtered layer depends on the exposure time of the target to the ion beam. We usually deposit each layer for 45 s which gives a layer that is tens of nanometres in thickness. Once an area of interest was identified, the sample is placed at eucentric height, and a first opening trench is milled at ~2 nA.

To extend SerialFIB to plasma ion sources, the template pattern files that follow the Thermo Fisher standard were adjusted to a pFIB equivalent to allow reading and writing of patterns. Parameters that changed in those files between a system utilising gallium, that is, an Aquilos 2 dual-beam FIB/SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), to the system used in the current study utilising plasma-based milling were: total diameter, volume per dose, total beam area, sputter rates, and depth per pass. One crucial parameter that had to be adjusted when switch ion sources was the milling pattern pitch, as the pitch in plasma-based ion sources needs to be significantly higher than when milling with gallium-based liquid metal ion sources, likely due to the decrease in focussing capability of the pFIB. The pitch values were 9.5 nm for gallium and 116 nm for nitrogen and argon-based milling. Furthermore, the beam shift limits for the ion and electron column had to be adjusted to the limits on the Helios Hydra system.</p><p>The imaging script that allows for definition of a milling and another imaging position to allow for stage movements between the two steps in the volume imaging protocol was developed inside SerialFIB’s scripting interface.

While stage movements normally lead to adjustment to the SEM focus according to linked stage height, the focus was enforced to a user-defined or via autofocussed determined value to remove the necessity of autofocussing after every stage movement.

The acceleration voltage for the I-beam was kept at 30 or 20 kV. To accurately reflect the ion beam current applied on the sample, the current presented for this experiment is the measured current. The milled surface is then imaged 90° to the SEM without an electrostatic lens to avoid interaction of the magnetic field with the ion beam. This is crucial for imaging with oxygen and nitrogen, where the use of the pre-field immersion lens led to blurring of the ion beam images. The pixel size, voltage, current, electric gain, and voltage offset were kept identical. This was repeated three times per current (total of 15 windows per current).</p><p>As curtaining can vary significantly across a milled surface, a semi-automated, quantitative assessment of curtaining is necessary for un-biased comparison of ion sources and milling settings. We use a method based on the work from Hovden’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). Using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) the initial image is subject to a fast Fourier transform (FFT). A horizontal 5° mask is applied and a reverse FFT performed. In this new image the vertical lines have been removed. By subtracting the initial and inverted masked FFT images, we can produce a mask to isolate those lines using a default threshold based on minimum cross entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Tam, 1998</xref>). A merged image where this mask is superimposed to the initial image allows precise identification of the location where the milling was performed. We can then produce a histogram where the white pixels are part of the curtain. The percentage of this white pixels is calculated and forms the curtaining score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>FRC calculation</title><p>The FRC calculation for measuring local resolution was derived from the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koho et al., 2019</xref>, which was originally developed for optical microscopy. Their one-image FRC calculation has a calibration factor applied, which was derived from optical microscopy images. This calibration aims to match the one-image FRC resolution value to the gold-standard two-image FRC value. To recalibrate this measure to SEM images, their calibration procedure was repeated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Here, the one-image FRC was used to measure local resolution as a quantitative comparison between images at different acquisition settings and positions within the stack. The images to be studied here were split into patches of 256×256 pixels, and the image resolution for each patch was calculated with the newly calibrated one-image FRC measure.</p><p>To calibrate the one-image FRC for EM images, a calibration dataset was obtained which consisted of pairs of images taken of the same FOV at different pixel sizes (1.12, 2.25, and 4.5 nm/pixel). One set of images was taken at 52° SEM angle, and the other at 90°. Both images in each pair were registered to each other with SIFT landmark placement using the linear stack alignment with SIFT plugin in Fiji 2.3.0/1.53q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The images were cropped to one FOV for all pixel sizes for each SEM angle, which covered 2000×2000 and 1600×1600 nm<sup>2</sup> for the 52° and 90° images, respectively, note that the number of pixels in each pair of images was different due to the varying pixel size.</p><p>The two-image FRC curves were calculated from each pair of images at each pixel size and SEM angle. Briefly, the cross-correlation between both images in the Fourier domain within frequency bands was determined, and the cross-correlation values were plotted against the frequency. The frequency was normalised against the maximum frequency values for each image to enable direct comparison between images. The normalised frequency at which the cross-correlation falls below 0.143 was determined, which is represented as <italic>r<sub>ref</sub></italic> for the two-image FRC, and <italic>r<sub>co1</sub></italic> for the uncalibrated one-image FRC.

The original implementation of Koho et al. was modified to include this calibration so that it would be applicable to SEM images.

The field has long searched for a suitable method to combine the pristine preservation of vitrified samples with a volumetric imaging modality that reveals subcellular architecture at sufficient contrast for ultrastructural analyses. The authors describe here the use of novel ion beams for imaging cellular samples in three dimensions, concluding that one of the four plasma sources tested produces the highest quality images, allowing them to provide several recommendations for imaging conditions along with software for improving collected images. This approach should be very useful for addressing many biological questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83623.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Zanetti</surname><given-names>Giulia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mb95055</institution-id><institution>Birkbeck, University of London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>de Marco</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02bfwt286</institution-id><institution>Monash University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00new7409</institution-id><institution>New York Structural Biology Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.21.508877">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.21.508877v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alex de Marco (Reviewer #1); Alex J Noble (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In its current form the paper does not show or discuss how plasma beams can mitigate charging artifacts (or not). The authors should add a comparison of charging artifacts with different sources (including Gallium) before computational correction. If this is not possible, they should remove the claim that they 'address these challenges using a cryogenic plasma FIB/SEM' (including charging). Similarly, the resolution measurements presented in the last supplementary figures do not relate to the use of plasma FIB/SEM in comparison with other beams.</p><p>2) Add a description of curtaining over time, in response to the following point from reviewer 1: &quot;curtains appear over time when milling, and it would be useful to understand how different sources behave over time in FIB/SEM tomography sessions. The score is currently done from individual windows milled, which gives a good indication of the performance. However, it would make sense to check that the behaviour remains identical in an imaging setting and with the moving milling windows (or lines). This will show the counteracting effect to the redeposition and etching effect reported when imaging with the E-beam the milled face. &quot;</p><p>3) Add data on milling resolution and beam cross-section in response to the following point from reviewer 1: &quot;No detail about the milling resolution has been reported. Since different currents and beams have different cross-sections, it is expected to affect the z-resolution achievable during an imaging session. It would be useful to have a description of the beam cross-sections at the various conditions used and how or whether these interfere with the preparation.&quot;</p><p>4) Comment on the effects of imaging tilt angle on collection efficiency.</p><p>5) Explain the loss in resolution upon tilting the imaging angle, and the effect on contrast on the curtain edges (refer to reviewer 1 comment: &quot;the generation of secondary electrons is known to increase with the increased tilt and to consider that the curtains (that are the prominent feature on the surface) are running along the tilt direction, it would be expected to see no contrast difference between the background and the edge of each curtain as the generation of secondary electrons will increase with tilt for both the edges and the background. Therefore, the contrast should be invariant, at least on the curtains&quot;).</p><p>6) Comment on reviewer 1 claim of suboptimal astigmatism correction, and on how this might affect the comparison between the different imaging tilt angles.</p><p>7) Discuss whether and how the contrast gained from the optimised approach using plasma FIB will allow interpretation and segmentation of biological features.</p><p>Can automated segmentation approaches be applied to the FIB/SEM volumes in similar ways to cryo-ET reconstructions?</p><p>Could the authors demonstrate that the features detected in the SEM can be used to target areas of interest for cryo-ET? If so, can they show structural preservation in the cryo-ET reconstructions?</p><p>Alternatively, the manuscript should more explicitly state that downstream correlative approaches are a potential application to be developed and tested in future work, and this is currently not possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for Improvement:</p><p>The results presented in this manuscript are substantial on their own, and merit publication. However, as written, I worry that most readers will have a similar experience as me, reading excitedly, on the edge of our seats, waiting for the proof-of-concept that this approach is effective (and perhaps more effective than CLEM) for targeting and downstream cryo-ET imaging, and will come up somewhat disappointed that this is not demonstrated.</p><p>I propose that the authors choose one of two possible paths to address the weakness above. The first, more extensive albeit thorough option, would be to address this by collecting tilt series data and reconstructing tomograms of the same lamella imaged by plasma cryo-FIB/SEM, and demonstrate that cross-correlation between volumetric cryo-FIB/SEM and cryo-ET acquisition is possible without affecting image/reconstruction quality. This could be evaluated either qualitatively (e.g. integrity of membranes/filaments) or structurally (e.g., by solving the subtomogram average of the cellular ribosome). Ideally, the authors would select a target and demonstrate an advantage of cryo-FIB/SEM targeting over the more standardized cryo-fluorescence/CLEM approaches.</p><p>The second option would be to revise the manuscript text to more explicitly state upfront that this work is solely focused on evaluating the performance of cryo-FIB/SEM for volumetric imaging and ultrastructural analyses, and that future work will determine whether these are of sufficient quality to the image by cryo-ET. The authors sort of dance around the possibility that this approach could be used for downstream applications without sufficiently testing this, and therefore, I believe the intent of the article needs to be more explicitly addressed in the manuscript text. This would strengthen the merits of the article by allowing the reader to focus on the substantial improvements to contrast/imaging without feeling like something is &quot;missing&quot; at the end.</p><p>Finally, I suggest that the authors apply an automated segmentation algorithm to their volumetric data as a more unbiased and practical metric to evaluate the degree to which cryo-FIB/SEM imaging increases resolution, contrast, and interpretability of subcellular features at scale that would enable biological insight.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a method for using the exceptional SEM imaging capabilities of the Helios Hydra and new cryo-plasma FIB milling functionality on vitrified biological specimens to obtain contextual information on cells and tissues while potentially localizing areas of interest for subsequent lamellae generation. Significant results are presented where analyses of the cryo-pFIB performance are qualitatively and quantitatively displayed and exemplified, which is particularly useful for the field as pFIBs begin to be used worldwide. The authors show SEM optimization examples from bacterial cells, mammalian cells, and tissue along with features that may be expected in the resolution range of the instrument (10 nm – 10 µm). The authors clearly compare the four plasma sources, proceed with the best source partly based on a proposed curtaining score, then optimize imaging quality by tilting to 90 degrees relative to the SEM, analyze several samples, and introduce a U-net algorithm for cleaning up charging streaks.</p><p>I have experience with cryo-FIB/SEM and cryo-ET/EM. Overall, I think this manuscript is timely and practical, given that cryo-pFIB/SEMs are anticipated to be adopted widely beginning in 2023, and should be published.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83623.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In its current form the paper does not show or discuss how plasma beams can mitigate charging artifacts (or not).

(Abstract Page 1, line 7 to 9).

For life science samples working at cryogenic temperatures this could be the presence of ice contamination or specific compartments within the cell, such as a lipid droplet. Over the course of a serial pFIB/SEM run, each milling step increases the chance to encounter such an event. This chance could be more or less extreme depending on the combination of milling source and target material but is not linked to the length of time a sample is milled.</p><p>We have analysed (calculating the curtaining score for each slice of a given dataset) the rubrum, heart and Vero cells and did not find any specific trend towards higher rates of curtaining over time, thus demonstrating the stochastic nature of the phenomena.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Curtaining rate from the mouse heart, Vero cells and R.</title><p>rubrum raw dataset as a function of slice number.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83623-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Add data on milling resolution and beam cross-section in response to the following point from reviewer 1: &quot;No detail about the milling resolution has been reported.

We have also added a section on page 4 titles “plasma ion beam characterisation” which explains the results of these findings as well as the following note in the discussion relating to our extra work on page 12, lines 15-18:</p><p>“Importantly, the absolute size of the beam spot is not necessarily the limiting factor for milling resolution – fine control of the beam, careful placement of milling boxes and a steep beam profile can enable slice thickness or final lamella thickness smaller than the beam diameter. Therefore, for plasma ion beams it should be possible to ablate thicknesses below this value.”</p><p>The probe sizes were measured a few months after the experiments originally reported in this manuscript (so the apertures have been milled and therefore degraded). However, beam profiles are reported for measured current.</p><p>The theoretical probe sizes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83623-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Comment on the effects of imaging tilt angle on collection efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>A comment on these effects have been added on Page 6, Lines 33-35.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Explain the loss in resolution upon tilting the imaging angle, and the effect on contrast on the curtain edges (refer to reviewer 1 comment: &quot;the generation of secondary electrons is known to increase with the increased tilt and to consider that the curtains (that are the prominent feature on the surface) are running along the tilt direction, it would be expected to see no contrast difference between the background and the edge of each curtain as the generation of secondary electrons will increase with tilt for both the edges and the background.

It is important to note that contrast and resolution are not the same thing; we have provided a sentence to highlight this. In our manuscript we discuss resolution of images.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this distinction and agree with their comment. We would like to highlight that we have discussed this aspect (page 6, line 29 to line 34) and have presented data in Figure 4 – Supplementary Figure 1 that demonstrates this effect. To add extra weight to this aspect, we have moved this figure into Figure 4. We have edited the relevant paragraph (page 6, line 34 to 36) to describe how we determine the change in contrast levels between 52° and 90° images.</p><p>We have found it difficult to identify to which sub-optimal astigmatic image the reviewer was referring and could not identify astigmatism ourselves from the raw image. The presence of astigmatism in images is not dependent on the tilt angle but is a factor of tuning during SEM image acquisition. Tilting will not change the astigmatism correction. Every effort was used to try to keep the images as aberration free as possible during acquisition, but users may have found it hard to correct for these at first pass due to the low contrast used in images used to set up focus and astigmatism correction in initial set-up stages of serial runs. As a result, some images may have had sub-optimal astigmatism though this is not a trend (as hopefully visible throughout the many samples we analysed and resolution and segmentation analyses based upon them).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discuss whether and how the contrast gained from the optimised approach using plasma FIB will allow interpretation and segmentation of biological features.</p><p>Can automated segmentation approaches be applied to the FIB/SEM volumes in similar ways to cryo-ET reconstructions?</p></disp-quote><p>Automated segmentation strategies for cryogenic volumetric data are still in their infancy, in most cases requiring substantial manual training data and correction; and are often bespoke to the data under investigation. The area with most automation and the most successful outcomes is in segmentation of mitochondria. For this reason, we have focused on an automated segmentation of mitochondria within the serial pFIB/SEM heart tissue dataset. The methods used and evaluation of the results have been added to the manuscript as Figure 11, Results (Page 10, line 12-31, Discussion) (Page 13, line 13-19, and Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors demonstrate that the features detected in the SEM can be used to target areas of interest for cryo-ET? If so, can they show structural preservation in the cryo-ET reconstructions?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion as this is indeed something we have pondered ourselves. To address this comment, we have performed correlative experiments incorporating fluorescence and electron tomography. As proposed by the referee we could show preservation of structures in cryoET and have updated the manuscript with the corresponding Results section “Combining pFIB/SEM with cryoCLEM and cryoET” (page 9 from line 1 to 22), Figure 9, the Materials and methods, Discussion (page 13, lines 1 to 12) and References.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the manuscript should more explicitly state that downstream correlative approaches are a potential application to be developed and tested in future work, and this is currently not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the above section should answer this reviewer comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions for Improvement:</p><p>The results presented in this manuscript are substantial on their own, and merit publication.
