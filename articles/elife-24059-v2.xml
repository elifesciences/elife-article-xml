Here we report that GH treatment limited to a few weeks during development influences the lifespan of long-lived Ames dwarf and normal littermate control mice in a genotype and sex-specific manner. Studies in a separate cohort of Ames dwarf mice show that this short period of the GH exposure during early development produces persistent phenotypic, metabolic and molecular changes that are evident in late adult life. These effects may represent mechanisms responsible for reduced longevity of dwarf mice exposed to GH treatment early in life. Our data suggest that developmental programming of aging importantly contributes to (and perhaps explains) the well documented developmental origins of adult disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24059.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24059.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24059.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For decades, research has shown that early-life events that happen when animals, including humans,are developing as embryos can later influence how those animals look and behave as adults. However, little is known about if the hormones that drive an animal’s growth shortly after its birth have long-lasting effects too. For example, do growth hormones influence how quickly an animal will age, how healthy it is during adulthood, and how long it will go on to live?</p><p>Sun et al. now show that increasing the levels of growth hormones in young mice for just six weeks can have a long-lasting effect on the animals’ lifespans. The experiments involved normal mice and dwarf mice, which are smaller and live for longer. From when they were one week old until they were seven weeks old, the mice were given either growth hormone or salty water as a negative control. As expected, the growth hormone helped the animals to grow longer and heavier. However, Sun et al. also found that this treatment significantly shortened the lives of the male dwarf mice, but not the female dwarf mice or the normal mice. Indeed, male dwarf mice given the growth hormone lived lives that were 20% shorter than those of male dwarf mice given the negative control, and further analyses suggested that they aged faster too.</p><p>The biochemical processes that occur within a living animal in order to keep it alive are collectively referred to as the animal’s “metabolism”. Further experiments showed that the metabolism of adult dwarf mice that had been exposed to growth hormone at a young age was different from the dwarf mice that had been given the negative control instead. These metabolic changes could help to explain why exposure to growth hormone at an early stage in life can affect an animal into its adulthood.</p><p>The next step will be to work out, in molecular detail, how exposure to growth hormone in early life has a long-lasting effect on aging and lifespan. Such studies might help scientists to understand more about how a person’s experiences during childhood could affect them in later life, including how it affects their risk of developing age-related diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24059.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24059.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>growth hormone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Liou Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG048264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Liou Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG050531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Liou Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AG050886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG043972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK056336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG019899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartke</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG038850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartke</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient hormonal alterations during early critical developmental periods can have a crucial and long-lasting effect on lifespan in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epidemiological studies of individuals born or conceived during the ‘Dutch famine’ led to an appreciation of the impact of early-life events on adult health, and this important concept was formalized as the ‘Barker hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker, 1997</xref>). Low birth weight infants born to undernourished mothers were found to have increased risk for hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huxley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that maternal over-nutrition and obesity are also strongly associated with adult metabolic dysfunction in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curhan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin and Govek, 1998</xref>). This evidence linked early growth status and nutrient signals to the development of diseases in adult life, and now this concept has been formulated as the Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanson and Gluckman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinclair et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that the impact of reduced nutrient availability, and the resulting slower growth and development is not always detrimental. Moderate reduction of food or protein intake during pregnancy of female rats and mice lead to improved metabolic status and extended longevity of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hales et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jennings et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozanne and Hales, 2004</xref>). We have shown that a modest reduction of nutrient availability during the pre-weaning period produced by increasing the number of pups in a litter increased longevity of UM-HET3 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2009a</xref>). Likely, the mechanisms of the effects of both under- and over-nutrition on adult disease, aging and longevity include alternations in hormonal signaling. Hepatic responsiveness to GH, the resulting changes in plasma IGF-1 levels, insulin levels and insulin sensitivity represent one possible mechanisms. There is considerable evidence that hormonal signals are among key determinants of mammalian longevity, and the role of the somatotropic axis (GH-IGF-I axis) in the control of aging is particularly well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartke et al., 2013</xref>). Robust and reproducible extension of both female and male longevity characterizes mice lacking GH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flurkey et al., 2001</xref>), GH receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coschigano et al., 2003</xref>) or GH-releasing hormone, the key stimulator of GH release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Longevity is also extended in mice with reduced tissue levels of bioavailable IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conover and Bale, 2007</xref>). Importantly, there is increasing evidence that the somatotropic axis similarly influences longevity in other mammalian species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guevara-Aguirre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Milman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Spoel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Panici et al. reported that GH (but not thyroxine) treatment during early postnatal period had negative effect on the lifespan of male Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panici et al., 2010</xref>) implying that the actions of GH during development can alter the trajectory of aging and that regulation of longevity may be difficult to uncouple from growth and adult body size. In contrast, an earlier study showed that early-life GH replacement had no effect on longevity in Snell dwarf mice despite dramatic effects on growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vergara et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, Snell dwarf mice share the same endocrine defects with Ames dwarf mice and also live much longer than their normal siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flurkey et al., 2001</xref>). The discrepancy between the results of these studies is likely due to the difference in the protocols including onset and timing of early-life GH treatments and genetic background. Interestingly, in an earlier study using the dwarf rats, GH therapy during development was shown to extend longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonntag et al., 2005</xref>), but the interpretation of these findings was complicated by the unexpectedly normal lifespan of these mutants. In view of the discrepancies between the available results and the potentially important implications of the impact of GH signaling during development on longevity, we re-examine this issue in both sexes of normal and long-lived mutant mice. To search for mechanisms linking early GH treatment with reduced longevity, a separate cohort of Ames dwarf mice was treated for six weeks with GH or saline starting at the age of one week. When these animals reached adulthood (18 months of age), they were used for metabolic profiling and assessment of the hepatic stress signaling, inflammation gene expression and xenobiotic detoxification pathways. Herein, we show that the relatively brief period of GH treatment during the defined early ‘developmental window’ can have a dramatic impact on the lifespan and age-associated characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Decreased lifespan in ames dwarf mice by transient exposure to GH during early</title><p>To evaluate the effect of early-life GH treatment on longevity, we examined the survival of Ames dwarf (<italic>Prop1</italic><sup>df/df</sup>) mice and normal littermate control mice employing two treatment protocols in which GH or vehicle (saline) was administered starting at the first or second postnatal weeks.</p><p>Consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>), saline treated dwarf mice had dramatically extended lifespan relative to N control mice (p&lt;0.0001; log-rank test, both sexes).

To further evaluate the long-term metabolic consequences of this early GH treatment, we assessed the metabolic alterations related to energy expenditure (EE) in these mice at the age of 18 months by means of indirect calorimetry. Similar to our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westbrook et al., 2009</xref>), O2 consumption rate (<italic>V</italic>O<sub>2</sub>), which declines during normal aging, was found increased in the adult dwarf mice when compared with age-matched littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Remarkably, this upregulation of <italic>V</italic>O<sub>2</sub> in 18-month-old dwarf mice was almost completely abolished by the transient early GH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the relative metabolic fuel utilization by measuring the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is a dimensionless ratio comparing the volume of carbon dioxide to the volume of oxygen consumed over a given time (RQ = <italic>V</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>/<italic>V</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>).

The dwarf mice were found to have a lower RQ value than control mice confirming our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westbrook et al., 2009</xref>) while early-life GH treatment significantly increased RQ value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Our previous studies have shown that Erk and Akt signaling are diminished, in response to multiple forms of stress, in cells and tissues from long-lived GH deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2009b</xref>). To identify signaling pathways responsible for the decrease of lifespan in Ames dwarf mice by the early-life GH, we first evaluated the effects of this treatment on several protein kinases which were shown to be affected in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2009b</xref>). In contrast to the littermate control mice, dwarf mice had lower hepatic phosphorylation of MAPKs, including the ERK1/2, P38 and Akt kinases, each of which is known to participate in cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the livers of GH-treated dwarf mice had elevated levels of phosphorylated EKR1/2, P38 and Akt (ser473) which were indistinguishable from those measured in control mice. Interestingly, Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We next examined the effect of early GH treatment on the transcriptional regulation of immediate early genes (IEGs). IEG including Egr-1, Fra1, Fos, and Jun are rapidly and transiently induced in response to stress or mitogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Criswell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sukhatme et al., 1988</xref>). Importantly, Akt and MAPK signaling have been found to regulate IEG induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murphy et al., 2004</xref>). By qRT-PCR, hepatic IEGs mRNA levels were found to be significantly lower in saline-treated dwarf mice than in littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) whereas early-life GH reversed this suppression and even augmented Egr-1 and Fra-1 mRNA levels above the values detected in control mice.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and 20-month-old dwarf mice exhibited lower mRNA levels of several proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1, TNF-α and Socs3 particularly in WAT and liver.

Interestingly, brain tissues (cortex), in contrast to other tissues, showed no such effect. These data suggest that GH signals during the early critical period have long-lasting effects on inflammation status in some tissues i.e. WAT and liver but not in other tissues such as cortex. To further understand how the early-life GH regulates tissue inflammation tone, we examined its effect on stress-responsive and metabolic-sensitive signaling molecules in these two tissues.

The results of these studies raise a question of how the factors and signals during the early life may influence mammalian aging. We believe that this question is of fundamental importance from both individual and public health perspectives. In an attempt to address this issue, in the current study, we have examined the role of GH signaling during development and obtained new evidence that transient GH exposure during pre- and early post-weaning period can remarkably shorten longevity of long-lived hypopituitary mice. The striking effects of GH treatment of juvenile mice on their aging trajectory provide a novel opportunity to investigate the role of early-life hormonal environment in longevity and aging at the mechanistic level.</p><p>Although the existence of critical developmental time window is known in other contexts, the effects of the early-life events on aging process have not been well studied. Earlier studies in rodents have shown that reduced growth in utero followed by rapid postnatal catch-up growth shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jennings et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozanne and Hales, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Ozanne <italic>et al.</italic> also found that offspring that were nursed by dams fed a low protein diet, had increased lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozanne and Hales, 2004</xref>). Along with these studies, our previous observations have shown that a 50% increase in litter size limited to the first three weeks of life in genetically heterogeneous male mice resulted in a significant increase of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2009a</xref>). Intriguingly, Holzenberger and colleagues reported that alterations of the nutritional status during the suckling period modified the growth trajectories and metabolic plasticity in late life through the regulations of the GHRH-GH-IGF-axis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kappeler et al., 2009</xref>). It is noteworthy that a series of studies in rats conducted by Vickers and his colleagues have shown that GH treatment from postnatal day 3 to day 22 could ameliorate or reverse the detrimental consequences of maternal under-nutrition indicating that hormonal intervention during this critical period can override prenatal predispostion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). A recent report has shown that disrupting the GH signaling during adulthood by induced disruption of the GHR gene did not affect the median lifespan of the mice although it led to a modest increase in the maximal lifespan of the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junnila et al., 2016</xref>). These findings strongly support the critical role of developmental GH signaling in lifespan regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junnila et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these evidences, our study pinpoints the periods between the first and the eighth week of postnatal life as a bona fide critical developmental time window in which longevity and aging rate could be programmed by GH signals. Using GH deficient dwarf mice in which hormonal signaling, growth and adult body size are drastically altered and longevity is greatly increased, our experiments provide compelling evidence that transient hormonal alterations during early critical developmental periods has crucial and long-lasting effect on lifespan.</p><p>An important advantage of using these mutant mice and their genetically normal siblings in this type of studies is the opportunity to make direct comparison of phenotypic characteristics in individuals that developed concurrently in the same uterus and were raised together by the same dam in an identical environment and yet have vastly different longevity phenotypes. The observation that early GH treatment can shorten the longevity of littermate control mice is novel and potentially important. It can be interpreted as additional evidence that GH actions during development predispose to accelerating aging. Thus, increasing GH action during early post-natal life leads to a reduction of longevity even if GH signals are not altered after eight weeks of age, which is more than 90% of the animal lifespan. However, these intriguing findings have to be interpreted with caution. Unlike GH deficient dwarf mice, the effect of exogenous GH is complicated by the impact of this treatment on endogenous GH activity and action. It is noteworthy that longevity was shortened by exogenous GH only in N male and in only one of the two experiment protocols.</p><p>As indicated in multiple studies of long-lived mice with mutations affecting the somatotropic axis and mice on long-term calorie restriction, decreased insulin and glucose levels together with improved insulin sensitivity are associated with slow-aging most likely mechanistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartke, 2011</xref>). Notably, these somatotropic mutant mice have markedly increased oxygen consumption (<italic>V</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) per unit of body weight and concomitantly reduced respiratory quotient (RQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westbrook et al., 2009</xref>). Strikingly, our new data have shown that these characteristic features are reversed by a few weeks of exposure to GH during early postnatal period. Our findings suggest that the advantageous metabolic features of these long-lived mice are established during the early postnatal life and are particularly susceptible to the alterations in hormonal environments. Taken together, this evidence suggests that that first few weeks of postnatal life represent a critical window in which the set points related to aging and longevity are programed by the hormonal milieu. Another important implications of the present findings is that it may be difficult or perhaps impossible to completely uncouple the extended longevity of these animals from the reductions in somatic growth and adult body size.</p><p>The mechanisms through which aging and longevity is programmed by the early-life GH signals remain unclear. In current studies, we focused on the possible involvement of the stress responsive pathways, inflammation signaling and xenobiotic detoxification gene expression. Our results suggest that the effects of the transient early GH action on gene expression and consequent functional alterations in various tissues persist into mid- and late adult life and may indeed be permanent. A number of lines of evidence suggest that stress responsive pathways play a critical role in delayed aging and extended longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller, 2009</xref>). It is worthwhile to note that long-lived mutant mice were characterized by decreased hepatic phosphorylation of stress related kinases, including the ERK, P38 and Akt, each of which is known to participate in cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsieh and Papaconstantinou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2009b</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that dwarf mice subjected to early postnatal GH administration lost these tissue-specific molecular characteristics, mirroring the change in metabolic features.</p><p>Chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to the development of age-related diseases and degenerative pathology during aging. Activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways including JNK and NF-kB activity has been recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in mediating the age-associated inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai and Liu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirosumi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tuncman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In the current study, administration of GH to dwarf mice during the critical developmental windows increased these proinflammatory markers in the livers and WAT indicating activation of JNK and NF-kB kinases in these tissues. In agreement with these observations, Sadagurski et al. found that early-life GH administrations significantly increased or normalized the indices of hypothalamic inflammation in the middle-aged Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sadagurski et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data suggest that activation of proinflammatory pathways including JNK and NF-kB may contribute to the loss of metabolic advantages and decrease of longevity in dwarf mice subjected to early-life GH exposure.</p><p>Previous studies by us and others suggest that a generalized up-regulation of many hepatic mRNAs for xenobiotic detoxification enzymes (XDE) represents a shared signature of long-lived mice and may be a general mechanism of slow-aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amador-Noguez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shore and Ruvkun, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The physiology and regulation of hepatic XDEs during early life is not fully understood. Here, in this study, we found that early-life GH administration had a major influence on the elevated expression of these XDE genes in adult Ames dwarf mice. The up-regulation of these typical XDE genes such as Cyp2b9, Cyp2b13, Hao3, FMO3 and Sth2 was dramatically attenuated in the livers from GH-treated dwarf mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathways remain poorly understood. Some studies indicate that the bile acid receptor, also known as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays an important role in the regulations of xenobiotic gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amador-Noguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Makishima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pineda Torra et al., 2003</xref>). In the present study, we observed that early-life GH supplement completely abolished the elevation of hepatic FXR protein levels in Ames dwarf mice. This implies that regulation of xenobiotic metabolism pathway by the FXR activity is at least partially mediated by early-life GH signals.</p><p>In summary, using GH deficient dwarf mice in which hormonal signaling, growth and adult body size are drastically altered and longevity is greatly increased, our studies provide compelling evidence that transient hormonal alterations during early critical developmental periods has crucial and long-lasting effect on lifespan and longevity-related characteristics. We speculate that mammals during the early development stage respond to their early-life hormonal environment and set anatomical, physiological and biochemical trajectories that shape their future life course including aging and longevity. Hence, understanding the role of hormonal levels and nutrient availability in the first few weeks of postnatal life on preservation of optimal health in old age and mortality risks has potential to make a significant impact on healthcare management and devising interventions that could improve quality of life for older individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and GH treatment</title><p>Groups of Ames dwarf (<italic>Prop1</italic><sup>df/df</sup>) and littermate control mice (both males and females) were subjected to treatment with porcine GH (pGH) via s.c. injection (6 μg/g bw/d), given in equally divided doses 2×/d starting at the age of 1 or 2 weeks and continuing for 6 wk (dwarf-GH treated). On Saturdays and Sundays, animals were injected only once with a full dosage following a previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panici et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, normal siblings (df/+ or N) of Ames dwarf mice were used as controls. These control mice are heterozygous for the Prop1<sup>df</sup> mutation and phenotypically not distinguishable from wild type mice. After 6 wk of treatment, the animals were set aside for a longevity study, and mice in these groups were not exposed to any other manipulations except for recording of body weight. Separate cohorts of animals produced using the same protocol were evaluated for metabolic measurements at 6 months of age, for additional metabolic measurements starting at 18 months of age and euthanized around 20 months of age for tissue collections. Animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Southern Illinois University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Aging rates</title><p>Aging rates were calculated non-parametrically as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koopman et al., 2016</xref>). First, mortality rates were calculated per group of mice per age interval of 200 days by dividing the number of mice that died by the number of days lived by all mice in the age interval of interest. If only one mouse died in the last age interval, this age interval was excluded. Aging rates were derived from the mortality rates per group of mice. The aging rate in each age interval was calculated as the absolute difference between the mortality rate in this age interval and the mortality rate in the subsequent age interval divided by the difference in age between both age intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Assessment of blood chemistry</title><p>Plasma was obtained from blood collected by cardiac puncture from isoflurane anesthetized animals at sacrifice and used for measurement of insulin using Mouse Insulin ELISA Kits (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL). Following the manufacturer’s protocol, total ketone bodies and non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) were measured using colorimetric assays from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA); glycerol was measured using kits from Sigma and triglycerides using kits from Pointe Scientific (Canton, MI), respectively. Adiponectin and resistin levels were assayed using Mouse Adiponectin/Resistin ELISA Kits (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Leptin levels were evaluated using Mouse Leptin ELISA Kits (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). TNF-α and IL-6 were measured using Mouse TNF-α/IL-6 ELISA Kits (Biosource, Camarillo, CA). Plasma FFAs were assayed using optimized enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Blood was taken from the tail to measure blood glucose using a glucometer (AgaMatrix, Salem, NH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Glucose Tolerance Test and Insulin Tolerance Test</title><p>Mice fasted for 16 hr underwent GTT by i.p. injection with 1 g of glucose per kg of body weight (BW). Blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min using a PRESTO glucometer (AgaMatrix, Salem, NH) for GTT. Non-fasted mice were injected i.p. with 1 IU porcine insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) per kg of BW. Blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min for ITT. The data for ITT are presented as a percentage of baseline glucose. P values were calculated by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests to compare the specific time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Indirect calorimetry</title><p>Mice were subjected to indirect calorimetry (PhysioScan Metabolic System from AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westbrook et al., 2009</xref>). This system uses zirconia, infrared sensors and light beams arrays to monitor oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>), and spontaneous locomotor activity, inside respiratory chambers in which individual mice were tested. All comparisons are based on animals studied simultaneously in eight different chambers connected to the same O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and light beam sensors in an effort to minimize the effect of environmental variations and calibration on data. After a 24 hr acclimation period, mice were monitored in the metabolic chambers for 24 hr with ad libitum access to standard chow (Laboratory Diet 5001) and water. Gas samples were collected and analyzed every 5 min per animal, and the data were averaged for each hour.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene 3000 system (Corbett Research, San Francisco, CA) with a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Biorad) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, tissues were homogenized with RNA extraction buffer (TRIZOL reagent; Life Technologies, CA) to yield total RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed with poly-dT oligodeoxynucleotide and SuperScript II. After an initial denaturation step (95°C for 90 s), amplification was performed over 40–45 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 10 s), annealing (60°C for 5 s), and elongation (72°C for 13 s). Amplification was monitored by measuring the fluorometric intensity of SYBR Green I at the end of each elongation phase. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or beta-actin expression was quantified to normalize the amount of cDNA in each sample. The change in threshold cycle number (ΔCt) was normalized to the GAPDH reference gene by subtracting ΔCt<sub>GAPDH</sub> from ΔCt<sub>gene</sub>. The effect of treatment (ΔΔCt) was calculated by subtracting ΔCt<sub>normal</sub> from ΔCt<sub>Tg</sub>. Fold induction was determined by calculating 2<sup>ΔΔCt</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Tissues were homogenized in 0.5 ml ice-cold T-PER tissue protein extraction buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 40 µg of total protein were separated electrophoretically according to size by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Criterion XT Precast Gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and blotted with the antibodies. For visualization of specific bands in the chemiluminescence assays, the membrane was exposed to X-OMAT film; for chemifluorescence the membrane was incubated with ECF (enhanced chemifluorescence) substrate and a digital image was generated with the Molecular Dynamics Storm system. Quantification of immunoblot signals was performed using the ImageQuant software package (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The following antibodies were obtained for immunoblotting: p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK, phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), JNK, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Akt, from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); Nrf2 antibody from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); β-actin, inhibitor from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.; and goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed to test the effects of treatments on lifespan of animals, separately in N and dwarf groups. To examine the effect of treatment on lifespan in each gender, the analyses were done separately for males and females, and also on combined data. Cox proportional hazards survival models were fitted to compare hazards of treatments in each group, both separately and combined by gender. As a part of survival analysis, in addition to Cox proportional hazards survival models, log-rank tests were also performed to test equivalent hypotheses. To assess the effect of treatment on maximum lifespan using quantile regression, Fisher’s Exact test was implemented as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Since there were no censored values in our data, the associations between treatment and lifespan were also tested by fitting linear regression models in addition to survival models. Sex was used as a covariate when data were analyzed combined for males and females.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Adam Spong, Jake Boehm, and Joshua Huber for technical assistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrew Dillin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Celine Riera (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Overview:</p><p>This paper provides unequivocal evidence that altering GH levels during early development, and that even small differences in GH can dramatically alter lifespan and growth. We think that this paper is important because it answers a major question in the aging field. Alterations of insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) components that result in dampened insulin signaling promote longevity in many model organisms. However, in mouse models, many of these long-lived animals present growth delay and defects in anterior pituitary function. A burning question in this field remains: Can the long lifespan of these animals be uncoupled from the growth defect due to reduced IIS in some tissues? Therefore, if we rescue the growth defect in Ames mice, can they still live long and present improved metabolic characteristics? Here, it appears that the lifespan extension of this particular reduced IIS model cannot be uncoupled from its growth delay or hormonal imbalances. In our opinion, the paper should be centered around this question.</p><p>Specific Concerns:</p><p>1) Need to normalize to lean mass. For example, GH supplementation increases body weight and therefore tissue mass. In order to study energy expenditure, the RQ data must be normalized to lean body mass. A large mouse will have reduced energy expenditure compared to a smaller mouse, without necessarily any thermogenic difference. By normalising to lean mass, it will be possible to determine whether the lean mouse actually shows increased thermogenic capacity.</p><p>2) Are all the physiological effects sex specific? For many, data from males and females were combined. Given the sex-specificity of lifespan and the phenotypes for which sex was examined, this would be interesting to know. It is not clear in all of the figures whether sexes are combined or not, making interpretation difficult. Can the authors please separate their analysis?</p><p>3) No Statistical analysis is provided for mean lifespans.</p><p>4) It would be very interesting to know whether this brief period of GH treatment during development changed the time of growth to adulthood. Did it? The authors should report this, and they may wish to comment. Is this hormonal system part of the mechanisms that produces this striking (though not universal) correlation in nature?</p><p>5) In many of the figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) it was not clear when/at what age the measurement were made and at what distance from the last GH injection. Maybe it is in the manuscript somewhere but if so, it is hard to find. This is very important to be able to assess the significance of the figures and also of the paper. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, IGF-1 levels are much higher in df-GH compared to df-S mice. If this occurs right after the GH injection it would be very much expected, but if this occurs months later it could completely change the significance of the results and of the paper, since it would suggest that the early GH treatment has long-lasting effects on the GH-IGF-1 axis. Thus, GH/IGF-1 signaling later in life may also explain the negative effects of GH exposure only early in life.</p><p>Missing Data Files: Lean mass and fat mass measurement are missing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24059.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Overview:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper provides unequivocal evidence that altering GH levels during early development, and that even small differences in GH can dramatically alter lifespan and growth.

We certainly agree that addressing the question of coupling/uncoupling of the longevity from the growth delay in these long-lived GH mutant mice is critical. However, our data so far do not provide convincing answer to this question. Indeed, adult body weight of Ames dwarf mice was increased by early GH treatment only slightly (about 15% increase at 1 year of age than saline treated dwarf mice). But median longevity was shortened quite drastically (50% shorter than saline treated dwarf mice) but these mice still live much longer than normal control mice. This evidence may actually indicate ‘partial uncoupling’ between the longevity and growth defects. Nevertheless, we have modified the text (in the last paragraph of the Introduction and in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion) to highlight this critical question and (recognizing comments from reviewers) to integrate this idea better into the manuscript as a whole.</p><p><italic>Specific Concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Need to normalize to lean mass. For example, GH supplementation increases body weight and therefore tissue mass. In order to study energy expenditure, the RQ data must be normalized to lean body mass. A large mouse will have reduced energy expenditure compared to a smaller mouse, without necessarily any thermogenic difference. By normalising to lean mass, it will be possible to determine whether the lean mouse actually shows increased thermogenic capacity.</italic></p><p>This is an important point. Many investigators attempt to normalize energy expenditure (EE) by total body weight (Tschop et al., 2011) however it has been suggested that dividing by the fat-free or lean mass is a preferable approach (Butler and Kozak, 2010; Tschop et al., 2011). Applying this scaling approach to this study is complicated by known differences in body composition in long-lived GH related mutant mice that allometric scaling does not account for. For example, the use of lean mass in the calculations is based on the assumption that smaller animals are leaner. However, Ames dwarf mice have a roughly 40% increase in percent body fat, a 85% increase in relative brain weight, a 30% reduction in relative liver weight, and a nonsignificant reduction in percent lean body mass (Bartke et al., 2013; Bartke and Westbrook, 2012). Thus, the actual metabolic body weight of the dwarf mice may be smaller than a simple scaling exponent would predict. This is further complicated by the fact that adipose tissue in these long-lived mutant mice is very metabolically active (Bartke et al., 2013; Berryman et al., 2004; Darcy et al., 2016). Thus, the allometric scaling exponents will likely to be overestimating the actual metabolic body weight in GH mutant mice and underestimating metabolic body weight in normal animals. When the actual measurements of lean body mass were used, significantly increased VO<sub>2</sub> was observed in mutant mice compared with control mice in our previous published study (Westbrook et al., 2009). The increases in VO<sub>2</sub> are of the same magnitude (1.3-fold) as those observed when expressing VO<sub>2</sub> per gram, indicating that in comparisons of GH mutant with normal control mice the isometric analysis more accurately corresponds to metabolic rate per functional metabolic mass than the allometric scaling exponent estimate.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have accurate in-vivo body composition analysis by Q-NMR or DXA measurements of lean or fat mass of the Ames dwarf and control mice used in the present study. However, our unpublished data has shown that age-matched Ames dwarf mice have roughly 30% body fat, whereas normal controls have about 20%.</p><p><italic>2) Are all the physiological effects sex specific? For many, data from males and females were combined. Given the sex-specificity of lifespan and the phenotypes for which sex was examined, this would be interesting to know. It is not clear in all of the figures whether sexes are combined or not, making interpretation difficult. Can the authors please separate their analysis?</italic></p><p>We apologize for this. We have now added an extra sentence to each figure legend to clarify the data of which sex was examined.</p><p><italic>3) No Statistical analysis is provided for mean lifespans.</italic></p><p>To address this issue, we have re-analyzed lifespan data to test effect of group on mean lifespan using Generalized Linear Models (GLM). We tested the hypotheses of equal mean lifespans between groups “Normal” and “Dwarf” after adjusting for sex where necessary. These results are now highlighted in Table 1 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We are also providing detailed SAS output of GLM results in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) It would be very interesting to know whether this brief period of GH treatment during development changed the time of growth to adulthood. Did it? The authors should report this, and they may wish to comment. Is this hormonal system part of the mechanisms that produces this striking (though not universal) correlation in nature?</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point. Unfortunately, we did not determine the age of sexual maturation in the mice of the present study. From our earlier work (Bartke, 1964, 1965) and from the studies of Vergara et al. in Snell dwarf mice (Vergara et al., 2004), we can assume that sexual maturation was advanced by the early GH treatment. In addition, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (C and D</xref>), the growth rate of GH treated dwarf mice has been dramatically slowed down when the GH injections were stopped. And then their growth rate appeared to be parallel to the growth of saline injected dwarfs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) In many of the figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) it was not clear when/at what age the measurement were made and at what distance from the last GH injection. Maybe it is in the manuscript somewhere but if so, it is hard to find. This is very important to be able to assess the significance of the figures and also of the paper. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, IGF-1 levels are much higher in df-GH compared to df-S mice. If this occurs right after the GH injection it would be very much expected, but if this occurs months later it could completely change the significance of the results and of the paper, since it would suggest that the early GH treatment has long-lasting effects on the GH-IGF-1 axis. Thus, GH/IGF-1 signaling later in life may also explain the negative effects of GH exposure only early in life.</italic></p><p>We now make it explicit that we are referring to the findings in the experimental conditions: Separate cohorts of animals produced using the same protocol were evaluated for metabolic measurements at 6 months of age, for additional metabolic measurements starting at 18 months of age and euthanized around 20 months of age for tissue collections. This is now stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We appreciate the insightful comment of the reviewers about the hepatic IGF-I mRNA level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Indeed, we have no further data regarding the apparently long-lasting effects on the status of somatotropic axis in late life since only hepatic IGF-I mRNA has been examined. Intriguingly, our previous study showed that IGF-I mRNA was significantly influenced by early-hormonal alterations in a tissue-specific manner (Do et al., 2015). Moreover, Holzenberger’s group reported that changes of GH/IGF-I axis in adults could be directly related to nutrient supply during the early postnatal period (Kappeler et al., 2009). The molecular details concerning how early GH impacts somatotropic axis later in life are currently under investigation and, we believe, outside the scope of this current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
