<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by replicating selected results from a substantial number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘BET bromodomain inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc’ by Delmore and colleagues, published in <italic>Cell</italic> in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B and 7C-E. Delmore and colleagues demonstrated that treatment with JQ1, a small molecular inhibitor targeting BET bromodomains, resulted in the transcriptional down-regulation of the c-Myc oncogene in vitro (Figure 3B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). To assess the therapeutic efficacy of JQ1 in vivo, mice bearing multiple myeloma (MM) lesions were treated with JQ1 before evaluation for tumor burden and overall survival. JQ1 treatment significantly reduced disease burden and increased survival time (Figure 7C-E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>).

Abnormal expression of c-Myc is frequently observed in a range of malignancies including breast, colon and cervical cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, osteosarcomas, glioblastomas and myeloid leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meyer and Penn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conacci-Sorrell et al., 2014</xref>). While c-Myc expression is required for tumor initiation and maintenance, c-Myc inactivation leads to tumor regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felsher and Bishop, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Soucek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabay et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, c-Myc represents an enticing target for pharmacological inhibition.</p><p>Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease characterized by the unrestricted proliferation of terminally differentiated plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>). The primary tumor-initiating events include genetic translocation and hyperploidy, while secondary events, such as oncogenic c-Myc activation and overexpression, drive MM progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergsagel and Kuehl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, studies by Chng and colleagues determined that c-Myc activation was prevalent in more than 60% of patient-derived MM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chng et al., 2011</xref>). Despite therapeutic advances and increases in survival, patients eventually succumb to treatment-refractory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Therapeutic strategies targeting c-Myc are complicated by the fact that c-Myc lacks a clear ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darnell, 2002</xref>). However, it is possible that c-Myc could be disrupted by other means, such as through disruption of chromatin-dependent signaling. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins are transcriptional regulators that epigenetically control the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, growth and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darnell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu and Chiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LeRoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>). BETs therefore provide potential therapeutic targets for modulating gene expression programs associated with various human diseases. Specifically, bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), a member of the BET subfamily that associates with acetylated chromatin to promote transcription, was reported to interact with the positive transcription elongation factor complex b (P-TEFb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Recruitment of P-TEFb by c-Myc was also reported, providing the rationale for Delmore and colleagues to explore targeting BET proteins to inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisgrove et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, BRD4 expression was found to positively correlate with MM disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). To interrogate this relationship, they used JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of the BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins, which has the highest affinity with BRD4 and competitively inhibits BET proteins from binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). While the (+)-JQ1 enantiomer potently inhibits BET proteins, the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains supporting an on-target mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Further support for the relationship between c-Myc and BET proteins was reported by Mertz and colleagues, who used gene expression profiling of cells treated with the active and inactive forms of the JQ1 inhibitor to identify <italic>MYC</italic> as a highly down-regulated gene following BET bromodomain inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative approach to direct c-Myc-targeting, Delmore and colleagues tested whether the BET inhibitor, JQ1, could effect c-Myc-specific gene silencing in MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). In Figure 3B, Delmore and colleagues assessed the ability of JQ1 to downregulate <italic>MYC</italic> transcription in the MM cell line MM.1S. In this experiment, MM.1S cells were treated with JQ1 for up to 8 hours and the relative expression of <italic>MYC</italic> was compared to untreated control cells. JQ1 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in <italic>MYC</italic> transcripts as determined by qRT-PCR. This key experiment shows that JQ1 was effective at silencing <italic>MYC</italic> gene transcription and will be replicated in Protocol 1. Importantly, Loven and colleagues also recently corroborated these results through the demonstration that JQ1 treatment in MM.1S cells significantly decreases <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loven et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to MM cell lines, JQ1 has proven to potently inhibit <italic>MYC</italic> in Merkel cell carcinoma cells (MCC-3 and 5), primary effusion lymphoma cells (PELs) and B cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas (B-ALL) cells at the transcript level, as well as in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells at the protein expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tolani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trabucco et al., 2015</xref>). However, JQ1-resistant cells have also been described. Specifically, JQ1 did not alter <italic>MYC</italic> transcription in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring alteration in KRAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shimamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horne et al., 2014</xref>). In lung adenocarcinoma cells (LACs), JQ1 was found to inhibit cell growth independent of <italic>MYC</italic> down regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lockwood et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In Figure 7C, 7D and 7E, the efficacy of JQ1 treatment was tested in mice harboring bioluminescent MM lesions. In these experiments, tumor burden was measured by whole-body bioluminescent imaging. Delmore and colleagues showed that JQ1 treatment significantly decreased disease burden and increased survival time compared to vehicle-treated control animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). Similar findings recapitulating the suppressive effect of JQ1 on solid tumor growth have been reported in MCC, DLBCL and PEL xenograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tolani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trabucco et al., 2015</xref>), and reduced leukemic burden in a B-ALL xenograft model with corresponding improvements in survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ott et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments will be replicated in Protocol 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protocol 1: evaluation of <italic>MYC</italic> expression in JQ1-treated MM.1S cells</title><p>This experiment analyzes the expression of endogenous <italic>MYC</italic> during pharmacological inhibition of BET bromodomains with JQ1.

The original report was unclear if the cells used for this experiment were MM.1S or MM.1S-LucNeo cells. This replication attempt will use MM.1S-LucNeo cells since this is the same cell line used in protocol 2 to assess the efficacy of JQ1 treatment in mice. The original details for the reverse transcription and qRT-PCR reactions were not known, thus the details used here are manufacturer recommended with the use of random hexamers to generate cDNA that are more representative of all regions of the transcripts. Following the first reaction, conditions will be adjusted if necessary to ensure proper quantitation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This Registered Report submission proposes to replicate key findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>, which reported the ability of the BRD inhibitor JQ1 to suppress <italic>MYC</italic> expression in a myeloma cell line and to extend survival of mice transplanted with this cell line. There was general agreement among the three Referees that the proposed studies will assess the major findings of Delmore et al., and will be highly relevant. The referees made the following recommendations to improve the protocols.</p><p>Protocol 1:</p><p>One reviewer noted that one of the main strengths of the published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>) was that JQ1 treatment led to downregulation of Myc was not limited to MM1.S cells, and that the effect was observed in several MM cell lines (Figure 3H and 3I). This is a key observation and we recommend that the qPCR analyses be extended to the MM cell types indicated in Figures 2A and 3I.</p><p>Addition of one more time point is recommended, the 1h treatment with 500 nM (+)-JQ1. This will indicate whether the Myc downregulation by JQ1 is as dynamic as reported.</p><p>In addition to the qPCR primers for Myc and GAPDH mentioned, the exact qPCR primers used by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>) should be included.</p><p>One reviewer requested scripts and a detailed description of the calculation performed with R. For example in Protocol 1, in the subsection headed “Test family”, the following sentence can be added: F test statistic (interaction) has been calculated following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen (2002)</xref> and the partial η2 has been calculated following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lakens (2013)</xref>.</p><p>This reviewer disagrees with the choice of a simple two-way ANOVA. In the original paper (Figure 3B) paired Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests were used. Since the replicated experiments are similar to the original ones a repeated measures anova is more appropriate. A carefully chosen repeated measures ANOVA is a natural extension of the paired <italic>t</italic>-test and can simplify the implementation of the proposed meta-analysis. A drawback with a repeated measures ANOVA is that it can be more difficult to set the parameters to determine the power. In such a case a sensitivity analysis can be performed with the G* power software.</p><p>Protocol 2:</p><p>Weight of mice should be recorded at day-0/day of injection.</p><p>In this protocol the analyses following an ANOVA have been performed using Fisher's LSD correction and alpha error = 0.05. In its basic form (I think the one used in the protocol) the LSD correction is not taking into account that multiple comparisons will be performed and therefore a Bonferroni correction (or other corrections) must be employed. For Protocol 2 this brings alpha to 0.025 and in practice is not dramatically changing the power calculations. As an alternative to Fisher's LSD followed by Bonferroni, the Hayter-Fisher's LSD procedure (Hayter, 1986) controls the MFWER (maximum family wise error rate).</p><p>Fisher's LSD correction has been reported also for survival data but it doesn't apply to this kind of data. Also here we need a (Bonferroni) correction. For the survival data, power calculations were performed with the Sample Size Calculator, however I do not have a clear link to the software. The authors should provide all the used parameters and references.</p><p>References:</p><p>Anthony J. Hayter. The maximum familywise error rate of fisher's least significant difference test.

The additional cell types would be a conceptual replication, which we agree is a useful approach to test the experiment’s underlying hypothesis, but which is not an aim of the project. Aspects of an experiment not included in the original study are occasionally added to ensure the quality of the research, but by no means is a requirement of this project; rather, it is an extension of the original work. Adding additional aspects not included in the original study can be of scientific interest, and can be included if it is possible to balance them with the main aim of this project: to perform a direct replication of the original experiment(s). As such, we will restrict our analysis to the experiments being replicated and will not include discussion of experiments not being replicated in this study.</p><p><italic>Addition of one more time point is recommended, the 1h treatment with 500 nM (+)-JQ1.

Additionally, we have added descriptions as suggested to more clearly describe the approach.</p><p><italic>This reviewer disagrees with the choice of a simple two-way ANOVA. In the original paper (Figure 3B) paired Student's</italic> t<italic>-tests were used. Since the replicated experiments are similar to the original ones a repeated measures ANOVA is more appropriate. A carefully chosen repeated measures ANOVA is a natural extension of the paired</italic> t<italic>-test and</italic> can <italic>simplify the implementation of the proposed meta-analysis. A drawback with a repeated measures ANOVA is that it</italic> can <italic>be more difficult to set the parameters to determine the power. In such a case a sensitivity analysis</italic> can <italic>be performed with the G* power software</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for catching the original analysis method. We have adjusted the planned analysis to include this approach. As the reviewer suggested, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the repeated measures ANOVA using the planned sample size and assuming 0 correlation among repeat measures and a nonsphericity correction of 1 to allow for a conservative estimate. We included the two planned comparisons (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests) assuming a correlation between groups of 0. This is because we do not have access to the original raw data. Additionally, it is not clear what df was used in the original paper since the reported p values suggest a larger effect size estimate than using the estimated means and standard deviations reported in the figure. This is likely due to the combination of the technical replicates (3) being combined with the biological replicates (2) giving a df of 5, opposed to using only the biological replicates (what is proposed in this manuscript), which gives a df of 2. Thus, we used the point estimated from G*Power using the estimated values from the graph reported in Figure 3B.</p><p>We are also proposing to analyze the data as originally planned (as a between subjects design) since the experimental set-up suggests this analysis. The sample comes from multiple random dishes of cells treated with or without drug. As such, it is possible to have a different number of data points in one group (vehicle) than the other (JQ1), thus making matched samples difficult. We think it is reasonable to use the independent test, and both analysis designs are reported in the literature. This will be considered additional exploratory analysis since it was not originally reported.</p><p><italic>Protocol 2</italic>:</p><p><italic>Weight of mice should be recorded at day-0/day of injection</italic>.</p><p>This is a parameter we have in the manuscript. Protocol 2, Step 5b. Weight of mice will be recorded during each day of injection during the course of the experiment.</p><p><italic>In this protocol the analyses following an ANOVA have been performed using Fisher's LSD correction and alpha error = 0.05. In its basic form (I think the one used in the protocol) the LSD correction is not taking into account that multiple comparisons will be performed and therefore a Bonferroni correction (or other corrections) must be employed. For Protocol 2 this brings alpha to 0.025 and in practice is not dramatically changing the power calculations. As an alternative to Fisher's LSD followed by Bonferroni, the Hayter-Fisher's LSD procedure (Hayter, 1986) controls the MFWER (maximum family wise error rate)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers comment on the use of a correction, such as Bonferroni or the modification of LSD by Hayter are ways to control for the MFWER, however as Hayter describes in his 1986 paper, this applies in situations where the ANOVA is unbalanced or with a balanced design with four or more populations. Since the proposed analysis is balanced with three population groups, the LSD is sufficiently conservative and powerful to account for the multiple comparisons in this specific situation. This is further explained by Levin et al., 1994 and discussed in Maxwell and Delaney, 2004 (Chapter 5) and Cohen, 2001 (Chapter 12).</p><p><italic>Fisher's LSD correction has been reported also for survival data but it doesn't apply to this kind of data. Also here we need a (Bonferroni) correction. For the survival data, power calculations were performed with the Sample Size Calculator, however I do not have a clear link to the software. The authors should provide all the used parameters and references</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this correction. We have updated the power calculations to reflect this adjustment.
