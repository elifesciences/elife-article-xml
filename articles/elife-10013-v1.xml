mammalian genes, <italic>Kcnt1</italic> and <italic>Kcnt2</italic>, encode pore-forming subunits of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Na</sub>) channels. Progress in understanding K<sub>Na</sub> channels has been hampered by the absence of specific tools and methods for rigorous K<sub>Na</sub> identification in native cells. Here, we report the genetic disruption of both <italic>Kcnt1</italic> and <italic>Kcnt2</italic>, confirm the loss of Slo2.2 and Slo2.1 protein, respectively, in KO animals, and define tissues enriched in Slo2 expression. Noting the prevalence of Slo2.2 in dorsal root ganglion, we find that KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, results in enhanced itch and pain responses. In dissociated small diameter DRG neurons, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, abolishes K<sub>Na</sub> current. Utilizing isolectin B4+ neurons, the absence of K<sub>Na</sub> current results in an increase in action potential (AP) firing and a decrease in AP threshold. Activation of K<sub>Na</sub> acts as a brake to initiation of the first depolarization-elicited AP with no discernible effect on afterhyperpolarizations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10013.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10013.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10013.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The billions of neurons in the brain send information along their lengths in the form of electrical signals called action potentials. These signals are produced by charged ions, such as sodium and potassium ions, moving into and out of the neuron. To ‘fire’ an action potential, sodium ions rapidly enter the neuron. This produces an electrical spike. Potassium ions then exit the neuron, which causes the electrical activity to subside and allows the neuron to return to a resting state.</p><p>The sodium and potassium ions move in and out of the neuron through structures called ion channels. The sodium-activated potassium channels are one type of ion channel; whether these ion channels let potassium ions out of a cell depends on the concentration of sodium ions inside the cell. Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 are two such potassium channels that are present in many different cells, including neurons. Nevertheless, and in spite of how common they are, the exact roles of these channels remain unclear.</p><p>Martinez-Espinosa et al. created mice that lack the genes encoding one or both of the Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 ion channels, and compared them with normal mice. Mice that lacked Slo2.2 but not Slo2.1 initially scratched more intensely than normal mice when made to feel an itch, though this increased scratching only occurred briefly. To some extent, the mice that lacked both Slo2 channels also had increased pain sensations.</p><p>Martinez-Espinosa et al. observed that in sensory neurons lacking the Slo2.2 sodium-dependent potassium channels, the neurons fired more action potentials. The increase in firing is thought to underlie the enhanced itching and pain sensations.</p><p>Taken together, the results suggest that the activity of sodium-activated potassium ion channels makes it less likely for a neuron to fire an action potential. Future work will need to address whether the activity of sodium-activated potassium channels is linked to specific kinds of sodium channels, and why the absence of the sodium-activated potassium current only enhances the immediate response to itch stimuli. The availability of these mice that lack Slo2 subunits provides an important new tool for evaluating the role of sodium-activated channels in other neuronal systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10013.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10013.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>SLO2</kwd><kwd>KNa current</kwd><kwd>DRG</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM081748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lingle</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM066215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lingle</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sodium-activated potassium ion currents encoded by the <italic>kcnt1</italic> gene delay action potential firing in DRG neurons by activity preceding an action potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Potassium channels regulated by cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Na</sub>) are encoded by two homologous mammalian genes, <italic>Kcnt1</italic> (encoding the Slo2.2 or Slack channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>Kcnt2</italic> (encoding the Slo2.1 or Slick channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</xref>). Recent work has revealed a critical role of K<sub>Na</sub> channels in neuronal function, through demonstration that several mutations in <italic>Kcnt1</italic> are associated with intellectual disability and childhood epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, despite apparently wide-spread expression both in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2005</xref>) and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kameyama et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niu and Meech, 2000</xref>), the physiological roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents during normal patterns of neuronal activity remain poorly understood in part because of the absence of suitably selective pharmacological tools and also the complexities than can arise from manipulations of Na<sup>+</sup>. Because of potential coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> activation to Na<sup>+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) channels, K<sub>Na</sub> currents have been proposed to influence repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gribkoff and Kaczmarek, 2009</xref>) and postexcitatory afterhyperpolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that K<sub>Na</sub> currents may be selectively activated by Na<sup>+</sup> influx through Nav channel openings that persist at steady state following inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>). To further probe the role of K<sub>Na</sub> currents, we have genetically disrupted <italic>Kcnt1</italic> and <italic>Kcnt2</italic> genes to generate mouse strains in which Slo2.1, Slo2.2, or both subunits together (Slo2 dKO) have been deleted. Because previous work has suggested an important role of Slo2 channels in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nuwer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biton et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the consequences of K<sub>Na</sub> KO on sensory function and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability. The results reveal a role of Slo2.2 channels in acute itch sensation. Pruritic stimuli trigger an immediate increase in itch response in Slo2.2 KO mice, with later time points indistinguishable from WT animals. Furthermore, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, removes a K<sub>Na</sub> current from all small-diameter DRG neurons examined. To examine effects of Slo2 KO on DRG excitability, we focused on small diameter neurons, immunoreactive for isolectin Β4 (IB4+), which are known to be enriched in neurons responsive to itch and pain stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>). Slo2 KO increases firing frequency at any level of current injection, while decreasing both rheobase and action potential (AP) threshold. Contrary to the view that K<sub>Na</sub> current functions primarily during AP repolarization and afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwindt et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallen et al., 2007</xref>), we propose that in DRG neurons activation of K<sub>Na</sub> current precedes AP initiation thereby acting as a brake to AP firing. During completion of this work, another paper describing a Slo2.2 KO mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) importantly identified a potential role of Slo2.2 in DRG in a neuropathic pain model. Here we reveal a role of Slo2.2 in acute sensory responses and provide a new explanation for how cell firing is altered by Slo2.2 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and validation of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 KO animals</title><p>Slo2.1 (gene: <italic>Kcnt2</italic>) and Slo2.2 (gene: Kcnt1) KO mice were generated via homologous recombination of specific targeting DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>) into the genome of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with confirmation by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>), generation of chimeric mice following injection of recombinant ES cells into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and then ultimately Cre/loxP mediated deletion of the targeted exons. Successful incorporation of the mutant allele into mice was confirmed by PCR genotyping of genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). The absence of specific native Slo2 protein was confirmed by western blots of total brain membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; See ‘Materials and methods’ for discussion of Slo2 epitopes identified by antibodies). Enrichment of brain Slo2 protein via sequential co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and western blot further validated the successful KO of Slo2 proteins and also established that Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 coassemble in WT brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>), as indicated in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). As a guide to tissues of interest for future study, quantitative RT-PCR was employed on various tissues to define the relative abundance of message for <italic>Kcnt1</italic> and <italic>Kcnt2</italic> message (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). mRNAs encoding either Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 are broadly present in the central nervous system, with message for Slo2.1 notably more abundant in heart and aorta and message for Slo2.2 relatively enriched in other tissues including DRG and cerebellum. The selective expression of transcript for Slo2.1 in rat heart has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</xref>). Based on the RT-PCR results, we examined DRG, spinal cord, cortex, cerebellum and heart for the presence of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 subunits using sequential IP and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>). Slo2.1 protein was detected in DRG, spinal cord, cortex and heart, but only a very weak band was seen from cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Slo2.2 was observed in DRG, spinal cord, cortex, and cerebellum, but not detectable in heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Co-IP between Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 was observed in those tissues for which both subunits were detectable: DRG, spinal cord, and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Because K<sub>Na</sub> currents have been described in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamsett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nuwer et al., 2010</xref>), we chose DRG as a convenient system for investigation of potential physiological roles.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10013.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction and validation of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper row: map of WT mouse <italic>Kcnt2</italic> (encoding Slo2.1) gene locus within genomic DNA bracketing the targeted exon 22.

A cheek injection assay has been proposed to distinguish itch from pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>). In the cheek, injection of HA elicits hindlimb scratching, while capsaicin injection elicits forepaw wiping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>), suggesting that they are being perceived differently. We wondered whether a pruritic stimulus injected into the cheek of a Slo2 dKO mouse might elicit a capsaicin-like forepaw wiping response. In our hands, cheek injection of CQ in WT animals was associated with two types of behaviors, hindlimb scratching of the injected site, but also some forepaw wiping presumably reflecting grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the dKO animals, forepaw wiping was no different than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but the hindlimb scratching was markedly increased only during the first 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We have not had reliable success with subtractive methods involving Na<sup>+</sup> current inhibition or Na<sup>+</sup> replacement. To test for the presence of K<sub>Na</sub> current in small diameter DRG neurons, we used a method previously applied to rat DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>): a K<sup>+</sup> background current arising from defined pipette Na<sup>+</sup> is measured using hyperpolarizing voltage-steps during the first 5 min following formation of the whole-cell recording configuration. With 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, little background current is observed with voltage-steps from −80 to −120 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). With 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, net current elicited by the same voltage-step gradually increases over 3 min reaching a plateau near 1 nA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). At longer times following whole-cell access, current activated by 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> gradually diminishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) despite no change in voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> current. As in rat DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>), the K<sub>Na</sub> current is blocked by extracellular 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup>, with stronger inhibition at −120 mV than −80 mV reflecting the voltage-dependence of Cs<sup>+</sup> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The average amplitude of K<sub>Na</sub> current was similar for WT and Slo2.1 KO DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), while there was no K<sub>Na</sub> current in Slo2.2 KO or Slo2 dKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Despite considerable variability in total K<sub>Na</sub> current among neurons from either WT or Slo2.1 KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the total current always exceeds that observed in WT cells with 0 Na<sup>+</sup>, or in Slo2 dKO or Slo2.2 KO cells with 70 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Excised inside-out patches confirmed that Slo2 dKO removed a Na–dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) which exhibited little voltage-dependence over the range of −80 through −20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>) with a single channel conductance of about 127 pS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Our results suggest that essentially all dissociated small diameter DRG neurons express K<sub>Na</sub> current which can be attributed exclusively to Slo2.2 subunits. The magnitude of the K<sub>Na</sub> current decreased with time in culture, being ∼1013 ± 95 pA (n = 44 cells) after 2–10 hr of culture, but only 277 ± 70 pA (n = 9 cells) after 2–3 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Measurement of K<sub>Na</sub> current in a set of small diameter neurons in DRG slices yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, one difference was that, although Slo2.2 accounted for most of the K<sub>Na</sub> current in DRG neurons in slices, after 2–3 min of dialysis of the pipette solution into the Slo2.2 KO neurons, some residual Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent current was observed. Although neurons in slices may be uniquely affected by dialysis of 70 mM cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup>, this observation raises the possibility that channels containing Slo2.1 subunits may be present at more peripheral locations in the DRG neurons, perhaps consistent with the presence of message encoding Slo2.1 and some Slo2.1 protein in DRG samples, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DRG neurons from Slo2 dKO mice exhibit increased excitability and reduced rheobase</title><p>Small diameter DRG neurons exhibit a complex range of electrical properties reflecting a rich variety of Nav (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vijayaragavan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho and O'Leary, 2011</xref>) and Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2010b</xref>).

AP waveforms were then transformed into phase plots (dV/dt vs V) for each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Since peak dV/dt can vary substantially among cells, we have defined the threshold in a given cell as the V<sub>m</sub> value at which dV/dt reaches 10% of its peak value (dotted lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). This comparison shows that APs are initiated from a more negative V<sub>m</sub> in dKO cells than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). In contrast to the effects of Slo2 dKO on AP initiation, a number of other properties of single APs, including peak AP amplitude, AP half-width, and AP after-hyperpolarization, showed no obvious differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, with both 10 and 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, dKO cells exhibited a somewhat more depolarized V<sub>m</sub>, although no obvious difference in input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) measured from a 10 mV step from −60 to −70 mV was noted. Potential reasons for the apparent discrepancy between V<sub>m</sub> and R<sub>in</sub> will be considered below.</p><p>If the difference in apparent AP threshold between WT and dKO cells arises from outward K<sub>Na</sub> current present in the WT cells that delays the activation of Nav current, a voltage-clamp ramp protocol that better approximates the slow depolarization preceding an AP might also reveal a difference between WT and dKO neurons. From a holding potential of −60 mV, cells were therefore stimulated with a 40 ms voltage-ramp up to −20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). We observed that the V<sub>m</sub> at which the overall current became net inward was more negative in dKO cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,I</xref>). Prior to the surge of Nav current activation, the ramp reveals a modest outward current, which is larger on average in WT cells and which in WT cells slightly shifts rightward the voltage at which net current becomes inward, relative to dKO cells.</p><p>Although the properties of the ramp-activated outward current and shift in 0 current potential are generally consistent with the loss of outward current activated at the onset of depolarization, a concern in regards to the above experiments is that the comparisons are being made between cell populations from genotypically distinct animals. For example, a shift in Nav channel activation to more negative potentials in dKO neurons might produce qualitatively similar effects. We therefore tested several inhibitors and activators of K<sub>Na</sub> current as tools to examine the properties of ramp-activated current in WT cells, but slow onset of action and non-specific effects on other ion channels precluded their use. As an alternative, having shown that extracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> inhibits K<sub>Na</sub> current, we examined the ability of 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> to influence excitability and ramp-activated currents in both WT and dKO DRG neurons with 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As shown above, the voltage-ramp activated a much more pronounced low-voltage outward current in WT cells than in dKO cells, with a marked shift in the 0 current potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Application of 20 mM extracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> to WT neurons also resulted in a reduction in ramp-activated outward current and a shift in the 0 current voltage (p = 0.000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), quite comparable to the current observed in the dKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In contrast, application of 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> to the dKO cells produced only small shifts in the 0 current voltage (p = 0.675; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Overall, 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> mimicked the effect of Slo2 dKO on the 0 current voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), while also producing essentially identical effects on measurement of rheobase in the same set of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). That an apparent shift in the voltages over which the surge of inward current is observed can occur from K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibition is also highlighted in comparisons of the normalized ramp activated currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which clearly shows the ability of Cs<sup>+</sup> to produce a shift in apparent inward current activation in WT cells which is much more reduced in the dKO cells. Inhibition by Cs<sup>+</sup> is likely to differ from Slo2 dKO in two primary ways: first, K<sub>Na</sub> will not be inhibited completely by Cs<sup>+</sup> at these voltages and second, Cs<sup>+</sup> is likely to inhibit other K<sup>+</sup> currents in addition to K<sub>Na</sub>. However, the results clearly support the view that an apparent shift in inward current activation occurs with inhibition of subthreshold K<sup>+</sup> currents, likely to include K<sub>Na</sub>.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10013.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Cs<sup>+</sup> inhibition of outward current in WT, but not dKO, neurons recapitulates properties of Slo2 dKO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Traces show averaged currents activated by the indicated voltage-ramp protocol (top) for 10 WT and 10 dKO neurons.

Step-activated inactivating current and the voltage of half-activation of the inward current was roughly similar in both WT and dKO neurons, with similar reductions produced by 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). The absence of obvious differences between the Nav currents in WT and dKO neurons make it highly unlikely that a difference in Nav current between WT and dKO neurons accounts for the differences in rheobase and ramp-activated 0 current potential. Furthermore, if the effect of Cs on ramp-activated current were to arise from an effect on Nav current, an inhibition of Nav current would be expected to shift the 0 current voltage rightward. This is not observed. Together, these results support the view that the Cs<sup>+</sup> induced inhibition of ramp-activated outward current and the shift in the 0 current voltage arise solely from inhibition of a K<sup>+</sup> current. Whatever this current is, it is apparently absent in the dKO neurons. Although it is perhaps possible that some other low voltage activated K<sup>+</sup> current other than K<sub>Na</sub> is also absent in the dKO neurons, the simpler view is that the difference in excitability between the WT and dKO neurons arises from the absence of the K<sub>Na</sub> current itself.</p><p>To ascertain whether there might be changes in other components of current between this particular set of WT and dKO neurons, we also compared steady-state current at the end of a 20 ms voltage-step in the same set of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). Although net outward current was generally similar in both groups, the dKO cells exhibited a larger outward at command potentials from −10 mV and more positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2E</xref>). However, over the range of −120 to almost −20 mV, there was no obvious difference in this steady-state current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2F</xref>). With 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, no significant difference was observed in the resting conductance measured from a fit of the I–Vs between −120 and −60 mV, suggesting that there is little obvious basal activation of K<sub>Na</sub> current with 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. Although these results also indicate that, in the voltage range of −50 to −20 mV, there are other Cs<sup>+</sup>-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> conductances besides K<sub>Na</sub> active at the end of 20 ms steps, these do not appear to differ significantly between WT and dKO neurons, again supporting the idea that the observed differences in excitability are likely to arise from changes in K<sub>Na</sub> alone.</p><p>Given that in many other cells K<sub>Na</sub> may play a role in slow AHPs, we also specifically addressed this question in WT DRG neurons. For example, in cells of the thalamic paraventricular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>), it has been shown that trains of APs produce a slow development of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent AHPs dependent on the number and frequency of APs in the trains. We therefore examined the consequences of an increasing number of APs on AHPs in IB4+ small diameter neurons. Trains of 5 or 10 APs applied at 7 Hz were unable to elicit any slow AHP in IB4+ small diameter neurons different from that elicited by a single AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This further suggests that K<sub>Na</sub> current in DRG neurons, at least with physiological ionic solutions, contributes negligibly to membrane potential regulation following APs.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10013.024</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>AP trains in IB4+ small diameter DRG neurons do not develop slow AHPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cell was maintained at a resting potential of −50 mV and stimulated with either 1, 5, of 10 pulses of 10 ms duration and 200 pA amplitude, with a pulse frequency of 7.1 Hz.

The absence of a difference in resting conductance between WT and dKO neurons at potentials between −60 and −120 mV suggests that basal K<sub>Na</sub> activation is minimal. Therefore, an influence of K<sub>Na</sub> current at the foot of AP generation presumably requires a source of Na<sup>+</sup> and perhaps a requirement for coupling to local Na<sup>+</sup> influx. Although it has been proposed that K<sub>Na</sub> channels may be coupled to influx through particular subtypes of Nav channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>), the results here would require that such coupling must be very tight and occur immediately upon Nav activation. Future work will be required to address these issues, but the results here suggest new considerations on the conditions under which K<sub>Na</sub> activation may occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Direct evidence supporting the existence of K<sub>Na</sub> channels in native cells first appeared about 25–30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kameyama et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bader et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dryer et al., 1989</xref>). Yet, even with identification of the two mammalian Slo2 genes that encode K<sub>Na</sub> channels of the type observed in the early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2003</xref>), full definition of functional properties and physiological roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents have proven somewhat elusive, despite the apparently widespread distribution of Slo2 subunits in excitable tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2005</xref>). Recent demonstration of neurological disorders linked to Slo2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2014</xref>) further highlights the potential importance of such channels. The availability of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 KO mice will now provide an additional tool to probe the roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents. The present results demonstrating the loci of expression of message for Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 subunits, the presence of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 protein in various tissues, and the natural occurrence of Slo2.1/Slo2.2 heteromultimers confirms and extends earlier work regarding the loci of expression of Slo2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamsett et al., 2009</xref>), while also providing KO controls confirming the utility of antibodies in western blots. Here, focusing on the role of Slo2.2 in sensory function, we observed that Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, KO results in enhanced itch and, to a lesser extent, pain responses. Furthermore, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, results in complete absence of the DRG K<sub>Na</sub> current. This loss of Slo2 current results in increased excitability in response to depolarizing stimuli, likely accounting for the observed phenotypes.</p><p>An important point of the present results is that the primary effect of K<sub>Na</sub> removal is to reduce AP threshold, with little or no clear effect on AHPs following an AP. The effect on AP threshold was revealed in multiple kinds of tests, a decrease in rheobase, a negative shift in AP threshold determined from the rate of AP rise (dV/dt), and also from a similar negative shift in the voltage at which current becomes net inward during a ramp protocol. Similar changes in AP threshold were observed with both 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, excluding a key role for differences in pipette Na<sup>+</sup> as a determinant of basal K<sub>Na</sub> activation. Overall, the results require that K<sub>Na</sub> acts as a mild brake to the onset of AP initiation. Furthermore, we observed no difference in AHP amplitude measured following single APs between WT and KO cells, either with 0 or 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. Trains of APs also did not evoke the development of slower AHPs.</p><p>A role of K<sub>Na</sub> activity preceding the AP upswing in DRG neurons differs fundamentally from other explanations of the proposed role of K<sub>Na</sub> current in other cells. In different cases, a primary role for K<sub>Na</sub> current has been proposed either in fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gribkoff and Kaczmarek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markham et al., 2013</xref>) or slower afterhyperpolarizations that may require trains of several APs to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwindt et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and McCormick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>). In the case of rapid coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> activation to single APs, this potentially provides a mechanism to facilitate high frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), while slow AHP development serves to support AP accommodation and termination of burst activity. The present results do not preclude such roles for K<sub>Na</sub> either in rapid repolarization or slow AHPs in other cells. However, the specific role of K<sub>Na</sub> channels in any cell would depend intimately on the balance of other repolarizing conductances, along with magnitude, spatial, and temporal properties of any cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] elevation. In this regards, it is worth mentioning that some of the best support for the presence of K<sub>Na</sub> currents in cortical neurons has required conditions under which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent outward currents are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwindt et al., 1989</xref>). Given the abundance of other repolarizing conductances in DRG neurons, it is perhaps not unexpected that modest K<sub>Na</sub> activation during AP repolarization in DRG neurons may have negligible effects on V<sub>m</sub>. Our observations are, in fact, consistent with earlier results in rat DRG neurons, in which both AP duration and AHPs were unchanged when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced by Li<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>), despite the fact that Li<sup>+</sup> does not substitute for Na<sup>+</sup> in K<sub>Na</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Safronov and Vogel, 1996</xref>).</p><p>If K<sub>Na</sub> activity acts as a brake to AP initiation, how is K<sub>Na</sub> activation elicited? Despite the well-established existence of K<sub>Na</sub> channels, the circumstances under which cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> elevation arising from physiological stimuli is sufficient to produce K<sub>Na</sub> activation remain unclear. In fact, consideration of basic properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion and the expected Na<sup>+</sup> flux through single channels have raised some doubt whether average [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can ever be sufficient to activate K<sub>Na</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dryer, 1991</xref>). Some aspects of our data partially address these issues, but there are complexities in our observations that are not readily explained. The differences in firing properties of WT and dKO cells, both with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, suggest that K<sub>Na</sub> activation is unaffected over the range of 0–10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. This is not surprising given that the threshold for K<sub>Na</sub> activation may be higher than 10 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamsett et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, when R<sub>in</sub> was measured with a step from −60 to −70 mV, no difference between WT and dKO neurons was observed either with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. Similarly, with R<sub>in</sub> measured by a fit to the I–V relationship over voltages from −120 to −60 mV with 0 Na<sup>+</sup> pipette solution, no Cs<sup>+</sup> dependent inhibition of conductance was observed in either WT or dKO neurons. Although it has been suggested that some Slo2.2 channel activation may occur in 0 Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), the present results suggest that in DRG neurons basal K<sub>Na</sub> activity at potentials negative to −60 mV does not occur. However, both with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, WT cells exhibited a slightly more negative V<sub>m</sub> than dKO cells. If pipette Na<sup>+</sup> itself does not influence the differences in WT cells from dKO cells, how might these differences arise? The largely linear behavior of both the WT and dKO neuron steady-state I–V relationship from −120 mV to −60 mV begins to exhibit distinct upward curvature in the range of −60 to −50 mV, bracketing the range of measured membrane potentials. This would suggest that conductances are active at rest that are apparently not active negative to −60 mV. Based on the differences in WT and dKO resting potentials, K<sub>Na</sub> current is clearly a candidate for one of these conductances. In addition, that V<sub>m</sub> is close to −50 mV with E<sub>K</sub> ∼ −80 mV suggests that there may be appreciable inward Na current at potentials above −60 mV. Future work will be required to assess the identity of any components of Na<sup>+</sup> current active at such potentials. Voltage-step protocols used here from a holding potential of −70 mV reveal little obvious inward current until at least −30 mV. Both Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels are known to be expressed in some small diameter IB4+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strickland et al., 2008</xref>) and Nav1.9, in particular, may begin to activate at potentials close to resting potentials we have observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rugiero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2011b</xref>). Another possibility reflects the proposal that K<sub>Na</sub> currents in some neurons may be selectively activated by persistent TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>). TTX-sensitive Nav1.7 channels can be found in small diameter DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassar et al., 2004</xref>) and, although such channels are largely inactivated near DRG resting potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vijayaragavan et al., 2001</xref>), it is possible that even under steady-state inactivated conditions some persistent openings occur. Perhaps as Slo1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels are coupled to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkefeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2008</xref>), molecular coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> channels to specific sources of Na<sup>+</sup> influx may occur.</p><p>Although the changes in rheobase, AP threshold, and increase in excitability observed in the dKO animals can largely consistent with what one would expect from the simple demonstrated removal of K<sub>Na</sub> current, there is also the possibility that genetic deletion of Slo2 protein may result in compensatory changes that account for some of the observed effects. This issue might be of particular concern in regards to DRG neurons, since it is well-known that a variety of manipulations can readily induce changes in various DRG current properties, including Nav channels, resulting in altered excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chahine and O'Leary, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in the particular case of Slo2.2, it has been proposed that severe human pathologies associated with Slo2.2 mutation arise from extensive alterations in gene and protein expression throughout the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaczmarek, 2013</xref>). In the present case, two possible alternative mechanisms by which rheobase, AP threshold, and excitability might be altered as observed in the Slo2 dKO neurons would be, first, a shift in Nav current activation to more negative potentials and, second, a loss of some other K<sup>+</sup> current active in the subthreshold range of voltages. Although we cannot fully exclude that there have been no changes other than loss of K<sub>Na</sub> current in the Slo2 dKO DRG neurons, the demonstration that inhibition of subthreshold K<sup>+</sup> current by Cs<sup>+</sup> mimicked the behavior of the dKO neurons strongly argues that a change in Nav channel expression does not underlie the observed phenotypes and, furthermore, that removal of a sub-threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductance can produce the particular constellation of changes we have observed. Finally, we did not observe any indication of a loss in a near threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductance other than K<sub>Na</sub>, although any such change might be difficult to resolve.</p><p>It is instructive to consider how much K<sub>Na</sub> current activation might be required to account for changes in resting potential. Assuming a simple modified GHK conductance equation and a relative balance of G<sub>K</sub>, G<sub>Na</sub>, and G<sub>Cl</sub> (net R<sub>in</sub> = 858 MΩ; G<sub>in</sub> = 1.165 nS) to yield a resting potential near −50 mV, increasing the background G<sub>K</sub> of 0.7 nS with an additional activation of 0.16 nS G<sub>KNa</sub> results in additional hyperpolarization of ∼3.3 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, we observed an average K<sub>Na</sub> conductance of 69 nS activated by 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> around −50 mV. Although 70 mM Na<sup>+</sup> produces a less than maximal activation, if one assumes a maximal conductance of 69 nS, the fractional activation of K<sub>Na</sub> required to produce a 3–4 mV hyperpolarization corresponds to a Po of about 0.002, which corresponds to 8 pA at −50 mV. If these calculations are generally correct, it is not surprising that it would be difficult to identify procedures to directly examine such a current.</p><p>The severity of the human patients with apparent Slo2.2 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heron et al., 2012</xref>) naturally raises a question regarding whether suitable phenotype tests may uncover cognitive impairments in the Slo2 dKO mice. Any such deficits, if they exist, apparently spare the basic ability of the dKO animals to eat, mate, and function in a generally normal way. Perhaps relevant to the possibility that Slo2.2 KO may have apparently benign functional consequences, one set of the human Slo2.2 mutations corresponds to gain-of-function changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barcia et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in larger K<sub>Na</sub> currents. Perhaps the presence of Slo2.2 subunits of altered function results in more deleterious consequences than the complete absence of such subunits.</p><p>Recent work on another Slo2.2 KO model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) also focused on sensory function with some complementary results. In both cases, exon 11 of the gene encoding Slo2.2 was deleted. Both groups observe similar absence of effects of Slo2.2 KO on hotplate and formalin tests. Given the absence of effects on acute pain responses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al. (2015)</xref> focused on neuropathic pain responses, observing that Slo2.2 activation reduces neuropathic pain and does not acutely influence sensory responses. However, our results clearly show that Slo2.2 KO influences the immediate response to sensory stimuli, in particular, itch. Furthermore, an enhancement of the acute responses to capsaicin also occurs at lower doses. Both groups also observed increased excitability in neurons lacking K<sub>Na</sub> current, although the basis for the enhanced excitability was not examined in detail by the other group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). However, we suggest that the increase in DRG neuron excitability observed in both studies is consistent with enhancement of the immediate response to a sensory stimulus.</p><p>Why do some aversive tests, for example, hotplate, formalin, tail flick, and cold plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), show no difference between WT and Slo2.2 KO? We envision three possible explanations. First, as suggested by the dose-dependence of capsaicin responses, perhaps regulation of K<sub>Na</sub> current has more impact on weaker stimuli or relatively weak depolarizing drive, whereas, with stimuli that elicit strong initial depolarization, modest K<sub>Na</sub> activation will be less likely to influence AP generation. Second, even if K<sub>Na</sub> is present in most small diameter DRG neurons, different categories of such neurons may have other conductances that diminish the impact of loss of K<sub>Na</sub> current. Third, perhaps there are small diameter neurons, or certainly DRG neurons of other sizes, that may not have K<sub>Na</sub> current.</p><p>In sum, we propose that, in small diameter IB4+ DRG neurons, K<sub>Na</sub> currents influence AP onset, with greatest effect during low frequency firing. The particular properties of K<sub>Na</sub> currents, specifically modest intrinsic voltage-dependence but voltage-dependence perhaps acquired through coupling to its cytosolic ligand, Na<sup>+</sup>, may be well-suited to influence the initial upswing of AP generation, at a time when other K<sup>+</sup> conductances are largely quiescent.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>Animals were handled and housed according to the National Institutes of Health Committee on Laboratory Animal Resources guidelines.

The needle was inserted at the midline near the heel and advanced anteriorly to the base of the second or third toe, where the drug was injected, forming a bleb that usually extended back to the initial point of entry. Capsaicin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was first dissolved in 95% ethanol (100 μg/μl) before diluting to the desired concentrations in PBS.

Total RNA from different mouse tissues was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Before the reverse transcription, total RNA was treated to remove genome DNA with the DNA-free Kit (AM1906, Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, United States). cDNA was synthesized using the Retroscript Kit (AM1710, Applied Biosystems). For the negative control groups, all components except the reverse transcriptase MMLV-RT were included in the reaction mixtures. Real-Time PCR with specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Mouse β-actin gene was utilized here as the homogenous standard. The running protocol extended to 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system. PCR specificity was checked by dissociation curve analysis and DNA electrophoresis. Primer efficiency was validated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2009</xref>).

Mature male mice were sacrificed for preparation of membrane proteins from whole brain, cerebellum, cortex and spinal cord, respectively. 1 g of mouse whole brain, cortex, cerebellum, or spinal was homogenized with Teflon-glass pestle in 10 ml ice-cold 0.32 sucrose in PBS, including 100 μl 1.5 M PMSF in acetone and 100 μl Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).

Hearts from four mature male mice were dissected, washed with PBS and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen hearts were pulverized with liquid nitrogen pulverizer and then homogenized on ice with Teflon-glass pestle in 3 ml TE(pH 7.6) buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 20 μl PMSF (1.5 M in acetone) and 20 μl Protease Inhibitor Cocktail.

The beads were removed by a brief spin at 14,000×<italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was carefully collected and mixed with 8 μg monoclonal anti-mSlo2.1 (N11/33) or anti-mSlo2.2 (N3/26) antibody (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA, United States) at 4°C cold room for 2 hr, followed by the addition of 80 μl Protein A/G Plus agarose beads. The mixture was rocked overnight and then centrifuged briefly to collect the beads. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and the bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 100 μl SDS loading buffer containing 100 mM DTT.</p><p>For western blotting, aliquots of total protein preparations or membrane protein preparations was mixed well with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer containing 100 mM DTT, maintained at room temperature for 30 min before loading onto 8% Precise Protein Gels (Pierce, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, United States). Protein markers were EZ-Run Prestained Rec Protein Ladder (Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes with the Trans-Blot Semi-Dry Transfer System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 solution (pH 7.3) at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C in 5 ml blocking solution containing monoclonal anti-mSlo2.1 or anti-mSlo2.2 antibody (10 μg/ml, Antibodies Inc). After washing with 5 ml blocking solution × 5 min for four times, membranes were incubated with 5 ml blocking solution containing Mouse Trueblot Ultra HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (at 1:2000 dilution, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, United States) at room temperature for 1 hr. After four-time washing with 5 ml blocking solution, HRP-labeling was developed using Amersham ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, United States). A specific Slo2.1 band in WT heart Slo2.1-IP sample was not detected in the first round of western blot with the monoclonal anti-Slo2.1 antibody (10 μg/ml, Antibodies Inc.). To visualize a Slo2.1-specific band, the initial western blot was stripped with Re-Blot Plus Mild Solution (Millipore; Billerica, MA, United States) and then the PVDF membrane was reblotted with the same antibody.</p><p>For western blotting, NeuroMab anti-Slo2.1 antibody (#75-055) targets amino acids 564–624 of Slo2.1; NeuroMab anti-Slo2.2 antibody (#75-051) is against amino acids 1168–1237 of Slo2.2. Slo2.1 KO predicts a residual protein Slo2.1(1–828) with a predicted MW of 91 kDa, which should be recognized by the NeuroMab antibody, but is not observed in the Slo2.1 KO brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This indicates that, following deletion of exon 22, no residual Slo2.1 protein remains in the knockout mouse, probably due to the instability of the truncated mRNA or protein. In the case of Slo2.2 KO, deletion of exon 11 (encoding amino acids 285–354 of Slo2.2) causes a frame-shift such that the predicted residual Slo2.2(1–252) protein does not contain the sequence recognized by the NeuroMab anti-Slo2.2 antibody. Therefore, no residual Slo2.2 protein was detected in Slo2.2 KO membrane samples. Since the residual Slo2.2(1–252) is terminated in the middle of the S6 segment of the inner helix, it seems unlikely that any residual Slo2.2 protein fragments in the knockout mouse would assemble into functional channels. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,D</xref>, it is clear that knocking out the gene for Slo2.1 has no obvious effect on the presence of Slo2.2 protein, and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Acute DRG dissociation</title><p>After removal of DRG from 3 to 5 week old mice, ganglia were desheathed and then incubated in 15 U/ml papain/L-cysteine in HBSS without calcium and magnesium (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37°C.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers one of whom, Richard Aldrich, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>This manuscript examines the consequences of global knockouts of <italic>slo2.1</italic> and <italic>slo2.2</italic> channels on the electrophysiology of small-diameter DRG neurons and on behavioral tests of acute pain and itch. The authors find that knockout of <italic>slo2.2</italic> channels but not <italic>slo2.1</italic> channels results in somewhat enhanced rapid pain and itch responses, most notably in the scratching induced by chloroquine or histamine injection in the first 5 minutes after injection, when wild-type animals have only small responses. In terms of electrophysiology, the authors do two sets of experiments. In one, they identify a sodium-activated conductance that is induced by dialyzing cells with 70 mM Na and show that this is gone in <italic>slo2.2</italic> KO animals. In the second, they study firing properties of the neurons with either physiological (10 mM) or 0 mM internal sodium. Surprisingly, they find that the <italic>slo2.2</italic>-KO animals have enhanced firing frequencies in either condition, accompanied by a reduction in spike threshold.</p><p>The work presented in the paper is done well technically and the results are interesting and novel. Another recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>, duly cited) also examined <italic>slo2.2</italic> KO mice for both electrophysiology of DRG neurons and for behavioral pain responses (but not itch). Unlike the present manuscript, Lu et al. reported no changes in acute pain responses but only in models of neuropathic pain. There is no real experimental conflict, because in the present manuscript the effects on acute pain were actually quite subtle, and were most clearly illustrated by a change in the dose-response curve for capsaicin injections. In the present manuscript the most dramatic effect in the knockout was a large increase in scratching in the first 5 minutes after injection of chloroquine and histamine, and itching was not tested by Lu et al. Therefore the behavioral effects in this manuscript are novel and interesting.</p><p>The electrophysiology in the present manuscript is far more extensive and detailed than in the Lu et al. manuscript, although the basic observation of increased excitability in the <italic>slo2.2</italic>-KO animals is similar.</p><p>As explained in detail below, a number of additional experiments need to be included to rule out alternative interpretations of the results. We feel that these can be reasonably accomplished.</p><p>There are several major issues in the present paper concerning the interpretation of the electrophysiology experiments. In the first series of experiments, the authors show that a Na-dependent conductance is produced by cell dialysis with 70 mM and that this conductance is lacking in the <italic>slo2.2</italic>-KO animals. In this part of the paper, everything suggests that this conductance is completely lacking in WT cells dialyzed with 0 mM Na. But in the second section of electrophysiology, the authors examine changes in firing behavior in the KO animals and find that the changes in excitability are exactly the same when the cells are dialyzed with 0 mM Na as with 10 mM Na. They then interpret the effects in 0 mM Na as suggesting either that the <italic>slo2.2</italic> conductance can actually be present even in the absence of internal Na, or that there is somehow enough Na-entry even at subthreshold voltages to activate the channels. The first possibility seems completely at odds with the first series of experiments, where they see no difference between WT and KO animals with 0 mM internal Na. This seeming inconsistency is not discussed. And there is no attempt to actually test the second possibility.</p><p>The authors never consider another possibility – that the changes in excitability are not directly due to loss of Na-activated K current but rather reflect changes in other conductances occurring as a result of developmental changes occurring in the KO animals, or other effects involving changes in protein synthesis by loss of <italic>slo2.2</italic>, for which there is previous evidence. This seems likely. As a whole, the changes in excitability seem far more consistent with a change in other conductances (e.g. an increase or change in voltage-dependence of voltage-activated sodium current, or possibly a reduction in a voltage-dependent potassium current) than a loss of Na-activated K current.</p><p>Specific:</p><p>1) As noted, there is a fundamental contradiction between the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> showing that the conductance identified as <italic>slo2.2</italic> current is lacking when cells are dialyzed with 0 mM Na and the interpretation of the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref> where it is assumed that this conductance is somehow present even with 0 mM internal Na. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, there is no data for the double KO with 0 mM Na internal. If the conductance with this condition is really the same as WT with 0 Na, then the speculation later that there might be Na-independent activity of the <italic>slo2.2</italic> conductance cannot be true.</p><p>2) Also inconsistent with the possibility of a Na-independent conductance from <italic>slo2.2</italic> channels is that the input resistance is not changed between WT and KO animals. (What was the protocol for measuring input resistance? From what voltage? Hyperpolarizxing or depolarizing current steps? How big? All of these are relevant to interpretation.)</p><p>3) The changes in excitability seem more consistent with an increase in voltage-dependent sodium current near threshold – possibly a shift in voltage-dependence to more negative voltages – than a change in potassium conductance. In the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, the initial outward current in the KO seems similar to control, but then the inward current seems to activate at more negative voltages. A shift in the voltage-dependent of sodium current is also the most obvious explanation for the changes in in the phase-plane plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>. The authors need to test whether there is a change in inward sodium current in the knockout animals by recording with K current blocked.</p><p>4) A change in non-voltage dependent potassium conductance might shift the frequency-current curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to the right, but there is no obvious reason it would result in an increased maximal frequency of firing. This also seems more easily explained by a change in sodium current. Obviously, a change in sodium current would also explain why the effect on excitability are the same with 0 internal and 10 mM internal Na.</p><p>5) Another possibility is a loss of a voltage-dependent K current. In the IV curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> shown for the dKO animals with 70 mM internal Na, it is striking that there is no evidence of any voltage-dependent component of K current like that seen for the WT neurons with 0 mM internal Na.</p><p>6) More generally, the authors interpret all of their results as if they represent direct effects of a loss of <italic>slo2.2</italic> rather than possible developmental changes. Such changes seem not only possible but likely based on the fact that <italic>slo2.2</italic> mutations in humans seem to have profound developmental effects and with previous evidence that <italic>slo2.2</italic> protein can affect synthesis of other proteins. To quote the final summary of the 2013 review by Kaczmarek, “Human mutations in these channels produce profound effects on neuronal function and development, suggesting that perhaps their biological role may extend beyond simply setting the level of neuronal excitability, and that these channels may influence cytoplasmic biochemical pathways that regulate development, plasticity, and intellectual function.” Obviously, such indirect effects could offer a completely different explanation of the changes in excitability – or even the effects on pain and itch behavior. This needs to be acknowledged and considered in the interpretation in this manuscript.</p><p>7) Because this is the first description of these knockouts, the authors should provide some rationale for gene targeting of the particular exons that were selected (perhaps in the Methods?). The authors should address what the selected exons encode, if knockout of the exon conceivably causes a dominant negative protein for its paralogue channel (i.e., is slick exon knockout result in a dominant negative for slack?), and why does the western blot of knockout show a complete lack of protein rather than a reduction in protein size (does the knockout cause a frame-shift)?</p><p>8) It would be informative if the authors address the significant depolarization in resting membrane potential in the knockout. Does this imply that slack channels are open at rest rather than during the rise to threshold?</p><p>9) A discussion regarding the discrepancies in the effect of the knockouts on firing patterns between Lu et al., and this study, would also be valuable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10013.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As explained in detail below, a number of additional experiments need to be included to rule out alternative interpretations of the results.

It was certainly not any intent of ours to overlook any possible explanations for differences in excitability between WT and dKO cells and we hope the changes we have made remedy this issue. The main point we had sought to make regarding the changes in excitability was that the effect on rheobase requires a difference between WT and KO cells in something preceding the AP. Although we would still suggest that, given that we demonstrate that K<sub>Na</sub> is absent in the KO cells, the absence of K<sub>Na</sub> current is the simplest potential explanation for such a difference, we have now spent more time, both in new experiments and in discussion, addressing other possibilities, including possible compensatory changes in other currents.</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for better focusing attention on the question of the circumstances of when K<sub>Na</sub> is active and what our results with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na have to say about this issue. The crux of this issue concerns both when K<sub>Na</sub> current is active and how any activation is controlled by Na<sup>+</sup>. Although we agree that a full answer to these questions is critical, it is beyond the scope of this paper and actually represent questions that have been posed and left unanswered for well over 20 years now. However, we have brought some new data to bear on this topic. We have included new results that more strongly argue that there is no basal activation of K<sub>Na</sub> in WT neurons with 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9–figure supplement 2E-F</xref>). Furthermore, over the voltage range of -120 to -60 mV, there is no clear difference in input resistance between WT and dKO cells and, importantly, Cs<sup>+</sup> does not reduce the resting conductance, negative to -60 mV. But we do consistently observe a difference in resting potential between WT and dKO neurons, which requires some difference in conductance in voltage range between -60 and -45 mV. Although our results do not allow definitive identification of currents active in this range, two factors lead to the hypothesis that a small amount of K<sub>Na</sub> is active near resting potentials: first, that we know that K<sub>Na</sub> is absent in the KO and, second, the resting potential of the DRG neurons is fairly positive. Since neither 0 nor 10 mM Na is thought to be sufficient to produce such activation, part of this hypothesis requires that there be some basal Na flux that produces a local [Na] sufficient to produce the very low Po K<sub>Na</sub> activity required to produce the modest hyperpolarization in WT cells. We also include some simple calculations regarding how much K<sub>Na</sub> activation would actually be required at rest. Although such considerations are admittedly rather speculative, they do highlight how very small conductances can play very important roles near resting potentials.</p><p>We would agree that it would be preferable that such questions be resolved and not simply be presented as a hypothesis. However, this hypothesis will require considerable work and, given the small amplitude of the currents likely to be involved at rest and the absence of selective pharmacological agents, it will be a challenging task. However, we feel the present results provide rather strong support for the idea that K<sub>Na</sub> is active at a time during AP generation that was not proposed in earlier work and the results at point the way towards strategies that might be useful for more explicit demonstration of time course and amplitude of K<sub>Na</sub> activation.</p><p>The implication of the lack of difference in firing between 0 and 10 mM Na<sup>+</sup> is simply that these levels of basal Na, which apparently do not activate K<sub>Na</sub> current themselves, also do not produce much discernible influence on whatever the activating Na actually is. As with other aspects of the results, this would tend to suggest that K<sub>Na</sub> activation is intimately connected to Na influx.</p><p>We also agree that some consideration of the possibility of compensatory changes in other conductances in the KO animals is required and this is now included. In our new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and supplements), two observations support the view that changes in Nav gating range are not the explanation for the greater excitability of dKO neurons: first, simple inhibition of the ramp-activated outward current in WT cells by the concentration of Cs found to largely block K<sub>Na</sub> current produces a shift in the 0 current membrane potential very similar to that observed in dKO neurons. In contrast, Cs produces a minor shift in the dKO neurons. Thus, simple alteration of K<sup>+</sup> conductance preceding the surge of inward current can shift the apparent (but not real) range of Nav activation. Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9–figure supplement 2</xref> we show that there is difference in the range of activation of Nav current between WT and dKO cells that would account for the observed shifts in 0 current potential and rheobase. Similarly, there are no changes in the major voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current that might account for the excitability changes. Given the heterogeneity of current phenotypes in DRG cells, we think additional work with fully isolated currents will be appropriate, but for this set of cells which reveals the same properties of ramp-activated outward current differences between WT and KO cells as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we can recapitulate essentially the main features of dKO by simple inhibition of outward current preceding the AP.</p><p>We are not so persuaded that the “changes in excitability seem far more consistent with a change in other conductances”. In fact, the effects on firing are generally consistent with what one would expect from an absence of SLO2 and, given that SLO2 is the molecular entity being deleted, that the change in firing results from its absence would certainly seem the simplest explanation for the observations. But as the review of the original manuscript correctly points out, it is absolutely the case that this is not the only possible explanation. However, we hope that our discussion of how compensatory changes might impact on our results now provides a more balanced presentation of the possible interpretations of the results and will draw readers’ attention to the complexity of effects involved with human SLO2.2 mutations.</p><p>Finally, in doing this work, a major concern of ours has been that our conclusions from electrophysiological experiments are based on comparisons between WT and KO cells and do not involve within cell comparisons. We feel the new experiments with Cs<sup>+</sup> provide in-cell comparisons that strongly bolster the arguments derived from WT vs. KO comparisons. However, it may be wondered why we choose Cs<sup>+</sup> for these experiments. We do, in fact, have a set of experiments with various compounds thought to act on SLO2 channels, both activators and inhibitors, with which we hoped that we might obtain within cell comparisons that would either further support or contradict the comparisons between KO and WT cells. Unfortunately, we obtained very unsatisfying results with loxapine, bithionol, and bepridil, all three of which produce inhibition of Nav current at concentrations comparable to those affecting K<sub>Na</sub> channels. The slow onset of action of such compounds was also problematic. Although Cs<sup>+</sup> cannot be considered specific in its blocking effects, the rapidity of onset of its action was more desirable in terms of knowing the effects were due to Cs as opposed to some sort of slow run-down.</p><p><italic>1) As noted, there is a fundamental contradiction between the experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>showing that the conductance identified as</italic> slo2.2 <italic>current is lacking when cells are dialyzed with 0 mM Na and the interpretation of the experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8"><italic>Figures 7 and 8</italic></xref> <italic>where it is assumed that this conductance is somehow present even with 0 mM internal Na. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F</italic></xref><italic>, there is no data for the double KO with 0 mM Na internal. If the conductance with this condition is really the same as WT with 0 Na, then the speculation later that there might be Na-independent activity of the</italic> slo2.2 <italic>conductance cannot be true.</italic></p><p>In the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, current estimates from WT with 0 Na were compared to WT with 70 Na and dKO with 70 Na. Since the K gradients are totally different, we have removed the WT with 0 Na from this panel, but now include WT at 70 mM following 30 minutes of recording, during which time the K<sub>Na</sub> current runs-down (also shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). To address more directly the question of K<sub>Na</sub> current at 0 Na, in the new set of cells we measure conductance from -120 to -60 mV. Although a smaller conductance was observed in the dKO cells, neither the conductance in WT or dKO cells was reduced by 20 mM Cs, so we the overall results support the view that there is no basal K<sub>Na</sub> activation negative to -60 mV. We certainly did not intend to “assume” that K<sub>Na</sub> was present with 0 internal Na, but this seemed one possible hypothesis to be considered. The current data now allow a stronger conclusion that there probably is no Na-independent activity of SLO2.2.</p><p><italic>2) Also inconsistent with the possibility of a Na-independent conductance from</italic> slo2.2 <italic>channels is that the input resistance is not changed between WT and KO animals. (What was the protocol for measuring input resistance? From what voltage? Hyperpolarizxing or depolarizing current steps? How big? All of these are relevant to interpretation.)</italic></p><p>We have now included the details for measurement of input resistance. In the data in the Tables, we used a 10 mV step from -60 to -70 mV. We think the failure to observe a clear difference in input resistance between WT and dKO cells with this protocol arises from the small amplitude of the current injection, and that negative to -60 mV, there isn’t much difference. We confirmed this with the new data set measuring input resistance from -120 to -60 mV.</p><p><italic>3) The changes in excitability seem more consistent with an increase in voltage-dependent sodium current near threshold – possibly a shift in voltage-dependence to more negative voltages – than a change in potassium conductance. In the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8H</italic></xref><italic>, the initial outward current in the KO seems similar to control, but then the inward current seems to activate at more negative voltages. A shift in the voltage-dependent of sodium current is also the most obvious explanation for the changes in in the phase-plane plot in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8E</italic></xref><italic>. The authors need to test whether there is a change in inward sodium current in the knockout animals by recording with K current blocked.</italic></p><p>These issues were addressed in our above summary. We would be hesitant to agree with the view that the “changes in excitability seem more consistent with an increase in voltage-dependent sodium current near threshold” based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and 8H</xref>. Our results provide abundant direct evidence that an outward current with the potential to be active near rest (K<sub>Na</sub>) is clearly absent in the dKO cells. Any other differences, if they occur at all, are not readily discernible. Both in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and 8H</xref>, the observed currents represent a composite of both inward and outward and any apparent shift in voltage-dependent Nav activation may only reflect the absence of an outward current. But the new experiments with Cs<sup>+</sup> provide more direct support that a reduction in K<sup>+</sup> at subthreshold potentials can produce essentially the same effect as SLO2 KO. Furthermore, we see no change in inward sodium current that could account for the changes in excitability.</p><p>The review comments suggest that we undertake a comparison of Nav currents in WT and KO cells with all K<sup>+</sup> current blocked. We agree this may perhaps be an important study to undertake, but feel it is beyond the scope of the present paper. The choice we have taken in using Cs was to allow us to examine the effects of the blocker (Cs) not only on the underlying currents but also on the ability of the cell to fire in the rheobase measurements. We think this provides a more direct test that the changes in current we see can account for the observed excitability changes.</p><p><italic>4) A change in non-voltage dependent potassium conductance might shift the frequency-current curves in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>to the right, but there is no obvious reason it would result in an increased maximal frequency of firing. This also seems more easily explained by a change in sodium current. Obviously, a change in sodium current would also explain why the effect on excitability are the same with 0 internal and 10 mM internal Na.</italic></p><p>Our description of Nav as a largely “voltage-independent” K<sup>+</sup> conductance was imprecise and we have now clarified this in the text. We did not mean that KNa<sub>Na</sub> functions as a voltage-independent current. When cells are loaded with 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, the current appears to be largely voltage-independent. But at a fixed and elevated Na, some of the linearity of K<sub>Na</sub> activation over then range of -80 to -20 mV will arise from a combination of increased activation by voltage and also voltage-dependent inhibition by intracellular Na. Furthermore, under more physiological conditions, it would be expected that K<sub>Na</sub> will increase in activation with depolarization weakly from its own intrinsic voltage-dependence, but more strongly as a consequence to elevations of cytosolic Na. We have to admit that it is not so obvious to us how to predict effects of a current active prior to an AP on the frequency-current plots, but we understand the basic point raised by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>5) Another possibility is a loss of a voltage-dependent K current. In the IV curves in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F</italic></xref> <italic>shown for the dKO animals with 70 mM internal Na, it is striking that there is no evidence of any voltage-dependent component of K current like that seen for the WT neurons with 0 mM internal Na.</italic></p><p>Thank you for focusing attention on this feature of the IV curves. The beginning of outward current activation in the WT cells at 0 Na in fact reflects K<sub>Na</sub> activation in those cells. This current runs down over time consistent with our other observations on run-down of K<sub>Na</sub> current. This provides support for the idea that under more physiological conditions this current does exhibit voltage-dependent activation.</p><p><italic>6) More generally, the authors interpret all of their results as if they represent direct effects of a loss of</italic> slo2.2 <italic>rather than possible developmental changes. Such changes seem not only possible but likely based on the fact that</italic> slo2.2 <italic>mutations in humans seem to have profound developmental effects and with previous evidence that</italic> slo2.2 <italic>protein can affect synthesis of other proteins. To quote the final summary of the 2013 review by Kaczmarek, “Human mutations in these channels produce profound effects on neuronal function and development, suggesting that perhaps their biological role may extend beyond simply setting the level of neuronal excitability, and that these channels may influence cytoplasmic biochemical pathways that regulate development, plasticity, and intellectual function.” Obviously, such indirect effects could offer a completely different explanation of the changes in excitability – or even the effects on pain and itch behavior. This needs to be acknowledged and considered in the interpretation in this manuscript.</italic></p><p>We have now included discussion of the possibility that the absence of <italic>Slo2</italic> protein may affect expression of other proteins. The hypothesis cited by the review comment is an intriguing one that will certainly require additional evaluation.</p><p><italic>7) Because this is the first description of these knockouts, the authors should provide some rationale for gene targeting of the particular exons that were selected (perhaps in the Methods?). The authors should address what the selected exons encode, if knockout of the exon conceivably causes a dominant negative protein for its paralogue channel (i.e., is slick exon knockout result in a dominant negative for slack?), and why does the western blot of knockout show a complete lack of protein rather than a reduction in protein size (does the knockout cause a frame-shift)?</italic></p><p>We have expanded on these points in the Methods.</p><p><italic>8) It would be informative if the authors address the significant depolarization in resting membrane potential in the knockout. Does this imply that slack channels are open at rest rather than during the rise to threshold?</italic></p><p>This was largely addressed above, but is repeated here. Our results lead us to suggest that slack channels are open at rest, at very low open probability, but that slack activation also increases during the rise to threshold. As discussed more thoroughly above, we have more explicitly addressed this issue both with new experiments and in the Discussion. However, this is not an easy question to definitely answer, and the identity and magnitude of the full set of conductances active at rest (and subthreshold) are not readily identified. As noted above, the discrepancy our results raise is that, although no differences in input resistance (measured negative to -60 mV) are noted between WT and dKO cells, we have consistently observed resting potential differences that do not seem readily explained solely on the basis the unfortunate heterogeneity of DRG neurons. Given that the relatively linear IV from -60 to -120 mV begins to markedly deviate above -60 mV, SLO2 channels are certainly candidates for a conductance that might contribute in this window. However, as we discuss, such a conductance would be very small at rest and activation at rest, but not negative to -60 mV would seem likely to require coupling to a source of Na influx in this window. Unfortunately, that remains a topic about which we know essentially nothing, so although the results suggest particular explanations, they remain decidedly speculative. Although it is to be expected that there is a Na flux in the -60 mV to -50 mV window that contributes to the relatively positive resting potentials, whether the coupling could be strong enough to produce even small K<sub>Na</sub> activation is unknown. These complicated questions are not easy to tease apart, given the small size of the conductances/currents and woefully nonspecific pharmacological agents. We think the present work points to some approaches that might be taken to address this more definitely in the future work. It was not the purpose of this manuscript to explain fully the role of K<sub>Na</sub> current during DRG electrical activity although that would have been nice. However, the effects on rheobase strongly focused our attention on processes that precede the upswing of the AP. For now, we feel the approaches we have taken are important in establishing a new way that Slack current can influence excitability and point to important new questions.</p><p><italic>9) A discussion regarding the discrepancies in the effect of the knockouts on firing patterns between Lu et al., and this study, would also be valuable.</italic></p><p>An additional comment in regards to the firing patterns is now included. However, the Lu paper does not undertake an examination of the basis for any firing differences in their KO animals, the size of neurons from which they record was not reported, and we simply felt there was no need to point out things that might be lacking in the other paper. The key point is that both papers note that excitability in response to constant current injection is increased. We feel that this is consistent with the idea that acute effects on sensory stimuli would likely be observed, even in the absence of neuropathic pain protocols.</p></body></sub-article></article>
