However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 20 weeks and do not assess male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences, which are largely unknown at the molecular level in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerves (SCN) – two tissues implicated in nociception and pain as well as diseases linked to inflammation, injury, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing male and female mice at adolescent (4 weeks) and adult (14 weeks) age. Our analysis deciphered protein subsets and networks that were correlated with the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins/biological pathways with known (patho)physiological relevance, e.g., homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin, and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. Extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that various proteins associated with distinct skin diseases and pain exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique proteome resource that facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology, and integrates age and sex as biological variables – a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>age differences</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>paw skin</kwd><kwd>sciatic nerve</kwd><kwd>DIA-PASEF</kwd><kwd>DDA-PASEF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003065</institution-id><institution>Universität Wien</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Julia Regina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomics uncovers thus far unknown age and sex differences in sciatic nerve and skin of naïve mice, highlighting the importance of adequate age matching and parallel investigation of male and female mice in biomedical studies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The age and sex of mice are major confounders in preclinical studies, affecting experimental outcomes across scales: from molecular, morphological, and physiological to behavioral parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flórez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). In mice, the first 12 weeks of life are characterized by pronounced changes in terms of growth and development of all organs and systems. Therefore, the Jackson Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org">https://www.jax.org</ext-link>) considers the widely used mouse strain C57BL/6J of mature adult physiology only at 12 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the sex of mice needs to be considered when comparing experimental outcomes. Despite recently enforced policies by funding agencies to include animals of both sexes, most preclinical studies still do not perform experiments on male and female rodents in parallel, exhibit gaps in data analysis by sex, and often pool animals of both sexes and a wide range of ages (between 4 and 20 weeks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flórez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>) given time and financial constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>). These practices may negatively impact reproducibility across studies, increase data variability, conceal differences or generate artifactual results, and, consequently, hamper translationally oriented preclinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flórez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oliva et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A prominent example of the enormous diversity of age ranges in publications are studies on rodent (mainly mice and rats) skin and peripheral sensory neurons (e.g., the sciatic nerve [SCN]) in the context of somatosensation and pain. Here, it is particularly noteworthy that often different age ranges were used for in vivo versus in vitro investigations. Mouse behavior experiments assessing paw sensitivity have routinely been performed in mice aged between 6 and 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Studies in cultured peripheral sensory neurons or keratinocytes have used mice aged 4–6 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poole et al., 2014</xref>), 4–8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>), 7–10 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narayanan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>), or 8–16 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadler et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, myelination of the SCN has been studied biochemically in mice aged 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siems et al., 2020</xref>), 10 weeks, and up to several months (depending on disease severity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siems et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, cultured Schwann cells are generally derived from newborn rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siems et al., 2020</xref>). We have recently discovered a previously unknown age dependence of tactile sensitivity in the back skin and hind paws of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michel et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, 4-week-old adolescent mice were more sensitive to innocuous tactile stimulation than 12-week-old adult mice. Interestingly, these observations correlated with similar changes in the activity of the mechanically activated ion channel Piezo2 and age-dependent transcriptome changes in peripheral sensory neurons.</p><p>Even so, to date, we still lack comprehensive knowledge about the differential molecular setup of the somatosensory system in dependence on age and sex, in particular on the level of the proteome. This is highly relevant as transcript levels only show limited correspondence with protein levels, which renders the functional interpretation of transcriptome results difficult, in particular under dynamic conditions such as development, maturation, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, in contrast to well-established RNA-seq approaches, deep proteome profiling of complex tissues is still challenging, above all, for low abundant and transmembrane proteins. Latest technological advances in mass spectrometry (MS) and data analysis provide new solutions for these challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meier et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we thoroughly compared two MS-based quantitative proteomics approaches: commonly used data-dependent acquisition (DDA) paired with parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (DDA-PASEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meier et al., 2018</xref>) compared to data-independent acquisition (DIA-PASEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier et al., 2020</xref>). The latter has been shown to offer superior performance for deep profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier et al., 2020</xref>), yet it has, thus far, only been applied by specialized laboratories given its high demands regarding technology and data analysis.</p><p>The goal of this work was to comprehensively catalog the protein setup of mouse paw skin and SCN, changes upon age (comparing adolescents, 4 weeks of age, and adults, 14 weeks of age), and differences between male and female wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice. The SCN is affected by a wide variety of motor and sensory neuropathologies induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Similarly, the skin, as our interface to the outer world, can be impaired by several inflammatory diseases like atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and lupus erythematodes. In addition, both the skin and SCN are involved in nociception and (chronic) pain. We therefore focused on the potential implication of our data for preclinical research on skin- and SCN-related pathologies, including pain. Our results decipher hitherto unknown age and sex dependency of assorted proteins and signaling pathways, including those with known disease relevance. Taken together, our dataset is unique as (1) it provides a quantitative protein catalog of skin and SCN and (2) it does so in dependence on the age and sex of naïve mice. Given the heterogeneity of mouse age ranges in biomedical studies and the impact of age and sex on experimental outcomes, our results represent a highly valuable resource to foster future investigations in the context of skin and peripheral nerve (patho)physiology by enhancing reproducibility and unmasking hitherto unknown differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DIA-PASEF allows deep and reproducible proteome profiling of mouse paw skin and sciatic nerves (SCN)</title><p>In this study, we analyzed 16 biological replicates of paw skin and SCN samples to compare the proteome between (1) two age groups, that is, 4-week-old adolescent mice and 14-week-old adult mice, and (2) males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To enable and optimize deep proteome profiling, we compared two label-free quantification strategies of MS-based quantitative proteomics. In particular, DDA-PASEF and DIA-PASEF. For each sample, we analyzed technical duplicates using a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik). DDA or DDA-PASEF have been the methods of choice for most proteomics studies published so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aballo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aebersold and Mann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyer, 2021</xref>). However, recent advances highlighted the superior performance of DIA-PASEF methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meier et al., 2021</xref>), which we tested in our study side-by-side. Given the long acquisition time of approximately 20 days for all samples and replicates, we constantly monitored the performance of our MS setup in DIA-PASEF mode by using pooled skin peptides and SCN peptides as quality controls. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for all quality control runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The average correlations of quality controls were 0.98 and 0.99 for pooled skin and SCN samples, respectively, indicating highly consistent stability of the instrument setup. Usually, DIA data is searched against a peptide library constructed from data obtained via DDA of the same sample; therefore, only proteins present in the library can be identified and quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ludwig et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, DIA-NN, a recently developed program based on deep neural networks, extensively advanced DIA workflows with a library-free database search mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we compared DDA-PASEF data subjected to a standard MaxQuant search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>) with DIA-PASEF data subjected to DIA-NN library-free search. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, protein identifications from DDA-PASEF were highly covered by DIA-PASEF experiments, and DIA-PASEF detected additional 4135 and 3926 protein groups in skin and SCN, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). Besides comparing protein identifications (protein IDs: for the remainder of this article, we will refer to protein groups as protein IDs for the sake of simplicity), we also compared both acquisition modes with respect to reproducibility at the quantitative level. Notably, we observed smaller coefficients of variation (CVs) across all DIA-PASEF runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), indicating higher reproducibility compared to DDA-PASEF. Taken together, DIA-PASEF exhibited superior performance and was therefore chosen for further analysis of skin and SCN samples.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Data-independent acquisition paired with parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (DIA-PASEF) acquisition followed by DIA-NN analysis outperforms data-dependent acquisition paired with PASEF (DDA-PASEF) acquisition in deep proteome profiling of paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN) of naïve mice.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Pearson’s correlations of technical controls of paw skin (blue) and SCN (green) acquired over 20 days on a timsTOF Pro.

Comparing this proteome dataset with the most comprehensive (human) skin proteome dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyring-Andersen et al., 2020</xref>) published so far, our skin proteome covered approximately 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, in our study we analyzed whole-skin lysates without preanalytical sample fractionation (e.g., separation of different skin layers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyring-Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). Note that the previously published skin proteome was obtained from human hairy skin, while we analyzed mouse glabrous skin known to exhibit several differences in skin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudjonsson et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, we identified all 50 known keratins and 19 collagens. In addition to structural proteins, we also quantified 13 members of the interleukin (IL) family and 11 of the S100 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), known to play essential roles in the context of inflammation and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozlyuk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2019</xref>). Their detection across all skin samples with only a few missing values (note that we did not impute any data; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) further validates the high performance and reproducibility of our optimized workflow. In SCN, approx. 8400 protein IDs were quantified across experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). SCN harbor myelinated axons, which are closely associated with glia cells such as Schwann cells. Remarkably, the myelin proteome was nearly completely covered in our SCN data (94%); 1014/1077 described myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siems et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), without a priori myelin enrichment as required in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siems et al., 2020</xref>). Among the 63 proteins of the myelin proteome, which were not covered in our dataset, were ATP synthases, histones, and septins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Another indication as to the depth and high performance of our workflow is the fact that we robustly quantified multiple ion channels across SCN samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), such as Trpv1 and several voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., Scn8a, Scn9a, Scn11a) – again without requiring preanalytical membrane preparations. These ion channel identifications further corroborate the high quality of our approach as ion channels are usually expressed at low abundance and are notoriously difficult to be detected by MS given their pronounced hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samways, 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Age and sex differences in proteomes of paw skin and sciatic nerve (SCN).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram shows unique and shared protein IDs across age and sex groups of paw skin.

Importantly, we only considered those proteins that were robustly quantified in all samples (according to all our quality criteria; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details), resulting in 6086 protein IDs in the skin and 6065 protein IDs in SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>). Age groups were clearly segregated by the first and second components in skin and SCN samples, indicating that age is a prominent discriminator in our study and associated differences can be tackled by whole-proteome analysis. Furthermore, to elucidate changes in abundance profiles across all experimental groups, fuzzy C-means clustering analysis was performed based on the average intensity of any protein ID quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the nine clusters generated, most of the proteins showed strong age patterns, such as clusters 2 and 5 in skin, and clusters 4, 6, and 7 in SCN. On the contrary, several proteins exhibited different expression trends in age/sex groups. For instance, most proteins in cluster 6 of the skin proteome showed minor age-dependent changes in females, while their abundance was notably increased in 14-week males compared to 4-week males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar sex-specific changes were also observed in SCN represented by cluster 3. Taken together, the clustering analysis of the paw skin and SCN proteome reveals thus far unknown expression patterns dependent on the biological variables age and sex, that is, sex-specific and -overlapping age dependency, which may affect mouse (patho)physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Diverse biological pathways exhibit age dependence intertwined with sex differences in paw skin</title><p>To explore this age dependency further, we applied a fold change (FC) cut-off (absolute log2 FC ≥ 0.585, i.e., an absolute FC of 1.5) in addition to a significance cut-off (q-value ≤ 0.05) and found 234 and 94 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in female and male skin datasets, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) analysis of 46 common DEPs resulted in three significantly enriched pathways (criteria: at least four DEPs/pathway, Bonferroni-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05). DEPs annotated to enriched pathways were mapped back to quantitative proteomic data, and the agglomerated z-scores of the pathways are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, revealing a marked age-dependent pattern.

These pathways were reported to be implicated in skin stability during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rappu et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, several proline/serine hydroxylases (e.g., P4ha2, P3h1, P4ha1) were highly expressed in 4-week skin together with members of collagens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Performing GO-BP enrichment on DEPs from age-dependent comparisons in female versus male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) revealed interesting biological insights into sex-dependent differences.

In addition, sparsely distributed sensory nerve endings in the skin play significant roles for aspects of somatosensation, including the detection of different physical stimuli, whether they be innocuous or noxious. However, this cellular diversity cannot be separated on the experimental level when analyzing complex tissue lysates as in our study. Therefore, we assessed the depth of our profiling workflow across different cell types indirectly by applying a recently published resource on ligand–receptor interactions in 42 cell types, including sensory neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wangzhou et al., 2021</xref>). We extracted ligand–receptor interactions found across skin cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wangzhou et al., 2021</xref>) for comparison with our skin dataset. In total, 144 ligands and receptors of DRG were present in our skin dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), of which 12 were significantly regulated (q-value ≤ 0.05) when comparing 4-week to 14-week mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). For example, the ligand Lamb1 was found to be more abundant in 4-week female skin. Lamb1 was reported to serve as an anchor point for end feet of radial glial cells and as a physical barrier to migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Radmanesh et al., 2013</xref>). Three receptors of Lamb1, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), C-type mannose receptor 2 (Mrc2), and suppressor of tumorigenicity 14 protein homolog (St14), were also identified in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, Mrc2 showed age-dependent statistical significance with higher expression at 4 weeks of age. Taken together, our results generally raise awareness of pronounced age dependency of protein expression in naïve mice, which should be carefully considered when pooling wide-ranging age groups in mouse studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Prominent age and sex dependency of immune pathways and myelin proteins in SCN</title><p>In the SCN proteome, we observed similar age dependency as in paw skin.

For example, among common DEPs, ‘vesicle localization’ had a higher z-score in 4-week SCN of both sexes, while pathways related to ‘neuron survival’, ‘neurotransmitter transport’, and ‘anterograde axonal transport’ were more pronounced in 14-week SCN of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These processes appear to be interconnected via distinct DEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting crosstalk during development.

Among the 56 immune cell ligands of neuronal receptors quantified in the SCN proteome, 19 showed age-dependent abundance changes in both sexes such as Agrin (Agrn), Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (Thy1), and several collagens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).

We found 85 glial cell ligands of neuron receptors and 70 neuron ligands of glial cell receptors in our SCN proteome, and, more interestingly, about one-third of ligand-receptor pairs showed strong age dependency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3 fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 3 and 4</xref>), e.g., limbic system-associated membrane protein (Lsamp), a glial cell ligand mediating selective neuronal growth and axon targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>), and two of its neuronal receptors, netrin-G1 (Ntng1) and thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (Thy1). While Lsamp exhibited higher expression in 4-week SCN than in 14-week SCN, its two receptors showed the opposite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>, datasheet 2). Similar expression trends were also found in neuron ligands of glial cell receptors, for example, the ligand disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 23 (Adam23) were less abundant in 4-weeks SCN, but the receptor integrin beta-3 (Itgb3) was more abundant in 4-week SCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>, datasheet 2). These data may suggest a homeostatic mechanism specifically in young SCN to counterbalance ligand abundance on the receptor level – an intriguing hypothesis given that, for example, Lsamp has been reported to suppress neuronal outgrowth of DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this respect, it is noteworthy that 21/90 known myelin proteins within the myelin proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siems et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) were differentially regulated by age, including highly abundant structural myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein (Mbp) and myelin protein P0 (Mpz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In line with previous reports in mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siems et al., 2021</xref>), Mbp and Mpz were significantly enriched in both male and female 14-week SCN, reflecting myelin assembly and axonal development with age. Similarly, CD59A glycoprotein (Cd59a), a sparsely expressed myelin protein associated with protection against complement-mediated lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeis et al., 2016</xref>), was more abundant at adult age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as described previously in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siems et al., 2021</xref>). This congruency with published data on both high- and low-abundant myelin proteins validates our datasets and highlights their quality and depth of profiling. Note, however, that some myelin DEPs appear to be specific for female (Bcas1, Ca2, Cadm4, Dynll1) or male (Itgb4) SCN in dependence on age – a fact that has not been investigated in previous studies, which mostly focused on male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Siems et al., 2021</xref>).

Fuzzy C-means clustering analysis of these 329 skin disease-related proteins revealed not only discrete abundance patterns among age and sex groups but also proteins with differential profiles when comparing all four experimental groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). For example, proteins in cluster 6 showed higher abundance in 14-week male skin, whereas proteins in cluster 7 exhibited lower abundance in 4-week skin of both sexes compared to 14 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Discrete abundance patterns in dependence on age and sex were also observed on the level of individual proteins (examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; full list detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). For example, collagen alpha-1(V) chain (Col5a1), collagen alpha-2(V) chain (Col5a2), and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 80 (Ccdc80) were less abundant at 14 weeks in both male and female samples and, in parallel, showed distinct sex differences. In contrast, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (Inmt) and keratin type II cytoskeletal 6A (Krt6a) represent examples with higher levels in both sexes at 14 weeks. Others display prominent sex dependency such as transcription factor Sp1 (Sp1) and versican core protein (Vcan) being specifically regulated in female skin in an age-dependent manner (less abundant in 4-week female skin compared to 14 weeks; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Among skin diseases used here for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), several are known to exhibit an autoimmune component such as alopecia areata, lichen plantus, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Overall, autoimmune skin diseases are more prevalent in females. Thus, we specifically checked whether top gene signatures of aforementioned autoimmune-associated skin diseases are among the reported female-enriched proteome changes of our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Indeed, 11 proteins could be identified, of which 9 were differentially regulated by age only in females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>, data sheet 3). For instance, transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (Tgfbi) and transcription factor Sp1 (Sp1) were more abundant in 14-week female skin, but no significance was found in males. It is noteworthy that in our study we investigated hairless glabrous skin in mice. However, transcriptomic profiles of human skin diseases used for comparison are mostly derived from human hairy skin – a difference that needs to be taken into account when interpreting the presented comparisons between mouse and human skin. This is why we additionally selected transcriptomic studies on skin diseases affecting human glabrous skin, that is, palms and soles, such as handfoot psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn et al., 2018</xref>), palmoplantar pustulosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCluskey et al., 2022</xref>), and vesicular hand eczema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Voorberg et al., 2021</xref>). Among top gene signatures presented in glabrous skin datasets (2498 DEGs), 928 proteins were quantified in our paw skin datasets and 96 of them showed age and/or sex dependency including several collagens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>; examples are marked with ‘#’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Overall, our data suggest significant regulation of human skin disease profiles by age and sex in mice – knowledge of utmost significance for reverse translational studies on the skin.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Multiple proteins associated with skin diseases and pain exhibit age and sex dependence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram indicates the number of quantified protein IDs in paw skin (white) associated with various human skin diseases (light gray) upon comparison with a skin disease database (dark gray, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biohub.skinsciencefoundation.org/">https://biohub.skinsciencefoundation.org/</ext-link>).

In this context, we assessed the presence of known pain-related genes in SCN datasets by comparison with three publicly available pain gene databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.painresearchforum.org/">https://www.painresearchforum.org/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://paingeneticslab.ca/4105/06_02_pain_genetics_database.asp">http://paingeneticslab.ca/4105/06_02_pain_genetics_database.asp</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://humanpaingeneticsdb.ca/hpgdb/">https://humanpaingeneticsdb.ca/hpgdb/</ext-link>). Among 841 pain genes, 245 were quantified in our SCN proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref> ). Similar to skin disease-related proteins, fuzzy C-means clustering analysis revealed distinct abundance profiles for these 245 pain-related proteins differing by age and/or sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Intriguingly, 132 of these pain-related proteins displayed significant changes (q-value ≤ 0.05) by age and/or sex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref>), of which examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>. For instance, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (Ace) exhibits pronounced age and sex differences while its family member Ace2 only showed age differences (i.e., higher expression in adult mice). Ace2 has been described to be associated with increased risk of nonspecific orofacial symptoms in the OPPERA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) prospective study, and Ace is linked to migraine and potentially higher frequency as well as susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dandona et al., 2007</xref>). Generally, Ace plays an essential role in vascular physiology and inflammation within the renin–angiotensin system. The FK506 binding protein 51 (Fkbp5) also displayed significant age and sex differences, with its expression being lower in female adults but higher in male adults compared to 4-week mice. Fkbp5 is a glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone, and its polymorphisms predict persistent musculoskeletal pain after traumatic stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bortsov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linnstaedt et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, it is generally involved in the acute stress response linked to stress-related disorders in humans via the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Häusl et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, variations in serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 6 (Serpina6), another pain gene with pronounced age differences and sex-opposite expression, are also associated with the HPA stress axis impacting the susceptibility to musculoskeletal pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holliday et al., 2010</xref>), the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as gene expression in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2021</xref>). These few examples highlight the importance of considering changes in the abundance of aforementioned proteins across ages and in both sexes for research on preclinical disease models. Therefore, our datasets represent a highly valuable and unique resource for biomedical studies. To further illustrate this utility, we have critically inspected our previous SCN datasets derived from the neuropathic pain model of nerve injury (spared nerve injury [SNI] model) in male adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, several candidate proteins we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2018</xref>) to be regulated upon SNI in adult males, for example, angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace), apolipoprotein E (Apoe), complement C3 (C3), progranulin (Grn), epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr), and voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1 (Cacna2d1), exhibited age-dependent abundance differences in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata5">Figure 6—source data 5</xref>) – a fact that has not been known before and might crucially affect SNI-induced pathology. Taken together, our data emphasize the essential need for male versus female as well as age-matched biomedical studies in parallel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Age and sex as parameters in rodent-based research are known to strongly affect experimental outcomes in vivo and in vitro. Despite this knowledge, the molecular setup of most cell and tissue types and how they are impacted by age and sex has not yet been discerned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>). This gap is especially eminent at the proteome level – a fact that hampers our understanding of the molecular signature underlying physiological processes and disease phenotypes. Here, we present an optimized workflow of quantitative proteomics, which utilizes DIA-PASEF followed by data analysis with the publicly available program DIA-NN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>). This approach enabled us to deeply profile and quantify the proteome of paw skin and SCN in adolescent versus adult male and female mice. Strikingly, our data reveal unprecedented insights into hitherto unknown age and sex differences of biological processes relevant for skin and SCN physiology as well as associated disorders. Therefore, our work serves as unique resource for the scientific community by defining the protein compendium of mouse skin and SCN and changes thereof in dependence on age and sex. In addition, our results assertively highlight the significance of appropriate age and sex matching and provide a stepping stone for optimizing preclinical and translational research toward enhanced reproducibility and success.</p><p>We focused our analysis on paw skin and SCN isolated from 4-week and 14-week male and female mice. Both tissue types are crucially implicated in multiple diseases. On one hand, in various allergic, itchy, and inflammatory skin pathologies such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and lupus erythematodes. The SCN, on the other hand, is affected by a wide variety of motor and sensory neuropathologies induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination. Moreover, both the skin and SCN are involved in nociception and pain, including chronic conditions. Our reasoning for the chosen age groups was as follows: given time and budget constraints as well as ‘comparability to historical data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reiber et al., 2022</xref>), it has become standard practice to perform experimental studies with mice of a wide age range, generally from 4 weeks to 12 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reiber et al., 2022</xref>), regardless of the studied biological system. Of note, mice aged 3–4 weeks are mostly used for cell culture-based in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isensee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malin et al., 2007</xref>). For example, peripheral sensory neurons of DRG exhibit better health and growth factor-dependent survival when isolated from young rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Melli and Höke, 2009</xref>). Similarly, Schwann cells originated from younger human donors proliferated faster than those from older donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monje, 2020</xref>). In contrast to these younger ages used for cell culture-based research, most studies on mouse behavior are conducted at ages of 6–12 weeks, that is, a period with overt maturational changes before reaching adulthood from 12 weeks of age onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>). Notable examples of this practice include studies on cutaneous touch, somatosensation and (chronic) pain, and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), just to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the most extensive and highly valuable RNA-seq-based resource describing the molecular setup of mouse CNS and PNS cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mousebrain.org">https://www.mousebrain.org</ext-link>) was assembled by pooling mice of both sexes aged 2–3 weeks. Our results show that the proteome exhibits clear differences when comparing 4-week with 14-week mice raising concerns about the aforementioned practices of comparing and correlating in vitro data derived from young ages with in vivo data of older ages. Failed correlations among these age groups may have led to false negatives and prevented new findings. On the contrary, mechanisms discovered in young cells may be wrongly accounted for phenotypic differences observed in adult rodents. Based on our data, we strongly suggest suitable age matching across different methods within a study to ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility.</p><p>From a technical point of view, we have employed a highly sensitive workflow based on DIA-PASEF followed by data analysis via DIA-NN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>). This enabled us to provide the most in-depth and highly reproducible proteome dataset of mouse skin and SCN published thus far. While we have previously used DIA-MS, but not DIA-PASEF, to investigate various tissues in mouse pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rouwette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sondermann et al., 2019</xref>), we have not achieved the high quantitative depth reported here. For instance, in SCN, we quantified more than twice as many proteins (~8400 IDs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as in our previous study using DIA-MS (3141 IDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2018</xref>). Even so, we would like to stress the fact that all here presented data and DEPs are closely interconnected with the experimental and analytical setup of our study. For example, datasets would become more comprehensive, if improved mass spectrometers, more biological replicates, lower cut-offs (in our study: absolute log2FC ≥ 0.585), or more powerful analysis algorithms (see discussion below) will be used in future investigations.</p><p>DIA workflows generally facilitate high reproducibility of quantitative profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Domon and Aebersold, 2010</xref>); however, resulting MS spectra are very complex requiring careful interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilbao et al., 2015</xref>). To address this, improvements of diverse aspects have been continuously implemented. For instance, from the hardware point of view, the addition of ion mobility to chromatographic and mass separation of peptides has significantly reduced spectral complexity in DIA-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helm et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the DIA-PASEF workflow was developed on timsTOF Pro instruments (Bruker Daltonik) and enables nearly complete sampling of the precursor ion beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, new algorithms have been developed to interpret complex spectra. For example, Arnaud Droit and colleagues systematically evaluated and compared DIA data processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotti et al., 2021</xref>) such as DIA-NN, DIA-Umpire, OpenSWATH, ScaffoldDIA, Skyline, and Spectronaut: DIA-NN outperformed others in terms of peptide and protein identifications. Given that DIA-PASEF has not yet been widely used, above all not for mouse skin and SCN, we have systematically compared the more commonly used DDA-PASEF mode with DIA-PASEF. We specifically compared (1) the number of protein IDs quantified, (2) the coefficients of variation (CVs), and (3) quantitative correlations between technical replicates of each sample. As expected, DIA-PASEF outperformed DDA-PASEF in all parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consequently, we obtained all reported datasets on paw skin and SCN via DIA-PASEF followed by DIA-NN library-free data analysis.</p><p>Both analyzed tissues harbor various cell types such as keratinocytes, immune cells, peripheral nerve endings, and fibroblasts in skin, and glia cells, immune cells, and axons in SCN. Because of this cellular complexity, we cannot assign the detected age- and sex-dependent proteome differences to specific cell types – a limitation applicable to all -omics assays, if not performed on the single-cell level. In contrast to established procedures for single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics on single cells is still in its infancy. However, the transcriptome cannot predict disease phenotypes in a straightforward manner given the highly dynamic regulation of protein levels by manifold mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, monitoring pathologies and associated changes in molecular and cellular signaling requires the integration of proteomics into a multi-omic suite. This calls for the development of technological advances for accurate, highly sensitive, and comprehensive proteome profiling on the single-cell level. Recently, Brunner et al. established an ultra-high-sensitivity MS workflow to quantify single-cell proteomes from cultured HeLa cells with protein IDs ranging from 1018 (cell cycle G1 phase) to 1932 (G1/S phase) per single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunner et al., 2022</xref>). Though this pipeline has provided the opportunity to analyze single-cell-derived proteomes, the workflow requires elaborate sample preparation and technical equipment. Furthermore, it has not yet been applied to complex tissues harboring multiple cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, we present the most extensive proteome compendium of mouse skin and SCN described thus far. Our work demonstrates prominent and previously unknown sexual and age dimorphism in paw skin and SCN of naïve mice. Many of the reported differences are likely relevant for our mechanistic understanding of various disorders involving the skin (e.g., inflammatory pathologies like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) and SCN (motor- and sensory neuropathologies induced by inflammation, trauma, and demyelination). Therefore, our study serves as a unique resource for different life science disciplines. In addition, our work advocates for the importance of appropriate age and sex matching and provides new avenues for improving the reproducibility, generalizability, and success of preclinical and translational research on skin and SCN.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Louis, MO) if not mentioned otherwise. Acetonitrile (ACN) and formic acid (FA) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, New Hampshire; both FA and ACN were liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS] grade). LC-MS grade water from Sigma was used for all solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals and tissue isolation</title><p>In-house bred C57BL/6J mice of both sexes were used. Housing and sacrificing of mice were carried out with approval of the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, see ‘Ethics statement’). All mice used in this study were group-housed in individually ventilated cages in a 12 hr light/dark cycle in the animal facility of the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences with water and food ad libitum. Mice were sacrificed at ages 3-4 (referred to as 4-week-old mice) or 14-15 weeks (referred to as 14-week-old mice). Thus, the experiment consisted of four different conditions with four biological replicates each (4-week females, 4-week males, 14-week females, and 14-week males). After CO<sub>2</sub> euthanization of mice, the SCN and paw skin were isolated. SCN was rinsed in ice-cold PBS before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. For the paw skin, a 4 mm punch biopsy (Kai Medical, Solingen, Germany) of the plantar aspect of the paw was taken, and the dermis and epidermis were separated from underlying tendons/muscle tissue under a microscope. The flash-frozen tissue was stored at 80°C until further use. For both skin and SCN, tissue from two mice of the same sex and age were pooled together as one biological replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein extraction</title><p>For protein extraction, each SCN was cut into three pieces with a scalpel on a glass slide and transferred to a protein LoBind tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) prefilled with 250 µL lysis buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 2% SDS) and in presence of 1× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Samples were then sonicated using Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium) for 15 cycles (30 s on and 30 s off, 4°C) at low frequency. After a short vortex, samples were further incubated at 70°C for 10 min with 1000 rpm agitation. Remaining tissue debris was removed after centrifugation at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken into a new tube. To remove lipids in the tissue lysates, 1250 µL (5× sample volume) of cold acetone was added, and the sample was placed at 20°C for 4 hr. With centrifugation at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, acetone was removed, and proteins were collected at the bottom. The protein pellet was further washed with 1.5 mL cold ethanol (80% v/v) followed by 30 min centrifugation at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic>. The protein pellet was air-dried for 20 min at room temperature before the addition of 100 µL lysis buffer. A further incubation at 70°C for 10 min with 1000 rpm agitation was performed to solubilize all proteins. Protein concentrations were measured using NanoPhotometer N60 (Implen, Munich, Germany) at 280 nm, and 50 µg protein of each sample was taken for protein reduction (5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 30 min incubation at 60°C) and alkylation (20 mM iodoacetamide [IAA], 30 min at room temperature in the dark). The remaining IAA in the sample was quenched with addition of 5 mM DTT. Skin biopsies were cut into two pieces and homogenized in 350 µL lysis buffer with the help of a glass dounce. The homogenate was further solubilized by incubation at 70°C for 10 min with 1500 rpm agitation and sonification with the Bioruptor Pico (15 cycles, 30 s on and 30 s off, 4°C, low frequency). Removal of cell debris and subsequent steps were done as described for the SCN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SP3-assisted protein digestion and peptide clean-up</title><p>For protein clean-up and digestion, a modified version of the single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) method from Hughes et al. was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, 10 µL of pre-mixed Sera-Mag SpeedBead beads (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) were added into 50 µg protein sample. To initiate binding of proteins to the beads, one volume of absolute ethanol was added immediately, followed by incubation on a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 24°C for 5 min with 1000 rpm agitation. The supernatant was removed after 2 min resting on a magnetic rack, and the beads were rinsed three times with 500 μL of 80% ethanol. Rinsed beads were reconstituted in 50 μL digestion buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8). Protein digestion was performed with 2 μg of either sequencing grade trypsin (SCN samples) or trypsin/Lys-C (skin samples) for 18 hr at 37°C with 950 rpm agitation. After digestion, ACN was added to each sample to a final concentration of 95%. Mixtures were incubated for 8 min at room temperature and then placed on a magnetic rack for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were rinsed with 900 μL of 100% ACN. The rinsed beads were reconstituted either in 40 μL (SCN samples) or 20 μL (skin samples) LC-MS grade water to elute the peptides. Peptide concentration was measured in duplicate using NanoPhotometer N60 (Implen, München, Deutschland) at 205 nm. Peptide samples were acidified with FA to a final concentration of 0.1% and stored at -20°C until LC-MS/MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>LC-MS/MS</title><p>Nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography (Nano-RPLC) was performed on a NanoElute system (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Then, 250 ng of peptides were separated with a 130 min gradient on a 25 cm × 75 µm column packed with 1.6 µm C18 particles (IonOpticks, Fitzroy, Australia). Mobile solvent A consisted of 2% ACN, 98% water, 0.1% FA, and mobile phase B of 100%, 0.1% FA. The flow rate was set to 400 nL/min for the first 2 min and the last 9 min of the gradient, while the rest of the gradient was set to 250 nL/min. The mobile phase B was linearly increased from 0 to 20% from 3 min to 110 min, flowed by a linear increase to 35% within 10 min and a steep increase to 85% in 0.5 min. Then, a flow rate of 400 nL/min at 85% was maintained for 9 min to elute all hydrophobic peptides. NanoElute LC was coupled with a hybrid TIMS quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer (timsTOF Pro, Bruker Daltonik) via a CaptiveSpray ion source. Each sample was analyzed in both DIA and DDA modes coupled with parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) one after another in duplicate. The TIMS analyzer was operated in a 100% duty cycle with equal accumulation and ramp times of 100 ms each. Specifically, in DDA-PASEF mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meier et al., 2018</xref>), 10 PASEF scans were set per acquisition cycle with ion mobility range (1 /k0) from 0.6 to 1.6, and singly charged precursors were excluded. Dynamic exclusion was applied to precursors that reached a target intensity of 17,500 for 0.4 min. Ions with m/z between 100 and 1700 were recorded in the mass spectrum. In DIA-PASEF mode, precursors with m/z between 400 and 1200 were defined in 16 scans containing 32 ion mobility steps with an isolation window of 26 Th in each step with 1 Da overlapping for neighboring windows. The acquisition time of each DIA-PASEF scan was set to 100 ms, which led to a total cycle time of around 1.8 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier et al., 2020</xref>). In both DDA and DIA-PASEF modes, the collision energy was ramped linearly from 59 eV at 1/k0 = 1.6–20 eV at 1/k0 = 0.6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DDA-PASEF data processing</title><p>All DDA data were analyzed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.17.0) and searched with Andromeda against <italic>Mus musculus</italic> database from UniProt containing 17,070 protein entries (downloaded on 2021-07-08). The minimal peptide length was set to six amino acids, and a maximum of three missed cleavages were allowed. The search included variable modifications of methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation, deamidation (N and Q), and fixed modification of carbamidomethyl on cysteine, and a maximum of three modifications per peptide were allowed. The ‘Match between run’ function was checked within 0.5 min retention time window and 0.05 ion mobility window. Mass tolerance for peptide precursor and fragments were set as 10 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. The FDR was set to 0.01 at precursor level and protein level. Label-free quantification algorithm was used to quantify identified proteins with a minimum of one razor and unique peptide. The rest of the parameters were kept as default. Proteus, an R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bartongroup/Proteus">https://github.com/bartongroup/Proteus</ext-link>), was used for downstream analysis of MaxQuant output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gierlinski et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DIA-PASEF data processing</title><p>DIA-NN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>) was used to process DIA-PASEF data in library-free mode with the same <italic>M. musculus</italic> proteome database to generate the predicted spectrum library. Trypsin/P was used for in silico digestion with an allowance of maximum three missed cleavages. A deep learning-based method was used to predict theoretical peptide spectra along with its retention time and ion mobility. Variable modifications on peptides were set to N-term methionine excision, methionine oxidation, and N-term acetylation, while carbamidomethylation on cysteine was a fixed modification. The maximum number of variable modifications on a peptide was set to 3. Peptide length for the search ranged from 5 to 52 amino acids. Aligned with the DIA-PASEF acquisition method, m/z ranges were specified as 400–1200 for precursors and 100–1700 for fragment ions. Both MS1 and MS2 mass accuracy were set to 10 ppm as recommended. Unique genes were used as protein inference in grouping. RT-dependent cross-run normalization and Robust LC (high accuracy) options were selected for quantification.

Two-sample moderated <italic>t</italic>-test was used to test for statistical significance test of individual contrasts. Age-dependent comparisons (Fe = female; Ma = male): Skin_Fe4w versus Skin_Fe14w, Skin_Ma4w versus Skin_Ma14w, SCN_Fe4w versus SCN_Fe14w, and SCN_Ma4w versus SCN_Ma14w. Sex-dependent comparisons: Skin_Ma4w versus Skin_Fe4w, Skin_Ma14w versus Skin_Fe14w, SCN_Ma4w versus SCN_Fe4w, and SCN_Ma4w versus SCN_Fe4w. Proteins with the adjusted (Benjamini and Hochberg, for multiple testing) p-value ≤ 0.05 (hereafter referred to as the q-value) and the absolute log2 FC ≥ 0.585, that is, an absolute FC of 1.5, were considered as DEPs in each contrast.

Indeed, this suggestion offered an interesting quantitative measurement of the advantages and limitations of these correction technologies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We tested this exciting suggestion on our own datasets given the lack of accessible granular data from published proteomics studies.</p><p>We focused on the skin proteome of our study and divided it into sub-group1 (Skin_Ma4w pooled with Skin_Fe4w) and sub-group2 (Skin_Ma14w pooled with Skin_Fe14w), i.e. we considered the two sexes as different batches. In this setting, we aimed at investigating age-dependent proteome changes. The two sub-groups were corrected individually using ComBat (non-parametric adjustment) within the SVA package in R to try to remove batch effects. The corrected proteome data was further subjected to differential expression analysis in the ProTiGY package as described in the manuscript, and we generated new DEP lists from age-dependent comparisons.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> and B, the ComBat correction (grey circles) led to partly different DEPs compared with the original, i.e. age- and sex-matched data in our study (white circles).</p><p>Similarly, we investigated sex-dependent proteome changes by manually dividing the data into sub-group1 (Skin_Ma4w pooled with Skin_Ma14w) and sub-group2 (Skin_Fe4w pooled with Skin_Fe14w) for batch effect correction (in this case, we considered the 2 age groups as different batches). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref> and D show the comparison with our original data.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81431-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our results show that batch effect correction was able to separate batches based on age or sex differences to a certain extent, e.g. approximately 55% (panels A and B) of DEPs that truly describe age differences based on our real study data, and 92% (panel C) and 45% (Panel D) that truly describe sex differences based on our real study data. However, it should be used with caution, as obtained results (i) miss a significant amount of biological information as shown in Venn diagrams above (white areas in Venn diagrams) and (ii) added different DEPs (dark grey areas in Venn diagrams). Thus, batch correction could only partially replicate our original data generated upon careful age and sex matching in well-controlled experiments. Given that we tested in silico batch correction on prominent age differences, i.e. 4w versus 14w, and observed aforementioned limitations in performance, these limitations will likely impact the performance of correction even more when considering scenarios often used in biomedical studies, e.g. pooling data of mice aged 3-8w or 6-20w.In summary, the here observed limitations of batch correction highlight the importance of adequate experimental design and careful age- and sex-matching in biomedical studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors failed to provide biochemical validation of DEPs identified from the work. I would appreciate that functional testing of the relevant changes to the mouse phenotypes, but this might be beyond the scope of this paper but do wonder whether relying on changes in protein expression level are truly enough to conclude the impact in the preclinical settings.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, biochemical and functional validation of DEPs is beyond the scope of this manuscript and we are grateful to the reviewers for their understanding.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a direct/linear relation between changes of the expression of a molecule or group of molecules (at any -omic level) and the phenotype cannot be expected. Yet, the breadth of our datasets offers a different perspective on distinct functional pathways that may be linked to sex and age and, in general, interrogated (patho)physiological changes.</p><p>Also, evidence is accumulating that proteome dynamics we have uncovered in our previous studies does indeed have biological significance. For example, in Rouwette et al. we discovered protein up- and downregulation upon chronic pain in mice, amongst others of Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) and proteins belonging to mitochondrial pathways (Rouwette et al. 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M116.058966). To validate the functional relevance of these findings, we injected mice with (i) Rotenone to interfere with the respiratory electron chain complex I and (ii) PACMA31 to inhibit PDIs. Importantly, both treatments resulted in significant changes in pain-associated behaviors compared to controls (Rouwette et al. 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M116.058966). Even more valuable, another independent research group has recently validated the regulation and significance of PDI in pathological pain with complementary methods and studied underlying mechanisms in detail (Zhang et al. 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110625">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110625</ext-link>).</p><p>Furthermore, we have recently published a follow-up paper on one of the proteins found to be regulated upon neuropathic pain in our proteome study (Rouwette et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M116.058966), i.e. the previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein Tmem160. Our functional investigations revealed the significance of Tmem160 for the establishment of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice (Segelcke et al. 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110152">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110152</ext-link>)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The impact of sex seems to be not impressive based on the PCA analysis of proteome, especially compared to age (Figure 2G and H) and PCA plots using sex-dependent DEPs are misleading (Figure 5C and D).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly pointed out that sex does not appear as a major contributor to proteome changes in skin and SCN. In particular Figure 2G and H highlight the difference between sex- and age-dependent changes showing the greater impact of age as a biological variable. In addition, in Figure 5C and D we performed PCA using only sex-dependent DEPs to test whether those DEPs are able to segregate sex as a biological variable in all samples. In doing so we followed a commonly used approach to discriminate differences between conditions using DEPs in quantitative proteomic studies (https://doi.org/10.1186/s1201-022-09361-1, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12014-019-9241-5). However, to avoid further confusion and clearly indicate to the reader the minor impact of sex versus age, we have put particular emphasis on explaining this fact in the revised figure legend of Figure 5C and D.</p><p>New figure legend 5C and D:</p><p>“C-D: Principal component analysis (PCA) using DEPs of sex-dependent comparisons (in contrast to PCA on all identified proteins illustrated in Figure 2G-H) reveals sex as an effective discriminator in paw skin and SCN tissues; females (magenta) and males (cyan).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have now included new comparisons of our paw skin datasets with those studies that reported molecular signatures of skin diseases that affect the hands or feet. Given the limited public availability of such kind of datasets, we focused on hand-foot psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis and vesicular hand eczema. These comparisons can be found in the revised Figure 6-source data 3. We added the following paragraph to the manuscript:</p><p>“It is noteworthy that in our study we investigated hairless glabrous skin in mice. However, transcriptomic profiles of human skin diseases used for comparison are mostly derived from human hairy skin – a difference, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting here presented comparisons between mouse and human skin. This is why we additionally selected transcriptomic studies on skin diseases affecting human glabrous skin, i.e. palms and soles, such as hand-foot psoriasis (Ahn et al., 2018), palmoplantar pustulosis (McCluskey et al., 2022) and vesicular hand eczema (Voorberg et al., 2021). Among top gene signatures presented in glabrous skin datasets (2498 DEGs), 928 proteins were quantified in our paw skin datasets and 96 of them showed age and/or sex dependency including several collagens (Figure 6-source data 3; examples are marked with “#” in Figure 6C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

As female sex is more prone to autoimmune skin diseases such as lupus erythematosus, it would be more interesting if the authors further analyze whether sex-dependent proteome difference is enriched in autoimmune-associated gene signature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this highly interesting aspect, which we have followed up in the revised version of the manuscript. We added the following analysis/paragraph to the manuscript:</p><p>“Among the skin diseases used here for comparison (Figure 6-source data 1) several are known to exhibit an autoimmune component such as alopecia areata, lichen plantus, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Overall, autoimmune skin diseases are more prevalent in females. Thus, we specifically checked whether top gene signatures of aforementioned autoimmune-associated skin diseases are among the here reported female-enriched proteome changes of our study (Figure 1-source data 1). Indeed, 11 proteins could be identified, of which 9 were differentially regulated by age only in females (Figure 6-source data 1, data sheet 3). For instance, Transforming growth factor-β-induced protein ig-h3 (Tgfbi) and Transcription factor Sp1 (Sp1) were more abundant in 14 weeks female skin, but no significance was found in males.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
