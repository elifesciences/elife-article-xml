Despite being the most basic form of learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet to emerge. To probe relevant mechanisms, we took advantage of a visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash). We used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging during repeated dark flashes and identified 12 functional classes of neurons that differ based on their rate of adaptation, stimulus response shape, and anatomical location. While most classes of neurons depressed their responses to repeated stimuli, we identified populations that did not adapt or that potentiated their response. These neurons were distributed across brain areas, consistent with a distributed learning process. Using a small-molecule screening approach, we confirmed that habituation manifests from multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, and we have implicated molecular pathways in habituation, including melatonin, oestrogen, and GABA signalling. However, by combining anatomical analyses and pharmacological manipulations with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we failed to identify a simple relationship between pharmacology, altered activity patterns, and habituation behaviour. Collectively, our work indicates that habituation occurs via a complex and distributed plasticity processes that cannot be captured by a simple model. Therefore, untangling the mechanisms of habituation will likely require dedicated approaches aimed at sub-component mechanisms underlying this multidimensional learning process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>habituation</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central function of the brain is to learn and change with experience. These adaptations can reflect attempts to identify and attend preferentially to salient stimuli. For example, identifying the smell of a predator or prey may be crucial, while identifying that my home still smells like my kin is not. This ability to suppress responses to continuous non-salient stimuli is known as habituation, a process generally considered to be the simplest form of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rankin et al., 2009</xref>). Habituation is conserved across all animals, and like other forms of plasticity, exists in at least two mechanistically distinct forms: transient short-term habituation and protein-synthesis-dependent long-term habituation. Here we focus on long-term habituation, which serves as a pragmatic model to dissect plasticity processes in neural circuits.</p><p>Work on long-term habituation in various species and paradigms has led to significant insights into the adaptations underlying this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Ramaswami, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDiarmid et al., 2019</xref>); nonetheless, a consensus model on the general principles underlying habituation is yet to emerge. Physiological and genetic work in <italic>Aplysia</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was consistent with a model in which homosynaptic depression of excitatory synapses drives habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Chen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rose et al., 2003</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glanzman, 2009</xref>). In contrast, work in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory and gustatory systems indicates that the potentiation of inhibitory neurons drives habituation rather than depression of excitatory connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paranjpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trisal et al., 2022</xref>), and habituation to specific orientations of visual cues in mice is associated with the potentiation of neuronal activity and synapses in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>), which requires GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayden et al., 2021</xref>). These studies are more consistent with a model in which the potentiation of inhibition, rather than depression of excitation, drives habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Ramaswami, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we found that long-term habituation of the response of larval zebrafish to sudden pulses of whole-field darkness, or dark flashes (DFs), involves multiple molecularly independent plasticity processes that act to suppress different components of the behavioural response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). Similar behavioural, pharmacological, and genetic experiments have led to comparable conclusions in acoustic short-term habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2023</xref>) and habituation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDiarmid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDiarmid et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that habituation generally acts via multiple modular plasticity processes. These modules act to mute or shift behavioural responses to repeated stimuli. How and where these processes are implemented in the circuit, and how conserved or derived these processes are across species or paradigms remains to be determined. Here we have used a combination of high-throughput behavioural analyses, pharmacology, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to dissect DF habituation. Our results are consistent with a model in which habituation results from a multidimensional and distributed plasticity process, involving multiple independent molecular mechanisms. We propose that GABAergic inhibition is central to DF habituation, but how individual cell types and molecular events lead to behavioural adaptations during habituation will require targeted genetic and cellular approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Volumetric two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of habituation learning</title><p>When stimulated with a DF, larval zebrafish execute an O-bend response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We used a head-fixed paradigm to perform two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in larvae expressing nuclear-targeted GCaMP7f pan-neuronally. Imaging was performed with a resonant scanner and piezo objective, enabling us to cover a volume of ≈600 × 300 × 120 µm (x,y,z) sampled at 0.6 × 0.6 × 10 µm resolution, leading to the detection of 30890 ± 3235 Regions of Interest (ROIs) per larvae (± SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). ROIs were aligned to the Z-Brain atlas coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating that this volume spans the majority of the midbrain, hindbrain, pretectum, and thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>We focused on a single training block of 60 DFs to identify neuronal adaptations that occur during the initial phase of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi</xref>). This paradigm induced strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), some of which were clearly associated with the DF stimuli. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to DFs generally decreased across the 60 stimuli, though this pattern was not seen in all neurons, and substantial heterogeneity in their adaptations was observed. Strong correlated patterns were also seen in large groupings of neurons, predominantly in the hindbrain, which were associated with movement events through their correlation with motion artefacts in the imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To explore the spatial patterns in these data, we used a two-dimensional lookup table to visualize tuning with regressors representing either DF stimuli or movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). This revealed segregated populations of neurons coding for the DFs (pink) and movement (green/teal). As expected, DF-tuned neurons were located predominantly in visual sensory areas of the midbrain (tectum) and the diencephalon (pretectum and thalamus). Motor-coding neurons dominated in the hindbrain, with the exception of the cerebellum and inferior olive, which was predominantly tuned to the sensory stimulus. Some neurons did show approximately equal correlation values to both stimuli, as evidenced by the bluish hues. Finally, some areas of the brain appeared to contain mixtures of neurons with different coding properties, including the ventral diencephalon and midbrain.</p><p>To determine if there was any spatial logic to how different neurons adapt their responsiveness to DFs during imaging, we plotted the ROIs using a lookup table highlighting the preference for either the first three DFs (pink, naive response) or last three DFs (green, trained response). Strong preferences for the naive stimuli reflect a depressing response profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). While most neurons did show tuning consistent with strong depression, there were neurons that showed an equal preference for naive and trained stimuli, or even stronger preference for the latter, indicating stable or potentiating response profiles. These non-depressing neurons were mostly contained in the dorsal regions of the brain, including the torus longitudinalis, cerebellum, and dorsal hindbrain. These results demonstrate that while the majority of neurons across the brain depress their responsiveness during habituation, a smaller population of neurons exists that show the opposite pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Functional classification and anatomical localization of neuronal types observed during habituation learning</title><p>To explore the functional heterogeneity within the DF-tuned neurons, we used affinity propagation clustering.

For this, we screened 1953 small-molecule compounds with known targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), in conjunction with the high-throughput assay we previously established, which has a maximum throughput of 600 larvae/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). As we aimed to identify modulators specific for habituation, we included additional behavioural assays as controls, including the response to acoustic stimuli, the optomotor response (OMR), and the spontaneous swimming behaviour of the fish in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In each 300-well plate, 40 groups of six larvae were treated in individual wells and compared to 60 vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

From 8:00 to 8:30, no stimuli are delivered and fish are monitored for spontaneous behaviour (yellow). From 8:30 to 9:00, fish are given acoustic stimuli via the solenoid tapping on the water bath (pink). From 10:00 to 11:00, fish are stimulated with alternating leftward and rightward motion using the RGB LEDs to induce the optomotor response and turning towards the direction of motion (light blue).

Consequently, using similarities and differences among the induced alterations should uncover molecular and neural linkages among different behavioural outputs. Following this logic, the ability of a compound to co-modify different aspects of behaviour would reflect molecular and/or circuit-level dependencies. For example, visual behaviours that all depend upon photoreceptors should be similarly affected by any compounds that modulate phototransduction in these photoreceptors. We quantified these relationships by calculating the correlated effects on our different behavioural measurements across compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our previous results highlighting uncorrelated learning across the behavioural components of the O-bend response during habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>), we found that different aspects of the response were independently affected pharmacologically, resulting in distinctive correlated groupings within the correlogram. While we previously found that O-bend response probability and latency habituate independently in individual fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>), in our small-molecule screen data these appear to be tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The performance of the animals in the OMR assay under different treatments was also associated with O-bend probability and latency, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of vision or arousal could drive these correlations within the small-molecule screen dataset.</p><p>These analyses confirm habituation behaviour manifests from multiple distinct molecular mechanisms that independently modulate different behavioural outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Modulation of habituation by GABA, melatonin, and oestrogen signalling</title><p>For the remainder of the analyses, we decided to focus on the mechanisms leading to the habituation of response probability as this is the criterion for which it is easiest to identify the link between neural activity and behaviour, providing the best entry point for studying the circuit mechanisms of long-term habituation.

PTX treatment had the strongest effects, with increased responsiveness to DFs during the training and test periods, indicative of defects in habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>). Dose–response experiments confirmed a strong effect of PTX on inhibiting the progressive decrease in responsiveness during habituation learning at 1–10 µM doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, like the naive DF response, the probability of responding to an acoustic stimulus and the optomotor response (OMR) was not inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While strong GABA<sub>A/C</sub>R inhibition results in epileptic activity in larval zebrafish, we did not observe evidence of seizure-like behaviour at these doses, consistent with a partial GABA<sub>A/C</sub>R in our experiments and previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandara et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that partial antagonism of GABA<sub>A</sub>R and/or GABA<sub>C</sub>R is sufficient to strongly suppress habituation but not generalized behavioural excitability, indicating that GABA plays a very prominent role in habituation. This is consistent with a model in which the potentiation of inhibition actively silences sensory-induced activity during habituation to suppress motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Ramaswami, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramaswami, 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Confirmed pharmacological modulators of habituation.</title><p>Dose–response studies for (<bold>A</bold>) picrotoxinin, (<bold>B</bold>) melatonin, (<bold>C</bold>) ethinyl estradiol, and (<bold>D</bold>) hexestrol.

Among the hits observed here were multiple agonists of both melatonin and oestrogen receptors, indicating that hormonal signalling may play a prominent role in habituation. Dose–response studies with melatonin confirmed strong potentiation of habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Melatonin did cause a decrease in spontaneous movement behaviour, consistent with its role in arousal/sleep regulation in zebrafish and other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>), yet melatonin did not inhibit the naive response to DFs, the responsiveness to acoustic stimuli or OMR performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Melatonin’s effect on habituation was also most prominent for the probability of response and did not strongly alter habituation for displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that it does not cause generalized sedation but modulates specific aspects of behaviour at these doses, including increasing habituation of the probability of response.</p><p>We similarly validated that the oestrogen receptor agonists ethinyl estradiol and hexestrol potentiated habituation at 5–100 µM and 1–10 µM doses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Ethinyl estradiol strongly suppressed movement rates at these doses, and both treatments suppressed acoustic responsiveness and OMR performance at doses ≥ 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Thus, it is less clear how specific or generalized oestrogen receptor agonism is on behaviour, although the effective doses of hexestrol for influencing habituation (1–5 uM) were lower than those that significantly affected other behaviours (10 uM). Nevertheless, we decided to focus on PTX and melatonin for the remaining experiments.</p><p>Our screening approach identified both expected (GABA) and unexpected (melatonin, oestrogen) pathways that strongly modulate habituation of responsiveness.

Indeed, melatonin has been found to increase the effects of GABA, and so such a relationship could be direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niles et al., 1987</xref>). In contrast to this straightforward hypothesis, what we observed was considerably more complex. We did not observe alterations of the average response profiles of individual neuronal classes, which remained indistinguishable after the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Instead, the proportion of neurons that belonged to the different classes was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Therefore, the pharmacological manipulations did not alter the activity of neurons in such a way as to alter the average activity states of populations, but instead the proportion of neurons belonging to different populations changed. This may point to fixed and relatively inflexible processing strategies that the brain is using in the context of DF habituation which constrain the possible functional response types.</p><p>The effect of PTX on cluster reassignment generally tended towards weaker depression, increasing the proportion of cells falling into the weaker depressing classes at the expense of strongly depressing classes for a given response shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This pattern was most clear in the classes with ‘short’ and ‘long’ <italic>Response Shapes</italic>, which are those that included the most strongly depressed classes of neurons.</p><p>Based on the hypothesis that melatonin and GABA cooperate during habituation, we expected PTX and melatonin to have opposite effects.

While habituation of the probability of response is oppositely modulated by PTX and melatonin, this is not true of behaviour globally – the behavioural fingerprints of melatonin and GABA are not opposites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) and opposing effects are not seen for the habituation of displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Therefore, a lack of coherent shifts across the entire neural population when applying these treatments is expected.

Analyses of the correlated effects of drugs across different aspects of behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are consistent with our previous results, indicating that habituation results from multiple molecularly independent plasticity processes which act to adapt different aspects of the DF response during habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). Here we focused our analysis on those pharmacological agents and pathways that strongly and relatively specifically modulated habituation when measuring response probability. We found that inhibition of GABA<sub>A/C</sub> receptors using PTX reduced habituation learning. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the zebrafish brain, and deficits in GABA signalling lead to epileptic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>). We were fortunate that our screening concentration (10 µM) did not cause seizures, but was still sufficient to inhibit habituation. This implies that the habituation circuit is exquisitely sensitive to changes in GABA signalling at levels well below the threshold required to drastically change excitatory-inhibitory balances. We cannot rule out the possibility that off-targets of PTX or subtle non-specific changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance alter habituation behaviour. However, the lack of strong modulation of other behaviours, including the response to acoustic stimuli or the optomotor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggests that GABAergic inhibition plays a crucial role in the process of DF habituation.</p><p>A critical role for GABA in habituation is also consistent with data from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where both olfactory and gustatory habituation have been linked to GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paranjpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trisal et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, this circuit motif of increasing inhibition to drive habituation may be a conserved feature of habituation, which would allow for a straightforward mechanism for habituation override during dishabituation via dis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Ramaswami, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trisal et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our screen also identified that neurohormonal signalling is critical for habituation, where melatonin and oestrogen receptor agonists potently increase habituation learning rate. The role of oestrogens in learning and memory is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nilsson and Gustafsson, 2002</xref>). Though its role in habituation is less well explored, it has previously been shown to increase memory retention for olfactory habituation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillon et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, melatonin has not previously been implicated in habituation, though it has been implicated in other learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El-Sherif et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jilg et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, melatonin was shown to block operant learning at night in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rawashdeh et al., 2007</xref>), and therefore melatonin appears to be able to both promote or inhibit plasticity in zebrafish, depending on the paradigm.</p><p>While melatonin and oestrogen were not strong candidates for involvement in DF habituation plasticity before our screen, their previous associations with learning and memory reinforce the idea that these molecules play critical roles in plasticity processes. In support of this idea, we have previously shown that habituation is regulated in a circadian-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>), and both melatonin and oestrogen levels fluctuate across the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvord et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that either or both of these pathways may act to couple the circadian rhythm with learning performance.</p><p>Finally, approximately 2% of the US population use melatonin as a sleep aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2022</xref>), and a substantial proportion of US women take oestrogen as part of either oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Therefore, understanding the roles these molecules play in neuroplasticity is a clear public health concern.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Circuit mechanisms of DF habituation</title><p>Based on behavioural experiments, we previously postulated that multiple plasticity loci cooperate in the habituating DF circuit, arranged in both parallel and series within the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). Here, our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments identified a diverse range of neuronal <italic>Adaptation Profiles</italic>, including non-adapting and potentiating neurons spread throughout sensory- and motor-related areas of the brain. Thus, non-habituated signals are transmitted throughout the brain, consistent with a distributed learning process. Such a model is further supported with brain-wide imaging data for short-term habituation to looming stimuli, where distributed neurons were identified that showed differential rates of habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marquez-Legorreta et al., 2022</xref>). It is important to point out that Marquez-Legorreta et al. did not observe non-adapting or potentiating neurons in their experiments. This may be due to the differences in analysis methods or could highlight a difference between short- and long-term habituation circuit mechanisms, the latter of which may rely on more complex circuit mechanisms involving both potentiation and suppression of neuronal responses.</p><p>We also observed classes exhibiting an On-response profile (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msubsup><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msubsup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). These neurons fire at the ramping increase in luminance after the DF, making it unlikely that they play a role in aspects of acute DF behaviour we measured here. These neurons exist in both non-adapting and depressing forms, suggesting a yet unidentified role in behavioural adaptation to repeated DFs.</p><p>While we have insufficient anatomical data to constrain circuit connectivity models that drive DF habituation, here we demonstrate the use of pharmacology, functional imaging, and neurotransmitter classifications to constrain our models. Specifically, pharmacology indicated a role for GABA and melatonin in habituation, and our functional imaging identified distinct classes of neuronal types in the DF circuit, including potentiating neurons (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msubsup><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).

Instead, we found that the GABAergic neurons in the circuit are characterized by their short burst of activity to the stimulus onset. If the GABAergic neurons are not increasing in their firing rates but do drive habituation, then perhaps it is the potentiation of GABAergic synapses that drives habituation. This is a somewhat unexpected model as studies of long-term synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD) have overwhelmingly focused on plasticity at excitatory synapses. Although a functional link to behaviour is less well established, long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity has been well documented, including inhibitory (i)-LTP and i-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castillo et al., 2011</xref>).

Making direct comparisons between freely swimming behaviour and head-fixed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is always challenging due to the differences in behaviour observed in the two contexts, and therefore our failure to identify a clear logic in these experiments may have technical explanations that will require approaches to measure neural activity from unrestrained and freely behaving animals to resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, these results are again consistent with the idea that habituation is a multidimensional and perhaps highly non-linear phenomenon in the circuit, which cannot be captured by a simple model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit loci of DF habituation</title><p>Where in the brain does habituation take place? As discussed above and previously, our data is inconsistent with a single locus of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randlett et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, we propose that plasticity is distributed throughout the circuit. Since PTX inhibits most aspects of habituation learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai</xref>), these all may involve GABAergic motifs. Moreover, the different functional classes of neurons are distributed through sensory- and motor-related areas of the brain, consistent with the notion that habituation plasticity occurs in a very distributed manner. While distributed, there are clear associations between anatomical location and functional neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>), indicating that there is some degree of regional logic to the localization of <italic>Adaptation Profiles</italic>.

The SSMD was then calculated for each of these average fish values for the compound-treated larvae relative to the vehicle (DMSO) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Volumetric imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) was performed at 930 nm on a Bruker Ultima microscope at the CIQLE imaging platform (Lyon, LYMIC) using a resonant scanner resonant scanner over a rectangular region of 1024 × 512 pixels (0.6 µm x/y resolution) and piezo objective mount for fast z-scanning. Imaging sessions began by taking an ‘Anatomy Stack’ consisting of 150 slices at 1 µm z-steps, summed over 128 repeats (imaging time ≈11 min). This served as the reference stack used for alignment to the Z-Brain atlas and detect Z-drift in the imaging session (see below). The functional stack consisted of 12 slices separated at 10 µm steps, thus covering 120 µm in the brain acquired at 1.98 Hz. To image <italic>Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s);Tg(gad1b:DsRed</italic>) double transgenic larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we used a custom-built two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haesemeyer et al., 2018</xref>), imaging 512 × 512 images (0.98 µm x/y resolution) at 1.05 Hz. The anatomy stack was taken at 2 µm step sizes for both the green and red channels in the dark. Functional imaging was performed only on the green/GCaMP channel since the red stimulus LED was incompatible with DsRed imaging.</p><p>When developing this protocol, we determined that substantial shifts of more than a cell-body diameter (5 uM) in the Z-plane are common during the ≈1.2 hr of imaging. We determined this by comparing the sum of the functional image planes during five equally sized time epochs (1540 frames per epoch), aligned to the ‘Anatomy Stack,’ using ‘phase_cross_correlation’ in the scikit-image library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). This allowed us to quantify shifts in the imaging plane as shifts in this alignment. These tended to occur within the first hour of imaging; therefore, we performed an hour of imaging of this functional stack before beginning the DF stimulation protocol to allow the preparation to settle under imaging conditions. DFs were delivered using a 3 mm red LED mounted above the fish, controlled by an Arduino Nano connected to the microscope GPIO board and the Prairie View software to deliver pulses of darkness consisting of 1 s light off, 20 s linear ramp back to light on, delivered at 60 s intervals.</p><p>Even with this pre-imaging protocol, z-shifts were still observed in a considerable number of fish. Since our habituation-based analysis is focused on how individual neurons change their responses over time, shifts in the z-plane are extremely problematic as they are not correctable post-acquisition and can result in different neurons being imaged at individual voxels. This could easily be confused for changes in functional responses over time during habituation. Therefore, any fish showing a z-drift of greater than 3 µm was excluded from our analysis. Stable z-positioning was further confirmed by manual inspection of the eigen images in the imaging time course using ‘View registration metrics’ in suite2p to confirm that these do not reflect z-drift. Of the 56 larvae imagined in total, 22 were excluded, leaving 34 included. Larvae were treated with 0.1% DMSO, picrotoxinin (PTX, 10 uM), or melatonin (1 uM) approximately 1 hr before imaging. These fish were analysed as a single population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) and separately to determine the effects of the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>To quantify responses to the DF stimuli, we used motion artefacts in the imaging data to identify frames associated with movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Motion artefact was quantified using the ‘corrXY’ parameter from suite2p, which reflects the peak of phase correlation comparing each acquired frame and reference image used for motion correction. The ‘motion power’ was quantified as the standard deviation of a three-frame rolling window, which was smoothed in time using a Savitzky–Golay filter (window length = 15 frames, polyorder = 2). A response to a DF was defined as a ‘motion power’ signal greater than 3 (z-score) occurring within 10 s of the DF onset and was used to quantify habituation in the head-embedded preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analysis</title><p>ROIs were identified using suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>) using the parameters outlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/owenrandlett/lamire_2022/blob/main/RunSuite2p_BrukerData_ScreenPaper.py">RunSuite2p_BrukerData_ScreenPaper.py</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/owenrandlett/lamire_2022/blob/main/RunSuite2p_MartinPhotonData_ScreenPaper.py">RunSuite2p_MartinPhotonData_ScreenPaper.py</ext-link> scripts for the data from the Bruker Ultima microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) and custom-built two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>), respectively. These ROIs mostly reflected individual neuronal nuclei/soma. The clustered heatmap image of neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) was generated using the suite2p GUI using the ‘Visualize selected cells’ function and sorting the neurons using the rastermap algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/rastermap">https://github.com/MouseLand/rastermap</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MouseLand, 2023</xref>). The imaging planes were then aligned to the anatomical stack taken before functional imaging using ‘phase_cross_correlation’ in the scikit-image library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). For the volumetric data, the anatomical stack was then aligned to the Z-Brain atlas coordinates using CMTK, and ROI coordinates were transformed into Z-Brain coordinates using streamxform in CMTK. These steps were performed using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/owenrandlett/lamire_2022/blob/main/Bruker2p_AnalyzePlanesAndRegister.py">Bruker2p_AnalyzePlanesAndRegister.py</ext-link>.</p><p>To identify ROIs that were correlated with the stimulus, we used a regression-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miri et al., 2011</xref>), where we identified ROIs that were correlated with vectors representing the time course of the DF stimuli convolved with a kernel approximating the slowed H2B-GCaMP time course with respect to neuronal activity. These regressors reflected either the entire 21 s DF stimulus, or only the onset of the flash, and either the first three, last three, or all 60 flashes (six regressors in total). To identify neurons correlated to motor output, we took advantage of the plane-based registration statistics calculated by suite2p. Specifically, the ‘ops[’corrXY’]’ metric, which reflects the correlation of each registered image frame with the reference image. We reasoned that movements would cause image artefacts and distortions that would be reflected as a transient drop in these correlations. Indeed, we confirmed this association by imaging the tail using an infrared camera and compared the motion index calculated through tail tracking, and that which we calculated based on the motion artefacts, which showed good overall agreement in predicted movement events and average correlation of 0.4, demonstrating that these image-based artefacts can be used as reliable proxies of tail movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, regressors based on these motion indices were used to identify neurons correlated with motor output.</p><p>Images for the functional tuning of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>) were computed using the hue saturation value (HSV) colour scheme, with the maximal correlation value to either regressor mapped to saturation, and the hue value reflecting the linear preference for either regressor. Clustering of functional response types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was done by first selecting all those ROIs that showed a correlation of ≥0.25 with any of the six stimulus regressors across all imaged fish. Then among these ROIs we removed any ROIs that did not show a correlation of ≥0.3 with at least five ROIs imaged in a different larvae. This filtered out ROIs that were unique in any individual fish, allowing us to focus on those neuron types that were most consistent across individuals. We then used the Affinity Propagation clustering from scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>), with ‘affinity’ computed as the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients (corrcoef in NumPy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2020</xref>), preference = -9 and damping = 0.9, and clustered using hierarchical clustering (cluster.hierarchy in SciPy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>). Cluster number was assigned based on the ordering of the hierarchical clustering tree.</p><p>To generate the final cluster assignments, we re-scanned all the ROIs calculating their correlation with the mean-response vectors for each of the identified 12 functional clusters, selecting those with a correlation value of ≥0.3, which were then assigned to the cluster with which they had the highest correlation.

The authors make use of many of the striking advantages of the larval zebrafish to perform whole brain, single neuronal calcium imaging during repeated sensory exposure, and high throughput screening of pharmacological agents in freely moving, habituating larvae. Notably, several blockers/antagonists of GABAA(C) receptors completely suppress habituation of the O-bend escape response to dark flashes, suggesting a key role for GABAergic transmission in this form of habituation. Other substances are identified that strikingly enhance habituation, including melatonin, although here the suggested mechanistic insight is less specific. To add to these findings, a number of functional clusters of neurons are identified in the larval brain that have divergent activity through habituation, with many clusters exhibiting suppression of different degrees, in line with adaptive filtration during habituation, and a single cluster that potentiates during habituation. Further assessment reveals that all of these clusters include GABAergic inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons, so we cannot take away the simple interpretation that the potentiating cluster of neurons is inhibitory and therefore exerts an influence on the other adapting (depressing) clusters to produce habituation. Rather, a variety of interpretations remain in play.</p><p>Overall, there is great potential in the approach that has been used here to gain insight into circuit-level mechanisms of habituation. There are many experiments performed by the authors that cannot be achieved currently in other vertebrate systems, so the manuscript serves as a potential methodological platform that can be used to support a rich array of future work. While there are several key observations that one can take away from this manuscript, a clear interpretation of the role of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in habituation has not been established. This potential feature of habituation is emphasized throughout, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections, meaning that one is obliged as a reader to interrogate whether the results as they currently stand really do demonstrate a role for GABAergic inhibition in habituation. Currently, the key piece of evidence that may support this conclusion is that picrotoxin, which acts to block some classes of GABA receptors, prevents habituation. However, there are interpretations of this finding that do not specifically require a role for modified GABAergic inhibition. For instance, by lowering GABAergic inhibition, an overall increase in neural activity will occur within the brain, in this case below a level that could cause a seizure. That increase in activity may simply prevent learning by massively increasing neural noise and therefore either preventing synaptic plasticity or, more likely, causing indiscriminate synaptic strengthening and weakening that occludes information storage. Sensory processing itself could also be disrupted, for instance by altering the selectivity of receptive fields. Alternatively, it could be that the increase in neural activity produced by the blockade of inhibition simply drives more behavioral output, meaning that more excitatory synaptic adaptation is required to suppress that output. The authors propose two specific working models of the ways in which GABAergic inhibition could be implemented in habituation. An alternative model, in which GABAergic neurons are not themselves modified but act as a key intermediary between Hebbian assemblies of excitatory neurons that are modified to support memory and output neurons, is not explored. As yet, these or other models in which inhibition is not required for habituation, have not been fully tested.</p><p>This manuscript describes a really substantial body of work that provides evidence of functional clusters of neurons with divergent responses to repeated sensory input and an array of pharmacological agents that can influence the rate of a fundamentally important form of learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84926.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Lamire et al. use a calcium imaging approach, behavioural tests, and pharmacological manipulations to identify the molecular mechanisms behind visual habituation. They show a valuable drug screen paradigm to assess the impact of pharmacological compounds on the behaviour of larval zebrafish.</p><p>The pharmacological screen identifies an expected suppression of habituation by GABA receptor antagonists. More interestingly, it identifies potentially new contributions of melatonin receptor agonists, and oestrogen receptor agonists to habituation, as they seem to increase the rate of habituation.</p><p>The volumetric calcium imaging of habituation to dark flashes is valuable, but the mix of responses to visual cues that are not relevant to the dark flash escape, such as the slow increase back to baseline luminosity, lowers the clarity of the results. The link between the calcium imaging results and free-swimming behaviour is not especially convincing, however, that is a common issue of head-restrained imaging with larval zebrafish. The identification of a cluster of neurons with potentiating responses, which could drive the habituation is intriguing, but more characterizations of these neurons would be needed to fully understand their function in habituation. The pharmacological manipulation of the habituation circuits mapped in the first part does not arrive at any satisfying conclusion, which is acknowledged by the authors.</p><p>Overall, the authors did identify interesting new molecular pathways that may be involved in habituation to dark flashes. Their screening approach, while not novel, will be a powerful way to interrogate other behavioural profiles. The authors identified circuit loci apparently involved in habituation to dark flashes, and the potentiation and no adaptation clusters have not been previously observed and are interesting targets for future work. This work suggests that the circuits and mechanisms underlying habituation are likely more complex than anticipated. The data will be useful to guide follow-up experiments by the community on the new pathway candidates that this screen has uncovered, including behaviours beyond dark flash habituation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84926.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>To analyze the circuit mechanisms leading to the habituation of the O-bed responses upon repeated dark flashes (DFs), the authors performed 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in larvae expressing nuclear-targeted GCaMP7f pan-neuronally panning the majority of the midbrain, hindbrain, pretectum, and thalamus. They found that while the majority of neurons across the brain depress their responsiveness during habituation, a smaller population of neurons in the dorsal regions of the brain, including the torus longitudinalis, cerebellum, and dorsal hindbrain, showed the opposite pattern, suggesting that motor-related brain regions contain non-depressed signals, and therefore likely contribute to habituation plasticity.</p><p>Further analysis using affinity propagation clustering identified 12 clusters that differed both in their adaptation to repeated DFs, as well as the shape of their response to the DF.</p><p>Next by the pharmacological screening of 1953 small molecule compounds with known targets in conjunction with the high-throughput assay, they found that 176 compounds significantly altered some aspects of measured behavior. Among them, they sought to identify the compounds that (1) have minimal effects on the naive response to DFs, but strong effects during the training and/or memory retention periods, (2) have minimal effects on other aspects of behaviors, (3) show similar behavioral effects to other compounds tested in the same molecular pathway, and identified the GABAA/C Receptor antagonists Bicuculline, Amoxapine, and Picrotoxinin (PTX). As partial antagonism of GABAAR and/or GABACR is sufficient to strongly suppress habituation but not generalized behavioral excitability, they concluded that GABA plays a very prominent role in habituation. They also identified multiple agonists of both Melatonin and Estrogen receptors, indicating that hormonal signalling may also play a prominent role in habituation response.</p><p>To integrate the results of the Ca2+ imaging experiments with the pharmacological screening results, the authors compared the Ca2+ activity patterns after treatment with vehicle, PTX, or Melatonin in the tethered larvae. The behavioral effects of PTX and Melatonin were much smaller compared with the very strong behavioral effects in freely-swimming animals, but the authors assumed that the difference was significant enough to continue further experiments. Based on the hypothesis that Melatonin and GABA cooperate during habituation, they expected PTX and Melatonin to have opposite effects. This was not the case in their results: for example, the size of the 12(Pot, M) neuron population was increased by both PTX and Melatonin, suggesting that pharmacological manipulations that affect habituation behavior manifest in complex functional alterations in the circuit, making capturing these effects by a simple difficult.</p><p>Since the 12(<italic>Pot, M</italic>) neurons potentiate their responses and thus could act to progressively depress the responses of other neuronal classes, they examined the identity of these neurons with GABA neurons. However, GABAergic neurons in the habituating circuit are not characterized by their Adaptation Profile, suggesting that global manipulations of GABAergic signalling through PTX have complex manifestations in the functional properties of neurons.</p><p>Overall, the authors have performed an admirably large amount of work both in whole-brain neural activity imaging and pharmacological screening.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84926.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lamire</surname><given-names>Laurie Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Laboratoire MeLiS, UCBL - CNRS UMR5284 - Inserm U1314, Institut NeuroMyoGène</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Haesemeyer</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Ohio State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Columbus</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Engert</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Granato</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Randlett</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Laboratoire MeLiS, UCBL - CNRS UMR5284 - Inserm U1314, Institut NeuroMyoGène</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This valuable manuscript attempts to identify the brain regions and cell types involved in habituation to dark flash stimuli in larval zebrafish.

However, the data presented are incomplete and do not show a convincing causative link between pharmacological manipulations, neural activity patterns, and behavioral outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their careful reading and reviews of our work. We are grateful that they appreciate the value in our experimental approach and results. We acknowledge what we interpret as the major criticism, that in our original manuscript we focused too heavily on the hypothesized role of GABAergic neurons in driving habituation. This hypothesis will remain only indirectly supported until we can identify a GABAergic population of neurons that drives habituation. Therefore, we have revised our manuscript, decreasing the focus on GABA, and rather emphasizing the following three points:</p><p>1. By performing the first Ca2+ imaging experiments during dark flash habituation, we identify multiple distinct functional classes of neurons which have different adaptation profiles, including non-adapting and potentiating classes. These neurons are spread throughout the brain, indicating that habituation is a complex and distributed process.</p><p>2. By performing a pharmacological screen for dark flash habituation modifiers, we confirm habituation behaviour manifests from multiple distinct molecular mechanisms that independently modulate different behavioural outputs. We also implicate multiple novel pathways in habituation plasticity, some of which we have validated through dose-response studies.</p><p>3. By combining pharmacology and Ca2+ imaging, we did not observe a simple relationship between the behavioural effects of a drug treatment and functional alterations in neurons. This observation further supports our model that habituation is a multidimensional process, for which a simple circuit model will be insufficient.</p><p>We would like to point out that, in our opinion, there appears to be a factual error in the final sentence of the eLife assessment:</p><p>“However, the data presented are incomplete and do not show a convincing causative link betweenpharmacological manipulations, neural activity patterns, and behavioral outcomes”.</p><p>We believe that a “convincing causative link” between pharmacological manipulations and behavioural outcomes has been clearly demonstrated for PTX, Melatonin, Estradiol and Hexestrol through our dose response experiments. Similarly a link between pharmacology and neural activity patterns has also been directly demonstrated. As mentioned in (3), we acknowledge that our data linking neural activity and behaviour is more tenuous, as will be more explicitly reflected in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, we maintain that one of the primary strengths of our study is our attempt to integrate analyses that span the behavioural, pharmacological, and neural activity-levels.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have substantially altered the Abstract and Discussion, removed the Model figure (previously Figure 8), and changed the title from :</p><p>“Inhibition drives habituation of a larval zebrafish visual response”</p><p>to:</p><p>“Functional and pharmacological analyses of visual habituation learning in larval zebrafish”</p><p>Text changes from the initial version are visible as track changes in the word document: “LamireEtAl_2022_eLifeRevisions.docx”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript addresses the important and understudied issue of circuit-level mechanisms supporting habituation, particularly in pursuit of the possible role of increases in the activity of inhibitory neurons in suppressing behavioral output during long-term habituation. The authors make use of many of the striking advantages of the larval zebrafish to perform whole brain, single neuronal calcium imaging during repeated sensory exposure, and high throughput screening of pharmacological agents in freely moving, habituating larvae. Notably, several blockers/antagonists of GABAA(C) receptors completely suppress habituation of the O-bend escape response to dark flashes, suggesting a key role for GABAergic transmission in this form of habituation. Other substances are identified that strikingly enhance habituation, including melatonin, although here the suggested mechanistic insight is less specific. To add to these findings, a number of functional clusters of neurons are identified in the larval brain that has divergent activity through habituation, with many clusters exhibiting suppression of different degrees, in line with adaptive filtration during habituation, and a single cluster that potentiates during habituation. Further assessment reveals that all of these clusters include GABAergic inhibitory neurons and excitatory neurons, so we cannot take away the simple interpretation that the potentiating cluster of neurons is inhibitory and therefore exerts an influence on the other adapting (depressing) clusters to produce habituation. Rather, a variety of interpretations remain in play.</p><p>Overall, there is great potential in the approach that has been used here to gain insight intocircuit-level mechanisms of habituation. There are many experiments performed by the authors that cannot be achieved currently in other vertebrate systems, so the manuscript serves as a potential methodological platform that can be used to support a rich array of future work. While there are several key observations that one can take away from this manuscript, a clear interpretation of the role of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in habituation has not been established. This potential feature of habituation is emphasized throughout, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections, meaning that one is obliged as a reader to interrogate whether the results as they currently stand really do demonstrate a role for GABAergic inhibition in habituation. Currently, the key piece of evidence that may support this conclusion is that picrotoxin, which acts to block some classes of GABA receptors, prevents habituation. However, there are interpretations of this finding that do not specifically require a role for modified GABAergic inhibition. For instance, by lowering GABAergic inhibition, an overall increase in neural activity will occur within the brain, in this case below a level that could cause a seizure. That increase in activity may simply prevent learning by massively increasing neural noise and therefore either preventing synaptic plasticity or, more likely, causing indiscriminate synaptic strengthening and weakening that occludes information storage. Sensory processing itself could also be disrupted, for instance by altering the selectivity of receptive fields. Alternatively, it could be that the increase in neural activity produced by the blockade of inhibition simply drives more behavioral output, meaning that more excitatory synaptic adaptation is required to suppress that output. The authors propose two specific working models of the ways in which GABAergic inhibition could be implemented in habituation. An alternative model, in which GABAergic neurons are not themselves modified but act as a key intermediary between Hebbian assemblies of excitatory neurons that are modified to support memory and output neurons, is not explored. As yet, these or other models in which inhibition is not required for habituation, have not been fully tested.</p><p>This manuscript describes a really substantial body of work that provides evidence of functional clusters of neurons with divergent responses to repeated sensory input and an array of pharmacological agents that can influence the rate of a fundamentally important form of learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful consideration of our work, and we agree that multiple models of how habituation occurs remain plausible. As discussed above and below in more detail, we have revised our manuscript to better reflect this. We hope the reviewer will agree that this has improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Lamire et al. use a calcium imaging approach, behavioural tests, and pharmacological manipulations to identify the molecular mechanisms behind visual habituation. Overall, the manuscript is well-written but difficult to follow at times. They show a valuable new drug screen paradigm to assess the impact of pharmacological compounds on the behaviour of larval zebrafish, the results are convincing, but the description of the work is sometimes confusing and lacking details.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying areas where our description lacked details. We apologize for these omissions and have attempted to add relevant details as described below. We note that all of the analysis code is available online, though we appreciate that navigating and extracting data from these files is not straightforward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The volumetric calcium imaging of habituation to dark flashes is valuable, but the mix of responses to visual cues that are not relevant to the dark flash escape, such as the slow increase back to baseline luminosity, lowers the clarity of the results. The link between the calcium imaging results and free-swimming behaviour is not especially convincing, however, that is a common issue of head-restrained imaging with larval zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the design of our stimulus, and specifically the slow increase back to baseline luminosity, is perhaps confusing for the interpretation of some of the response profiles of neurons. We originally chose this stimulus type (rather than a square wave of 1s of darkness, for example) in order to better highlight the responses of the larvae to the onset of darkness (rather than the response to abruptly returning to full brightness). We therefore believe that the slow return to baseline is an important feature of the stimulus,, which better separates activity related to the fast offset from activity related to light onset. And since all of the foundational behavioural data (Randlett et al., Current Biology 2019), and pharmacological data, used this stimulus type, we did not change it for the Ca2+ imaging experiments. Our use of relatively slow nuclear-targeted GCaMP indicators also means that the temporal resolution of our imaging experiments is relatively poor, and therefore we felt that using a stimulus that highlighted light offset might be best.</p><p>We also fully acknowledge in the Results section that the behaviour of the head embedded fish is not the same as that of free-swimming fish, and that therefore establishing a direct link between these types of experiments is complicated. This is an unavoidable caveat in the head-embedded style experiments. To further emphasize this, we have also added a paragraph to the discussion where this is acknowledged explicitly.</p><p>“We also found that the same pharmacological treatments that result in strong alterations to habituation behaviour in freely swimming larvae ([fig:5]), resulted in relatively subtle and complex functional alterations in the circuit ([fig:6]). Making direct comparisons between freely-swimming behaviour and head-fixed Ca2+ imaging is always challenging due to the differences in behaviour observed in the two contexts, and therefore our failure to identify a clear logic in these experiments may have technical explanations that will require approaches to measure neural activity from unrestrained and freely-behaving animals to resolve . Alternatively, these results are again consistent with the idea that habituation is a multidimensional and perhaps highly non-linear phenomenon in the circuit, which cannot be captured by a simple model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The strong focus on GABA seems unwarranted based on the pharmacological results, as only Picrotoxinin gives clear results, but the other antagonists do not give a consistent results. On the other hand, the melatonin receptor agonists, and oestrogen receptor agonists give more consistent results, including more convincing dose effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our manuscript focused too strongly on GABA and have toned this down. We are currently performing genetic experiments aimed at identifying the Melatonin, Estrogen and GABA receptors that function during habituation, which we think will be necessary to move beyond pharmacology and the necessary caveats that such experiments bring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pharmacological manipulation of the habituation circuits mapped in the first part does not arrive at any satisfying conclusion, which is acknowledged by the authors. These results do reinforce the disconnect between the calcium imaging and the behavioural experiments and undercut somewhat the proposed circuit-level model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this criticism and have toned down the focus on GABA specifically in the circuit, and have removed the speculative model previously in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors did identify interesting new molecular pathways that may be involved in habituation to dark flashes. Their screening approach, while not novel, will be a powerful way to interrogate other behavioural profiles. The authors identified circuit loci apparently involved in habituation to dark flashes, and the potentiation and no adaptation clusters have not been previously observed as far as I know.</p><p>The data will be useful to guide follow-up experiments by the community on the new pathway candidates that this screen has uncovered, including behaviours beyond dark flash habituation.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for both their support of our approach, and in pointing out where our conclusions were not well supported by our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>To analyze the circuit mechanisms leading to the habituation of the O-bed responses upon repeated dark flashes (DFs), the authors performed 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in larvae expressingnuclear-targeted GCaMP7f pan-neuronally panning the majority of the midbrain, hindbrain, pretectum, and thalamus. They found that while the majority of neurons across the brain depress their responsiveness during habituation, a smaller population of neurons in the dorsal regions of the brain, including the torus longitudinalis, cerebellum, and dorsal hindbrain, showed the opposite pattern, suggesting that motor-related brain regions contain non-depressed signals, and therefore likely contribute to habituation plasticity.</p><p>Further analysis using affinity propagation clustering identified 12 clusters that differed both in their adaptation to repeated DFs, as well as the shape of their response to the DF.</p><p>Next by the pharmacological screening of 1953 small molecule compounds with known targets in conjunction with the high-throughput assay, they found that 176 compounds significantly altered some aspects of measured behavior. Among them, they sought to identify the compounds that (1) have minimal effects on the naive response to DFs, but strong effects during the training and/or memory retention periods, (2) have minimal effects on other aspects of behaviors, (3) show similar behavioral effects to other compounds tested in the same molecular pathway, and identified the GABAA/C Receptor antagonists Bicuculline, Amoxapine, and Picrotoxinin (PTX). As partial antagonism of GABAAR and/or GABACR is sufficient to strongly suppress habituation but not generalized behavioral excitability, they concluded that GABA plays a very prominent role in habituation. They also identified multiple agonists of both Melatonin and Estrogen receptors, indicating that hormonal signaling may also play a prominent role in habituation response.</p><p>To integrate the results of the Ca2+ imaging experiments with the pharmacological screening results, the authors compared the Ca2+ activity patterns after treatment with vehicle, PTX, or Melatonin in the tethered larvae. The behavioral effects of PTX and Melatonin were much smaller compared with the very strong behavioral effects in freely-swimming animals, but the authors assumed that the difference was significant enough to continue further experiments. Based on the hypothesis that Melatonin and GABA cooperate during habituation, they expected PTX and Melatonin to have opposite effects. This was not the case in their results: for example, the size of the 12(Pot, M) neuron population was increased by both PTX and Melatonin, suggesting that pharmacological manipulations that affect habituation behavior manifest in complex functional alterations in the circuit, making capturing these effects by a simple difficult.</p><p>Since the 12(<italic>Pot, M</italic>�) neurons potentiate their responses and thus could act to progressively depress the responses of other neuronal classes, they examined the identity of these neurons with GABA neurons. However, GABAergic neurons in the habituating circuit are not characterized by their Adaptation Profile, suggesting that global manipulations of GABAergic signaling through PTX have complex manifestations in the functional properties of neurons.</p><p>Overall, the authors have performed an admirably large amount of work both in whole-brain neural activity imaging and pharmacological screening. However, they are not successful in integrating the results of both experiments into an acceptably consistent interpretation due to the incongruency of the results of different experiments. Although the authors present some models for interpretation, it is not easy for me to believe that this model would help the readers of this journal to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms for habituation in DF responses at the neural circuit level.</p><p>This reviewer would rather recommend the authors divide this manuscript into two and publish two papers by adding some more strengthening data for each part such as cellular manipulations, e.g. ablation to prove the critical involvement of 12(Pot, M) neurons in habituation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful consideration of our manuscript, and we agree that our emphasis on a particular model of DF habituation, namely the potentiation of GABAergic synapses, was overly speculative. We hope they will agree that our revised manuscript better reflect the results from our experiments, and we have tried to more specifically emphasize the incongruency in our behavioural and Ca2+ imaging data after pharmacological treatment, which we agree shows that a simple model is insufficient to capture both of these sets of observations.</p><p>We have opted not to split the paper into two, since we feel that the collective message of this paper and approach combining molecular and functional analysis will be of interest. Moreover, we feel that the molecular and functional analyses feed off of each other and provide a level of complementarity that would be lost if the manuscript would be split, even if the message in this particular case is rather complex</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>There is much to commend about this manuscript. The advantages of studying habituation in the zebrafish larva are very clearly demonstrated, including the wonderful calcium imaging across the brain and the relatively high throughput screening of large numbers of different pharmacological agents. The habituation to dark flashes in freely moving larvae is also striking and the very large effect size serves the screening beautifully. Thus, if we take the really substantial amount of work of a very high standard that has been done here, there is clearly potential for an important new contribution to the literature. However, as you will see from my public review, I am of the opinion that a specific role for the modification of GABAergic inhibitory systems has not yet been established through this work. While the potential role for GABAergic inhibitory neurons in habituation, either as the key modifiable element or as an intermediary between memory and motor output, is an attractive theory with many strengths, your study as it currently stands does not categorically demonstrate that one of those two options holds. For instance, the more traditional view, that adaptive filtration is mediated by weakened synaptic connectivity between excitatory sensory systems and excitatory motor output or reduced intrinsic excitability in those same neurons, could still be in operation here. By lowering GABAergic influence over post-synaptic targets with picrotoxin, it is possible that motor output remains highly active, and even lower activity or synaptic drive from those excitatory sensory systems that feed into the output may still reliably produce behavioral output. Alternatively, it could be the formation of a memory of the familiar stimulus is disrupted by reduced inhibition that alters sensory coding either by introducing noise or reducing the selectivity of receptive fields. I believe that there are several options to address these concerns:</p><p>1. You could change the emphasis of the manuscript so that it is less focused on inhibition and instead emphasizes the categorization of clusters of neurons that have divergent responses during habituation, including either strong suppression to potentiation. To this, you add a high throughput screening system with a wide range of different agents being tested, several of which produce a significant effect on habituation in either direction. These observations in themselves provide powerful building blocks for future work.</p><p>1. If GABAergic neurons play a key role in habituation in this paradigm, then picrotoxin is having its effect by blocking receptors on excitatory neurons. Thus, it seems that selectively imaging GABAergic neurons before and after the application of these drugs is not likely to reveal the contribution of GABAergic synaptic influence on excitatory targets. More important is to get a stronger sense of how the GABAergic neurons change their activity throughout habituation and then influence the downstream target neurons of those GABAergic neurons (some of which may themselves be inhibitory and participating in disinhibition). For instance, you could interrogate whether anti-correlations in activity levels exist between presynaptic inhibitory neurons and putative post-synaptic targets. This analysis could be further bolstered by removing that relationship in the presence of Picrotoxin, thereby demonstrating a direct influence of inhibition from a GABAergic presynaptic partner on a postsynaptic target. While this would constitute a lot more work, it is likely to yield greater insight into a specific role for GABAergic neurons in habituation, and I suspect much of that information is in the existing datasets.</p><p>1. To really reveal causal roles for inhibition in this form of habituation, it seems to me that there needs to be some selective intervention in GABAergic neuronal activity, ideally bidirectionally, to transiently interrupt or enhance habituation. Optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation/inactivation is one option in this regard, which I imagine would be challenging to implement and certainly involves a lot of further work, particularly if you are then going to target specific subpopulations of GABAergic neurons. I appreciate that this option seems way beyond the scope of a review process and would probably constitute a follow-up study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not “categorically demonstrated” that GABAergic inhibitory neurons drive habituation by increasing their influence on the circuit, and appreciate the suggestions for how to reformulate our manuscript to better reflect this. We have opted to follow suggestion (1), and have considerably changed the focus of the manuscript.</p><p>The additional analysis suggested in (2) is very interesting, but since we can not identify which cells are inhibitory in our imaging experiments with picrotoxinin treatment, nor which are pre- orpost-synaptic, we feel that this analysis will be very unconstrained. Also, if GABA is acting as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, it therefore is expected to act to drive anticorrelations among pre and postsynaptic neurons through inhibition. Therefore, blockage of GABA through PTX would be expected to result in increased correlations, regardless of our hypothesized role of neurons during habituation. Our current efforts are aimed at identifying critical neurons driving habituation plasticity, and we will perform such analysis once we have mechanisms for identifying these neurons.</p><p>Finally, we agree that (3) is the obvious and only way to demonstrate causation here, and this is where we are working towards. However, since we currently have no means of genetically targeting these neurons, we are not able to perform these suggested experiments today.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have some additional concerns that I would really appreciate you addressing:</p><p>1. The behavioral habituation is striking in the freely moving larvae, but very hard to monitor in the larvae that are immobilized for calcium imaging. Are there steps that could be taken in the long run to improve direct observation of the habituation effect in these semi-stationary fish? For instance, is it possible to observe eye movements or some more subtle behavioral readout than the O-bend reflex? I apologize if this is a naïve question, but I am not entirely familiar with this specific experimental paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Dark Flash paradigm, we do not have readouts beyond the “O-bend” response itself, which is characterized by a large-angle bend of the tail and turning maneuver. We have not observed other, more subtle behavioural responses, such as eye or fin movements, for example. If we would be able to identify alternative behavioural outputs that were more robustly performed during head-embedded preparations, this would indeed be an advantage allowing us to more directly interpret the Ca2+ imaging results with respect to behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The dark flash as a stimulus to which the larvae habituate is obviously used as a powerful and ethologically relevant stimulus. However, it does leave an element of traditional habituation paradigms out, which is a novel stimulus that can be used to immediately re-instate the habituated response (otherwise known as dishabituation). Is there a way that you can imagine implementing that with zebrafish larvae, for instance through systematically altering a visual feature, such as spatial frequency or orientation? This would be a powerful development in my view as it would not only allow you to rule out motor or sensory fatigue as an underlying cause of reduced behavior but also it would provide an extra feature that strengthens your assessment of neuronal response profiles in candidate populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that identifying a dishabituating stimulus would be very powerful for our experiments. For short-term habituation of the acoustic startle response, Wolman et al demonstrated that dishabituation occurs after a touch stimulus (Wolman et al., PNAS, 2011; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107156108). We attempted to dishabituate the O-Bend response with tap and touch stimuli, and this unfortunately did not occur. Our understanding of dishabituation is that this generally requires a second stimulus that elicits the same behaviour as the habituated stimulus (e.g. both acoustic and touch-stimuli elicit the Mauthner-dependent C-bend response). In zebrafish the only stimulus that has been identified that elicits the O-bend is a dark-flash. This lack of an appropriate alternative stimulus is perhaps why we have been unsuccessful in identifying a dishabituating stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. You have written about the concept of 'short' and 'long' response shapes when using calcium imaging as a proxy for neural activity, surmising that the short response shape may reflect transient bursting. Although calcium imaging obviously has many advantages, this feature reveals one notable limitation of calcium imaging in contrast to electrophysiology, in that the time course of the signal is considerably longer and does not allow you with confidence to fully detect the response profile of neurons. Is there some kind of further deconvolution process that you could implement to improve the fidelity of your calcium imaging to the occurrence of action potentials? The burstiness of neurons is obviously important as it can indicate a particular type of neuron (for instance fast-spiking inhibitory neurons) or it might reveal a changing influence on post-synaptic neurons. For instance, bursting can be a response to inhibition due to the triggering of T-type calcium channels in response to hyperpolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the major limitations to Ca2+ imaging is the lack of temporal resolution. In our particular approach, using nuclear-targeted H2B-GCaMP indicators, further reduces our temporal resolution.Deconvolution approaches can be used in some instances to approximate spike rate, since therise-time of Ca2+ indicators can be relatively fast. However, in our imaging we chose to image larger volumes at the expense of scan rate, where our imaging is performed at only 2hz. Therefore, deconvolution and spike-rate estimation is not appropriate. Considering these limitations, we would argue that the fact that we can observe differences in kinetics of the 'short' and 'long' response shapes indicates that they likely show very different response kinetics, which we hope to confirm by electrophysiology once we have established ways of targeting these neurons for recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I note that among the many substances you screened with is MK801. An obvious candidate mechanism in habituation is the NMDA receptor, given the importance of this receptor for so many forms of learning and bidirectional synaptic plasticity. If I am to understand correctly, this NMDA receptor blocker actually enhances habituation in the zebrafish larvae, similar to melatonin. That is a very surprising observation, which is worth looking into further or at least discussed in the manuscript. The finding would, at least, be consistent with the idea that plasticity is not occurring at excitatory synapses and could potentially bolster the argument that plasticity of inhibitory synapses is at play in this particular form of habituation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point. We were also particularly interested in MK801, which has been shown to inhibit other forms of habituation, like short-term acoustic habituation (Wolman et al., PNAS, 2011; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107156108). In our experiments we did see that fish become even less responsive to dark flashes when treated with MK-801 (SSMD fingerprint data: Prob-Train = -0.39, Prob-Test = -1.58) which would indicate that MK-801 promotes dark flash habituation, similar to Melatonin. However, we also observed that MK-801 caused a decrease in the performance in the other visual assay we tested: the optomotor response (OMR-Perf = -0.93), indicating that MK-801 causes a generalized decrease in visual responses, perhaps by acting on circuits within the retina.Therefore, based on these experiments with global drug applications, we cannot determine if MK-801 influences the plasticity process in dark-flash habituation, and this is why we did not pursue it further in this project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Anyway, I hope that you take these suggestions as constructive and, in the spirit that they are intended, as possible routes for improving an already very interesting manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for your suggestions, which we feel has helped us to improve our manuscript substantially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, but confusing at times.

As we have discussed, both above and in the manuscript, we saw very strongly muted responses to DFs in the head-embedded preparation, but we neglected to describe our method of quantifying the responses. We have added the following description to the methods:</p><p>“To quantify responses to the dark flash stimuli we used motion artifacts in the imaging data to identify frames associated with movements ([fig:1]-[fig:S1]). Motion artifact was quantified using the “corrXY” parameter from suite2p, which reflects the peak of phase correlation comparing each acquired frame and reference image used for motion correction. The “motion power” was quantified as the standard deviation of a 3-frame rolling window, which was smoothed in time using a Savitzky-Golay filter (window length = 15 frames, polyorder = 2). A response to a dark flash was defined as a “motion power” signal greater than 3 (z-score) occurring within 10-seconds of the dark-flash onset, and was used to quantify habituation in the head-embedded preparation ([fig:6]A).“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 94: This seems to be a strong claim based on the sparse presence of non-habituating, or potentiating, neurons in downstream regions.

These neurons could encode the luminosity and be part of other responses, such as light-seeking in Karpenko S et al, eLife, 2020 or escape directionality in Heap et al, Neuron, 2018. Furthermore, dimming information has been shown to have parallel processing pathways in Robles E et al, JCN, 2020; so it would make sense that not all the observed responses in this manuscript would be involved in behavioural habituation to dark flashes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that without functional interventions, we do not know which of the neurons we have categorized are specifically involved in the dark flash response habituation.

We have therefore removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 103: It appears that several of those responses are to the changes in luminosity and not the DF itself, especially the ON and sustained responses. Based on the previous DF habituation study from Randlet O et al, eLife, 2019; the latency of the response is below 0.5s. So the behaviour-relevant responses must only include the shortest latency one, as discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point that the reviewer is making here, but we are less clear about what the difference between “changes in luminosity” and a “dark flash” response are, since a dark flash consists of a change in luminosity. We take it that the reviewer means the difference between a luminance stimulus that elicits an O-bend, from one that does not. In order to disambiguate the two, one would likely need to use stimuli where the luminosity changes, but do not elicit O-bends.</p><p>Perhaps due to the limited temporal resolution of our Ca2+ imaging data, we do not see a clear difference in the onset of the stimulus response for any of the functional clusters that would help us to determine which neurons are more relevant to the acute DF response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig.2B. It is very difficult to make out the actual average z-scored fluorescence, a supplementary figure would help by making these bigger. A plot to quantify the maximum response would also be useful to judge how it changes between the first few and few last DF. Another plot to give the time between the onset of the responses and the onset of the DF stimulus is also needed to judge which cluster may be relevant to the DF escapes observed in the free-swimming experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that interpreting these datasets are challenging. We did include the actual average z-scored fluorescence in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, panel D. This figure also includes a comparison between the predicted Ca2+ response to the dark flash (the stimulus convolved with the approximate GCaMP response kernel), which shows that all OFF-responding neuronal classes show very similar rise time response kinetics, and thus this analysis does not help to judge whether a cluster is more or less relevant to O-bend responses in the free-swimming experiments. We appreciate that there are differences in opinion about the best way to present the data, but we have opted to leave our original presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 130: Is a correlation below 0.1 meaningful or significant? It does not seem like this cluster would be a motor or decision cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal with this correlational analysis to motor signals was to identify if certain clusters of DF responsive neurons were more associated with motor output, and therefore may be more downstream in the sensori-motor cascade. Cluster 4 showed the highest median correlation across the population of cells. Whether a median correlation of ~0.1 is “meaningful” is impossible for us to answer, but it is highly “significant” in the statistical sense, as is evident by the 99.99999% confidence intervals plotted. We note that these cells were not selected based on their correlation to the motor stimulus, but only to the dark flash stimulus. There are “motor” clusters that show much higher correlations to the motors signals, as is evident in Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 165: Did the changes observed for Pimozide fall below the significance threshold, were lethal, or were the results not repeated?

Indeed, in our previous experiments with Pimozide we had already established that a 10uM dose is lethal, and that the maximal effective dose we tried was 1uM as reported in (Randlett et al., Current Biology, 2019).</p><p>We have clarified this in the text:</p><p>“While the false negative rate is difficult to determine since so little is known about the pharmacology of the system, we note that of the three small molecules we previously established to alter dark flash habituation that were included in the screen, Clozapine, Haloperidol and Pimozide , the first two were identified among our hits while Pimozide was lethal at the 10\muM screening concentration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig.1B and Fig.3B are the same data, which is awkward and should be explicitly stated.

We have corrected the typo in the figure legend of Figure 3B :</p><p>“Habituation results in a progressive decrease in responsiveness to dark flashes repeated at 1-minute intervals, delivered in 4 training blocks of 60 stimuli, separated by 1hr of rest (from 0:00-7:00).”</p><p>We have also added a statement that the data is the same as that in Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3-4: SSMD fingerprint, there is no description of the different behavioural parameters. What they represent is left to the reader's inference. There is no mention of SpontDisp in the GitHub for example, so it is hard to know how these different parameters were measured. Even referring to the previous manuscript on habituation (Randlet O et al, eLife, 2019) does not shed light on most of them, for example, I suppose TwoMvmt represents the 'double responses' from the previous manuscript. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies between 3C and 4B, some minor (SpontDisp becomes SpntDisp), but Curve-Tap has disappeared for example, and I suspect became BendAmp-Tap. A more thorough description of these measures, and making the naming scheme consistent, are essential for readers to know what they are looking at.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for their careful assessment of our data, and we apologize for this sloppiness. We have gone through and made the naming of these parameters consistent in both figures, and have added another supplementary table that describes in more detail what each parameter is, and how it relates to the analysis code (Figure3_sourcedata3_SSMDFingerprintParameters.xls). This was an essential missing piece of information from our original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 206: While this prioritization makes sense, how was it implemented, how was the threshold decided and which were they? A table, or supplementary figure, would help to clarify the reason behind the choices. Fig.4C being cropped only around the response probability makes it impossible to judge if the criteria were respected, as the main heatmap is too small. For example, the choice of GABA receptor antagonists is somewhat puzzling, as besides PTX it does not seem that the other compounds had strong effects, with Amoxapine for example having seemingly as much effect on Naive and Train, with little in Test. And Bicuculline gave negative SSMD for prob in the three cases.The dose-response for PTX does lend credence to its effect, but I would have liked the other compounds, especially bicuculline. The melatonin results, for example, are much more convincing and interesting in our opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>While in hindsight it may have been possible to do the hit prioritization in a systematic way using thresholding and ranking, we did this manually by inspecting the clustered fingerprints. We have clarified this in the text: “This manual prioritization led to the identification of the GABAA/C Receptor antagonists…”</p><p>While we agree that it is not possible to judge how well we performed this prioritization based on the images presented, we note that we do provide the full fingerprint data in the supplementary data, for which the reader is welcome to draw their own conclusions.</p><p>We have not performed further experiments with amoxapine, so we can not comment further on this. We did perform additional experiments with bicuculline, for which we did see effects similar to those of PTX, were habituation was inhibited. However, the effects are weaker and more variable than what we observe with PTX, and bicuculline also inhibits the initial responses of the larvae, causing their Naive response to be lower. Therefore we did not include it in our manuscript. We include these data here in Author response image 1 to reassure the Reviewer that picrotoxinin is not the only GABA Receptor antagonist for which we see inhibitory effects on habituation.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84926-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig.6: Why was the melatonin concentration used only 1um instead of 10um on the screen?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on dose response experiments (Figure 5B, and others not shown), we found that the effect of Melatonin on habituation saturates at about 1uM, and therefore we used this dose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 277: As the correlation with motor output is marginal at best, and the authors recognize the lack of behaviour in tethered animals, I would be careful about such speculation.

Alternatively, the authors can tone down the language used in this section to match the confidence level of the association they propose.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7A-E are what can be considered “virtual colocalization” analyses, where we are comparing the localization of data acquired in different experiments using image registration to common atlas coordinates. We agree that these results alone will never be very strong evidence for the identification of individual cells. The MultiMAP approach of Lovett-Barron is a powerful approach, though it makes the assumption that registration accuracy will be subcellular, which in practice may often not be the case. We believe that a better approach is to label the cells of interest during the Ca2+ imaging experiment itself, as we did 7F and G. The challenge in this experiment is binarizing the ROIs and thus deciding what is and is not a Gad1b-positive cell. In our opinion, the fact that these two independent experiments came to the same conclusion regarding Cluster 10 and 11 is good evidence that these cell types are likely predominantly GABAergic.</p><p>As discussed above, we have re-written the manuscript to tone down our claims about the role of GABA and GABAergic neurons in habituation, which we hope the reviewer will agree better reflects the limitations of the data in Figure 6 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 317: Based on the somewhat inconsistent results of the other GABA antagonists, I would be careful.
