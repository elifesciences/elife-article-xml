Within the growth cone, various intracellular effectors transduce axonal guidance signals by remodeling the cytoskeleton. Semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) is a guidance cue implicated in development of the fornix, a neuronal tract connecting the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. Microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) has been shown to be involved in the Sema3E growth-promoting signaling pathway. In this study, we identified the collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) as a MAP6 partner and a crucial effector in Sema3E growth-promoting activity. CRMP4-KO mice displayed abnormal fornix development reminiscent of that observed in Sema3E-KO mice. CRMP4 was shown to interact with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex within detergent-<italic>resistant</italic> membrane (DRM) domains, and DRM domain integrity was required to transduce Sema3E signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway. Finally, we showed that the cytoskeleton-binding domain of CRMP4 is required for Sema3E’s growth-promoting activity, suggesting that CRMP4 plays a role at the interface between Sema3E receptors, located in DRM domains, and the cytoskeleton network. As the fornix is affected in many psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, our results provide new insights to better understand the neurodevelopmental components of these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRMP4</kwd><kwd>fornix</kwd><kwd>axonal guidance</kwd><kwd>Semaphorin-3E</kwd><kwd>detergent-resistant membrane domains</kwd><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Collapsin-Response-Mediator-Proteins</kwd><kwd>Detergent-Resistant-Membrane-Domains</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-CE11-0026 MAMAs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrieux</surname><given-names>Annie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-Blanc-120201 CBioS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrieux</surname><given-names>Annie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRMP4 is a new actor in the guidance cue Semaphorin-3E pathway, crucially involved in the establishment of the fornix, a key axonal tract for memory and emotional control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axonal pathfinding and outgrowth are tightly regulated during central nervous system development, and allow neuronal tracts to be properly established. Axonal growth and guidance involve many signaling pathways triggered by various guidance cues such as semaphorins, netrins, and ephrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raper and Mason, 2010</xref>). These signals are transduced by transmembrane receptors to regulate intracellular effectors which then affect cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to axonal outgrowth modulation. Dysregulation of these signaling cascades results in neuronal connectivity defects, and sometimes cognitive or psychiatric disorders. In this study, we focused on the signaling pathway mediated by semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) and its role in the development of the post-commissural fornix. The post-commissure of the fornix is the major output of the hippocampus and is mainly composed of subicular axons that primarily terminate in the mammillary bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Witter, 2006</xref>). The post-commissural fornix belongs to a set of limbic connections, including the Papez circuit, involved in memory, emotion, personality, and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bubb et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of the fornix is associated with several psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koshiyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The attractive effect of Sema3E on subicular neurons is crucial for fornix development and is enabled by a tripartite receptor complex composed of plexin-D1 (PlxD1), neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>). Some receptors involved in semaphorin signaling pathways, such as Nrp1, have been shown to localize to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains (including lipid rafts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guirland et al., 2004</xref>). Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched DRM domains are involved in axonal growth and guidance, acting as platforms for ligand-induced receptor activation and recruitment of intracellular actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simons and Sampaio, 2011</xref>). For example, kinases downstream of semaphorin signaling, such as Akt or glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), can be recruited to DRM domains where they are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao and Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sui et al., 2006</xref>). One of the major substrates of GSKβ is the collapsin response mediator protein family (CRMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charrier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hou, 2020</xref>). The five CRMPs members have been implicated in numerous neuronal processes including neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khazaei et al., 2015</xref>), dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niisato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niisato et al., 2013</xref>), axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leung et al., 2002</xref>), and axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsuboi et al., 2005</xref>). Within this family, CRMP2 was the first to be implicated in Sema3A-dependent growth cone collapse in higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goshima et al., 1995</xref>) and continues to be the most extensively studied. Sema3A stimulates CRMP2 phosphorylation through GSK3β activation which regulates the interaction between CRMP2 and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khazaei et al., 2014</xref>). Although repulsive Sema3A signaling has been well described in recent years, the molecules involved in Sema3E signaling and therefore in the growth of subicular neurons remain to be fully characterized. Recently, we showed that microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) was crucial for fornix development due to its role in regulating axonal elongation induced by Sema3E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deloulme et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we found that although MAP6 interacts with CRMP1, -2, and -4, only CRMP4 is required for Sema3E axonal outgrowth. In mice, knockout (KO) of <italic>Crmp4</italic> is associated with defective development of the post-commissural fornix. The results presented here show that CRMP4 binds the tripartite Sema3E-receptor complex in a DRM domain-dependent manner. Disruption of DRM domains blocks Sema3E-mediated axonal growth and affects CRMP4 phosphorylation by GSK3β. The integrity of DRM domains is thus critical for downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway by Sema3E. Furthermore, we found that Sema3E signaling triggers a reduction of GSK3β-driven phosphorylation of CRMP4, and that the interaction of CRMP4 with the cytoskeleton is necessary to transduce Sema3E signaling.</p><p>Taken together, our results establish CRMP4 as a new specific downstream effector of the Sema3E signaling pathway, exerting its activity through DRM domains and phospho-regulated interactions with the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRMP1, -2, and -4 are MAP6 partners</title><p>MAP6 is crucial for Sema3E-dependent fornix development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deloulme et al., 2015</xref>). To identify new effectors of the Sema3E signaling pathway, we performed MAP6-immunoaffinity chromatography experiments coupled with mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Protein extracts from adult brains were passed over affinity columns containing monoclonal antibody directed against the neuron-specific MAP6-N isoform. Bound proteins were then eluted by addition of an excess of MAP6 peptide containing the epitope targeted by the monoclonal antibody. Eluted fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify MAP6 partners. Interestingly, proteins in the CRMP family, members of which are known to play critical roles during semaphorin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbeille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goshima et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niisato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quintremil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>), were identified as MAP6 partners. More precisely, we identified twelve specific peptides belonging to CRMP2, three specific peptides from CRMP4, two specific peptides from CRMP1, and six peptides shared by two or three of these CRMP proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The presence and specificity of the CRMP-MAP6 complex was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using wild-type (WT) and MAP6-KO brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether MAP6 interacts directly with CRMPs, we performed pull-down experiments using sepharose beads coupled to recombinant CRMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Sema3E stimulates axon growth through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/GSK3β pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>). By binding to PlxD1, Sema3E activates VEGFR2 which triggers the recruitment and activation of PI3K. Activated PI3K phosphorylates downstream Akt, which in turn phosphorylates GSK3β to inactivate it. CRMPs including CRMP4 are well-known substrates of GSK3β, which catalyzes their phosphorylation on threonine 509 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2004</xref>). We thus determined whether CRMP4 phosphorylation was modified downstream of Sema3E signaling. To do so, we treated starved subicular neurons with Sema3E for 11 min and monitored the phosphorylation status of the downstream effectors by western blot using appropriate antibodies (against Akt p-Ser473, GSK3β p-Ser21/9, and CRMP4 p-Thr509) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). As expected, Sema3E treatment triggered the signaling cascade with an increase in Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation (203% ± 35% and 153% ± 9.5 of the control, respectively). In the same experiments, a considerable decrease in CRMP4 phosphorylation (43% ± 5.4 of the control) was observed. This decrease strongly suggests that the phosphorylation state of CRMP4 is regulated by Sema3E signaling.</p><p>We next investigated whether the Sema3E signaling cascade depends on DRM integrity.

This pathway is necessary for the development of the fornix, an essential brain structure. We have previously proposed that MAP6 acts as a scaffold protein within subicular neurons, facilitating the interaction of Sema3E pathway receptors and downstream SH3-containing actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deloulme et al., 2015</xref>). Building on this knowledge, we identified CRMPs as additional effector candidates, thanks to their interactions with MAP6.</p><p>Here, we showed that CRMP4 knockdown suppresses axonal growth in subicular neurons in response to Sema3E stimulation. Axons from these cells mostly constitute the post-commissural part of the fornix. In addition, CRMP4-KO mice had defects in fornix development that were identical to those reported in Sema3E-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, analysis of the fornix in <italic>Crmp4</italic>/<italic>Sema3E</italic> double heterozygote animals compared to single heterozygote animals revealed that <italic>Crmp4</italic> and <italic>Sema3E</italic> cooperate to allow the correct establishment of the fornix.</p><p>Taken together, these findings identified CRMP4 as a new effector of Sema3E-dependent axonal outgrowth implicated in fornix development. The involvement of CRMP4 in neurite outgrowth mechanisms has also been reported in the Sema3A pathway in another hippocampal neuron subtype. Thus, Sema3A stimulates the development of dendrites in a CRMP4-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niisato et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, <italic>Crmp4</italic> and <italic>Sema3d</italic> genetically interact to promote axonal growth from some peripheral neuron populations in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). These observations suggest a general role for CRMP4 in the attractive function of semaphorins. This property appears to be shared by other CRMPs, as both CRMP4 and CRMP1 are required to orient cerebral pyramidal neuron dendrites, and to position Purkinje cells in the developing mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamazaki et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, CRMP2 can rescue the inhibitory effects of CRMP4 knockdown on axonal development in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4 share some cellular functions and may have redundant roles that could be related to their extensive sequence homology, which ranges from 74% to 76% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charrier et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, our results show that downregulation of CRMP1 or CRMP2 does not affect the growth-promoting activity of Sema3E. These results suggest that CRMP4 plays a specific role in this signaling pathway. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of CRMP4 using siRNA stimulated basal axonal growth in cultured subicular neurons. This observation suggests that CRMP4 alone can repress axonal outgrowth in these particular neurons. Conversely, other authors report that CRMP4 promotes growth of axons as well as dendrites from neurons in the hippocampus or olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khazaei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsutiya et al., 2016</xref>). Our research thus contributes to a growing body of work proposing that CRMP4 function is regulated by the molecular context of the neurons where it is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Girouard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niisato et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the antagonistic roles of CRMP4 observed in distinct neuronal populations could be due to differences in its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CRMP4-KO mice display dendritic arborization defects in hippocampal CA1 and cortical pyramidal neurons, mispositioning of Purkinje cells, and olfactory bulb lamination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsutiya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamazaki et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we additionally show that a KO of CRMP4 is associated with a defect in post-commissural fornix development, leading to a reduction of this tract associated with fasciculation defects persisting into adulthood. This tract is crucial for cognitive functions, and in line with this role, recent investigations of white matter microstructure by diffusion tensor imaging across psychiatric disorders have highlighted alterations of the fornix in patients suffering from both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koshiyama et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a de novo variant of <italic>Crmp4</italic> was recently identified in an adult males with ASD, and CRMP4-KO mice show a decrease in social interaction as well as a severe alterations to their sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsutiya et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore possible that the fornix alterations we observed in CRMP4-KO mice here may contribute to these behavioral defects.</p><p>Through this study, we demonstrated that CRMP4 interacted with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex, specifically interacting with Nrp1 and PlxD1. Complex formation between CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4, and PlxA1 – a Sema3A co-receptor – has been known for several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). More recently, a study showed that the direct interaction of CRMP2 with PlxA3 was involved in dendritic growth under the control of Sema3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Binding of CRMP2 to the Ngr1 receptor and PlxA2 induced by Nogo-A was also demonstrated to limit axonal regrowth after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sekine et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, we demonstrated that CRMP4 and Sema3E receptor interaction occurs only in DRM domains, despite the fact that these domains contain only small amounts of these proteins.</p><p>In this context, DRM is used as a broad term for a family of membrane domains resistant to high detergent concentrations, which includes lipid rafts. Thus, according to the methods used (sucrose gradients after solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 and following MβCD treatment), we opted to use the broad term DRM. Here, we show that MβCD, by destabilizing DRM, inhibits the stimulation of Sema3E-dependent axonal growth and blocks downstream activation of the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. Our results are consistent with studies highlighting the involvement of DRM/rafts in the Sema3A signaling pathway. For example, in leukemic T cells, Sema3A/Fas-dependent apoptosis requires Nrp1 and plexin-A1 to co-localize within lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moretti et al., 2008</xref>). Lipid rafts are also involved in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse in neurons following the recruitment of Nrp1 to the rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guirland et al., 2004</xref>). The presence of CRMP4 in membrane domains has been implicated in the maintenance of growth cones, suggesting that this localization places CRMP4 in an environment containing specific signaling proteins and cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosslenbroich et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, cerebral ischemia induced by occlusion led to CRMP4 and Nrp1 recruitment to lipid rafts, which hints that these molecules play a role in mediating signal transduction in response to neuronal damage triggered by ischemia-reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whitehead et al., 2010</xref>). Other effectors of the Sema3E signaling pathway, such as Akt, are involved in a myriad of cellular processes and have also been localized within DRM. Indeed, for particular cellular processes like axonal growth, Akt must localize to regions enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao and Zhang, 2008</xref>). Our results support the idea that DRM/lipid rafts regulate the spatiotemporal recruitment of Sema3E-specific receptors in order to recruit ubiquitous effectors such as Akt or GSK3β to specific membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averaimo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). Sema3E axonal growth-promoting activity relies on the PI3K/Akt pathway, as it leads to downstream phosphorylation-induced inactivation of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>). In line with this hypothesis, we also observed that Sema3E increased phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3β, to produce an inactive form of the latter, and thus decreased CRMP4 phosphorylation on Thr509, one of the three GSK3β phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, Sema3A’s repulsive activity was associated with sequential phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Cdk5 and then by GSK3β, blocking interaction between CRMP2 and microtubules in DRG-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uchida et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of CRMPs can be considered to be a mechanism regulating CRMP activity in response to the attractive or repulsive effects of the guidance molecules. However, results from our rescue experiments in CRMP4-KO neurons tend to suggest that the phosphorylation state of CRMP4 has little direct impact on axonal growth in response to Sema3E. Indeed, CRMP4-4A and CRMP4-4D constructs both restored the response to Sema3E in CRMP4-KO neurons. One explanation for this result could be that CRMP4 phosphorylation alters its localization rather than its cytoskeleton modulatory function. This phosphorylation-dependent localization could have been bypassed following electroporation of CRMP4 plasmids, resulting in ubiquitous overexpression of CRMP4 mutants. This hypothesis has previously been proposed for the response to Sema3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the construct deleted for the region comprising the cytoskeleton domain (CRMP4ΔCyt) did not allow recovery of axonal-growth stimulation by Sema3E, reflecting the importance of the regulatory role played by CRMP4 on the cytoskeleton.</p><p>In summary, we propose that CRMP4 is the terminal downstream effector of Sema3E in axonal-growth induction, modulating cytoskeletal dynamics to mediate axonal growth. The results presented here thus identify CRMP4 as a major new player in the growth-promoting activity of Sema3E, a signaling pathway that is much less well characterized than the repulsive role played by Sema3E in axon guidance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the local animal welfare committee (Comité Local GIN, C2EA-04 – APAFIS number 8303–2016060110523424) and complied with EU guidelines (directive 2010/63/EU).

Among them, the fornix that needs the tripartite receptor complex formed by plexin-D1 (PlxD1), neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) for Sema3E attractant signalling. Here, Boulan et al. investigate how Sema3E governs the fornix development through CRMP4, a known player for axon development and growth cone dynamics. They found that :</p><p>– Axonal elongation of subicular neurons induced by sema3E is through CRMP4 but no other members of the CRMP family.</p><p>– CRMP4 binds the tripartite Sema3E-receptor complex in a DRM domain-dependent manner.</p><p>– Activation of Sema3E signalling leads to a reduction of the phosphorylation of CRMP4 by GSK3B</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Boulan and colleagues explored the role for the Collapsin Response Mediator protein CRMP4 in Sema3E signaling in the context of the development of the fornix, a key projection in the CNS that connects the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Previous work had identified a role for Sema3E in the development of this structure; however, the downstream signaling mechanism remained obscure. The authors identified multiple CRMP proteins in a proteomics approach for proteins that could interact with Map6, a known component of the Sema3E pathway. Of the CRMP proteins identified, in vitro analysis supports a specific role for Crmp4 in the Sema3E growth promoting pathway. Analysis of the expression pattern and loss of function mutants for Crmp4 revealed that Crmp4 appears to be co-expressed with Sema3E receptors, and that the mutants show reduced volume and projections in the post commissural fornix, a phenotype with some similarity to that of Sema3E mutants. Interestingly, the authors detected genetic interactions between Sema3E and Crmp4; animals heterozygous for mutations in both genes exhibit significant deficits in fornix formation. Finally, additional biochemical analysis suggests that Sema3E signals through a specific pool of receptors located in detergent resistant membrane domains to promote axon growth through Crmp4.</p><p>While generally the data and presentation are of high quality and support the major conclusions of the paper, there are some aspects of data analysis, interpretation and quantification that need to be further substantiated.</p><p>(1) Biochemistry and in vitro axon outgrowth. While it appears that there is a specific role for CRMP4 in promoting growth in response to Sema3E, one wonders how specific this effect is. Have the authors tested whether Crmp4 also prevents the action of other growth promoting factors (e.g. Netrin, BDNF).</p><p>The authors nicely show that they can detect a complex between Crmp4 and Sema3E receptor components. It would be interesting to know whether the association between Crmp4 and these receptors is in any way ligand dependent. Does Sema3E treatment promote or inhibit this interaction?</p><p>(2) Expression Data. Crmp4 expression in vivo does appear to overlap in several regions with Nrp-1; however, the pattern of localization is diffuse and does not appear to be enriched in neurites like Nrp-1 is. In primary culture of subicular neurons, CRMP-4 looks to be enriched in axons and growth cones- it would be important to show that the staining in primary culture is specific, given the apparent discrepancy between primary neurons and IF on brains.</p><p>(3) Phenotypic Analysis. The authors do a nice job measuring the area, length and volume of the PF in mutants and suggest that the phenotype 'photocopies' that of Sema3E. Of course, they mean phenocopies, but the description of the prior work on Sema3E is incomplete and could be clarified in the text. More importantly, to what extent have the authors explored the underlying cause of the reduction in PF area, length and volume. Are subicular neurons specified and maintained in normal numbers? Do fibers that should target the PF mistarget elsewhere, or do they just fail to grow. These types of measurements were included in the work on Sema3E knockouts from Neuron 2007. It would be important to look more carefully at this.</p><p>It is puzzling to this reviewer why the authors characterize the Crmp4 KO phenotype as a developmental delay.

The quality of each CRMP protein sample used for the coupling reaction is now shown in figure 1 – supplement figure 1 (Coomassie staining).

Thus, for sake of clarity we have modified the text and now say that MAP6-N can bind directly to each of the CRMP isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.2) Figure 2: Extent of knockdown should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of three independent experiments are now present in figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.3) Figure 8: The westerns in this figure are not convincing, especially 8D.

We now explained in the figure legends how the experiment was done and that controls (CtrL) correspond to conditions where no antibody was added to the DRM/RPM fractions. Thus, the bands observed might probably correspond to Nrp1 and PlxD1 bound to beads in DRM fractions which contain large amount of lipids. As our main point was to show that CRMP4 was higher in DRM than in RPM, we now provide, in the result section, a quantification of the proportion of PlxD1 and Nrp1 present in the CRMP4 immuno-precipitate (minus the amount present in the CtrL) in both DRM and RPM fractions. For the experiment (Figure 8 D) performed in DRM fractions, the signal for Nrp1 and for PlxD1 represent 62% and 25% of CRMP4 signal, respectively, whereas in RPM fractions the signal for Nrp1 and for PlxD1 represent 0.18% and 0.69% of CRMP4 signal, respectively. A second experiment was performed and gave similar results (higher ratio in DRM than in RPM). Altogether these differences in ratio clearly indicate a preferential interaction of CRMP4 with PlxD1 and Nrp1 receptors in the DRM fractions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.4) Figure 9: The effect of Sema3E on downstream phsosphorylation of targets seems pretty subtle.

MAP6-E is expressed in the embryonic brain and remains expressed in adult, whereas MAP6-N expression starts at E15 and strongly increases throughout adulthood. Thus, we preferentially worked with MAP6-E when addressing the developing brain and cultured subicular neurons (Deloulme 2015), whereas we used MAP6-N when working with the adult brain. In this study a monoclonal antibody (mAb175) against MAP6-N was used on adult brain extract. Moreover, mAb175 is a homemade antibody which we can easily produce in bulk to set up an affinity column. Also, for your perusal, you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> CRMP4 pulldown experiments performed on crude brain extracts from embryonic to post-natal stages. The results clearly indicate that 1/MAP6N and MAP6-E interact with CRMP4 2/ MAP6-N expression starts around embryonic day 15 making its contribution to post-commissural fornix formation plausible.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Pulldowns of MAP6-E and MAP6-N from embryonic, post-natal and adult brains using CRMP4-Sepharose (upper panel) and control-Sepharose beads (lower panel).</title><p>Western blot using a pan-MAP6 antibody revealed both MAP6-N and MAP-E isoforms.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70361-sa2-fig1-v5.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the expression of MAP6-N versus MAP6-E in post mitotic neurons, we are unable to answer definitively as both isoforms could be expressed.
