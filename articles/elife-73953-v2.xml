Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat or prevent the prominent pathological subtype of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Based upon the screening of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, we discovered that Arbidol could effectively inhibit the proliferation of human ESCC in vitro. Next, we conducted a series of cell-based assays and found that Arbidol treatment inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of ESCC cells and promoted G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Phosphoproteomics experiments, in vitro kinase assays and pull-down assays were subsequently performed in order to identify the underlying growth inhibitory mechanism. We verified that Arbidol is a potential ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor via binding to ATR kinase to reduce the phosphorylation and activation of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 at Ser108. Finally, we demonstrated Arbidol had the inhibitory effect of ESCC in vivo by a patient-derived xenograft model. All together, Arbidol inhibits the proliferation of ESCC in vitro and in vivo through the DNA replication pathway and is associated with the cell cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ESCC</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81872335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Kangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81902486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yanan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006407</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>161100510300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Kangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Central Plains Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talents</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>224200510015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Kangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arbidol is a ATR inhibitor to reduce the phosphorylation and activation of MCM2 at Ser108, and innhibits the cell proliferation of ESCC in vitro and in vivo through the DNA replication and cell cycle pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human esophageal cancer is a malignant neoplasm with a high incidence worldwide, ranking eighth in global incidence and sixth in overall mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). It has two pathological types: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Napier et al., 2014</xref>). ESCC is the main histological type and accounts for approximately 90% of esophageal cancers in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ke et al., 2019</xref>). Current treatment options for patients with ESCC are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ha et al., 2020</xref>). However, the 5-year survival rate remains less than 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pennathur et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic or chemopreventive agents to improve the survival rate of patients with ESCC.</p><p>Chemoprevention is a promising strategy to prevent the recurrence of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In recent years, studies have found that certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacchi et al., 2012</xref>). For example, it was reported that aspirin was used for chemoprophylaxis of colorectal, prostate, and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gronich and Rennert, 2013</xref>). Aside from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other repurposed drugs also exhibit antitumor effects. Metformin, a hypoglycemic drug has been shown to have a preventive effect on lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duncan and Schmidt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morales and Morris, 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that repurposing pre-existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs could also be a promising strategy to prevent ESCC recurrence.</p><p>We screened a series of FDA-approved drugs and found that Arbidol has a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of ESCC cells. Arbidol is a broad-spectrum antiviral compound which is conventionally used for the prevention and treatment of influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blaising et al., 2014</xref>). Its antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses is mainly based on disrupting key steps during the virus-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). However, its role in cancer prevention or treatment has not been reported. Here, we identified that Arbidol is an inhibitor of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase.</p><p>ATR belongs to the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PI3KKs) family and one of its key functions is to regulate DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). ATR can phosphorylate the key replication protein minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) on serine 108 in response to various forms of DNA damage and stalling of replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hae et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lecona and Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>). In recent years, ATR inhibitors have been used in many cancer investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), and their roles in cancer treatment have gradually been realized.</p><p>We performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of lysates derived from Arbidol-treated cells to investigate the proteomic and phosphoproteomic response upon treatment. Additionally, we performed in silico molecular docking on a panel of kinases to predict potential binding partners and clarify the drug’s inhibitory mechanism. Our results showed that Arbidol inhibited ESCC growth via modulating the MCM2-ATR axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arbidol inhibits ESCC cell proliferation</title><p>To identify a drug able to inhibit ESCC cell proliferation, we conducted toxicity experiments using FDA-approved drug libraries and discovered that Arbidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) effectively suppresses ESCC cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The IC50 values of Arbidol in KYSE150, KYSE450, and shantou human embryonic esophageal (SHEE) cells were 57.54, 54.72, and 87.63 μM at 24 hr and 26.37, 20.75 and 62.52 μM at 48 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We found that Arbidol had a higher IC50 value in the SHEE immortalized esophageal epithelium cell line than in ESCC cells, which indicated that Arbidol had stronger toxicity in ESCC cells. To further evaluate the effect of Arbidol on ESCC growth, we treated KYSE150 and KYSE450 cells with different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 µM) of Arbidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The results indicated that Arbidol inhibited the proliferation of KYSE150 and KYSE450 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It is worth mentioning that we also performed toxicity and proliferation experiments on the SHEE human immortalized esophageal epithelial cell line and observed that the growth inhibitory effect was less pronounced. We next assessed whether treatment with Arbidol could impact anchorage-independent cell growth using the soft agar assay. The result showed that Arbidol inhibited anchorage-independent growth of KYSE150 and KYSE450 cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, we used the colony-formation assay to determine whether Arbidol inhibited the proliferation of ESCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Similarly, the results indicated that Arbidol inhibited colony-formation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these results suggested that Arbidol had a significant inhibitory effect on ESCC in vitro.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Arbidol inhibits ESCC cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The structure of Arbidol.

Subsequently, MS was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org</ext-link>) via the iProX partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD034944. We identified 241 downregulated proteins and 340 downregulated sites. Next, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis using the quantified phosphate sites to query significantly downregulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). The DNA replication was identified as the key pathway affected. A heat map detailing phosphorylation site enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the S108 site of MCM2 in the DNA replication pathway was significantly downregulated after Arbidol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). The molecular profile of MCM2 S108 obtained using MS was displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>. The results of the in silico analysis were verified by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). The results of western blot confirmed the phosphoproteomics data and showed that MCM2 S108 phosphorylation was strongly inhibited after Arbidol treatment. To further investigate the specific targets of Arbidol, we first searched for proteins upstream of p-MCM2 Ser108 and found that Cdc7 and ATR can phosphorylate MCM2 (Ser108) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charych et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). However, pull-down results indicated that Cdc7 could not directly bind to Arbidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the recent quantitative human interaction group (pull-down MS), and utilized the kinase prediction tool (from phosphoproteomics data). We also used the chemical structure of Arbidol to predict targets using the SwissTargetPrediction. The results suggested that ATR kinase was a potential target of Arbidol.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphoproteomics reveals that Arbidol inhibits tumors through minichromosome maintenance-ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (MCM-ATR) signal pathway.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The mass spectrometry workflow of phosphorylated proteomics analysis of KYSE150 cells after 24 hr treatment with Arbidol.

The MCM complex undergoes multisite phosphorylation to initiate replication during the transition from G1 to S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fei and Xu, 2018</xref>). MCM2, a component of the MCM complex, is required for the initiation and elongation stages of DNA replication; it is also a crucial target of the S-phase-promoting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montagnoli et al., 2006</xref>). Phosphorylation of MCM2 on S108 by ATR plays key role in the activation of prereplication complexes and to stabilize replication forks in response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thakur et al., 2022</xref>). Phosphorylation of MCM2 S108 by ATR, a mediator of the S-phase checkpoint, is increased upon stalled S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortez et al., 2004</xref>). According to our findings, Arbidol treatment of ESCC cells resulted in decreased S-phase progression and G1-phase blockade. We further verified that Arbidol specifically bound with ATR and not with CDKs. We speculated that the S-phase ESCC cell fraction decreased followed by an increase in the G1-phase fraction after the phosphorylation levels of MCM2 S108 decreased. Therefore, Arbidol decreased the S-phase fraction of ESCC cells and initiated G1-phase blockade through the ATR/MCM2 signaling pathway.</p><p>In the present study, we identified that ATR is an upstream kinase of MCM2 using a predictive model based on multiple proteomic assays. ATR was found to be a target of Arbidol through pull-down and in vitro kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b-f</xref>).

First, a greater number of ESCC cell lines and tissue samples should be used to verify the antitumor effects of Arbidol. PDX models have been shown to mimic several features of human cancer. Within the present study, a subcutaneously implanted tumor model is used. Nonetheless, it may be more ideal if an orthotopic transplantation tumor model is used in future studies. Next, immune responses within the model are neglected as severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice are used in ESCC PDX model.

The limitations of the in vivo experiment are also discussed:</p><p>“In the present study, we verified the anti-tumor effects of Arbidol in vivo and in vitro. Certain limitations could be overcome for utilizing Arbidol as an anti-cancer drug. First, a greater number of ESCC cell lines and tissue samples should be used to verify the anti-tumor effects of Arbidol. PDX models have been shown to mimic several features of human cancer. Within the present study, a subcutaneously implanted tumor model is used. Nonetheless, it may be more ideal if an orthotopic transplantation tumor model is used in future studies. Next, immune responses within the model are neglected as severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice are used in ESCC PDX model. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of Arbidol is solely assessed in the in vivo experiments. However, additional pre-clinical experiments and clinical experiments are necessary for safety evaluation as an anti-cancer drug.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Methods of IC-50 determination and the software used should be included in the methods section of the manuscript.

Since a G1 phase cycle block can be observed and this effect could be also triggered by the inhibition of CDKs, this possibility should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. Our results showed that Arbidol strongly reduced the S phase fraction and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4c). Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a primary role in tumor carcinogenesis by dysregulating the cell cycle. CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 are expressed during interphase. CDK4 and CDK6 drive cell-cycle progression from G0 or G1 phase into S phase. CDK2 controls the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009). To exclude that the G1 phase cycle block was triggered by the inhibition of the three interphase CDKs, we performed pull-down assays to investigate potential binding between Arbidol and CDK2, CDK4, or CDK6. Our results indicated that Arbidol did not bind with CDK2, CDK4, or CDK6 kinase. This strongly suggested that Arbidol specifically binds with ATR.</p><p>RB1, as a tumor suppressor, canonically regulates cell cycle progression and represents a down-stream target for CDK4/6 or CDK2 inhibitors that are in clinical use (Knudsen et al., 2019). CDKs have been shown to initiate phosphorylation and inactivation of RB1, resulting in derepression of E2-regulated genes. Phosphorylation of residues within the central pocket and c-terminal domains of RB1 (S249, T252, S356, S373, S608, S612, S780, S788, S795, S807, S811, T821, S826) have been extensively studied. RB1 S249 is phosphorylated by CDK2, RB1 S807 and RB1 T826 is phosphorylated by CDKs to promote cell cycle progression (Janostiak et al., 2022). Therefore, to verify that Arbidol triggers the G1 phase blockade independent of the CDKs/RB signaling pathway, phosphorylated RB1 (S204, S807, T826) abundance was measured by western blotting in cells after Arbidol treatment. As expected, the levels of phosphorylated RB1 (S204, S807, T826) were not altered after Arbidol treatment (Fig S1d). These findings demonstrated that Arbidol induced G1 phase block through targeting ATR. We have added these results as Figure S1 in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors described that Arbidol targets ATR protein to affect the DNA replication pathway and confirmed by cell cycle analysis. The authors need to give a more thorough discussion on the functional relationship between DNA replication and cell cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We further discussed the relationship between DNA replication and cell cycle in the third paragraph of the Discussion section. We also displayed this part here:</p><p>“DNA replication occurs in all organisms that use DNA as their genetic material and their molecular basis of biological inheritance (Rozpędek et al., 2019). During DNA replication, a key component called the MCM complex binds to related proteins and provides the helicase activity that unwinds DNA at the origin of replication (Charrier et al., 2011; Kawamura et al., 2019) The MCM complex undergoes multi-site phosphorylation to initiate replication during the transition from G1 to S phase (Fei and Xu, 2018). MCM2, a component of the MCM complex, is required for the initiation and elongation stages of DNA replication; it is also a crucial target of the S-phase-promoting kinases (Montagnoli et al., 2006). Phosphorylation of MCM2 on S108 by ATR plays key roles in the activation of pre-replication complexes and to stabilize replication forks in response to replication stress (Thakur et al., 2022). Phosphorylation of MCM2 S108 by ATR, a mediator of the S phase checkpoint, is increased upon stalled S-phase (Cortez et al., 2004). According to our findings, Arbidol treatment of ESCC cells resulted in decreased S-phase progression and G1-phase blockade. We further verified that Arbidol specifically bound with ATR and not with CDKs. We speculated that the S-phase ESCC cell fraction decreased followed by an increase in the G1-phase fraction after the phosphorylation levels of MCM2 S108 decreased. Therefore, Arbidol decreased the S-phase fraction of ESCC cells and initiated G1-phase blockade through the ATR/MCM2 signaling pathway.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3a, the binding of Arbidol to ATR at ASN 2361 residue is missing. The authors should include this residue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your useful suggestion. Due to the different viewpoint in the previous version of the manuscript, Arbidol binding to ATR at HIS 2361 was not sufficiently 2visualized. We have changed the viewpoint and produced a new figure that displays both ASN 2346 and HIS 2361.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

What is the p-value for &quot;****&quot; in Figures 6c and 6g?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. &quot;****&quot; in Figures 6c and 6g denotes p&lt;0.0001. We also added this information in the Statistical Analysis of Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figures 1e and 6g, length unit should be &quot;50 μm&quot; but not &quot;50 μM&quot;.
