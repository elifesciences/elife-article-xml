(sulfide) in deeper sediment to the reduction of an electron acceptor (oxygen or nitrate) near the surface. While this electric metabolism is prevalent in both marine and freshwater sediments, detailed electronic measurements of the conductivity previously focused on the marine cable bacteria (<italic>Candidatus</italic> Electrothrix), rather than freshwater cable bacteria, which form a separate genus (<italic>Candidatus</italic> Electronema) and contribute essential geochemical roles in freshwater sediments. Here, we characterize the electron transport characteristics of <italic>Ca</italic>. Electronema cable bacteria from Southern California freshwater sediments. Current–voltage measurements of intact cable filaments bridging interdigitated electrodes confirmed their persistent conductivity under a controlled atmosphere and the variable sensitivity of this conduction to air exposure. Electrostatic and conductive atomic force microscopies mapped out the characteristics of the cell envelope’s nanofiber network, implicating it as the conductive pathway in a manner consistent with previous findings in marine cable bacteria. Four-probe measurements of microelectrodes addressing intact cables demonstrated nanoampere currents up to 200 μm lengths at modest driving voltages, allowing us to quantify the nanofiber conductivity at 0.1 S/cm for freshwater cable bacteria filaments under our measurement conditions. Such a high conductivity can support the remarkable sulfide-to-oxygen electrical currents mediated by cable bacteria in sediments. These measurements expand the knowledgebase of long-distance electron transport to the freshwater niche while shedding light on the underlying conductive network of cable bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electron transport</kwd><kwd>cable bacteria</kwd><kwd>bioelectricity</kwd><kwd>bioelectronics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.M.

Respiratory organisms, for instance, gain energy by routing electron flow from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor through the network of reduction-oxidation (redox) cofactors that constitute the cellular electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray and Winkler, 2003</xref>). While the length scales of biological electron transfer events were long thought to be limited to nanometer distances and confined within individual cells, recent observations of fast long-distance extracellular and intercellular electron transport in microbial communities have upended this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2023</xref>). In fact, with the discovery of micron-scale electron transport via cytochrome nanowires from metal-reducing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), conductive bacterial biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yates et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), inter-species electron transfer in microbial consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGlynn et al., 2015</xref>), and multicellular cable bacteria (CB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>), the length scales of microbial electron transport observations have jumped from the nanometer to centimeter scale during the last 15 years.</p><p>The novel multicellular filamentous CB, which belong to the <italic>Desulfobulbaceae</italic> family of Deltaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>), are a particularly interesting system for understanding the limits of biological electron transport given that they are the only known living structures capable of macroscopic (up to centimeter-scale) electron conduction. This macroscopic electron transport allows CB to gain energy from coupling sulfide oxidation by cells that dwell in the deeper sulfidic zone to oxygen reduction by cells near the surface sediment in both marine and freshwater sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nielsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meysman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Risgaard-Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). The energy harnessed from this process allows CB to form a dense matrix (up to hundreds of meters per cm<sup>2</sup>) that composes a majority of the biomass in sediment when blooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marzocchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burdorf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van de Velde et al., 2016</xref>). While the molecular pathway of the conductive network responsible for centimeter-scale electron transport along the cables is not yet understood, the genomic basis and components allowing CB to carry out the two spatially-separated half-reactions are just beginning to come into focus. CB appear to oxidize sulfide by reversing the canonical sulfate reduction pathway and are capable of sulfur disproportionation, while oxygen reduction is hypothesized to be driven by periplasmic cytochromes without energy conservation due to the absence of terminal oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kjeldsen et al., 2019</xref>). The electrogenic sulfur oxidation and its coupling to distant redox events by CB significantly affect sulfur cycling and other essential geochemical processes, including nitrogen and metal cycling in global sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kjeldsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marzocchi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>But what is the conductive pathway responsible for long-distance electron transport along an entire CB filament? The answer appears to lie in the unusual cell envelope of CB, where up to thousands of cells share a common outer membrane and parallel longitudinal ridges run along the surface of the entire filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>). These ridges reflect the presence of a network of long nanofibers (33–67 nm diameter) along the entire length of each cable in the periplasmic space between the common outer membrane and the cellular inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonid et al., 2023</xref>). Initial electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) of these ridges showed striking electrostatic contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>), implicating the periplasmic nanofibers as the current-carrying structures in marine CB filaments. More recently, the conductivity of intact air-dried marine CB filament and chemically extracted sheaths containing the nanofiber network was measured directly by various electronic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiruvallur Eachambadi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonné et al., 2020</xref>). Tens of nanoampere currents could be observed along both intact cable filaments and extracted nanofiber sheaths spanning hundreds of microns between microelectrodes in N<sub>2</sub>/vacuum environments, but the conductance declined rapidly upon exposure to ambient air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>). Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) with stiff tips that scrape outer cell surface layers revealed that the conductive path indeed correlates with the network of individual periplasmic nanofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiruvallur Eachambadi et al., 2020</xref>). For the marine CB nanofibers, conductivities spanning the 10<sup>–2</sup>–10<sup>1</sup> S/cm range, with the upper end reaching as high as 79 S/cm, have been estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>) these values represent a record high for any biological structure. Furthermore, temperature-dependent electronic measurements suggest a thermally activated Arrhenius-type charge transport process with a low activation energy, suggesting that the CB conductive properties are comparable to organic semiconductor materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonné et al., 2020</xref>). The composition of the CB conductive nanofibers remains unknown, but recent evidence points to yet-unknown core proteins rich in sulfur-ligated nickel cofactors that mediate electron transport through an enigmatic physical mechanism, and that the conductivity is diminished upon oxidation of the Ni/S groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boschker et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the CB clade consists of two novel candidate genera: the mostly marine <italic>Candidatus</italic> Electrothrix and mostly freshwater <italic>Candidatus</italic> Electronema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trojan et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, a more distant group of CB has been identified in groundwater environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). However, the abovementioned electronic characterization of CB conduction largely focused on marine CB, with the exception of two-probe measurements as part of a recent comparative study of diverse CB that included one freshwater CB enrichment culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonid et al., 2023</xref>). Freshwater sediments can contain CB populations at densities comparable to their marine counterparts, and their activity strongly influences the sediment geochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Risgaard-Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, freshwater CB play an essential role in a cryptic sulfur cycle by stimulating sulfate reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sandfeld et al., 2020</xref>) and have been harnessed to significantly reduce methane emissions from rice-planted soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scholz et al., 2020</xref>). From a materials perspective, investigations of freshwater CB may also uncover conductive biomaterials suited for applications in less saline environments that support higher electric fields than marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sandfeld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Risgaard-Petersen et al., 2014</xref>).

The first site, Ballona Freshwater Marsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), is a shallow seasonal freshwater pond which is heavily vegetated by aquatic plants that supply sufficient organic matter to the pond bottom sediment in the wet season (December to early June), and is dried out from approximately late June to December every year. The sediment profile from the site was brown-orange-colored at the surface and dark in color with a sulfide smell below the surface, indicating a sharp oxic to sulfidic transition in the sediment. The second sampling site is Mungi Lake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is primarily fed by washes from surrounding areas in Eastern Los Angeles and therefore is precipitation dependent. Mungi Lake has a much thinner and more densely packed sediment layer, compared to the Ballona Freshwater sediment, as the lake was converted from a gravel pit, with almost no aquatic plants and therefore no roots in the bottom surface sediment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The sampling locations in Southern California and optical microscopy images of intact freshwater cable bacteria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sampling sites for cable bacteria from the Ballona Freshwater Marsh and Mungi Lake, CA, USA.

Following laboratory incubation in circulating water to enrich for CB (’Materials and methods’), a high density of CB filaments was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When observed with optical microscopy, the filament diameters varied from 0.7 to 3 µm, with thinner CB filaments usually observed within Mungi Lake sediments. Other than the diameter, there were no obvious morphological differences between the CB from the two sites. Occasionally, darker cells with slightly larger diameters than neighboring cells could be observed at seemingly random locations along the cable filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed that the freshwater CB display the characteristic previously observed parallel longitudinal periplasmic nanofibers that run along the entire CB filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The estimated width of the fibers ranged from 49 to 57 nm, which is comparable to those of the marine cables (ca. 50 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>). TEM imaging of CB recovered from the sediments occasionally revealed degraded cells along the filaments where only an ‘empty cage’ of the parallel nanofibers remained, appearing as darker material reflecting a higher electron-dense composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and likely corresponding to the enlarged cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Here, we identified two sampling sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the Los Angeles basin area, which served as a source for downstream phylogeny, microscopy, scanning probe, and electronic studies of freshwater CB. While CB have not been isolated into pure culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thorup et al., 2021</xref>), the freshwater CB from both Ballona wetlands sediment and Mungi Lake sediment could be reliably enriched in laboratory incubations to provide a continuous supply for studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), CB from the heavily vegetated Ballona sediments are closely related to <italic>Ca</italic>. Electronema palustris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trojan et al., 2016</xref>), which has been previously observed to be associated with the roots of aquatic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scholz et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, CB from the non-vegetated Mungi Lake sediments are more closely related to those from PAH-contaminated sediment collecting water runoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). The 16S rRNA gene analysis also revealed additional non-CB clones from both Ballona and Mungi Lake samples, many of which are highly similar to those from stratified and oligotrophic freshwater ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorador et al., 2013</xref>). Although the relationship and functions of these bacteria are unclear, they likely represent cells firmly attached to CB filaments, as all the filaments were thoroughly washed before DNA extraction. The communities from both sites have representative lineages related to organic contaminant degradation, which correlate to the environmental background of the two sites. In Mungi Lake, for example, various contaminants (chlordane, DDT, lead, dieldrin, PAH, and polychlorinated biphenyls) have been identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Environmental-Protection-Agency US, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Morphologically, our freshwater CB filaments exhibited the expected characteristics of previously studied CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>), including the cell surface ridge pattern and underlying periplasmic nanofiber network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The latter could be observed in TEM of freshwater CB both within intact cells and, occasionally, as the remaining cage scaffold from naturally degraded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The typical single nanofiber width encountered in our freshwater CB was 53 ± 8 nm, which is consistent with the previously reported nanofiber thickness from marine CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>) and recent characterization of a single-strain freshwater CB enrichment culture (33 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonid et al., 2023</xref>). These results suggest that, while general morphological features are shared among diverse CB strains, the number and size of the ridges (and possibly their internal components) may depend on strain and environmental conditions. However, similarly to previous measurements of marine CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>), EFM captured stronger electric forces when scanning the cell surface above the ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), again indicating the unique electric potential and charge distribution from the underlying conductive periplasmic nanofibers. By scanning the long-range electrostatic interaction between CB and tip at a fixed retrace height above the sample, we observed the expected voltage squared dependence of the EFM phase contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staii et al., 2004</xref>), thereby unambiguously assigning EFM phase contrast to the electric force gradient rather than a topographic contribution. C-AFM with an ultra-sharp diamond tip that disrupts the insulating outer cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) offered an even more direct confirmation of the conductivity of underlying periplasmic nanofibers by observing conductive paths between the microelectrode and scanning tip that correlate with the CB ridge pattern. Furthermore, C-AFM point I–V spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) confirmed a direct path for charge transport originating from the microelectrode below intact CB, along the internal periplasmic nanofiber, and into the C-AFM tip above the sample, consistent with the previously observed interconnectivity of the nanofiber network between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiruvallur Eachambadi et al., 2020</xref>). The latter measurements also illustrate a high degree of variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in the conduction signal across different cables; it remains unclear whether this variability reflects heterogeneities intrinsic to different CB filaments or stems from culturing and/or sample preparation effects (including possible oxidative damage). Taken collectively, however, the EFM and C-AFM observations, performed here for the first time on freshwater CB, are consistent with previous analogous measurements on marine CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiruvallur Eachambadi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While their two-probe nature includes a contact resistance contribution, we found IDA microelectrodes to offer a convenient assessment of CB conduction properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) ahead of more sophisticated AFM and four-probe-based techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The IDA platforms, which are commercially available, have been previously used to investigate conductivity in bacterial biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yates et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) and result in high current signals (μA currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as a result of assessing transport along multiple CB sections spanning the IDA inter-electrode gaps. Interestingly, these measurements hint that freshwater CB conductivity may have a somewhat higher degree of tolerance to oxygen exposure than previously reported for marine CB. Instead of an instantaneous and dramatic decline in conduction upon exposure to air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>), some of our freshwater CB samples exhibited a slow (hours) and only partial decline of the conduction upon exposure to air, which could be partially restored by re-insertion into an anaerobic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While these observations showed a high degree of variability and therefore require a more detailed investigation, it is interesting to consider the possibility that the oxidative decline (or other damaging processes), thought to be a consequence of oxidation of Ni cofactors involved in electron transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boschker et al., 2021</xref>), may not affect all sections of the centimeter-long CB filaments simultaneously; under these conditions, IDA measurements, which probe multiple micrometer-scale electrode-crossing CB regions (e.g., 372 crossings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> inset), may offer an advantage over techniques addressing entire CBs or specific CB regions. It is also interesting to consider an alternative possibility that the conductive properties of freshwater CB may be intrinsically more oxygen-resistant than marine CB. A recent bioRxiv paper mentioned that although the cross-sectional area of a single fiber in a marine CB strain was ca. 50% bigger than a freshwater CB strain, the total surface of the fibers in the freshwater CB filament is 40% bigger than that of the marine CB filament. Meanwhile, the freshwater CB strain exhibit higher conductivity than the marine CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonid et al., 2023</xref>). These differences hint at the possibility that the structure or morphology/size of the freshwater cables may be more robust against this oxidative degradation. In general, salt content affects the solubility of oxygen, which dissolves to 25% high levels in freshwater than saltwater. Indeed, previous CB studies verified 20–25% higher oxygen concentration at the surface of freshwater sediment (310–350 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Risgaard-Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sandfeld et al., 2020</xref>), compared to marine sediments (200–280 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nielsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meysman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sulu-Gambari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Risgaard-Petersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seitaj et al., 2015</xref>). Our results motivate a systematic investigation to correlate the oxygen availability in CB environments to both their conductivity and tolerance of electron transport to oxygen exposures.</p><p>When taking contact resistances of intact freshwater CB into account with four-probe measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), we estimated the single nanofiber conductivity to be in the 10<sup>–1</sup> S/cm range. Since CB may possess nonuniform conductivity along their length and estimates for nanofiber diameter and per cable amount were used in our single nanofiber conductivity calculation, we cannot constrain our reported value to better than on the order of 0.1 S/cm. Despite this, our figure falls within the 10<sup>–2</sup>–10<sup>1</sup> S/cm range recently reported for marine CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonné et al., 2020</xref>). We did not observe freshwater CB nanofiber conductivity near the upper end of the previously reported range (~80 S/cm). While these measurements are performed under ex situ conditions, they motivate the question of whether the measured conductivities are sufficient to support the in situ activity of CB in sediments. From previous measurements of the CB filaments density in sediment incubations (~10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>–2</sup>) and the electron current densities linking electrogenic sulfur oxidation to oxygen reduction (74–96 mA m<sup>–2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meysman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geelhoed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van de Velde et al., 2017</xref>), one arrives at a per cable current around 170 pA, which amounts to per nanofiber current of 5 pA given the average number of nanofibers seen in our cables. Assuming a driving voltage up to 1 V, representing the redox potential difference between the anodic sulfide oxidation and cathodic oxygen reduction half-reactions, for a typical nanofiber cross-sectional area and length (e.g., several millimeters), these conditions require a minimum nanofiber conductivity on the order of 0.1 S/cm. Remarkably, this heuristic calculation therefore sets a limit on conductivity that is consistent with the electronic measurements. It is also interesting to consider what the observed conductivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiruvallur Eachambadi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonné et al., 2020</xref>) and this study may teach us about the underlying physical electron transport mechanism in CB. It is common to interpret such extended transport in molecular systems in one of two limits: hopping between charge localizing sites such as redox factors (e.g., the hypothesized Ni/S groups of CB) or coherent band-like transport familiar from periodic systems including metals or semiconductors. In this context, the thermally activated nature of CB transport and the estimate of the room temperature electron mobility at ~ 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonné et al., 2020</xref>) are consistent with hopping transport, as the latter figure approaches but is still below the generally accepted minimum mobility (∼1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs) for band transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polizzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pirbadian and El-Naggar, 2012</xref>). Still, future electronic transport and structural studies (e.g., to identify the precise molecular makeup of the nanofibers) are needed to resolve the underlying mechanism, particularly if conduction operates in a more complex regime than band theory or hopping, where electron transport may be delocalized transiently or permanently over several sites along the nanofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beratan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beratan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study presents a detailed electronic characterization of <italic>Ca</italic>. Electronema CB from Southern California freshwater sediments. The cell envelope characteristics of the freshwater CB, including the characteristic periplasmic nanofiber network, are consistent with previous observations of the globally distributed CB. C-AFM and EFM confirmed the role of the nanofiber network as the conductive conduit of freshwater CB, as previously observed in marine CB. In addition, current–voltage measurements confirmed the conductivity of whole CB filaments while hinting that the conductivity of the freshwater filaments may be less sensitive to oxygen exposure than previously observed. The conductivity of the periplasmic nanofibers from four-probe electronic transport measurements was estimated at 0.1 S/cm, a value high enough to support the electron current densities linking sulfide oxidation to oxygen reduction through the electric metabolism of CB in sediment environments. While electronic characterization of this long-distance electron transport previously focused on marine cables, our measurements shed light on the conductivity of freshwater CB and highlight the potential applications of CB as bioelectronic conduits with both environmental and future biotechnological relevance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sediment sampling and incubation</title><p>Surface sediment and pond water were collected from two sampling sites. The first site, the Ballona Freshwater Marsh pond (33°58′15′′N, 118°25′51′′W), is a restored wetland that was previously filled and farmed for decades and is located 18 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The pond is seasonal (accessible approximately December to early June during the wet season). The second sampling site is Mungi Lake (34°6′6.192′′N, 118°0′44.2224′′W), located in the Los Angeles River Basin in the city of Arcadia, CA, USA. The sediment samples were collected from shallow water because the dissolved oxygen (DO) typically declines to zero during the summer months at depths greater than 5 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Environmental-Protection-Agency US, 2012</xref>). In the wintertime, less water stratification results in a higher DO concentration that can support CB growth in the lake bottom sediment. Mungi Lake samples were accessible year-round despite the lake shrinking during the dry season.</p><p>The top ~5 cm of sediment from both sites was sampled approximately every 3 months. Upon returning to the laboratory, the sediment was homogenized, sieved through a 5-mm-pore-size sieve, and carefully filled into glass jars, avoiding air bubbles in the sediment. The sediment jars were then incubated in a water bath at 15℃, submerged in circulating, air-saturated water collected from the respective sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cable bacteria filaments pickup</title><p>Filamentous bacteria were detectable after 2 weeks of incubation; occasionally, the filament density was high enough to be directly observed in sediment cracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Over the incubation period, small sediment cores were taken from the sediment jars using plastic straws (8 mm diameter, 80 mm length) and transferred into small Petri dishes filled with DI water. Long filaments were hand-picked under a dissection microscope using glass hooks made from capillary tubes, then washed successively at least three times in Milli-Q water droplets. This extraction of CB was performed in a glove bag under an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic identification</title><p>Under a dissection microscope, three long filaments from each sampling site were washed and transferred into a sterile PCR tube. Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw three times as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>). The lysates were directly used for PCR using the primer pair 8F and DSBB/1297R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kjeldsen et al., 2007</xref>). PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, USA). After 30 s at 98℃ for initial denaturation, PCR was performed with 35 cycles, consisting of 10 s at 98℃, 30 s at 65℃, and 45 s at 72℃, followed by a final step of 2 min at 72℃. The PCR amplicons were mixed and cloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit. Clones with a correct insertion were commercially sequenced (GENEWIZ, USA) using the vector primers M13F and M13R. Sequences were assembled in Sequencher 5.4, and their quality was checked manually. Alignment was performed in the ARB software package (arb-6.0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ludwig et al., 2004</xref>) using aligned sequences from SILVA database SSU 132 for reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quast et al., 2013</xref>) and manually refined subsequently. The 16S rRNA phylogenetic trees were generated using ARB. Trees that were built using the ARB neighbor-joining algorithm and the maximum likelihood algorithm (RaxML) with a 50% positional conservation filter, with 1000 bootstrap replicates in all trees, were compared to make sure the trees had no conflicting branching. Representative sequences from this study were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers (OR244071–OR244134).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Bundles of filaments were washed thoroughly, deposited in small droplets of Milli-Q water, and the CB filament-containing water droplets were then transferred and air-dried on PELCO hexagonal Carbon-Formvar-coated copper grids.

Substrates were affixed and electrically connected to sample discs. The CB were extracted from sediment using fine glass hooks, washed several times in DI water, and placed on the prepared substrates to dry. The sample discs were wired to the grounding pin of the AFM upon loading. Si probes with a Ti/Ir (5/20) coating, a nominal resonant frequency of 75 kHz (58–97 kHz range), a nominal spring constant of 2.8 N/m (1.4–5.8 N/m range), and a tip radius of 28 ± 10 nm were used for all EFM measurements. High-resolution EFM scans were performed following initial ‘wide view’ tapping AFM imaging to locate the CB filaments. For each EFM scan, a first pass scans the conductive probe in standard tapping without an applied tip bias, followed by a second ‘nap’ pass that retraces the first pass topography at a constant height above the sample. EFM was performed at different nap pass heights and tip voltage biases to arrive at optimal conditions and evaluate the voltage dependence. Electrostatic forces between the tip and sample shift the resonance frequency of the probe, resulting in a phase change of the cantilever, which was quantified for pixels representing specific features (e.g., nanofibers). The phase differences for each image (e.g., specific tip voltage bias) were averaged and their standard deviation taken.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Current–voltage (I–V) measurements on IDA microelectrodes</title><p>A 3 µm gap-size Au IDA (IDA model# 012129, ALS Co, Ltd, Japan) and a Pine WaveDriver 200 Bipotentiostat/Galvanostat were used for electrical measurements. The IDA consists of two individually addressable arrays of interdigitated gold microelectrodes (length, 2 mm; width, 3 µm; thickness: 100 nm). Copper wires were affixed to these two electrodes with silver paint (product # 16035, TED PELLA, Inc) and covered with an epoxy layer at the contact points. The wires were then connected to the potentiostat, which swept the potential from –0.2 to 0.2 V at a 10 µV/s sweep rate. All measurements were performed in an anaerobic chamber (95% N<sub>2</sub> and 5% H<sub>2</sub>) (Bactron 300, Sheldon Manufacturing, Inc, Cornelius, OR). Control measurements prior to measurements of CB included open circuit (without water or CB), I–V measurements of an IDA on which a water droplet has been deposited (no CB), and I–V measurements made after the Milli-Q water droplets were dried on the IDA (no CB). After these controls, CB filaments were washed and deposited in a small droplet of Milli-Q water on the IDA surface. The CB filament-containing water droplet was then left to dry prior to the I–V measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Conductive atomic force microscopy</title><p>C-AFM was performed using an Oxford Instruments Asylum Research Cypher ES AFM.

For C-AFM current mapping, ultra-sharp conductive single-crystal diamond probes (AD-2.8-SS, Adama Innovations, Ltd), with &lt;5 nm tip radius, were used to image Mungi Lake CB in contact mode under N<sub>2</sub> perfusion. C-AFM current mapping was performed with a 0.1 Hz scan rate, 300 nN force, and a constant 5 V DC voltage bias applied between the probe and IDA. The probes and imaging parameters were selected to minimize disturbance to the sample while simultaneously eroding the insulating outer membrane enough to electrically probe the underlying periplasmic fibers. Prior to C-AFM, high-resolution tapping mode imaging was performed to spatially correlate the topography of the CB nanofibers to conductivity.</p><p>Point current–voltage (I–V) measurements were also performed to measure conduction along Ballona Marsh CB between the IDA microelectrodes and C-AFM tip (Si Probe ASYELEC.01-R2, Oxford Instruments, with a conductive Ti/Ir [5/20] coating and 28 ± 10 nm tip radius) probing CB spots above the insulating quartz IDA gap under ambient conditions. At each point, the IDA voltage was swept for five consecutive cycles in the –10 to 10 V range with a 0.1 cycle/s scan rate, while the C-AFM probe was grounded and held in contact with the CB surface at a 450–510 nN force. All point–IV curves shown, including the insulating quartz background curve, are the average values taken from the five voltage cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Four-probe device fabrication</title><p>Four-probe (4P) microelectrode devices were designed in-house and fabricated by the University of California San Diego Nano3 cleanroom foundry service. Each device consisted of a series of parallel electrode bands. The bands were 3.5 mm long, 100 μm wide, and each one was connected on alternating sides to a 1.5 mm by 5 mm contact pad. The electrode band separation distances were variable, including multiple 20 and 200 μm gaps to assess different CB lengths. The fabrication process is briefly outlined as follows. 100-mm diameter and 0.5-mm-thick SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si wafers (wafer model 1583, University Wafer, Inc) were used as substrates. Solvent-cleaned wafers were coated with photoresist (PR) and a laser writer was used to project repeats of the device pattern onto the PR with UV light. E-beam evaporation was used to deposit a 5 nm Ti adhesion layer followed by a 100 nm Au layer onto the wafers. Solvents were used to remove the excess Au/Ti layer and PR, leaving just the electrode patterns. As a final step, the wafers were coated in PR and each device was then diced into an 18 mm × 18 mm chip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Four-probe electrical measurements</title><p>Four-probe (4P) measurements were made using an Agilent 4156C Precision Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer, along with a Signatone 1160 series probe station. Thin copper wires (product # 1227, Train Control Systems) were electrically connected to the 4P contact pads with silver paint (product # 16035, TED PELLA, Inc) and alligator clips attached to tungsten probes were used to connect the 4P device to the analyzer. Mungi Lake CB filaments were placed and dried across the electrodes of our devices. To deal with the high degree of variability between individual filaments, they were placed one at a time and I–V measurements were performed after each deposition until current (from a conductive filament) was observed. To make the 4P measurement, a set of four electrodes on the device, with either a 20 or a 200 μm inner probe separation distance, were each wired to a source monitor unit within the analyzer. Current was swept between the outer two electrodes from –1 to 1 nA in step sizes of 100 pA. The voltage difference between the inner two electrodes (<italic>V</italic><sub>inner</sub>) was then recorded at each current step. Auto-range voltage sensitivity with a voltage compliance of 5 V and an integration time of 1 PLC were used. A 2 s delay was used between each <italic>V</italic><sub>inner</sub> measurement to eliminate capacitive current contributions. Current sweeps were performed three times for the two inner probe gap sizes used. Average <italic>V</italic><sub>inner</sub> values for each current step were obtained from the three sweeps, along with an error bar indicating the standard deviation.

Minor comments follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for the encouraging feedback and for appreciating the central message of the preprint. Below we address the reviewer’s constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional information could be provided regarding the degraded cells where an 'empty cage' remains, as well as the polyphosphate granules, which were previously observed in marine CB (refs. 11 and 18).</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript to note that the appearance of empty cages and the polyphosphate granules in freshwater cable bacteria is indeed consistent with these features as previously reported in marine CB. The size of polyphosphate granules in freshwater CB are comparable or slightly smaller than in marine CB (Sulu-Gambari et al., 2015). In the case of empty cages, these cells were previously described as ‘ghost filaments’ which had lost all cell membrane and cytoplasmic material (Cornelissen et al., 2018).</p><p>Manuscript edits: a sentence regarding polyphosphate granules has been added into the manuscript from lines 307 - 308. “The size of polyphosphate granules in freshwater CB (70 nm – 400 nm) is comparable or slightly smaller than in marine CB (35)”.</p><p>A sentence regarding the empty cages has been added into the manuscript (lines 303-305). “These empty cages were previously described as ‘ghost filaments’ which had lost all cell membrane and cytoplasm material (20).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also state that the 'phase difference between the elevated ridges and interridge regions is proportional to the tip voltage squared,' and refer to Fig. 4D. This figure has only three data points with large error bars. The authors may wish to explain this finding and justify their analysis in greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that we presented this result but did not adequately describe its origin or significance. In general, the probe phase response of electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) can originate not only from the electrostatic interaction with the sample (i.e. the electrical properties of interest) but also from shorter range van der Waals forces (which are more reflective of probe-sample distance i.e. topography). To ensure that EFM is reporting electrical interactions, we performed these measurements using a two-pass technique, with the second pass retracing the topography measured during the first pass, but at a fixed height above the surface where the interactions are long range (electrostatic) rather than short range (vdW) or resulting from topography cross-talk. The purpose of the voltage change measurement (Fig. 4D) is to simply assess whether this procedure is successful, since electrostatic forces are proportional to the square of the voltage at a fixed height (F = <italic>½ . ∂C⁄∂z .V2</italic>). While the error bar of that measurement is high, due to the intrinsic noise in the dynamic (high frequency) EFM phase response measurement, we note that the purpose of this measurement is simply to assess that the interaction is due to the electrical interaction with the sample, before proceeding to actual conductance measurements (Figs. 5-8).</p><p>Manuscript edits: we previously simply cited a reference where the reader can delve deeper into the origin of the square voltage signal. To put this into better context, we now include an additional information (lines 461 - 475), noting the origin and purpose of the result as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting that the freshwater CB appear to be more resilient to air compared to marine CB (or at least some freshwater filaments, as the authors note that the level of resilience is filament-dependent). The authors indicate that salt affects oxygen solubility and there is a larger oxygen content in freshwater. Do the authors have thoughts on whether or not the differences between marine and freshwater CB could fit, or not fit, with the hypothesis that conductivity in air is lowered due to oxidation of the Ni/S species (ref. 25 in manuscript)? Could the freshwater CB have greater protection against oxidation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Indeed, our manuscript mentions the current hypothesis that conductivity of cable bacteria may be diminished upon oxidation of the Ni/S groups (lines 101 - 105 and 498 - 504). It remains unclear how this idea may lead to variability between marine and freshwater cables. Interestingly, however, a recent comparative <italic>bioRxiv</italic> preprint (Digel <italic>et. al.</italic> 2023) noted significant differences in the morphology, number, and crosssectional area of nanofibers between a freshwater and marine CB strain. These differences may lead to a different resiliency against oxidative degradation upon exposure air. Specifically, even though the marine CB strain was characterized by a larger cross-section area per nanofiber, it had significantly fewer nanofibers, leading to 40% smaller total area than its freshwater counterpart. We have edited the manuscript to highlight these possible differences (at least in size) between freshwater and marine cables.</p><p>Manuscript edits (lines 506 – 514) “For example, a recent comparative study (21) hints at significant differences in the morphology, number, and size of nanofibers when comparing a marine CB strain to a freshwater CB strain. Specifically, while the marine CB was characterized by a 50% larger cross-sectional area per nanofiber, the total nanofibers’ area was 40% smaller than the freshwater strain due to a smaller number of nanofibers per CB filament. Given the proposed central role of nanofibers in mediating electron transport along CB, it is possible that such differences may also lead to different degrees of tolerance against oxidative degradation upon exposure to air.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6D shows current-voltage measurements from three representative cables; there is a large variation, most notably between Cable 1 and Cables 2 and 3. Is this variation typical for different cables? Can the authors comment on the range of values observed and how many cables fit into different ranges? Any thoughts on the reasons behind the range?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6 B and C (red and blue) are representative of most of the cable conductance measured using the point IV CAFM technique, with the Figure 6 A (green) IV curve being an example of the upper limit, which was less frequently observed. In total we measured ten cables using the point IV CAFM technique. These variations may stem from actual differences in the conductivity of separate CB filaments, the environment of the measurement, or limitations in the conductive AFM measurement techniques. These limitations include a large contact resistance due to the interaction of the small probe with the sample, which may lead to large variability depending on the contact point. For this reason, we rely on 4-probe measurements (Fig. 8) for quantitative conductive analyses, rather than conductive AFM. It is important to note, however, that the conductive AFM measurements (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) provide other complementary information including the demonstration of both transverse and longitudinal transport (lines 389-393) in Fig. 6 and the visualizing of the current carrying nanofibers in Fig. 7.</p><p>Manuscript edits: we have edited the manuscript (lines 413 - 418) to make it clear that the quantitative estimate of conductivity was made only using 4 probe measurements due to the limitations of CAFM or two-probe techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on how the number of fibers per CB in their samples compares with the number of fibers in marine CB? Marine CB are known to have pinwheel junctions where the fibers come together before branching out again. This pinwheel design could play a role in the function of the CB or in its survival (see Adv. Biosys. 2020, 4, 2000006). Were pinwheel structures observed in freshwater CB? If so, how do they compare?</p></disp-quote><p>From the previous studies, estimates of the number of fibers in marine CB appeared to vary significantly from 15 or 17 (Pfeffer et. al., 2012) to 58 – 61 (Cornelissen et. al., 2018). In our freshwater CB, we estimated the number of fibers at ~35 per CB (line 423), which is comparable to the count of 34 per freshwater CB recently reported by Digel <italic>et al.,</italic> bioRxiv 2023. We cannot specifically comment on the pinwheel structure as we did not perform the transverse thin section TEM imaging necessary to observe the cell-cell junctions in this particular study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On lines 95-96, the authors discuss the fact that marine cable bacteria have a wide variance in their measured conductivities. While one may ask if the larger marine conductivities (near 80 S/cm) are representative, a conductivity of 0.1 S/cm is 2 orders of magnitude lower than this value, which the field generally refers to as a high conductivity. The authors should mention whether or not any of their specimens display the high conductivities seen in select marine cable bacteria specimens.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed important to note that the ~80 S/cm figure refers to an upper end previously observed (ref. 22) for marine CB conductivity. In our manuscript (lines 525 - 526), we highlight that the previously observed <italic>range</italic> (including in that same study) is 10−2-101 S/cm and we were careful to qualify the previously reported upper end with ‘reaching as high as’ (line 97). Note that this places our measurement of 0.1 S/cm within the previously reported range. We have not observed freshwater CB conductivity near the upper end of the previously reported range, and generally propose that these types of measurements are better analyzed in the context of the biological function rather than ‘high vs. low’. Towards that end, the manuscript (lines 527-537) makes the argument that the 10-1 S/cm figure may be sufficient to support the electrical currents mediated by CB in sediments. We have edited the manuscript to highlight that we did not observe single CB nanofiber conductivity near the upper limit previously observed in marine CB (lines 522 525).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Mohamed Y.

Our discussion (lines 498-506) considers the possible reasons for this variability:</p><p>‘While these observations showed a high degree of variability and therefore require a more detailed investigation, it is interesting to consider the possibility that the oxidative decline (or other damaging processes), thought to be a consequence of oxidation of Ni cofactors involved in electron transport (25), may not affect all sections of the cm long CB filaments simultaneously; under these conditions, IDA measurements, which probe multiple micrometer-scale electrode-crossing CB regions (e.g. 372 crossings in Figure 5 inset) may offer an advantage over techniques addressing entire CBs or specific CB regions. It is also interesting to consider an alternative possibility that the conductive properties of freshwater CB maybe intrinsically more oxygen-resistant than marine CB’.</p><p>To summarize , the manuscript points to the likelihood that the IDA technique used here may offer an advantage for detecting currents under damaging conditions since it interrogates multiple sections simultaneously. Furthermore, in a recent preprint from Digel <italic>et al.,</italic> (2023), the conductivity of the only freshwater strain investigated in that study was among the highest compared to other marine CB strains. Therefore, the freshwater CB being more resistant is one possibility to be investigated based on these observations and results. We therefore present the latter as a possibility in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The calculation of a single nanofiber conductivity is based on experiment and calculation with significant uncertainty. E.g. for the number of nanofibers in a single filament that varies depending on the filament size (Frontiers in microbiology, 2018, 9: 3044.), and the measured CB resistance, which does not scale well with inner probe separation (Figure 5). A more rigorous consideration of these uncertainties is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. For these calculations, we made sure to determine the representative number of fibers per cable and thickness of the nanofibers (~50 nm) from our own samples. We indeed assessed the possible variability across our different cable filaments and found the fiber numbers varied from 30 – 44 (with 35 used as a representative figure in the paper). For the scaling of resistance with inner probe separation, our 4P results estimated that the CB resistances are 47 MΩ and 240 MΩ for the 20 µm and 200 µm lengths, respectively, rather than an expected tenfold difference if the cable has a uniform conductivity along the entire filaments. This result suggests nonuniform conductivity in different sections of the CB filament. Since accounting for non-uniform conduction (and variability in fiber morphology/density) is clearly difficult, we were careful to limit our conclusion to an order of magnitude estimate (e.g. lines 522-525). Given the previously reported range of cable bacteria conductivity (10−2101 S/cm), this places our estimate within this range. We have further edited the manuscript to note that our reported single nanofiber conductivity cannot be constrained further than the order of 0.1 S/cm due to our estimates in nanofiber diameter and per cable amount as well as the possibility of nonuniform conductivity along the CB length (lines 522-525).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 4A: Please add scale- and color bar.</p></disp-quote><p>Done - new Fig. 4 included with colors bars for topography and phase.
