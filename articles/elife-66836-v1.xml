communication across sensorimotor loops. For active touch with the hand, the longest loop is the transcortical continuation of ascending pathways, particularly the lemnisco-cortical and corticocortical pathways carrying tactile signals via the cuneate nucleus, ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus, and primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices to reach corticospinal neurons and influence descending activity. We characterized excitatory connectivity along this pathway in the mouse. In the lemnisco-cortical leg, disynaptic cuneate→VPL→S1 connections excited mainly layer (L) 4 neurons. In the corticocortical leg, S1→M1 connections from L2/3 and L5A neurons mainly excited downstream L2/3 neurons, which excite corticospinal neurons. The findings provide a detailed new wiring diagram for the hand/forelimb-related transcortical circuit, delineating a basic but complex set of cell-type-specific feedforward excitatory connections that selectively and extensively engage diverse intratelencephalic projection neurons, thereby polysynaptically linking subcortical somatosensory input to cortical motor output to spinal cord.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>motor</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>corticospinal</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS061963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon M G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI056346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Gregory Allan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-type-specific circuit analysis reveals a highly polysynaptic pattern of excitatory feedforward connections along the somatosensory-to-motor loop, from cuneate via VPL thalamus to S1 and M1 cortex and corticospinal neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functions of the hand and forelimb depend on sensorimotor circuits spanning multiple levels of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber and Costa, 2018</xref>). At the earliest, most reflexive stage, somatosensory afferents are tightly coupled to motor neurons in the spinal cord. Through a longer loop, somatosensory pathways ascending via brainstem and thalamus reach corticospinal neurons in cortex. The major nodes sequentially traversed in this transcortical pathway include the cuneate nucleus, ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of thalamus, the hand/forelimb-related primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices. The macroscopic structure of these lemnisco-cortical and corticocortical pathways is well-known from classical anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brodal, 1981</xref>) and supported by in vivo electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson, 1995</xref>). However, the cellular-level synaptic connectivity linking the major nodes, whereby peripheral inputs are ultimately conveyed to corticospinal neurons in S1 and/or M1, remains largely uncharacterized for these hand-related circuits. Elucidation of this circuit organization will be an important step toward characterizing basic mechanisms underlying somatosensory-guided control of the hand and forelimb and related aspects of sensorimotor integration in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hatsopoulos and Suminski, 2011</xref>), and can potentially inform translational approaches to restore hand function in neurological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, much is known about the circuit connections and structure-function relationships in corresponding transcortical pathways in the whisker-barrel system of rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Petersen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staiger and Petersen, 2021</xref>). Similar to the hand-related pathways, the ascending somatosensory pathways in this system include lemniscal and corticocortical pathways traversing the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus, whisker S1, and whisker M1; additionally, however, a paralemniscal pathway conveys whisking-related signals via the posterior (PO) nucleus. While both systems are used for active sensing, they differ in fundamental ways, ranging from the structure and function of the sensors (actively whisked vibrissal hairs versus glabrous pads and hairy skin) and proprioceptive systems (muscle spindles present in forelimb but largely absent in vibrissal musculature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Severson et al., 2019</xref>) to the modes of operation (bilaterally coupled oscillatory whisking versus diverse forelimb movements for manipulation and locomotion). Differences in pathway anatomy may reflect these behavioral specializations; the S1 and M1 areas for the whiskers are widely separated, whereas those for the hand/forelimb are side-by-side, and the primary source of corticocortical input to whisker M1 is the contralateral whisker M1, whereas that for forelimb M1 is the adjacent ipsilateral forelimb S1, suggesting a more prominent role of somatosensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colechio and Alloway, 2009</xref>). With this mix of similarities and differences, the extent to which the organizational features of the whisker-related transcortical circuits pertain to the hand-related circuits is unclear.</p><p>Mice offer a favorable model for investigating these hand-related transcortical circuits, as they display a variety of hand and forelimb movements including highly dexterous manipulation behaviors, directional reaching, and more (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Whishaw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Galiñanes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrett et al., 2020</xref>). Mice have a well-defined hand and forelimb representation in S1, and corticospinal neurons projecting to cells and circuits in the cervical spinal cord feeding into motor neurons innervating forelimb muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>). Elucidation of hand-related transcortical circuit organization in the mouse could thus provide a valuable comparison both for the rodent whisker-barrel system and the primate hand, and would also facilitate basic research on cortical mechanisms of forelimb functions, for which mice are increasingly used as a model organism.</p><p>We used viral labeling, optogenetic photostimulation, whole-cell electrophysiology, and related methods to dissect the cell-type-specific connections in the ascending pathways carrying somatosensory information from the mouse’s forelimb, leading to the S1 hand subfield, forelimb M1, and cervically projecting corticospinal neurons. The findings establish a detailed wiring diagram for excitatory somatosensory-to-motor transcortical circuits for the mouse’s hand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The S1 hand/forelimb subfield overlaps medially with corticospinal neurons</title><p>The overall goal of this study – dissection of the chain of excitatory connections whereby information conveyed by lemnisco-cortical afferents ultimately reaches M1 corticospinal neurons that project back to the cervical spinal circuits controlling the forelimb musculature – entails consideration of the cortical topography involved. The hand-related area of S1 is well-demarcated as a somatotopically organized subfield of the ‘barrel map’ defined by layer (L) 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>). However, the cortical distribution of cervically projecting corticospinal neurons, the key cortical components at the downstream end of the transcortical circuit for the hand, is more complex, centering on forelimb M1 (also termed the caudal forelimb area) but also extending into forelimb S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li and Waters, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young et al., 2012</xref>). Recent results clarify that the corticospinal neurons in forelimb S1 innervate sensory-related neurons in the cervical cord and, unlike those in M1, are not labeled following injections of retrograde transsynaptic viruses in forelimb muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>). In light of these anatomical complexities, prior to dissecting the transcortical circuit connections we first assessed the topography of the hand subfield of S1 in the mouse, as defined by the presence of L4 barrel-like structures, in relation to the areal distribution of cervically projecting corticospinal neurons. We targeted those projecting to cervical level 6 (C6) in particular (corticospinal<sup>C6-proj</sup> neurons), as C6 is prominently involved in sensorimotor functions of the hand.</p><p>Crossing the L4-specific Scnn1a-Cre driver line with the Ai14 Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line yielded offspring expressing tdTomato in L4 neurons across S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De la Rossa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sigl-Glöckner et al., 2019</xref>). In flattened brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the hand/forelimb S1 subfield contained barrel-like blobs, arrayed in a pattern closely matching that of the rat, where this pattern has been shown to be somatotopically arranged, corresponding to the digits, pads, and wrist, with the D1 and thenar pad representation situated most lateral (adjacent to the lip and mouth area) and the D5 and hypothenar most medial (adjacent to the hindlimb area) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waters et al., 1995</xref>). The mediolateral somatotopic layout of the digits and the cortical magnification of the hand and thumb representations constitute a conserved mammalian pattern found in other rodents such as squirrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sur et al., 1978</xref>) and in monkeys and humans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Penfield and Rasmussen, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martuzzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chand and Jain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roux et al., 2018</xref>). Septa – linear gaps in the Scnn1a labeling pattern – were found between the hand subfield and neighboring body part representations, and also within the hand subfield, demarcating a lateral region corresponding to the thumb/thenar subregion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waters et al., 1995</xref>); similar septa have been described in monkey S1 as gaps in myelin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chand and Jain, 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The S1 hand/forelimb subfield overlaps medially with corticospinal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Flat-mount section through L4 of the cortex of a Scnn1a-Cre;Ai14 mouse, showing the L4 labeling pattern across S1 cortex.

In the cortex, corticospinal<sup>C6-proj</sup> neurons (seen as their proximal apical dendrites in flattened L4 sections) were distributed mostly medial to the hand S1 territory, but with partial overlap at the medial edge of hand S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This region of overlap corresponds to the D5 and hypothenar barrels in the ulnar part of the hand S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The corticospinal distribution moreover extended into the relatively large septum between the hand and hindlimb territories of S1, narrowing as it extends posteriorly before merging into a larger cluster of corticospinal neurons situated medial to the posterior medial barrel subfield. Corticospinal labeling was weaker or absent within the hindlimb S1 region itself, and also within the lateral part of the hand subfield corresponding to the D1/thenar subregion. Images of coronal sections gave similar results, confirming that the horizontal distribution of corticospinal neurons, which are located in L5B, extends from M1 into S1, up to ~0.3 mm laterally below the labeled L4 of hand S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>To relate the neuronal labeling patterns to cranial landmarks and stereotaxic coordinates, we imaged the cranium of anesthetized mice to identify the coronal sutures and bregma under bright-field illumination, and transcranially imaged tdTomato fluorescence from L4 neurons and GFP from corticospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Corticospinal labeling was observed in the region commonly identified as forelimb M1, medial to the L4 territory defining S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tennant et al., 2011</xref>). However, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>), the distribution of cervically projecting corticospinal neurons also appeared to extend toward and partially into the medial subregion of hand S1.</p><p>To functionally assess if the region of hand S1 overlapping with corticospinal neurons corresponds to the hypothenar/ulnar aspect, we performed somatosensory mapping. First, using CaMKIIa-Cre;GCaMP6s mice to label excitatory cortical neurons, we confirmed the large-scale somatotopic layout of major body part representations in the mouse, with hand S1 situated anterolateral to hindlimb S1, posteromedial to the lower lip and face, and anterior to the vibrissal territory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), consistent with prior results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sigl-Glöckner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Then, for higher resolution imaging restricted to S1 areas, we used Scnn1a-Cre;GCaMP6s mice to label L4 neurons in S1 areas, which showed that responses to tactile stimulation of the fifth digit (D5) were located in a region corresponding to the posteromedial part of hand S1, in the region of overlap with corticospinal neurons, with the D2 representation located more anterior and lateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>These results, which build on and extend recent characterizations of hand/forelimb-related region of mouse S1 as it relates to the areal distribution of corticospinal<sup>C6-proj</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrate that the region of partial overlap occurs in a medial part of S1 corresponding to the hypothenar/ulnar subregion of the somatotopic representation of the hand/forelimb area. Subsequently in this study, we generally targeted this subregion of the S1 hand subfield for injections and recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PRV labeling of the lemnisco-cortical pathway to L4 neurons in S1</title><p>As a first step in circuit-tracing, we used pseudorabies viruses (PRV) to anatomically trace the ascending polysynaptic lemnisco-cortical pathway to hand S1. Because L4 neurons are strongly thalamo-recipient in sensory cortex, we targeted them as starter cells for PRV tracing, by injecting the Cre-dependent PRV-Introvert-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pomeranz et al., 2017</xref>) into the hand S1 of Scnn1a-Cre mice. After 72 hr (n = 3 mice), Cre-dependent labeling was observed primarily at the injection site in S1, largely restricted to L4 neurons, with additional labeling in a small subregion of the VPL nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After longer incubation periods (96 hr; n = 3 mice), labeling was stronger at these sites, and also appeared in the cuneate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In these experiments, the precise timing and extent of labeling at different time points may be influenced by multiple factors, such as the time dependence of Cre-mediated gene expression and variable numbers of infected starter neurons in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pomeranz et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, because the labeling in cortex does not distinguish between first-, second-, and higher order neurons, cortical labeling in L4 presumably represents a mix of these especially at later time points, reflecting the dense intralaminar interconnectivity in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the timing of the spread to the cuneate suggests a disynaptic lemnisco-cortical circuit (i.e., cuneate→VPL→S1-L4).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PRV labeling of the lemnisco-cortical pathway to L4 neurons in hand S1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the injection strategy.

For example, one tool we used was the recently developed Cre-dependent PRV-Introvert-GFP virus, which together with Cre-driver mouse lines enables cell types of interest to be selectively labeled as starter cells for polysynaptic circuit tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pomeranz et al., 2017</xref>). General considerations with viral circuit-tracing methods include the possibilities of mixed neuronal tropism, under-labeling of connected neurons, and transsynaptic versus transneuronal propagation modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beier, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nectow and Nestler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rogers and Beier, 2021</xref>). As discussed earlier (see Results), additional considerations with the use of PRV-Introvert-GFP for cortical labeling include the increasing difficulty over time of distinguishing first-, second-, and higher-order labeling in the cortex, due to interconnections among cortical neurons. However, this was not a major concern for our main purpose of using PRV to anatomically delineate the lemnisco-cortical pathway leading to forelimb S1, as a starting point for subsequent detailed quantitative analysis of synaptic connectivity in this circuit using electrophysiology-based methods. In particular, we used the technique of ChR2-based circuit mapping, which combines selective presynaptic photostimulation and targeted postsynaptic whole-cell recordings. A limitation with this technique is that it gives only one particular (albeit particularly important) view of connectivity from the perspective of single-cell measurements at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>). Because the strengths and drawbacks of these techniques tend to be distinct and often complementary, the use of multiple techniques helps to establish findings by triangulation. Accordingly, we assessed connectivity along the transcortical circuit using several approaches, including anatomical labeling, circuit tracing with PRV, and anterograde labeling of axons with ChR2 and electrophysiological recordings from retrogradely labeled projection neurons.</p><p>We also developed a circuit analysis paradigm that combines ChR2-electrophysiology and virally mediated anterograde transneuronal labeling using AAV-hSyn-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). With this approach, by starting at the cuneate and injecting multiple retrograde tracers to label various types of cortical projection neurons, we were able to sample and compare, in the same slices, cuneo-thalamo-cortical inputs to various corticocortical and corticospinal projection neurons, in effect constituting cuneo-thalamo-cortico-cortical and cuneo-thalamo-cortico-spinal circuits. This paradigm thus extends the number of circuit nodes that can be tested in the same experiment, from two, as in standard ChR2-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>), or three, as in approaches involving recordings from identified projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>), to four, by selectively activating inputs from presynaptic neurons that are postsynaptic to a particular upstream source of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Areal organization of the hand/forelimb subfield of S1</title><p>Characterization of the areal topography of the hand/forelimb subfield of mouse S1 was aided by the Scnn1a-Cre mouse line, which labels L4 across all of S1, similar to cytochrome oxidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sigl-Glöckner et al., 2019</xref>).

Recent evidence reveals that corticospinal neurons in S1 in the overlap zone project to more dorsal levels of the spinal cord where they innervate distinct classes of spinal interneurons and are involved in more sensory-related aspects of forelimb motor behavior, whereas M1 corticospinal neurons project to more ventral cord levels and connect to spinal interneurons that directly contact spinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>).

In this sense, forelimb S1 and M1 in the mouse resembles more the typical side-by-side topographic layout of somatosensory and motor areas seen in primates. Another notable aspect of the somatotopic layout of the forelimb subfield of mouse S1 is the relative expansion, or cortical magnification, both of the hand with respect to the rest of the forelimb, and of the thumb/thenar representation with respect to the rest of the hand.

In the whisker-barrel system, in addition to lemniscal inputs, thalamus receives paralemniscal afferents, which arise from other regions of the trigeminal nucleus (pars interpolaris, rostral subdivision) and innervate the PO nucleus. Thus, our retrograde tracer injections in the PO resulted in labeling in the trigeminal nucleus, but not in the cuneate nucleus. The PRV labeling using L5A neurons in hand S1 as starter neurons labeled the PO, but also did not lead to additional labeling in the cuneate. Thus, for the hand-related pathways, and in contrast to cuneo-PO projections described in other species such as the cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berkley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loutit et al., 2021</xref>), we did not identify a clear cuneo-PO counterpart to the trigemino-PO circuit in the whisker-related paralemniscal pathway. Although ascending subcortical sources of input to hand-related PO neurons in the mouse remain to be identified, descending cortical axons from hand S1 target a subregion of PO, strongly exciting recurrently projecting PO neurons there to form cortico-thalamo-cortical loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Thalamocortical and corticocortical connections</title><p>The pattern of VPL connectivity to excitatory neurons in hand S1, marked by a strong bias toward L4 neurons, matched the anatomical pattern of axon branching, and accords generally with prior results in whisker-related pathways and core-type thalamocortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cruikshank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik and Naka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>).

The VPL input was moderately strong to L2/3 and L5A neurons, but weak or absent to corticospinal neurons. The pattern of PO inputs was distinct insofar as input was strong to L5A and weak to L4 neurons, but also similar in that input was again weak or absent to corticospinal neurons. These findings resemble prior findings for VPM and PO input to neurons in whisker S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bureau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audette et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>). Thus for both thalamocortical projections to hand S1, the major targets are intratelencephalic-type neurons in the upper and middle layers.</p><p>Although we found evidence for direct, monosynaptic corticocortical continuation of the transcortical circuit in the form of VPL inputs to L2/3<sup>M1-proj</sup> and L5A<sup>M1-proj</sup> neurons, these connections were only moderately strong and often much weaker than the inputs to L4 neurons. Strong local L4→L2/3 connectivity has been demonstrated in hand-related S1 of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamawaki et al., 2014</xref>), implying that the disynaptic VPL→L4→L2/3<sup>M1-proj</sup> circuit is a major route for excitatory signaling along the transcortical VPL→S1→M1 pathway. The S1→M1 corticocortical pathway originates mainly from L2/3<sup>M1-proj</sup> and L5A<sup>M1-proj</sup> neurons in S1. The axons of these neurons project to upper layers of M1 and innervate L2/3 neurons in particular, with notably scarce/weak connectivity to other types of neurons including corticospinal neurons. However, corticospinal neurons in forelimb M1 of the mouse receive particularly strong local excitatory input from L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the present findings, together with prior circuit-mapping results, imply that local L2/3 neurons in M1 are the critical penultimate excitatory link in this transcortical circuit, postsynaptic to S1 corticocortical axons and presynaptic to M1 corticospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A similar organization is implied for S1 corticospinal neurons, except that their L2/3 inputs can arise locally without intervening corticocortical circuits, as indicated by recent anatomical tracing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frezel et al., 2020</xref>). It is important to note that while we emphasize here the mono- and disynaptic connections along the feedforward circuits, recurrent connections within and across cell classes in the circuit presumably generate complex, polysynaptically propagating activity patterns in vivo.</p><p>The overall thalamocortical-corticocortical circuit architecture in many ways closely resembles the corresponding whisker-related S1→M1 circuits, which have mostly been studied piece-wise but also involve the concatenation of excitatory connections. These include connections from VPM neurons mainly to L4 neurons in S1, from those mainly to L2/3 and other local neurons in S1, and from those to mainly L2/3 neurons in M1, which excite local L5B neurons including pyramidal-tract type neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farkas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoffer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aronoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>). One apparent difference in the hand-related circuits (in addition to the apparent lack of an ascending paralemniscal pathway to PO, discussed above) is that VPL inputs are notably weak to corticospinal neurons, representing a major subtype of pyramidal-tract type neurons in L5B, whereas VPM inputs to L5B neurons in whisker S1 appear relatively stronger and are implicated in early cortical processing of somatosensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egger et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Transcortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits</title><p>A recent analysis of the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit organization of hand-related S1 in the mouse indicates that these circuits tend to form strongly recurrent loops, with cortical axons strongly exciting recurrently projecting thalamocortical neurons in both VPL and PO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). The present findings carry implications for understanding how transcortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits intersect and interconnect, pointing to specific cell types and their connections whereby feedforward transcortical circuits are selectively integrated with recurrent loops between cortex and thalamus. As alluded to above, both the VPL and PO connections to S1 neurons were overwhelmingly biased toward neurons in layers 2/3, 4, and 5A, including M1-projecting corticocortical neurons in L2/3 and L5A. These neurons are all members of the broad class of intratelencephalic type neurons. In contrast, the thalamus-projecting neurons we recorded from in L5B and L6, representing subtypes of pyramidal-tract and corticothalamic type projection neurons, respectively, generally received little or no direct excitatory input from either thalamic nucleus, broadly consistent with previous findings in forelimb M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>) and whisker S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crandall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frandolig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, their input likely includes strong local excitation from intratelencephalic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). Thus, the available evidence suggests that the feedforward thalamocortical circuits largely avoid direct innervation of thalamus-projecting neurons and instead engage mainly intratelencephalic type neurons, including subtypes involved either mainly in local excitatory circuits (L4 neurons) or in both local and corticocortical circuits (L2/3, L5A neurons). Particularly striking in this regard is the strong bias of PO inputs to L5A neurons, including L5A<sup>M1-proj</sup> neurons, which thus appear as common elements shared by recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, local excitatory networks, and corticocortical circuits in the transcortical circuit. Another way to conceptualize this network is as an extended set of intersecting and selectively interconnecting looping circuits, within which the feedforward circuits constituting the transcortical circuit are fully embedded. This perspective dovetails with emerging concepts about the crucial role of looped circuit architecture for sensorimotor control of the forelimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bizzi and Ajemian, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Comparing hand- and whisker-related transcortical circuits</title><p>Having made comparisons to the counterpart vibrissal somatosensory circuits along the way, here we highlight several key points. The overall picture to emerge is one of similarity. Both systems are, after all, part of the lemniscal pathway, the main ascending somatosensory system for tactile sensation: cuneo-VPL-cortical for the forelimb and trigemino-VPM-cortical for the vibrissae. The patterns of excitatory connections for the hand-related circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) generally resemble those known for vibrissal circuits, both for the lemniscal VPM/VPL-related pathways and also the paralemniscal PO-related pathways (see references listed above; for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik and Naka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staiger and Petersen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shepherd and Yamawaki, 2021</xref>). As also noted earlier, a possible difference in the hand-related circuits is the notably weak-to-absent VPL input to corticospinal neurons, contrasting with evidence suggesting relatively stronger VPM input to similar neurons in vibrissal S1 (thick-tufted L5B pyramidal-tract type neurons; see references above). However, such comparisons must be tempered by various considerations including the possibility of basic differences in cellular composition and other properties of the two cortical areas; for example, vibrissal S1 and M1 are largely devoid corticospinal neurons. On the other hand, for the relatively short-distance corticocortical circuits studied here, it is striking that they adhere to the same pattern of targeting upper-layer neurons previously observed in the vibrissal S1-to-M1 projection, despite the greater distances bridged by the inter-areal projections in that pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). Whether these conserved features of transcortical circuit connectivity hold for other somatosensory pathways as well (e.g. hindlimb, trunk, tongue) seems likely, a prediction that can be tested using similar approaches for cellular circuit analysis as applied here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Functional implications</title><p>The highly polysynaptic nature of the circuit organization at the cortical level suggests many possibilities for cellular mechanisms that may regulate and modulate the flow of excitation through the loop. These include inhibitory mechanisms, such as particular types of interneurons activated by these circuits; for example, ‘bottom-up’ feedforward inhibition through S1 activation of fast spiking interneurons in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murray and Keller, 2011</xref>), and ‘top-down’ disinhibition through M1 activation of VIP<sup>+ </sup>and somatostatin<sup>+</sup>interneurons in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, an essential aspect of the concept of the transcortical pathway is that it is represents a key interface for integration of somatosensory, motor, and cognitive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conrad and Meyer-Lohmann, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evarts and Fromm, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evarts et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pruszynski and Scott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>). Perhaps the dense incorporation of multiple types of IT neurons into this circuit increases its computational power by providing an expanded array of targets by which local and long-range inputs from diverse sources can modulate excitatory feedforward signaling along the connections feeding into M1 corticospinal neurons. Whereas this study focused on lemnisco-cortical pathways, which chiefly mediate forelimb tactile processing, an important related area for future research is the circuit organization of cuneo-cerebello-cortical pathways, which mediate forelimb proprioceptive processing and are also integrated and modulated at the cortical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jörntell and Ekerot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loutit et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>). With the many tools now available in mice for in vivo monitoring and modulation of specific cell types, the challenge will be to prioritize which cells and circuits to investigate in which behavioral paradigms. The characterization provided here of excitatory cell-type-specific connections in the somatosensory-to-motor transcortical circuit for the mouse’s hand presents a framework for targeted investigation of how this circuit organization supports specific aspects of sensorimotor integration and forelimb tactile sensory perception and motor control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Wild-type C57BL/6</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>#000664; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Scnn1a-Cre or B6;C3-Tg(Scnn1a-cre)3Aibs/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td>#009613; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:009613">IMSR_JAX:009613</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Txl3-Cre or B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Tlx3-cre)PL56Gsat/Mmucd</td><td>MMRRC; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td>#041158-UCD; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_041158-UCD">MMRRC_041158-UCD</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>CaMKII-Cre or B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-Cre)T29-1Stl/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>)</td><td>#005359; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005359">IMSR_JAX:005359</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai14 or B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup>/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td>#007914; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ai96 or B6J.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm96(CAG-GCaMP6s)Hze</sup>/MwarJ</td><td>Jackson Laboratory; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td>#028866; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:028866">IMSR_JAX:028866</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV-ChR2-mCherry or AAV1.CamKIIa.hChR2(E123T/T159C).mCherry.WPRE.hGH</td><td>Addgene</td><td>#35512; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_35512">Addgene_35512</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV-ChR2-Venus or AAV1.CAG.ChR2-Venus.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Addgene</td><td>#35509; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_35509">Addgene_35509</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV-hSyn-Cre or AAV1.hSyn.Cre.WPRE.hGH</td><td>Addgene</td><td>#35509; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_35509">Addgene_35509</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAVretro-GFP or AAV-CAG-GFP</td><td>Addgene</td><td>#37825; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_37825">Addgene_37825</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAVretro-tdTomato or AAV-CAG-tdTomato</td><td>Addgene</td><td>#59462; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_59462">Addgene_59462</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>PRV-EGFP or PRV-152</td><td>CNNV; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu">http://www.cnnv.pitt.edu</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>PRV-Introvert-GFP</td><td>J.

Craniotomies were opened over the injection targets in the right hemisphere. Laminectomies were performed in the case of spinal injections at cervical level 6 (C6). Injection pipettes, fabricated from glass capillary micropipettes and beveled to a sharp edge, were loaded with virus or tracer solution by tip-filling and advanced to reach the stereotaxic target; injection volumes were 40–100 nL. Animals were post-operatively covered with analgesic (1.5 mg/kg meloxicam subcutaneously once every 24 hr for 2 days).</p><p>To determine optimal coordinates for the various anatomical structures targeted for injections in this study, we used standard atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong, 2008</xref>) as a starting point, and refined the targeting based on retrograde and anterograde labeling patterns. For example, for cuneate injections, based on retrograde labeling from VPL, we used coordinates of (in mm) anteroposterior (AP) –7.5 to –8.0, mediolateral (ML) +1.0 to+1.2, and dorsoventral depth (Z) –3.0 to –3.4. For thalamic injections, based on anterograde labeling from the cuneate and retrograde labeling from S1, we used coordinates for VPL of AP –1.9, ML +2.0, Z –3.7; and, for PO, AP –1.9, ML +1.2, Z –3.3. Based on a series of characterizations (described in the Results), forelimb S1 coordinates were AP 0.0, ML +2.4, Z –0.2 to –0.9 for D5, and AP +0.2, ML +2.7, Z –0.2 to –0.9 for D2; forelimb M1 coordinates were AP 0.0, ML +1.5, Z –0.2 to –0.9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>PRV tracing</title><p>PRV injections were performed largely as described above, with minor modifications. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with ketamine (80–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–15 mg/kg). Three to five days (as indicated) after injection of PRV (10 nL), animals underwent intracardial perfusion-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The brain and spinal cord were harvested, cryosectioned (0.1 mm), and processed for immunohistochemical visualization of fluorescence labeling, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamawaki et al., 2019</xref>). To control for nonspecific spread of the virus, we injected the Cre-dependent PRV-Introvert-GFP into the cortex of wild-type mice; no labeling was observed, consistent with the original characterization of this improved version of Cre-dependent PRV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pomeranz et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cortical flat-mounts</title><p>Scnn1a-Cre;Ai14 mice, previously injected in the left C6 with AAVretro-GFP, were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS, and the brain was extracted and cut in half along the midline. The cortex in the right hemisphere was dissected free from the underlying white and gray matter structures, and the medial bank was gently unfolded to partially flatten the cortex. The tissue was placed in dish filled with PFA (4% in PBS), and gently compressed under a weighted glass slide overnight. The tissue was washed with PBS and sectioned to remove the upper and lower cortical layers, leaving a ~0.4 mm thick slice containing L4 and L5. The flattened slice was mounted on a slide and imaged on an epifluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Somatosensory mapping</title><p>Transcranial fluorescence imaging of somatosensory responses was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), with several modifications. Briefly, after undergoing head-post mounting surgery, mice were injected with ketamine (80–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–15 mg/kg) and head-fixed under an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a blue LED (M470L2, Thorlabs), low-power objective lens (Olympus, XLFluor 2x/340, N/A 0.14), and monochrome camera (2048 × 1536 pixels, FS-U3-32S4M-C, FLIR Systems). The apparatus was mounted on a vibration isolation table and covered during experiments by a black enclosure.</p><p>Mice expressing GCaMP6s in L4 neurons of S1 (Scnn1a-Cre;Ai96) were used in experiments involving stimulation of different digits of the hand, and mice expressing GCaMP6s in all cortical excitatory neurons (CaMKII-Cre;Ai96) were used in experiments comparing hand and other body part representations. The stimulator consisted of a plastic probe affixed to a piezoelectric bimorph wafer (SMBA4510T05M, Steiner and Martin), controlled by linear driver (EPA-007–012, Piezo Systems). For stimulation of single digits, a thin metal probe (⌀~0.5 mm, fashioned from a 27G needle by blunting its tip) was affixed to the plastic probe, and its tip was brought into position, just next to the digit (D2 or D5). For stimulation of different body parts, the plastic probe tip was positioned just next to, without contacting, the left hand (glabrous skin), hindpaw (glabrous skin), or lower jaw (hairy skin). Trials consisted of 5 s blue LED illumination, 4 s image acquisition (2 × 2 binning, 40 ms exposure, 17.4 dB, 20 fps), and 1 s stimulation (20 Hz sinusoidal command signal). Image acquisition and tactile stimulation began 1 and 3 s after LED onset, respectively. Stimulation trials were interleaved with no-stimulation trials (no command signal to the bimorph driver), and repeated 30 times (3 s inter-trial interval). Stimulus delivery and image acquisition were controlled by WaveSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wavesurfer.janelia.org/">wavesurfer.janelia.org</ext-link>) through an NI USB-6229 data acquisition board (National Instruments). During the experiment, the mouse was thermally supported with feedback-controlled heating pad (Warner instrument). Bright-field images of the cranium were used to identify bregma. In some experiments with Scnn1a-Cre;Ai96 mice, spinal injections at C6 with AAVretro-tdTomato enabled imaging of corticospinal labeling as well.</p><p>For off-line data analysis, each frame was spatially binned by 8, and pre-stimulus baseline (20 frames) were averaged and subtracted from each frame to create ΔF/F images for each trial. Data for ‘stimulation’ and ‘no stimulation’ trials were grouped and averaged, and sensory maps were constructed by calculating the average value in the stimulus time window (20 frames) during stimulus trials and subtracting from this the corresponding average value in the same time window during ‘no stimulation’ trials. For the display, the maps from each animal were normalized, bregma aligned, averaged, and median filtered with a kernel of 5 × 5 pixels. Contours and centroids of responses were determined using ‘regionprops’ and other standard functions in Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Circuit analysis</title><p>Methods for slice-based optogenetic-electrophysiological circuit analysis have been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamawaki et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, mice that had undergone in vivo labeling were euthanized by isoflurane overdose and decapitation, and brains were rapidly removed and placed in chilled cutting solution (in mM: 110 choline chloride, 11.6 sodium L-ascorbate, 3.1 pyruvic acid, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Coronal slices (0.3 mm for cortex and 0.25 mm for thalamus) were cut (VT1200S; Leica) in chilled cutting solution, transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 127 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>), incubated at 34 °C for 30 min, and kept at 22 °C for at least 1 hr prior to recording. Slices were placed in the recording chamber (perfused with ACSF at 32 °C) of a microscope equipped for whole-cell electrophysiology, photostimulation, and fluorescence microscopy. Ephus software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/ephus/Ephus">http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/ephus/Ephus</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suter et al., 2010</xref>) was used for hardware control and data acquisition. Recordings (serial resistance &lt;40 MΩ) in voltage-clamp mode were made using borosilicate pipettes filled with cesium-based internal solution, composed of (in mM): 128 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.4 GTP, three ascorbate, 1 EGTA, 1 QX314; 4 mg/ml biocytin; pH 7.25, 290–295 mOsm. The sodium channel blocker QX-314 was included to prevent action potentials. Cortical recordings were made with TTX (1 µM) and 4-AP (100 µM) added to the ACSF, to isolate monosynaptic responses by blocking action potentials and thus polysynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). These were omitted in thalamic recordings, where disynaptic responses were not a concern.</p><p>Wide-field photostimulation was performed using a low-power objective lens (4×) and a blue LED (M470L2; Thorlabs) driven by a TTL pulse to generate a 5 ms stimulus, with the LED intensity controller set to deliver 1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the level of the specimen. For each cell, photostimulation trials were repeated several times at an inter-stimulus interval of 30 s, while recording in voltage-clamp mode with the command potential set to –70 mV. To quantify evoked synaptic responses, for each cell the traces from several (generally three) trial repetitions were averaged, and the response amplitude was calculated as the mean over a post-stimulus interval of 50 ms. Sequential recordings of multiple neurons were made for each slice. Data were compared by pooling across slices and animals, and pairwise comparisons were made using the absolute or normalized response amplitudes, as indicated in the text.</p><p>To test short-term synaptic plasticity, repetitive stimulation was performed by delivering short trains of photostimuli at 100 ms inter-stimulus interval. We initially attempted to use a laser-based approach but were limited by difficulty in activating axons at a location sufficiently far away from the recorded neuron, and therefore resorted to wide-field LED-based repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>). The response ratios were calculated based on the EPSC peak amplitudes, calculated by averaging five points around the peak responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Multiple animals were used per experiment, and results were analyzed by pooling across animals and/or by averaging per animal, as indicated in the Results. Group comparisons were made using non-parametric tests as indicated in the text, with significance defined as p&lt;0.05. For two-group comparisons, the rank-sum test was used for unpaired data and the sign test for paired data. To compare three or more groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. For group data, medians and median average deviations (m.a.d.) were calculated as descriptive statistical measures of central tendency and dispersion, except for ratios, for which geometric means and standard factors were calculated. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, which are similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). Statistical analyses were conducted using standard Matlab (Mathworks) functions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Barrett and Yutaka Yoshida for comments and suggestions, Frances Hausmann for technical assistance, and, for provision of PRV viruses, Jeffrey Friedman (Rockefeller), Oliver Huang (Princeton), Lisa Pomeranz (Rockefeller), and the Center for Neuroanatomy with Neurotropic Viruses (CNNV, University of Pittsburgh).

The mouse has emerged as a model for better understanding the circuitry underlying sensorimotor integration. Here, Yamawaki et al report results regarding the synaptic organization of ascending sensory pathways related to mouse forelimb somatosensory and motor cortex, shedding light on the circuits involved in limb sensorimotor integration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Circuit organization of the excitatory sensorimotor loop through hand/forelimb S1 and M1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Barry Connors (Reviewer #2); Yutaka Yoshida (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>PRV tracing data:</p><p>If there is a principled relationship between time and the number of transsynaptic jumps, why are cortical neurons presynaptic to layer 4 (L4) neurons not seen after 72 hours incubation when presynaptic neurons in VPL are seen? Are some of the Cre expressing L4 neurons at 72 hours presynaptic to other infected L4 neurons or are they primary infections? And at 48 hours, are only L4 neurons labeled or also VPL neurons? In addition, in Figure 2D, the PRV labeling seems to be all layers in the S1. If starter (first order) neurons are detected in L4 48 hours after the infection, second order neurons would be detected 72 hours as shown in Figure 2B (VPL) and 3rd order neurons would be detected 96 hours after the infection. It is not clear that the labeling in the cortex and other brain regions is consistent with the time-course. How could synapse type or synapse number from a particular source affect these data and the interpretation? These issues should be placed in additional context in the Results and addressed in a revised Discussion.</p><p>Relatedly, how specific to Cre-expressing neurons is the PRV-invert-GFP labeling? It is hard to assess with the small example image in Figure 2B and the qualitative description of the control experiments in Cre- mice. Adding some quantification of these control experiments and higher magnification example images from Cre+ and Cre- mice would be helpful.</p><p>Finally, if the incubation goes even longer than 4 days, do labeled cells appear in PO?</p><p>Specification of tracers used:</p><p>The experiment in Figure 3, for example, used an anterograde tracer, but the type of tracer is never specified in the text or legend. Specifying precisely which retrograde tracers were used in which experiments in each figure would be helpful. If different combinations of tracers were used in an experiment, please specify which combinations contributed to which data.</p><p>In addition, it is difficult to discriminate the overlapping blue and green tracers in Figure 3F (right). Could something facilitate this discrimination such as adding a thin white line bordering the blue retrograde tracer (which seems to be a much smaller area than the green antero)?</p><p>Layer 4 cell types:</p><p>The experiment in Figure 4 is impressive, using multiple retrograde and anterograde viral tracers to selectively and transneuronally express ChR2 in cuneate-recipient VPL cells to dissect the concatenating Cun-VPL-S1 circuit. The presentation did raise a few questions.</p><p>First, the neurons in L4 are a mix of spiny excitatory cells and inhibitory interneurons, and in this experiment no genetic markers were used to tell them apart. In many thalamocortical projections (including VPM-to-L4 cells of S1) the inputs to PV interneurons are much stronger than those to spiny cells. Was any attempt made in this experiment to distinguish the neuronal types? If the cortical neurons were voltage-clamped with Cs-based solutions here, and spikes were blocked with TTX and QX-314, could that be clarified in the Methods (line 618) and Results?

In this study, Yamawaki et al. focus on the excitatory circuit organization of the lemnisco-cortical and corticocortical pathways which are important for the sensory-guided limb and hand control. To dissect those circuits, authors use sophisticated and combined techniques such as optogenetics, retrograde and anterograde AAVs, trans-synaptic viruses, electrophysiology, and mouse genetics.

Are some of the Cre expressing L4 neurons at 72 hours presynaptic to other infected L4 neurons or are they primary infections? And at 48 hours, are only L4 neurons labeled or also VPL neurons? In addition, in Figure 2D, the PRV labeling seems to be all layers in the S1. If starter (first order) neurons are detected in L4 48 hours after the infection, second order neurons would be detected 72 hours as shown in Figure 2B (VPL) and 3rd order neurons would be detected 96 hours after the infection. It is not clear that the labeling in the cortex and other brain regions is consistent with the time-course. How could synapse type or synapse number from a particular source affect these data and the interpretation? These issues should be placed in additional context in the Results and addressed in a revised Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points and we have modified both the Results and Discussion sections to further address them. We do not have answers to all these questions. While in theory there may be a “principled relationship”, in practice there are multiple factors contributing to variability in the timing and extent of labeling. This limitation would certainly have been a major and indeed insurmountable problem had our purpose been to characterize the <italic>cortical</italic> labeling, because intracortical connectivity would have precluded accurate determination of synaptic order. But our only purpose was to label the ascending pathway from the cuneate. Because this is an essentially unidirectional pathway there is little cause for ambiguity about the synaptic order despite polysynaptic propagation and the possibility of variability in timing and other factors. We now make even more explicit some of the key limitations of the technique and how they do or don’t affect our results. We emphasize that the viral labeling was not taken as definitive proof of circuit connections, but provided a framework/starting-point for the subsequent detailed quantitative electrophysiology-based circuit analysis that constitutes the bulk of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, how specific to Cre-expressing neurons is the PRV-invert-GFP labeling? It is hard to assess with the small example image in Figure 2B and the qualitative description of the control experiments in Cre- mice. Adding some quantification of these control experiments and higher magnification example images from Cre+ and Cre- mice would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we now show the images in an enlarged format in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and have indicated the number of animals (n = 2). The sectioned material we have for these control experiments is unfortunately not ideal for accurately counting labeled neurons, but there were none that could be identified in the Cre-negative animals, whereas there were large numbers (tens to hundreds) in the Cre-positive animals. We note that the PRV-Introvert was generated by Pomeranz et al. (2017) based on a FLEx switch design, a non-leaky construct in wide use in Cre-dependent AAVs as well. We use the same PRV-Introvert as in the original paper by Pomeranz et al. They showed that this virus is essentially 100% Cre-dependent using multiple assays (gene expression, animal survival, etc.). Multiple subsequent studies have also confirmed the nonleakiness of Cre in this virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, if the incubation goes even longer than 4 days, do labeled cells appear in PO?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried this, but encountered two related problems: the mice began to showing behavioral abnormalities (e.g., tremor, turning), and the extensive neuronal labeling at this point in cortex and thalamus made it difficult to interpret the labeling patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specification of tracers used:</p><p>The experiment in Figure 3, for example, used an anterograde tracer, but the type of tracer is never specified in the text or legend.
