tightly controlled by RhoGTPases, actin binding-proteins and nucleation-promoting factors to perform fundamental cellular functions. We have previously shown that ERK3, an atypical MAPK, controls IL-8 production and chemotaxis (Bogueka et al., 2020). Here, we show in human cells that ERK3 directly acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC42 and phosphorylates the ARP3 subunit of the ARP2/3 complex at S418 to promote filopodia formation and actin polymerization, respectively. Consistently, depletion of ERK3 prevented both basal and EGF-dependent RAC1 and CDC42 activation, maintenance of F-actin content, filopodia formation, and epithelial cell migration. Further, ERK3 protein bound directly to the purified ARP2/3 complex and augmented polymerization of actin in vitro. ERK3 kinase activity was required for the formation of actin-rich protrusions in mammalian cells. These findings unveil a fundamentally unique pathway employed by cells to control actin-dependent cellular functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERK3</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd><kwd>RhoGTPases</kwd><kwd>actin polymerization</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3</kwd><kwd>cell shape /migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003042</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUN-MAPK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogucka-Janczi</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Harms</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1292/TP05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogucka-Janczi</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name><name><surname>Rajalingam</surname><given-names>Krishnaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ERK3 controls actin cytoskeleton.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins with over 95% homology among all isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vandekerckhove and Weber, 1979</xref>).

The cytoplasmic actin network constitutes an important part of the cytoskeleton, which not only mechanically supports the plasma membrane and gives the cell its shape, but fulfills a variety of other functions: It regulates velocity and directionality of cell migration, enables intracellular signaling and transport, supports cell division, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamaguchi and Condeelis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">dos Remedios et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, by branching and bundling of F-actin filaments the actin cytoskeleton can form unique structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia, which in epithelial cells regulate cell polarization and are crucial for the contact with their environment, while in other cell types these actin rich structures control motility, chemotaxis, and haptotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Raich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khurana and George, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahri et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To perform its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton must be able to rapidly remodel in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Innocenti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bugyi and Carlier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</xref>).

Two models of the filopodia initiation emerged, where ARP2/3 and formins are thought to be involved in the ‘convergent elongation’ and ‘tip nucleation’ model, respectively. However, the proposed models are not mutually exclusive and filopodia formation could engage both ARP2/3 and formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang and Svitkina, 2011</xref>).

The structural and biochemical properties of the ARP2/3 complex have been intensively studied in vitro, and apart from ATP, its activation relies on binding to pre-formed actin filament and nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pizarro-Cerdá et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nolen and Pollard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Espinoza-Sanchez et al., 2018</xref>). The main regulators of the ARP2/3 complex belong to the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family proteins, including WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yarar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Higgs et al., 1999</xref>). WASP and WAVE proteins serve as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and RhoGTPases via direct and intermediate binding to cell division control 42 (CDC42) and Ras-related C3 botulin toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlier et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The small RhoGTPases belong to the Ras homologous (Rho) superfamily of GTP-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hodge and Ridley, 2016</xref>).

Its physiological roles are tissue-specific and can be both dependent and independent of its catalytic activity: kinase-dependent roles of ERK3 include promoting lung cancer cell migration and invasion, while its function in the regulation of breast cancer cell morphology and migration is shown to be partially kinase-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Mahdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogucka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogucka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elkhadragy et al., 2020</xref>).

Although the specific signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of ERK3 have been studied by us and others and provided tissue-specific insights into this atypical MAPK function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogucka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elkhadragy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">El Merahbi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elkhadragy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Long et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sauma and Friedman, 1996</xref>), many aspects of ERK3 biology such as its role in suppressing melanoma cell growth and invasiveness remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). It is, however, known that ERK3 possesses a single phosphorylation site at serine 189 (S189) within S-E-G activation motif, located in its kinase domain, which was shown to be phosphorylated by group I p-21-activated kinases (PAKs), the direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Déléris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De la Mota-Peynado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coulombe and Meloche, 2007</xref>).</p><p>ERK3 signaling is required for the motility and migration of different cancer cells, yet its direct role in the regulation of the polarized phenotype of the cells and actin cytoskeleton is lacking. Here, we unveil a multilayered role for ERK3 in regulating actin filament assembly. We demonstrate that ERK3 controls bundling of actin filaments into filopodia via activation of CDC42. Mechanistically, ERK3 directly binds to RAC1 and CDC42 in a nucleotide-independent manner and is required for the activity of both RhoGTPases in vivo. Furthermore, ERK3 could function as a direct GEF for CDC42 in vitro. In addition, ERK3 stimulates ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization and maintains F-actin abundance in cells via direct binding and phosphorylation of the ARP3 subunit at S418. While the kinase activity is not required for CDC42 activation, RAC1 activity partially depends on ERK3 kinase function. The in vivo relevance of these ERK3 functions was corroborated by analyses of the motility of tumor cells in orthotopic mammary tumors grown in mice. Together, our results establish a hitherto unknown regulatory pathway directly controlled by ERK3 involving the major signaling molecules CDC42, RAC1, and ARP2/3 in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ERK3 is required for motility of mammary epithelial cells</title><p>ERK3 has been shown to regulate mammary epithelial cancer cell migration and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Mahdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogucka et al., 2020</xref>). To uncover the molecular underpinnings of the role of ERK3 in cell migration, we investigated the intracellular localization of ERK3 by immunocytochemical analyses using a validated antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogucka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogucka et al., 2020</xref>). Endogenous ERK3 co-localized to the F-actin-rich protrusions in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Reorganization of actin protrusions at the leading edge of the cells initiates cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamaguchi and Condeelis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter and Weijer, 2005</xref>); therefore, we further analyzed the significance of ERK3 in cancer cell motility by loss-of-function studies. Depletion of ERK3 reduced speed and displacement length (distance between the start point and the end position of the cell along each axis) of MDA-MB231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>).

Interestingly, knockdown of ERK3 significantly attenuated the EGF-induced chemotaxis of both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>, respectively).</p><p>Considering that ERK3 participated in EGF-mediated chemotactic responses of both primary and oncogenic mammary epithelial cells, we tested ERK3 protein kinetics in response to the growth factor. EGF induced serine 189 (S189) phosphorylation of ERK3 at early time points in primary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>) and MDA-MB231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). A slight increase in ERK3 protein levels was detected in HMECs upon EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Further cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments coupled with RT-PCR analyses suggested that EGF treatment did not increase ERK3 protein half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–2H</xref>). Taken together, these data confirmed that ERK3 was activated in response to EGF and required for EGF-mediated directional migration of epithelial cells. We then investigated the significance of S189 phosphorylation of ERK3 on F-actin and formation of actin-rich protrusions. ERK3-depleted HMECs cells (shERK3 – 3′ UTR) presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were transfected with V5-tagged ERK3 wild type (ERK3 WT) or S189 mutants (ERK3 S189A/ERK3 S189D) and expression of exogenous ERK3 was visualized by V5-tag staining. Co-staining of the cells with phalloidin green did not show any significant differences in F-actin organization upon the overexpression of the S189 phosphorylation mutants compared to the wild type ERK3 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, we observed that exogenous ERK3 localized predominantly in the cytosol compared to the endogenous ERK3, which we detected at the cell edges and F-actin rich protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

ERK3 knockdown significantly decreased the levels of both basal and EGF-induced GTP-bound CDC42 and RAC1 in primary (HMEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D, and F</xref>) and triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E, and G</xref>), respectively. HMECs were cultured in growth factor/hormone-enriched medium that also contained EGF. Therefore, we withdrew the supplements to test the effect of EGF alone on the activity of RAC1 and CDC42 in these cells and compared the responses with those of the cancer cells. Interestingly, we detected high RAC1 and CDC42 levels at steady state in HMEC cells, which underwent a rapid activation-inactivation cycle after starvation and restimulation with EGF alone. The inhibitory effect of ERK3 knockdown on RAC1 was not as striking as with CDC42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). Intriguingly, we could observe co-precipitation of ERK3 protein with the active RhoGTPases at endogenous levels, suggesting that these proteins exist in a multimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We expanded these analyses to different cell types and consistently found that depletion of ERK3 reduced the activity of RAC1 and CDC42 and that the active RhoGTPases specifically co-precipitated endogenous ERK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).

Next, we tested whether the kinase domain of ERK3 (amino acids [aa] 9–327) would be sufficient for this interaction.

The process involves ARP2/3 complex, WASP (VCA) as nucleation promoting factor, filamentous actin (F-actin), and monomeric actin (G-actin). In the initial step, CDC42 is activated by GEF-catalyzed exchange of GDP to GTP. Active CDC42 (CDC42-GTP) binds to the GTP-binding domain (GBD) on WASP, thereby displacing the VCA domain. While the V-verpolin-like motif binds actin monomer (G-actin), C-central and A-acidic domains bind and activate the ARP2/3 complex. Conformational changes induced by the binding of the ARP2/3 complex promote its binding to the actin filament, which is strengthened by the additional interaction of the ARP2/3 complex with WASP (VCA)-G-actin. Further conformational changes will secure the ARP2/3 complex on the filament and allow its binding to the actin monomer and the polymerization of the newly nucleated filament. Actin polymerizes at the fast-growing/barbed end, elongating toward the plasma membrane and the ARP2/3 complex would cross-link newly polymerizing filament to the existing filament.

Consistent with the reduction in active RAC1 and CDC42 levels, we observed that knockdown of ERK3 by CRISPR/Cas9 or with si/shRNAs led to a reduction in F-actin staining in mammary epithelial cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>. To further quantify these effects and corroborate the role of ERK3 in polymerization of actin filaments, we evaluated the ratio of cytoskeleton-incorporated filamentous (F-) and globular/monomeric actin (G-actin) in control and ERK3-depleted mammary epithelial cells by ultracentrifugation. Knockdown of ERK3 significantly shifted total F-actin to G-actin in both primary HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) and MDA-MB231 cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

To determine whether ERK3 had any direct effect on the assembly of actin filaments, we used a pyrene-actin polymerization assay to monitor fluorescence kinetics over time as the actin filaments assembled in the presence of the purified ARP2/3 complex. We used the VCA domain of WASP protein as a positive control. Indeed, recombinant ERK3 stimulated ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization at a nanomolar concentration (5 nM) in the presence of 10 nM of the ARP2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, the nucleation-promoting activity of ERK3 was comparable to WASP (VCA), a well-known NPF. ERK3 protein alone did not exert any stimulatory effect on actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data suggest that ERK3 could function as nucleation promoting factor that stimulates ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Additionally, we measured the effect of having both ERK3 and WASP (VCA) present on ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Using the same concentration as for the initial screening (ERK3 4.8 nM and WASP [VCA] at 400 nM), we did not detect any additive effect when both proteins were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Structural modeling has suggested that although ARP2 and ARP3 interact with each other in the inactive conformation, they are not in the right configuration to act as a seed for actin nucleation. After activation by NPF binding, the heterodimer mimics two actin subunits. Binding of an actin monomer then initiates the formation of the actin nucleus and the polymerization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gournier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kelleher et al., 1995</xref>). Extensive characterization of the individual subunits also revealed that ARP3 is crucial for the stimulation and activity of the ARP2/3 complex and nucleation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gournier et al., 2001</xref>). Considering that ARP3 is a structural component regulating the nucleating properties of the ARP2/3 complex, we further determined whether ERK3 can directly bind to ARP3. Through GST pull-down experiments with purified recombinant proteins, we could indeed detect a concentration-dependent direct binding between full-length ERK3 and ARP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results were further confirmed with ELISA analyses suggesting a high-affinity binding between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The ERK3 kinase domain binds also directly to the Arp3 protein, albeit with low affinity in comparison to the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we also detected ERK3 co-precipitating with ARP3 and ARP2 in HMECs at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>ERK3 phosphorylates ARP3 at S418</title><p>Conformational changes activating ARP2/3 are induced by binding to NPFs, actin, and ATP.

Most of the studies focused on phosphorylation of the ARP2 subunit, which induced the conformational repositioning of this subunit toward ARP3, further allowing binding of NPFs and full activation of the ARP2/3 complex leading to the formation of the ARP2-ARP3 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narayanan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LeClaire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2013</xref>).

Since ERK3 is a kinase, we assessed phosphorylation of the ARP2/3 complex by ERK3 by employing in vitro kinase assays and subsequent analysis of phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry. Initial analyses detected phosphorylation of the ARP3 subunit at serine 418 (S418) (peptide sequence: HNPVFGVM<bold>S,</bold> please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We further validated the significance of the detected phosphorylation in vivo by overexpressing the non-phosphorylatable (S418A) and phospho-mimicking (S418D) mutants of ARP3 in primary mammary epithelial cells and analyzing the cell morphology and F-actin abundance. Cells transduced with wild type (WT) ARP3 or empty vector (EV) were used as reference controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We were able to validate the phosphorylation of ARP3 at Ser418 in ARP3-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and detect a decrease in the S418 phosphorylation in ERK3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and in the kinase dead (KD) ERK3-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of note, we observed that expression of exogenous ARP3 reduced the protein levels of the endogenous ARP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), possibly due to disruption of the protein complex, thereby affecting the stability of the endogenous proteins. Strikingly, expression of the phosphorylation-mimicking ARP3 mutant (S418D) under these settings predominantly induced actin filament formation, as indicated by the intense phalloidin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and enhanced the F/G-actin ratio in primary mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). Moreover, S418D-overexpressing cells exhibited F-actin-rich protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, lower panel). In contrast, most of the S418A-expressing cells were smaller in size and had a round morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, upper panel). Quantification of the F-actin levels revealed that despite the morphological distortion, cells expressing non-phosphorylatable ARP3 (ARP3 S418A) had no significant effect on overall F-actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). To further determine the relevance of the S418 phosphorylation in ERK3-regulated ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization in cells, we depleted ERK3 in the ARP3 S418D-overexpressing HMECs using shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). Knockdown of ERK3 led to a significant reduction of the F-actin levels in the ARP3 S418D-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). These data suggested that although phosphorylation at S418 of ARP3 promoted actin polymerization and thus the F-actin content it is not absolutely essential like ERK3. A concomitant active RAC1/CDC42 pull-down revealed a significant decrease in RAC1 activity, with almost no effect on CDC42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We could still detect ARP3 and ARP2 in complex with CDC42 under these settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using immunofluorescence analysis, we observed significant colocalization between endogenous ERK3 and ARP3 in HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and between endogenous ERK3 and overexpressed ARP3 S418D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), respectively. Further, depletion of ERK3, as expected, reduced the migration of ARP3 S418D-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Kinase activity of ERK3 is necessary for membrane protrusions in primary mammary epithelial cells</title><p>ERK3 controls both F-actin levels by regulation of the new filament assembly via ARP3-binding and its branching and bundling into the actin-rich protrusions by binding to CDC42/RAC1. We further investigated whether kinase activity of ERK3 was required for the formation of actin-rich protrusions and F-actin levels in mammary epithelial cells. Control (shCo) and ERK3-depleted (shERK3, 3′ UTR) HMECs were reconstituted with WT or kinase dead (KD) (K49A/K50A) ERK3, and EV was introduced as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Knockdown of ERK3 led to a decrease in actin-rich protrusions and overall F-actin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) with concomitant decrease in F-actin abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Complementation with ERK3 WT rescued overall F-actin levels and the protrusive phenotype of the HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Interestingly, KD ERK3 recovered cytoskeletal F-actin levels to the same extent as ERK3 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). However, although the abundance of F-actin is rescued upon KD ERK3 overexpression, cells formed a dense meshwork of actin membrane ruffles which did not protrude into filopodia but rather curved around the edges of the cell forming a tangled web (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results indicate that kinase activity of ERK3 is not required for the polymerization of actin, but rather for the bundling and/or branching of the rapidly polymerizing actin filaments. To further corroborate these observations, the WT and KD ERK3 proteins were expressed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system and then employed to stimulate ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization in vitro. Kinase activity of ERK3 did not seem to affect the ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We performed active RAC1/CDC42 pull-down from HMECs shERK3 (3′ UTR) cells reconstituted with either WT or the KD ERK3 and found that the kinase activity of ERK3 was not required for interactions or activation of CDC42. However, RAC1 activation was partially dependent on the kinase activity of ERK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Kinase dead (KD) mutant of ERK3 inhibits actin-rich protrusions with no negative effect on F-actin levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot validation of the ERK3 levels and expression of the V5-tagged <italic>ERK3</italic> constructs is presented as well as the total actin levels.

The signaling machinery that controls the actin skeleton dynamics is deregulated in cancer contributing to metastasis. Kinases are major drivers of signaling events and form the largest part of the druggable genome. Several drugs have successfully been developed to target deregulated kinases in cancer. Of the more than 500 kinases encoded by the human genome, many studies have been focused on the conventional MAPKs, while the pathophysiological significance of atypical MAPKs remains underexplored. We have recently demonstrated that ERK3 directly contributed to AP-1/c-Jun activation, IL-8 production, and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogucka et al., 2020</xref>). Emerging studies have further shown that ERK3 functions in a context- and tissue-specific manner in controlling tumorigenesis and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Mahdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogucka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elkhadragy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elkhadragy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elkhadragy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshammari et al., 2021</xref>). Mice expressing a catalytically inactive ERK3 mutant survive to adulthood and are fertile, but the kinase activity of ERK3 is necessary for optimal postnatal growth. In this study, we aimed to elucidate how ERK3 influences cell shape and actin cytoskeleton and unexpectedly revealed a pivotal role for this atypical MAPK in the regulation of RhoGTPases as GEF, of ARP2/3-dependent polymerization of actin probably as NPF, and of cell migration in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further, our studies unveiled an evolutionarily conserved role for ERK3 in the formation of actin-rich protrusions.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of the ERK3-dependent mechanisms regulating actin cytoskeleton and cell motility.</title><p>ERK3 directly binds and activates the ARP2/3 protein complex as well as the CDC42 and RAC1 Rho GTPases.

ERK3 regulates actin-rich protrusions, which play a direct role in cell motility.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85167-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>ERK3 is a GEF for CDC42</title><p>The activation of both RAC1 and CDC42 was compromised in the absence of ERK3 in primary mammary epithelial cells and oncogenic MDA-MB-231 cells. While the activation of RAC1 was partially rescued in HMECs upon EGF stimulation in ERK3-depleted cells, this was not the case in MDA-MB231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C, F, and G</xref>). Furthermore, while ERK3 regulated the activity of both RAC1 and CDC42 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref>), the kinase domain of ERK3, which lacks kinase activity, directly facilitated GDP-GTP nucleotide exchange specifically for CDC42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C, and G</xref>), which is implicated as a main regulator of filopodia assembly. In some cell types, we often detect a reduction in the total protein levels of RAC1 and CDC42 after depletion of ERK3. Whether inactivation of these RhoGTPases prompts them for proteasomal degradation under these settings deserves further analysis. Using several experimental procedures, we demonstrated that the interaction between ERK3 and RAC1 or CDC42 is direct and nucleotide-independent, which suggests that ERK3 is probably targeting the C-terminus of these RhoGTPases. Interestingly, it has been reported that RAC1 possesses a C-terminal docking (D site) for the canonical ERK (<sup>183</sup>KKRKRKCLLL<sup>192</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tong et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the same site is being exploited by ERK3 for its binding to RAC1 or CDC42 deserves further studies. It is interesting to note that while the kinase domain of ERK3 promoted GTP binding to CDC42, it slightly attenuated the same process with RAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>). While the kinase activity of ERK3 is not required for CDC42 activation, RAC1 activity partially depends on it. Further structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies are clearly warranted to unveil the molecular basis of this interaction and the subsequent functional implications.</p><p>In cells, regulation of RhoGTPases and that of the actin assembly is a much more complex and integrative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kurokawa et al., 2004</xref>). For example, a cell type-dependent, hierarchical crosstalk between RhoGTPases was observed in the regulation of actin-rich protrusions and CDC42 activity was shown to initiate RAC1-dependent lamellipodia protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zamudio-Meza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nobes and Hall, 1999</xref>). While ERK3 might activate RAC1 through its GEF-like function toward CDC42, it could also function as an intermediate link between RAC1 and its GEF by scaffolding both proteins and/or activating the GEF, thus indirectly contributing to RAC1 activity.</p><p>It is highly interesting that PAK family kinases, the effector kinases of RAC1 and CDC42, directly phosphorylate the SEG motif in the activation loop of ERK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Déléris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De la Mota-Peynado et al., 2011</xref>). The observations presented here strongly suggest a positive feedback loop, where ERK3 is required for the GTP loading of CDC42 and RAC1 to induce their interaction with PAKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK3. We show that active ERK3 kinase is required for the eventual formation of actin-regulated membrane protrusions. The functional and physical uncoupling of this loop could possibly be controlled by a phosphatase or by inducing the rapid turnover of ERK3 protein. The constituents of this dynamic complex need further evaluation and characterization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ERK3 binds ARP3 to regulate its function in actin polymerization</title><p>Cells rely on several mechanisms to regulate the assembly of actin filaments. To complicate matters further, regulatory pathways involved in the filopodia formation seem to be cell type-specific, and CDC42-, WASP-, and ARP2/3-independent mechanisms of membrane spikes formation have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Czuchra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Snapper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steffen et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that ERK3 directly binds the ARP2/3 complex and contributes to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Conformational changes in ARP2/3 complex assembly are crucial for the initial heterodimer formation between ARP2 and ARP3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gournier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Welch et al., 1997</xref>). In the unstimulated complex, ARP2 and ARP3 subunits exist in a splayed confirmation and upon stimulation by NPFs the two proteins align into a side-by-side position creating a surface mimicking the first two subunits of the new actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mullins and Pollard, 1999</xref>). Binding of these two crucial subunits by NPFs could reassure an active conformation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of certain subunits of ARP2/3 complex has been shown to be indispensable for the destabilization of its inactive conformation prior the full activation by the NPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vadlamudi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narayanan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LeClaire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). LeClaire et al. further reported that Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) regulates ARP2 phosphorylation and grooms the ARP2/3 complex for the activation by NPFs. Phosphorylation events within the ARP2/3 complex could regulate nucleation activity by affecting several properties, such as complex formation itself, conformational changes in the complex assembly, or the affinity of the ARP2/3 to NPFs. Further structural simulation studies are needed to test whether the interaction of ERK3 with the ARP2/3 complex and ARP3 phosphorylation at S418 inflicts key conformational changes to support actin polymerization. While we uncover a role for ERK3 in the formation of filopodia and ARP2/3-dependent actin polymerization, the possible role for ERK3 in the regulation of other actin nucleation factors including formins cannot be ruled out.</p><p>While the kinase activity of ERK3 is clearly required for the formation of actin-rich protrusions, expression of KD constructs in ERK3-depleted cells failed to inhibit F-actin enrichment. These data suggest that perhaps ERK3 binding to ARP2/3 and possibly other hitherto unknown factors per se contribute to actin polymerization, while its kinase activity is probably still required for ARP2/3-dependent and CDC42-induced filopodia formation, polarization, and migration of mammalian epithelial cells.</p><p>Overall, our studies shed new light on the multilayered regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by an understudied MAPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). ERK3 is druggable, and kinase inhibitors have already been developed for clinical use, which could also serve as tools to decipher kinase-dependent and -independent functions. Our observations will not only enhance the current understanding of actin cytoskeleton regulation, but also instigate new lines of investigations on the molecular, structural, and functional characterization of RhoGTPases and the ARP2/3 complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Immortalized HMECs hTERT-HME1 (ME16C) (ATCC CRL-4010) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM) BulletKit, containing supplements and growth factors (Cat# CC-3150, Lonza) according to the Clonetics mammary epithelial cell system guide (Lonza).

Briefly, the raw cell images were linearly adjusted for brightness and contrast for optimal filopodial observation and also had a mask applied to just analyze the filopodial region of interest in each cell and applied to each cell in the same way. Additionally, the following parameters were initially applied to each cell in the same way: Cell Edge Threshold = 20, Number of Iterations = 10, Number of Erode Cycles = 0, Fill Holes on Edges = checked, Filopodia Threshold = 25, Filopodia Minimum Size = 10 pixel.

The images were first acquired in multiple regions of each cell type for 20 h.</p><p>The image sequences were imported into Imaris version 9.3.1 and detected automatically by fluorescence with both the whole-cell spot and whole-cell surface analysis. As the surface and spot analysis center positions differed in control analysis by less than 1%, the whole cell spot automated analysis was applied to all images in the same way with a 16 µm per cell diameter estimate. The automated tracking also occurred in the same way for all image sequences within Imaris with the autoregressive motion algorithm, with a maximum average distance of 60 µm per step and with zero step gap applied. The speed (or cell speed) was determined by dividing each x, y step by 1800s (or 30 min). The acceleration (or cell acceleration) was determined by subtracting a step speed from the previous step speed and dividing by 1800s (or 30 min). The displacement length was determined by subtracting the initial x, y position from the final x, y position and then to determine the difference vector length for each track over 20 hr of acquisition. The track length added each absolute x, y vector step for an entire track over 20 hr of acquisition. The track mean speed averaged the speed of the steps for individual tracks.</p><p>The graphs were created with GraphPad Prism (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>), and cell distribution according to the analyzed parameter was visualized by violin plots.

HMECs and MDA-MB231 cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in supplements-free or serum-free medium, respectively. 500 µl of supplements-free/serum-free medium was mixed with 100 ng/ml of EGF and added into the bottom chamber and 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 120 µl of supplements-free/serum-free medium were added into each insert.

One of the key discoveries is that ERK3 is functioning as a direct GEF for Cdc42 but not Rac1. Using cell-based studies, the authors performed reconstitution experiments with wildtype and kinase-dead versions of ERK3 under ERK3 depleted conditions to delineate the role of the kinase activity of ERK3 in mediating Rac1/Cdc42 activity. However, it would be helpful to know if the authors also tried to reconstitute cells with the kinase domain alone and check for effects on Cdc42.</p><p>2. Related: The authors' efforts to show and understand the effects of the ERK3:small GTPase and ERK3:ARP3 interactions are appreciated. They show that the kinase domain is sufficient to bind Rac1 and Cdc42 (Figure 2L). For ARP3, binding with full-length ERK3 is shown (Figure 6C). Is the ERK3 kinase domain also sufficient for ARP3 binding?</p><p>3. The authors employ purified ERK3 protein (both full-length and kinase domain) to perform direct GEF assays. Is there any difference in the activity of the proteins employed as they seem to be obtained from different sources? It may also be interesting to test the activity of these proteins in a direct kinase assay.</p><p>4.

Apparently the kinase domain of ERK3 is enough to activate Cdc42 directly. I would propose the authors test the kinase activity of the different proteins they have employed here. Are they phosphorylated at Ser 189?</p><p>2. The data demonstrating the dependency of ERK3 for Arp3S418 phosphorylation in cells is hidden in the supplement. I would present this in the main figure. Also is this antibody commercially available?</p><p>3. Figure 6: Supplement 2- These observations also demonstrate that there is a possible feedback working on ERK3 -mediated Cdc42 activation as Cdc42 activity is reverted in cells expressing Arp3S418D but not the F actin content or chemotactic migration of cells.

ERK3 is activated by PAK kinases (through phosphorylation at Ser 189) which are downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the authors can add further discussion in these lines in the context of the summary figure presented in Figure 8.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After reading the manuscript a number of questions arise that the authors could address to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1. The paper is heavily centered on ERK3 knock-down, which is acceptable and the authors have done their best to address this in multiple cell lines. However, the data shown in Figure 1-supp3 is concerning. Firstly, the authors should show the single V5-tag channel as it is not possible to critically comment on this as shown. Having said that, it seems that none, or very little, of the overexpressed ERK3 (WT or mutant), is located in the vicinity of the actin cytoskeleton at the periphery of the cell. The authors should comment on this. How does this experiment look if the anti-ERK3 antibody used in Figure 1A is employed here?</p><p>2. Related to the point above. When considering Figure 1, the first experiment that comes to mind is whether the effects seen in Figure 1A on the actin cytoskeleton can be rescued by reintroducing siRNA-insensitive ERK3. The authors do this experiment and come back to it in Figure 7 from a different angle. It would be informative to know what small GTPase activity/pARP3-S418 phosphorylation looks like in the ERK3 WT/S189A/S189D overexpression experiment.</p><p>3. In Figure 3F the authors show a convincing GEF assay with the ERK3 kinase domain and Cdc42. The experiment shown in Figure supp 1 has a very high starting fluorescence, can the authors explain what is going on here?</p><p>4. In Figure 4, the colocalization data is supportive, but there are no real controls. The authors should consider changing their wording on line 280 in the results text, from &quot;corroborated&quot; to &quot;supported&quot;.</p><p>5. The authors' efforts to show and understand the effects of the ERK3:small GTPase and ERK3:ARP3 interactions are appreciated. They show that the kinase domain is sufficient to bind Rac1 and Cdc42 (Figure 2L). For ARP3, binding with full-length ERK3 is shown (Figure 6C). Is the ERK3 kinase domain also sufficient for ARP3 binding? A natural question is whether ERK3 binds ARP3 and Cdc42 at the same time, or would this be mutually exclusive. Can the authors address this with any data?</p><p>6. Figure 7 is rather important and could be better utilised to bring clarity to their investigation. Moving the Rac1/Cdc42 activity data from Figure 7 -suppl2 would add important functional information. This should be complemented with a blot for pARP3-S418 in the expression of empty vector/ERK3 WT/ERK3 KD conditions. Together this would strengthen the authors' conclusions in the text.</p><p>7. More of a comment. The authors convincingly show that EGF stim leads to pERK3-S189 phosphorylation and that ERK3 KD affects the EGF-dependent effects on the cytoskeleton. In spite of their efforts, it still remains rather unclear how this impacts the pERK3-small GTPase dynamics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85167.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have attempted to perform the active Rac1 and Cdc42 pulldowns from the cells overexpressing the kinase domain ERK3 vs. full-length ERK3 under conditions where ERK3 is depleted with a 3’UTR shRNA. However, due to the uneven expression levels of the truncated ERK3 construct (kinase domain aa 1-340) as compared to the WT ERK3, we were unable to reliably compare the active Rac1/Cdc42 pull-down from the cells overexpressing both constructs (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> presented for the reviewer). Also please note that reconstruction of full-length ERK3 in ERK3 knockdown cells consistently brings back active Cdc42 levels (see also Figure 7E), while the expression of the kinase-dead (KD) version (ERK3 K49A/K50A in the ATP-binding site of ERK3) under the same settings failed to do so.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western Blot analyses are presented to demonstrate the different expression efficiency of ERK3 WT (full-length) and truncated ERK3 (aa 1-340, kinase domain only) constructs with either N-Tap Flag tag (left panel) or C-Tap V5-tag (right panel).</title><p>1 µg cDNA was used for the transfection in 6-well plates as described in the methods section.

As proposed by this reviewer, we have added a short discussion about the possibility of a positive feedback loop, in which ERK3 is activated by EGF to stimulate the GTP loading of Cdc42 and Rac1 and their interaction with PAKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK3 (please see page 16 first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

We have performed the assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions (h=ps://www.cytoskeleton.com/pdf-storage/datasheets/bk100.pdf). Similar to the representative examples in the brochure, we detect different staring fluorescence which could be attributed to slight differences in starting temperature, GEF concentrations etc. However, despite these variations in settings, there is always a clear, dose-dependent increase in GEF activity upon addition of DBS or ERK3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

We have commented on that observation in the manuscript: “We observed that exogenous ERK3 localized predominantly in the cytosol as compared to the endogenous ERK3, which we detected at the cell edges and F-actin rich protrusions (Figure 1A). These results prompted us to prefer ERK3 knockdown cells for the study of ERK3-mediated phenotypes. “.</p><p>The discrepancies in the localisation of overexpressed and endogenous proteins can be explained by the conformational changes which might have occurred due to overexpression of the exogenous construct. Additionally, one cannot rule out the possibility of changes in the stoichiometry and composition of ERK3 containing multimeric protein complexes. However in IP assays and in complementation experiments we could detect tagged ERK3 precipitating with the other interactors and rescue the phenotype in KD cells. Perhaps one should explore a knock in cell line with tagged ERK3 in the C-terminus and perform further studies. We hope that we can address these issues in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
