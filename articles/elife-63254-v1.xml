the earliest developmental stages when trophoblast cells differentiate and invade into the endometrium to establish the definitive maternal-fetal interface. Previously, we identified the ubiquitously expressed tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) as a central factor of a novel molecular node controlling early mouse placentation. However, functional insights into how BAP1 regulates trophoblast biology are still missing. Using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and overexpression technology in mouse trophoblast stem cells, here we demonstrate that the downregulation of BAP1 protein is essential to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during trophoblast differentiation associated with a gain of invasiveness. Moreover, we show that the function of BAP1 in suppressing EMT progression is dependent on the binding of BAP1 to additional sex comb-like (ASXL1/2) proteins to form the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex. Finally, both endogenous expression patterns and BAP1 overexpression experiments in human trophoblast stem cells suggest that the molecular function of BAP1 in regulating trophoblast differentiation and EMT progression is conserved in mice and humans. Our results reveal that the physiological modulation of BAP1 determines the invasive properties of the trophoblast, delineating a new role of the BAP1 PR-DUB complex in regulating early placentation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trophoblast</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>trophoblast invasion</kwd><kwd>stem cell self-renewal</kwd><kwd>CRISPR gene editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT100160MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hemberger</surname><given-names>Myriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000735</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Next Generation Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Vicente</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000735</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centre for Trophoblast Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Vicente</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RYC-2019-026956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Vicente</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Erasmus+ traineeship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BAP1/ASXL is a key regulator of trophoblast invasion during early mouse and human placentation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The placenta is a complex organ essential for nutrient and oxygen exchange between the mother and the developing fetus. Normal placental function in humans depends on the earliest stages of development, when trophoblast cells proliferate and differentiate to form the villous tree and invade into the maternal decidua. Trophoblast invasion allows attachment of the placenta to the uterus and also mediates transformation of maternal spiral arteries, thereby ensuring an unimpeded blood flow into the intervillous space. This process is fundamentally important to secure an adequate supply of resources to the fetus. Several pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, placenta accreta, and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are underpinned by a primary defect in trophoblast invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaufmann et al., 2003</xref>). Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate adequate trophoblast differentiation and invasion remain poorly understood.</p><p>As part of the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders (DMDD) programme, we found that placental malformations are highly prevalent in embryonic lethal mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). This means that a significant number of genetic defects that lead to prenatal death may be due to abnormalities of placentation. In addition, we identified new molecular networks regulating early placentation. One of these molecular hubs is centred around the tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), a deubiquitinase enzyme involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, cell death, gluconeogenesis, and DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2013</xref>). At the molecular level, BAP1 regulates a variety of cellular processes through its participation in several multiprotein complexes. Amongst others, BAP1 has been reported to interact with the BRCA1-BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain I) complex, with forkhead box proteins K1 and K2 (FOXK1/2), host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), yin yang 1 (YY1), <italic>O</italic>-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), lysine-specific demethylase 1B (KDM1B) and methyl-CpG binding domain protein 5 and 6 (MBD5 and MBD6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Misaghi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baymaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>BAP1 also binds the epigenetic scaffolding proteins additional sex comb-like-1/2/3 (ASXL1/2/3) to form the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex that exerts an essential tumour suppressor activity by regulating ubiquitination levels of histone H2A (H2AK119Ub) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheuermann et al., 2010</xref>). ASXL proteins are obligatory partners of BAP1 and this interaction is required for BAP1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campagne et al., 2019</xref>). Mutations and deletions in PR-DUB core subunits, <italic>BAP1</italic> and <italic>ASXL,</italic> are frequently associated with various malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Wahab et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Triviai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micol et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In terms of its role in development, we have previously reported that <italic>Bap1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse conceptuses are embryonic lethal around midgestation (E9.5) and exhibit severe placental defects that likely contribute to the intrauterine demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the placentas of <italic>Bap1</italic>-mutant conceptuses show defects in differentiation of the chorionic ectoderm into syncytiotrophoblast, a process required for the development of the labyrinth, the area of nutrient exchange in the mouse placenta. Although conditional reconstitution of gene function in the placenta but not the embryo did not rescue the intrauterine lethality, it substantially improved syncytiotrophoblast formation. Moreover, <italic>Bap1</italic>-mutant placentas show a striking overabundance of trophoblast giant cells (TGCs), the invasive trophoblast cell population. A similar bias towards the TGC differentiation pathway at the expense of the syncytiotrophoblast lineage was observed in <italic>Bap1</italic>-null mouse trophoblast stem cells (mTSCs), suggesting a critical role for BAP1 in regulating trophoblast biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent reports have highlighted the possibility of co-evolution of shared pathways of invasion between trophoblast and cancer cells, in particular with regard to cell invasiveness and the capacity to breach basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kshitiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2018</xref>). In both cases, the initial process is characterized by EMT where epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesion properties, and gain migratory and invasive properties of mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El-Hashash et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms by which BAP1 regulates trophoblast differentiation and invasion will be important not only to uncover new molecular pathways involved in placental development, but also to shed light into the signalling pathways altered in tumours where BAP1 is mutated.</p><p>Here, we sought to determine the molecular mechanism by which BAP1 regulates trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, and invasion. Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated <italic>Bap1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mTSCs, we find that the deletion of <italic>Bap1</italic> does not affect their self-renewal capacity but precociously promotes the EMT process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BAP1 downregulation is required to trigger EMT; consequently, <italic>Bap1</italic> overexpression, mediated by CRISPR-Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM)-induced activation of the endogenous locus, slows down cell proliferation, delays TGC differentiation, and reduces trophoblast invasion. Analysis of the PR-DUB complex components <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic> revealed that ASXL1 is downregulated in parallel to BAP1, regulating BAP1's stability. In contrast, <italic>Asxl2</italic> exhibits the opposite expression pattern, with a concomitant increase as cells differentiate. By knocking down <italic>Asxl1</italic> or <italic>Asxl2</italic> in mTSCs, we further show that BAP1 stability depends on its interaction with ASXL proteins. Like <italic>Bap1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mTSCs, both <italic>Asxl1-</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic>-mutant mTSCs fail to induce syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The functional characterization of BAP1 in the human placenta and human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) suggests that the role of BAP1 in regulating trophoblast differentiation and EMT progression is conserved in mice and humans. Indeed, overexpression of BAP1 in hTSCs indicates that BAP1 levels define the epithelial characteristics of hTSCs. Collectively, these data reveal a pivotal role of BAP1/ASXL complexes in regulating EMT as a requisite for trophoblast invasion and in regulating the finely tuned balance of lineage-specific differentiation into the various trophoblast subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BAP1 is highly expressed in undifferentiated trophoblast and downregulated as cells enter the TGC lineage</title><p>To gain insight into the role of <italic>Bap1</italic> in trophoblast development, we first examined BAP1 expression in mTSCs. This unique stem cell type is derived from the trophectoderm of the blastocyst or from extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of early post-implantation conceptuses. mTSCs retain the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into all trophoblast subtypes under appropriate culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 1998</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of BAP1 in mTSCs showed strong nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>). We noticed that mTSC colonies containing areas of spontaneous differentiation, identified by decreased ESRRB stem cell marker expression, displayed a concomitant reduction in BAP1 staining intensity, suggesting that BAP1 is downregulated as soon as trophoblast cells start to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In line with these observations, differentiation of mTSCs in vitro revealed a significant reduction in BAP1 protein levels at days 3 and 6 of differentiation compared to stem cell conditions, as shown by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot (WB) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The strongest downregulation was seen at 6 days when giant cells are the prevailing differentiated cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). However, <italic>Bap1</italic> mRNA levels did not significantly change across this differentiation time course, indicating that the functional regulation of BAP1 takes place at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BAP1 protein levels are modulated during trophoblast differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of mouse trophoblast stem cells (mTSCs) in the stem cell state for BAP1 and the stem cell marker ESRRB.

While ExE will go on to develop predominantly into the labyrinth at later stages of development, EPC cells will give rise to the placental hormone-producing spongiotrophoblast layer and to invasive TGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed strong nuclear BAP1 staining in the embryo proper (epiblast, Epi) and in the ExE. However, differentiating EPC showed a significantly reduced staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and C</xref>). In E9.5 placentae, BAP1 immunoreactivity was prominent in the developing labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast layer as well as in maternal decidual cells, but was markedly less pronounced in TGCs, again suggesting that BAP1 is specifically downregulated as trophoblast cells differentiate into TGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that BAP1 is highly expressed in undifferentiated trophoblast of the ExE in vivo and in mTSCs in vitro. BAP1 is downregulated at the protein level specifically as cells enter the TGC lineage, suggesting a potential function of BAP1 in regulating trophoblast differentiation and invasiveness, a key property of TGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BAP1 deletion does not impair the stem cell gene-regulatory network</title><p>The proliferative and self-renewal capacity of mTSCs depends on FGF and Tgfβ1/activin A signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erlebacher et al., 2004</xref>).

WB analysis showed that after 3 days of differentiation under standard differentiation conditions (base medium) or in the presence of CM, BAP1 was markedly downregulated.

To study the endogenous association of BAP1 and ASXL, we immunoprecipitated BAP1, ASXL1, and ASXL2 from extracts of mTSCs grown in stem cell conditions and tested for reciprocal interactions by WB. While we were not able to detect an association of BAP1 and ASXL2 in stem cell conditions, co-immunoprecipitation of BAP1 and ASXL1 revealed that BAP1:ASXL1 is the predominant complex in mTSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Then, we further analysed whether this interaction regulates the stability of the BAP1 and ASXL proteins. Whereas the absence of BAP1 did not affect the stability of ASXL1 and ASXL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of either ASXL1 or ASXL2 resulted in a decrease of BAP1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This was particularly significant in the case of ASXL1 knockdown, in line with ASXL1 being the major complexing partner of BAP1 in stem cell conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insight into the specific roles of BAP1’s interaction partners, we generated <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic> KO mTSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

However, under differentiation conditions, <italic>Asxl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Asxl2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mTSCs failed to upregulate markers of syncytiotrophoblast, whereas the differentiation towards TGCs was promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This defect phenocopied the syncytiotrophoblast differentiation defect we had previously reported for <italic>Bap1</italic>-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the absence of <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic> induced an upregulation of EMT markers such <italic>Cdh2, Vim, Zeb1,</italic> and <italic>Zeb2</italic>, suggesting that ASXL1 and ASXL2 together with BAP1 contribute to the modulation of EMT as a critical process during trophoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>BAP1 PR-DUB complex is also regulated during human trophoblast differentiation</title><p>TGCs represent the invasive trophoblast cell type in mice whereas in humans, this function is exerted by extravillous trophoblast (EVT).

Taken together, these results indicate that the molecular mechanism by which the BAP1/ASXL complexes regulate trophoblast differentiation and invasion may be conserved in human and in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The similarities between trophoblast and tumour cells have long been recognized, in particular with respect to their invasive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferretti et al., 2007</xref>). BAP1, a tumour suppressor frequently mutated in human cancers, is ubiquitously expressed and inactivation or deletion of this gene results in metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2013</xref>). During murine development, embryos deficient for <italic>Bap1</italic> die during around mid-gestation (E9.5) with severe placental dysmorphologies. Although a central role for BAP1 during early placentation was suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), its function in regulating trophoblast development has not been explored to date. In the current study, we show that BAP1 is highly expressed in both mTSCs and hTSCs, and that its downregulation triggers EMT and promotes trophoblast invasiveness. We also find that BAP1 protein levels are tightly coordinated with the expression of the ASXL proteins, indicating that modulation of the PR-DUB complex is required for proper trophoblast differentiation. To unravel the mechanism by which BAP1 and ASXL may regulate trophoblast self-renewal and differentiation, we deleted and overexpressed these factors in mTSCs using CRISPR/Cas9-KO and CRISPR/Cas9-SAM activation technology – the first time this method of gene expression modulation has been employed in mTSCs to date. We find that BAP1 regulates many facets of trophoblast biology. First, in stem cell conditions, <italic>Bap1</italic> ablation triggers an overt EMT phenotype associated with increased cellular invasiveness, and, at the same time, enhances proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. This suggests that deficiency of <italic>Bap1</italic> uncouples the normal loss of proliferation from differentiation, reminiscent of malignant transformation. Indeed, the upregulation of stem cell markers upon functional BAP1 depletion is seen in human uveal melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, and is associated with aggressive cancer behaviour and poor patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matatall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peña-Llopis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harbour et al., 2010</xref>). In line with these data, overexpression of BAP1 induces the converse phenotype in mTSCs with reinforcement of epithelial features and reduced invasiveness. Therefore, we propose that BAP1 modulation, and specifically its downregulation, is one of the main drivers triggering the EMT and invasion processes in trophoblast. In line with this view, BAP1 mutations in human liver organoids result in loss of cell polarity, epithelial disruption, and increased cell motility, features observed during the initial steps of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, a direct link between BAP1 modulation and EMT regulation in early development and cancer has not been reported. However, results from previous studies of cancers that are strongly associated with an EMT process during metastatic transformation such as uveal melanoma, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer showed a significant decrease in tumour BAP1 expression and worse clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalirai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2012</xref>). On the background of our results reported here, it is tempting to speculate that the characteristic EMT and metastatic behaviour of these malignancies is induced by deletion or low abundance of BAP1. However, loss of BAP1 has also been reported to promote mesenchymal-epithelial transition in kidney tumours cells suggesting that its precise mode of function depends on the cell- and tissue-specific context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Further molecular analyses will be required to unravel the intricate regulation of the EMT pathway in different cellular contexts and the role of BAP1 in these processes.</p><p>In the absence of an FGF signal, <italic>Bap1</italic> deficiency promotes trophoblast differentiation towards a TGC phenotype, while syncytiotrophoblast formation is repressed. This is shown by the precocious cytoskeletal rearrangements we describe in mutant mTSCs, as well as the profound overabundance of terminally differentiated, extremely large TGCs in the KO placentae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). These dual roles of BAP1 depending on the FGF signalling environment may indeed be explained by the differential regulation of its PR-DUB components, ASXL1 and ASXL2. BAP1 and ASXL proteins form mutually exclusive complexes of the PR-DUB tumour suppressor, which maintains transcriptional silencing of polycomb target genes. Moreover, the fact that ASXL proteins can affect the stability of BAP1 may account for the high discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels in m/hTSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheuermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daou et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that the BAP1:ASXL1 complex is predominant in mTSCs and plays an important role in preventing mTSCs from undergoing EMT while in a proliferative stem cell state. With the onset of trophoblast differentiation and the concomitant upregulation of ASXL2, both BAP1:ASXL1 and BAP1:ASXL2 complexes are likely to coexist. Both these complexes are important to promote syncytiotrophoblast differentiation; in the absence of either <italic>Bap1</italic>, <italic>Asxl1,</italic> or <italic>Asxl2</italic>, syncytiotrophoblast differentiation is abrogated, and TGC differentiation dominates. This is in keeping with the finding that overexpression of <italic>Asxl2</italic> induces cellular senescence in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huether et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We previously found a strong correlation between cardiovascular and brain defects in embryos with abnormal placentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Since <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic> mutants have also been reported to exhibit cardiovascular and brain developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baskind et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that they may be due, in part, to a placental defect.</p><p>Finally, our data suggest that BAP1:ASXL1/2 regulate trophoblast differentiation and invasiveness in other species. In humans as in mice, BAP1 protein levels are downregulated during differentiation towards the invasive EVT lineage in coordination with ASXL gene expression. We also observed that in addition to <italic>ASXL1</italic> downregulation, <italic>ASXL3</italic> expression was also modulated during EVT differentiation. De novo mutations of <italic>ASXL1/2/3</italic> genes are associated with severe FGR, preterm birth, and defects in the development of the heart-brain axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Srivastava et al., 2016</xref>). These types of defects are strongly linked to abnormal placentation. Our work suggests a direct link of these mutations to abnormal trophoblast development through the various functions of PR-DUB in regulating the unique properties of trophoblast cells. Gaining detailed insights into the molecular networks regulating this BAP1-ASXL modulation during early placentation will help not only to shed light onto the major unexplained pregnancy disorders, but also to open up new avenues into investigations of tumours where PR-DUB is mutated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Perez-Garcia et al., follows up on a prior study by the same authors in which they identified the tumor suppressor BAP1 as a regulator of mouse placentation and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) (Perez-Garcia et al., Nature, 2018). In their preceding work the authors showed that CRISPR-mediated knockout of BAP1 in TSCs results in upregulation of key stem cell markers Cdx2 and Esrrb and biased differentiation towards trophoblast giant cells at the expense of the syncytiotrophoblast lineage. Here the authors have expanded on these observations by demonstrating that BAP1 modulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TSCs and that a similar phenotype can be obtained by genetic deletion of Asxl1/2. Declining protein levels of BAP1 during differentiation of human TSCs into extravillous trophoblast suggest that the role of BAP1 may be conserved in humans. As the molecular mechanisms of trophoblast development, including EMT and invasive behaviors of trophoblast giant cells in the mouse and extravillous trophoblast cells in human are only beginning to be understood, this study provides an important advance.</p><p>This is a well-written and technically sound study that clarifies the role of BAP1 in trophoblast development. Overall, the work presented is very important to the fields of EMT and trophoblast stem cell biology, and it warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in principle. However, the claims in the abstract, the model in Figure 5, and the conclusions in the discussion are not well-supported. Therefore, additional experimental work will be essential for the manuscript to become suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There was consensus that the current manuscript lacks functional data to demonstrate conservation of BAP1/ASXL1/2 function in human TSCs. These are crucial claims in the abstract that are not supported, and some elements of these claims are necessary for the manuscript to have impact beyond the previous Nature 2018 publication. Currently, the studies in human TSCs are purely observational (Figure 6D-E). The authors should employ genetic approaches to interrogate whether the functions of BAP1 in TSC self-renewal and differentiation are truly conserved between mouse and human.</p><p>2. The main takeaway from Figure 2 is that BAP1 is dispensable for mouse TSC maintenance and that BAP1 knockout results in increased expression of stem cell markers Cdx2 and Esrrb. Both of these findings were previously reported in the authors' 2018 paper (see Figure 4b in the Nature paper). Therefore, the statement that &quot;BAP1 deletion does not impair the stem cell gene regulatory network&quot; is not surprising and the authors should state clearly that these experiments confirm their prior observations.</p><p>3. The overexpression data in Figure 4 is difficult to interpret. Vector transduced TSCs show a tight, epithelial morphology (Figure 3A), whereas the NT-sgRNA control cells look like they are undergoing EMT (Figure 4C). Why does the introduction of the NT-sgRNA induce EMT characteristics? Bap1 sgRNA1 cells seem less epithelial than the Vector transduced cells. Do NT-sgRNA TSCs have less BAP1 than Vector transduced TSCs?</p><p>4. Moreover, all the data in Figure 4 are based on a single sgRNA that could activate BAP1 expression. To exclude off target effects, the authors should confirm the effect of BAP1 overexpression using another sgRNA or cDNA overexpression system.</p><p>5. The authors need to examine the gene expression data more closely as well as the functional consequences of BAP1 overexpression on TSC proliferation and differentiation. In particular it would be important to compare the list of DEG in BAP1 KO and overexpression condition. Are they mirror-image or are there differences? For example, <italic>Zeb2</italic> expression is strongly upregulated in BAP1 mutant line but not significantly altered in cells overexpressing BAP1. This should be discussed.</p><p>6. In the abstract, the authors state that BAP1 function during trophoblast development is dependent on its binding to Asxl1/2/3. However, the data presented in this manuscript do not address whether BAP1 and Asxl1/2/3 are indeed part of the same complex in TSCs. Furthermore, the fact that Asxl1/2 KO increases expression of syncytial genes (Figure 5) does not provide direct evidence of functional synergy between these proteins and BAP1. This conclusion could be strengthened by demonstrating that Asxl1 and BAP1 indeed have a protein-protein interaction in TSCs and/or by deleting the BAP1 binding domain in Asxl1/2. It would also be instructive to examine whether the phenotype of BAP1 overexpression in TSCs (e.g. gain of epithelial features and reduced invasiveness) is dependent on Asxl1. This could be examined by overexpressing BAP1 in Asxl1-deficient TSCs.</p><p>7. In some cases, experiments are carried out to &quot;confirm&quot; and &quot;corroborate&quot; hypotheses rather than test them. For example, the similarity between the gene expression signature of Bap1 mutant murine TSCs is and Bap1 mutant melanocytes and mesothelial cells is shown and emphasized. One wonders how unique is this similarity? Is Bap1 expression modulation observed in other EMT processes during development or in cancer? This should be explored and discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;BAP1/ASXL complex modulation regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition during trophoblast differentiation and invasion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

There was consensus that the current manuscript lacks functional data to demonstrate conservation of BAP1/ASXL1/2 function in human TSCs. These are crucial claims in the abstract that are not supported, and some elements of these claims are necessary for the manuscript to have impact beyond the previous Nature 2018 publication. Currently, the studies in human TSCs are purely observational (Figure 6D-E). The authors should employ genetic approaches to interrogate whether the functions of BAP1 in TSC self-renewal and differentiation are truly conserved between mouse and human.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ statement that a more detailed investigation of BAP1 function in hTSCs will boost the scientific impact of this manuscript tremendously. To address this point, we have performed important additional functional experiments: Notably, we have generated BAP1 overexpressing hTSCs by lentiviral transduction followed by RT-qPCR to demonstrate that overexpression of BAP1 in hTSCs regulates the epithelial features of human trophoblast. As in mice, the overexpression of BAP1 in hTSCs did not affect their self-renewal capacity but resulted in upregulation of key EMT markers with a concomitant strong repression of EMT drivers. Thus, mesenchymal markers <italic>CDH2</italic> and <italic>ZEB2</italic> were markedly downregulated in BAP1-overexpressing cells, whereas pro-epithelial genes such as <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CLDN2</italic> and <italic>TJP1</italic> were upregulated. These data are in addition to the clear endogenous regulation of BAP1 during trophoblast differentiation that demonstrate a significant downregulation of BAP1 as trophoblast acquires invasive properties. We have shown this by RT-qPCR on primary tissue samples, on human trophoblast cell lines that exhibit different invasive properties, on tissue sections by IHC, and on hTSCs upon differentiation into extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT). These data are summarized in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement. Specifically, the newly added data are in Figure 6F, 6G and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, and in the text on p. 12/13 lines 353-364.</p><p>Overall, these data clearly indicate that BAP1 gene function is conserved between mouse and human. The main focus of this manuscript is on describing a novel, key role of BAP1 in regulating EMT in trophoblast cells. While we conduct the majority of this study in the mouse, the above data strongly suggest that this function is conserved in human trophoblast. We feel that it is beyond the scope of the current study to unravel all aspects of the intricate BAP1/ASXL complex regulation in human placentation, which – in our opinion – would represent a separate manuscript. It should also be noted that these hTSC manipulation experiments are extremely challenging and state-of-the-art in the field; we attempted CRISPR KO and siRNA approaches, but these were not successful for technical reasons and the fragility of these cells. These approaches have not been established as routine experimental protocols in hTSCs and require substantial amounts of technological optimization, which is beyond the scope of this work and, again, would constitute a study in its own right. To the best of our knowledge, our overexpression approach represents the first-of-its-kind genetic manipulation of the recently derived hTSCs to confirm that a specific molecular mechanism is conserved between mice and humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The main takeaway from Figure 2 is that BAP1 is dispensable for mouse TSC maintenance and that BAP1 knockout results in increased expression of stem cell markers Cdx2 and Esrrb. Both of these findings were previously reported in the authors' 2018 paper (see Figure 4b in the Nature paper). Therefore, the statement that &quot;BAP1 deletion does not impair the stem cell gene regulatory network&quot; is not surprising and the authors should state clearly that these experiments confirm their prior observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we previously observed the upregulation of the stem cell markers <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Esrrb</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>Bap1</italic> KO mTSCs grown in stem cell conditions. We now go further by describing in detail the dynamics of the CDX2 and ESRRB protein and mRNA levels in stem cell conditions and during early differentiation in the absence of BAP1. Importantly, we find that deletion of BAP1 affects cell proliferation, and we also describe that BAP1 is primarily regulated by FGF signalling. We also investigate a number of additional marker genes to underscore the point of sustained stem cell potential. These additional data provide insights well beyond those previously reported.</p><p>In line with reviewers’ suggestion, we now state that in lines 185-191: “Previously, we reported that Bap1 deletion in mTSCs resulted in a upregulation of Cdx2 and Esrrb mRNA levels (Perez-Garcia et al., 2018). We assessed CDX2 and ESRRB protein levels in Bap1<sup>-/-</sup> mTSCs compared to (empty vector) control cells across 24 hours of differentiation (0h=stem cell conditions; 4h, 8h, 24h = hours upon differentiation). The absence of BAP1 resulted in increased ESRRB and CDX2 protein levels confirming our previous observations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have replaced the images with new examples that better represent the epithelial character of these cell lines (Figure 4B). Importantly, following the reviewers’ concern, we have compared the transcript levels of BAP1 in 3 different Vector control clones and the 3 replicates of NT-sgRNA mTSCs and find that they behave like close replicates, indistinguishable from each other (Panel A <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, we have also immunoblotted BAP1 (Panel B <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

However, the high specificity of the dCas9-SAM system has been proven by several studies to show extremely rare off-target effects (Thakore et al., 2015; Konermann et al., 2015; Saayman et al., 2016). In particular for the dCas9 technology, the frequency of off-target binding to functional exons is very low (Boyle et al., 2017), and any residual potential off-target effects are expected to be mitigated due to epigenetic protection (Hay et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2016).</p><p>The three sgRNAs used in this study were previously designed to minimize potential off-target effects (Joung et al., 2017, 2019) and target the 180bp region upstream of the target gene TSS, which represents the strongest predictor of activation efficiency (Konerman et al., 2015). In our case, the most effective guide was sgRNA1, the closest to the TSS. The other two sgRNAs did not significantly upregulate <italic>Bap1</italic> transcription. Only when they were transduced together was <italic>Bap1</italic> expression upregulated, presumably due to the contribution of sgRNA1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Despite this well-reported evidence, following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have performed new experiments overexpressing BAP1 by viral transduction (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, 1H) and show that the overexpression of BAP1 affects the regulation of genes involved in epithelial characteristics of mTSCs. These new data are entirely in line with the results obtained by CRISPR/Cas9-SAM overexpression and validate the immense efforts we have put into implementing this system in mTSCs, as shown in Figure 4. These corroborating results are described on p. 10 lines 279-283.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors need to examine the gene expression data more closely as well as the functional consequences of BAP1 overexpression on TSC proliferation and differentiation. In particular it would be important to compare the list of DEG in BAP1 KO and overexpression condition. Are they mirror-image or are there differences? For example, Zeb2 expression is strongly upregulated in BAP1 mutant line but not significantly altered in cells overexpressing BAP1. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for these suggestions as they have proven particularly helpful to better understand the specific gene network regulated by BAP1. We have now assessed the proliferation rate and performed time course differentiation experiments on <italic>Bap1</italic> CRISPR/Cas9-SAM overexpressing cells compared to control cells (new Figure 4C, 4G and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) and find that the increased amount of BAP1 resulted in a slower proliferation rate and delayed differentiation towards TGCs. These data exactly mirror-image the higher proliferation rates and slower differentiation of <italic>Bap1</italic> KO TSCs (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement).</p><p>In addition, following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have compared the DEG in <italic>Bap1</italic> KO and overexpression conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and Supplementary Table 5) to narrow down the specific gene network regulated by BAP1. By looking at these opposing scenarios, we show that despite expected differences due to the different gene engineering system, the mirror-image behaviour of de-regulated genes clearly indicates that BAP1 levels critically regulate the epithelial state of trophoblast.</p><p>The new results are included in lines 253-254: “The upregulation of Bap1 resulted in tight epithelial mTSC colonies that proliferated at a slower rate than NT-sgRNA control mTSCs (Figure 4B and 4C)”.</p><p>Lines 266-272: “Intriguingly, there was substantial overlap between genes downregulated in Bap1 KO mTSCs and those upregulated in Bap1-overexpressing cells, and conversely also between genes upregulated in the KO and downregulated in the overexpressing cells. Thus, the two opposing models of Bap1 modulation (KO vs overexpression) provided mirror-image results that pivoted around the biological processes of epithelial cell integrity, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and Supplementary Table 5).”</p><p>Lines 276-285 “In line with the re-acquisition of epithelial properties, Bap1-overexpressing mTSCs exhibited a delay in differentiation towards the invasive TGC lineage and lower invasive capacity through Matrigel compared to NT-sgRNA control cells (Figure 4G, 4H and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Finally, we corroborated the data obtained by CRISPR/Cas9-SAM overexpression by performing exogenous GFP-Bap1 overexpression experiments in mTSCs grown in stem cell conditions, which similarly resulted in a significant upregulation of Cdh1 and strong downregulation of Cdh2, Zeb1, Zeb2, Snai1 and Vim expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and 1H). These results demonstrate that precise levels of BAP1 regulate mTSC morphology, and that modulation of BAP1 levels affects the extent and speed at which trophoblast cells undergo EMT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the abstract, the authors state that BAP1 function during trophoblast development is dependent on its binding to Asxl1/2/3. However, the data presented in this manuscript do not address whether BAP1 and Asxl1/2/3 are indeed part of the same complex in TSCs. Furthermore, the fact that Asxl1/2 KO increases expression of syncytial genes (Figure 5) does not provide direct evidence of functional synergy between these proteins and BAP1. This conclusion could be strengthened by demonstrating that Asxl1 and BAP1 indeed have a protein-protein interaction in TSCs and/or by deleting the BAP1 binding domain in Asxl1/2. It would also be instructive to examine whether the phenotype of BAP1 overexpression in TSCs (e.g. gain of epithelial features and reduced invasiveness) is dependent on Asxl1. This could be examined by overexpressing BAP1 in Asxl1-deficient TSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this comment. Firstly, just to clarify, the deletion of <italic>Asxl1</italic> or <italic>Asxl2</italic> impaired the upregulation of syncytial genes (Figure 5F, 5G and Figure 5-supplement 1F). Beyond that, the fact that the <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl2</italic> KO mTSC phenotype recapitulated to some extent the phenotype of <italic>Bap1</italic> KO mTSCs indeed suggested a functional synergy between BAP1 and ASXL proteins.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have conducted additional experiments to assess the endogenous interaction of BAP1-ASXL proteins by co-immunoprecipitating reciprocally BAP1-ASXL1 and BAP1-ASXL2 in stem cell conditions (new Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). In addition, to demonstrate that BAP1 function is dependent on interaction with ASXL, we examined the protein levels of ASXL1/2 in the presence or absence of BAP1. The absence of BAP1 did not affect the levels of ASXL1 or ASXL2 (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). Then, we performed siRNA experiments to show that the knockdown of <italic>Asxl1</italic> or <italic>Asxl2</italic> reduced BAP1 protein levels, indicating that the stability of BAP1 depends on its interaction with ASXL proteins. Moreover, these experiments allowed us to demonstrate that BAP1:ASXL1 is the predominant complex in stem cell conditions (Figure 5D and 5E).</p><p>The new results included in lines 298-310: “These results prompted us to investigate the nature of the BAP1-ASXL interaction in the mTSC context. To study the endogenous association of BAP1 and ASXL, we immunoprecipitated BAP1, ASXL1 and ASXL2 from extracts of mTSCs grown in stem cell conditions and tested for reciprocal interactions by WB. While we were not able to detect an association of BAP1 and ASXL2 in stem cell conditions, co-immunoprecipitation of BAP1 and ASXL1 revealed that BAP1:ASXL1 is the predominant complex in mTSCs (Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Then, we further analysed whether this interaction regulates the stability of the BAP1 and ASXL proteins. Whereas the absence of BAP1 did not affect the stability of ASXL1 and ASXL2 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D), small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of either ASXL1 or ASXL2 resulted in a decrease of BAP1 protein levels (Figure 5D). This was particularly significant in the case of ASXL1 knockdown, in line with ASXL1 being the major complexing partner of BAP1 in stem cell conditions (Figure 5D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

However, results from previous studies of cancers that are strongly associated with an EMT process during metastatic transformation such as uveal melanoma, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer showed a significant decrease in tumour BAP1 expression and worse clinical outcomes (Kalirai et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2012). On the background of our results reported here, it is tempting to speculate that the characteristic EMT and metastatic behaviour of these malignancies is induced by deletion or low abundance of BAP1. However, loss of BAP1 has also been reported to promote mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in kidney tumours cells suggesting that its precise mode of function depends on the cell- and tissue-specific context (Chen et al., 2019). Further molecular analyses will be required to unravel the intricate regulation of the EMT pathway in different cellular contexts and the role of BAP1 in these processes.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have substantially revised their manuscript in response to the reviewers' comments.
