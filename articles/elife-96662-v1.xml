ovarii</italic> (RO) is an appendage of the ovary that has been given little attention. Although the RO appears in drawings of the ovary in early versions of Gray’s Anatomy, it disappeared from recent textbooks, and is often dismissed as a functionless vestige in the adult ovary. Using PAX8 immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we characterized the fetal development of the RO in the context of the mouse ovary. The RO consists of three distinct regions that persist in adult life, the intraovarian rete (IOR), the extraovarian rete (EOR), and the connecting rete (CR). While the cells of the IOR appear to form solid cords within the ovary, the EOR rapidly develops into a convoluted tubular epithelium ending in a distal dilated tip. Cells of the EOR are ciliated and exhibit cellular trafficking capabilities. The CR, connecting the EOR to the IOR, gradually acquires tubular epithelial characteristics by birth. Using microinjections into the distal dilated tip of the EOR, we found that luminal contents flow toward the ovary. Mass spectrometry revealed that the EOR lumen contains secreted proteins potentially important for ovarian function. We show that the cells of the EOR are closely associated with vasculature and macrophages, and are contacted by neuronal projections, consistent with a role as a sensory appendage of the ovary. The direct proximity of the RO to the ovary and its integration with the extraovarian landscape suggest that it plays an important role in ovary development and homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>rete ovarii</italic></kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>SNARE complex</kwd><kwd>fluid secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1R01HD090050-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capel</surname><given-names>Blanche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1R01DK132120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HD103778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKey</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#R00HD103778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKey</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#5R01HD039963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anbarci</surname><given-names>Dilara N</given-names></name><name><surname>Capel</surname><given-names>Blanche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006510</institution-id><institution>Duke University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Trent Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capel</surname><given-names>Blanche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>rete ovarii</italic> is a complex secretory structure that may play an important role in ovarian homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>rete ovarii</italic> (RO) is an epithelial structure that is directly connected to the ovary, first described over a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waldeyer, 1870</xref>) as a multiregion structure of mesonephric origin. Despite high conservation among mammalian species, including guinea pigs, cows, cats, sheep, swine, prairie deer mice, camels, dogs, monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cassali et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos et al., 2012</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 1999</xref>), previous work on the RO did not arrive at a consensus on the function of this structure. Thus, it has remained a mysterious orphan structure.</p><p>Although the RO has been proposed to be the female homologue of the rete testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wenzel and Odend’hal, 1985</xref>), our recent work revealed that it is more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>). The RO is composed of three distinct regions: (1) the extraovarian rete (EOR), which consists of columnar epithelial cells that create a single convoluted tubule structure ending in a blind distal dilated tip (DDT); (2) the connecting rete (CR), which consists of pseudo-columnar cells; and (3) the intraovarian rete (IOR), which consists of squamous epithelial cells that branch and form a fine network of thin solid cell cords approximately 1–3 cells thick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byskov and Lintern-Moore, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>). It was previously shown that the RO consists of ciliated and non-ciliated cells rich in apical microvilli and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Czernobilsky et al., 1985</xref>). Fine granular Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material was found in the cytoplasm of the EOR and CR cells, indicating the presence of polysaccharides (e.g., glycogen and mucins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein and Anderson, 1979</xref>). Because the proportion of PAS-positive material in the RO was found to be influenced by the estrous cycle in cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wenzel et al., 1987</xref>), researchers concluded that the luminal contents of the RO were under endocrine control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archbald et al., 1971</xref>). Although these results strongly suggested a secretory role for the RO, this function was not experimentally confirmed, and no proteomic or metabolomic investigations were pursued. Previous characterization of the RO relied heavily on imaging serial sections to study the structure. However, these studies lacked contextual information, and the use of sections made it challenging to determine whether tubules were connected to one another or were isolated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wenzel and Odend’hal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woolnough et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, some investigators reported that the whole RO contracted postnatally and that the DDT of the EOR separated from the RO and degenerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byskov and Lintern-Moore, 1973</xref>). Perhaps for these reasons, the RO was deemed a functionless vestige and has been omitted from recent textbook representations of the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girsh, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The RO was rediscovered and highlighted in our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>), where we used confocal and lightsheet imaging of whole ovaries to study the integration of ovary morphogenesis with the development of surrounding tissues, including the RO. Recently, the IOR has gained attention as a newly described progenitor for supporting cells of the murine gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayère et al., 2022</xref>). This echoes previous data suggesting that the RO plays a role in the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein and Anderson, 1979</xref>). Recent single-cell transcriptomics studies have also identified cells of the RO within human fetal gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lardenois et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taelman et al., 2022</xref>). We reported that the entire RO expresses high levels of PAX8 and used this as a marker to visualize and characterize cells of the RO. In the present study, we used the Pax<italic>8-rtTa; Tre-H2B-GFP</italic> RO nuclear reporter mouse line, advanced imaging techniques, and secretome analysis to characterize the development of the intact RO in its native context and to investigate the function and heterogeneity of its cells. We found that the RO arises from a subset of the mesonephric tubules, analogous to the rete testis, and persists into adulthood. Our studies reveal that the RO is a continuous structure, surrounded by smooth muscle actin, a dense vascular network, and several macrophage populations. We also show that the RO is directly contacted by neurons. The enrichment of secretory machinery in RO cells as well as our experimental analysis of directional flow and luminal contents, together suggest that the RO sends material to the ovary. Based on these findings, we suggest that the RO plays a role in ovary function and should be investigated as a functional organ of the female reproductive tract.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the IOR, CR, and EOR</title><p>We used immunofluorescence (IF) and confocal imaging to investigate the development and sub-regional structure of the RO from embryonic day (E) 16.5 to postnatal day (P) 7. Three distinct regions of the RO were originally defined histologically by cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byskov and Lintern-Moore, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Using IF and confocal imaging, we found that these three regions are maintained throughout development, but their relative sizes change. While the entirety of the RO is PAX8+, we took different approaches to identify region specific markers. First, as GFRa1 was known to be expressed in the rete testis, we hypothesized that it was expressed in the RO as well. Indeed, immunostaining using antibodies against GFRa1 revealed that part of the RO is GFRa1+. GFRa1 specifically labeled the CR from E16.5 to P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, bottom row). To identify additional RO markers, we performed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) of cells from the ovarian complex of mice at E16.5 and 2 months and found that <italic>Krt8</italic> was enriched in the RO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarci et al., 2024</xref>). We validated these findings using IF against KRT8, which revealed that KRT8+ cells were specifically localized to the EOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, third row; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>rete ovarii</italic> (RO) undergoes dynamic changes during development alongside the ovary.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>, top row) Diagrams depicting the development of the three regions (extraovarian rete [ER], magenta; connecting rete [CR], cyan; intraovarian rete [IOR], yellow) of the RO from E16.5 to P7 in the whole ovarian complex (ovary, light pink; oviduct, gray).

At E16.5, the CR and IOR were the largest of the three regions. In the EOR, several tubules leading from the region of the CR converged into a single tube of columnar PAX8+ and KRT8+ epithelial cells that lead to a blind end. Between E16.5 and E18.5, the EOR underwent rapid expansion, and the blind end of the EOR became dilated. This structure, which we refer to as the DDT, was best visualized from the ventral side of the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). By E18.5, the EOR was the largest of the three regions. At this stage, the CR was still large, but the IOR began to regress. At P0, the EOR remained the largest region, and the IOR had regressed to the medullary region of the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>).

In contrast, the ovary and surrounding tissue are more highly innervated than the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKey et al., 2019</xref>). A surprising finding in our bulk transcriptome analysis of the RO was the presence of a high proportion of immune cells and cells with vascular markers that co-isolated with E16.5 RO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarci et al., 2024</xref>). To explore the integration of the RO with its environment, we used IF to investigate the expression of endothelial marker Endomucin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), smooth muscle marker alpha smooth muscle actin (aSMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), pan-neuronal marker TUJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and macrophage markers F4/80 and LYVE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We found that at E18.5 the EOR was tightly surrounded by vasculature and ensheathed within a layer of aSMA+ mesenchyme. The EOR, and more specifically the DDT, was directly contacted by neurons that contact the PAX8+ epithelial cells. We also found that the EOR is specifically associated with F4/80+ macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

To investigate this idea, we first chose to determine the direction of flow at P7 when the DDT of the EOR was fully dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We first injected fluorescently labeled pH-insensitive dextran into the DDT of the EOR and found that, within just 15 minutes, the fluorescent fluid had readily traveled from the DDT into the ovary, where it then diffused widely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, when we injected fluorescently labeled dextran into the P7 ovary near the IOR, the dextran remained in the ovary and did not travel to the EOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Due to the curvature of the DDT, optical slices often include cilia from neighboring cells. However, an ultrathin (0.6 um) optical section suggested that each cell has a single cilium. Since the EOR was covered in a sheath of aSMA+ mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4e and f</xref>), we investigated whether and when this layer of smooth muscle became contractile. We used an antibody against the contractile smooth muscle protein Calponin (CNN1) and found that CNN1 was absent around the EOR during fetal development and in neonates. However, by P7, the mesenchymal sheath around the EOR gained expression of CNN1, indicating that it acquired the ability to contract by this stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>).

To address this question, we analyzed the protein contents of the luminal material using mass spectrometry. Using the <italic>Pax8rtTA; Tre-H2B-GFP</italic> reporter mouse line, we dissected EORs and isolated luminal fluid by gently pressing the tissue with a pestle. Using this method, we anticipated several problems. First, we expected that some cells within the EOR and surrounding tissue would be lysed during this procedure, which would release proteins not ordinarily secreted. Second, we expected that some cells closely associated with the EOR would be co-isolated, which could result in contamination with contents from cells that are not part of the EOR. To eliminate intracellular proteins arising from lysed cells, we cross-referenced our proteomic dataset with that of the mammalian secretome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meinken et al., 2015</xref>), thereby retaining only known secreted proteins.

The presence of other components of the SNARE-complex were validated using IF.

We suggest that the RO be added to this list and investigated as an additional component of female reproductive function. We show that the RO consists of three distinct regions that mature during fetal life and persist into adulthood. The cells of the EOR show secretory capabilities consistent with the presence of secreted proteins in the lumen identified through mass spectrometry. Importantly, we show that contents of the EOR are transported to the ovary by P7, suggesting a role in ovary homeostasis.</p><p>Historically, the regions of the RO were identified using histological sections, where the EOR was defined as a columnar epithelium, while the CR was defined as pseudo-columnar. Recently, we found that the entire RO expresses PAX8+, which is usually considered a marker of urogenital epithelial identity. We also showed that the IOR contained PAX8+/FOXL2+ cells and that the EOR was KRT8+ at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKey et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we further characterized KRT8 and E-Cadherin expression throughout RO development as the CR acquires epithelial characteristics. We also identified a marker, GFRa1, that is exclusively expressed in the CR. These molecular distinctions predict that the different regions of the RO are functionally distinct.</p><p>While PAS-positive staining in the lumen of the EOR of sheep indicated the presence of glycogens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein and Anderson, 1979</xref>), it remained unclear whether these were secreted by the EOR cells or were accumulated secretions from the ovary. Using injections of a membrane-impermeable dye, dextran, into either the RO or ovary, we found that the fluid within the EOR travels toward the ovary. We also found that the EOR is ensheathed within a layer of aSMA+ mesenchyme that expresses the contractile component Calponin (CNN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggests that the EOR gains contractility during development, which could facilitate fluid movement within the EOR lumen in conjunction with cilia within the EOR. We found that the ciliary protein ARL13b was expressed in the EOR. While the primary cilium is not motile and does not generate flow, we found in our ScRNA-seq data that cells in the EOR express <italic>Pkd2</italic>. In renal epithelial cells, nonmotile primary cilia expressing PDK2 sense shear stress during fluid flow and transduce this sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). Perhaps fluid movement within the EOR is a two-part process, where the primary cilia sense pressure within the lumen inducing contraction of the smooth muscle surrounding the EOR to promote fluid movement toward the ovary. Our E16.5 ScRNA-seq data indicates that the EOR only expresses <italic>Arl13b</italic> and does not express the multicilia marker <italic>Foxj1</italic>. However, both markers are present in the putative EOR cell clusters in our adult SnRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarci et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that, after maturation, the EOR likely includes <italic>Arl13b+/Foxj1+</italic> multiciliated cells. It is well documented that adult oviductal multiciliated cells express both ARL13b and FOXJ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coy et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that the primary cilia give rise to motile multiciliated cells, as shown in the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jain et al., 2010</xref>) and suggested in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We used a ‘milking’ process to extrude the contents of EOR, and mass spectrometry, to identify 4232 proteins. We expected this group to be a mix of proteins from the luminal fluid, and cytoplasmic proteins from lysed EOR cells or from cells closely associated with the EOR. We took a very conservative approach to identify proteins highly likely to be secreted from EOR cells: (1) we compared the proteomics data with the known mammalian secretome to identify only secreted proteins; and (2) we next compared this shortened list with our available E16.5 ScRNA-seq data to find proteins whose transcripts were specific to the EOR at that stage. Although we recognize that the secretome at P7 is likely far more complex, this candidate list of 15 proteins reveals the first insight into specific proteins secreted from the RO that may be involved in the secretory process itself or may be transported to the ovary to affect ovary function.</p><p>Within the protein candidate list, we focused on validating clusterin (CLU) and syntaxin binding protein 2 (STXBP2) due to their roles in protein and vesicle transport. Consistent with our proteomic results, both <italic>Clu</italic> and <italic>Stxbp2</italic> RNAs were detected in the RO. CLU is a chaperone protein that is present in both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argraves and Morales, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saewu et al., 2017</xref>). In the epididymis, CLU acts as a chaperone to direct luminal proteins to the sperm head surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saewu et al., 2017</xref>). Although the role of CLU in the RO remains unknown, we hypothesize that it is important for post-secretory protein guidance to the ovary. STXBP2 binds t-SNARE protein STX and is essential for the vesicle-apical surface membrane fusion stage of vesicle secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Söllner, 2003</xref>). The presence of STXBP2 in the candidate list, coupled with validation of the expression of <italic>Stxbp2</italic> RNA in the cells of the EOR, led us to investigate the presence of other components of the SNARE complex in the EOR.</p><p>The SNARE complex is comprised of a vesicle bound v-SNARE (Vamps), membrane bound t-SNARE (STXs), small GTPases (RABs), and syntaxin binding proteins (STXBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Söllner, 2003</xref>). Using IF staining, we confirmed the presence of STX3, as well as RAB11. Our ScRNA-seq data indicate that EOR cells also express <italic>Vamp7</italic> and <italic>Vamp</italic>8, which are v-SNAREs typically associated with STX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dingjan et al., 2018</xref>). Small GTPases, such as RAB11, are essential in the SNARE complex as they mediate the tethering of vesicle membranes to the apical membrane prior to membrane fusion. Taking into consideration the presence of all components of the SNARE complex, we hypothesize that the EOR utilizes the SNARE complex to promote apical secretion into the luminal fluid.</p><p>A protein that was prominent on the proteomic candidate list was IGFBP2. We found that <italic>Igfbp2</italic> was highly expressed in both the embryonic and adult RO transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarci et al., 2024</xref>). IGFBP2 is an ideal candidate protein to mediate ovarian function. The IGF1 pathway is essential for the regulation of follicular growth and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Talia et al., 2021</xref>). IGFBP2 can bind and sequester IGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenzweig, 2004</xref>), limiting its availability to promote follicle growth through activation of its receptor IGF1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amutha and Rajkumar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). We spatially validated the expression of <italic>Igfbp2</italic> in the EOR using HCR and noted high expression at E18.5, which was decreased by P7. This decrease correlated with the end of the first wave of follicle activation immediately after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mork et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). We also found variation in levels of <italic>Igfbp2</italic> in our adult SnRNA-seq data, where <italic>Igfpb2</italic> was enriched specifically in RO cells during the estrus stage compared to the diestrus stage of the estrous cycle. Based on these results, we hypothesize that high levels of estradiol during estrus trigger the EOR to produce IGFBP2 to sequester free IGF1 and decrease follicle growth and production of estradiol, maintaining ovary homeostasis.</p><p>The EOR is highly integrated with the extraovarian environment. We found that EOR cells are tightly surrounded in a dense web of vasculature. The RO may send or receive information through the vasculature, similar to other epithelial tissues in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>), raising the possibility that the RO participates in endocrine signaling. We also found that the EOR is directly contacted by TUJ1+ neurons, another avenue through which information may be entering or exiting the EOR. It is unclear whether the innervation contacts the epithelial cells specifically, similar to the way in which innervation contacts epithelial cells in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohórquez et al., 2015</xref>), or whether the innervation contacts the smooth muscle cells that surround the EOR to induce contraction, similar to the innervation-muscle interaction in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morizaki et al., 1989</xref>). We also found that the EOR is specifically associated with F4/80+LYVE1- macrophages. LYVE1 macrophages are predicted to have an angiogenic role in the adipose tissue surrounding the epididymis and could possibly be playing a similar role in the EOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2007</xref>). The integration of the EOR with the extraovarian environment, including vasculature, neurons, and macrophages, places the EOR in an ideal position to act as an antenna to interpret homeostatic signals and send information to the ovary. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, there is ample evidence that the ovary responds to physiologic levels of glycogen, insulin, amino acid levels, and changes in diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hubbard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laws and Drummond Barbosa, 2017</xref>). The mediator of this response has not been determined in mammals, but we hypothesize that this is the function of the RO. Interestingly, our scRNAseq data revealed expression of ESR1, PGR, INSR, and IGF1R, which are all critical hormone receptors regulating different aspects of female reproduction and health. Ongoing work will investigate how the EOR responds to hormones and other physiological signals, and whether proteins secreted by the EOR such as IGFBP2 respond to physiologic stimuli such as diet or immune status, and convey this information to the ovary.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crl:CD1(ICR)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain code: 022;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_CRL:022">IMSR_CRL:022</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #:000664;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tre-H2B-Gfp (Tg(tetO-HIST1H2BJ/GFP)47Efu/J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14671312/">14671312</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:J:90563;

Samples were then blocked for 1 hour with PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% horse serum, and 3% BSA. Samples were incubated overnight in primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution at 4°C (Key Resource Table). Samples then underwent three 30-minute washes in permeabilization solution and incubated overnight in secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution) and Hoechst vital dye solution diluted in blocking solution. The next day, samples underwent three 20-minute washes in permeabilization solution before being transferred into 100% PBS and stored at 4°C until ready for confocal imaging. Samples were mounted in DABCO mounting solution and stored at –20°C until imaged.

The RO was oriented to the left of the ovary with the oviduct at the top of the ovary. Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop CC (Adobe, Inc, CA) for final processing of channel overlay, brightness, contrast adjustment, and modification of red to ‘magenta’ (hue adjustment to –30). Channel color accessibility was determined via Photoshop colorblind proofing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dextran injections</title><p>Postnatal day 7 mice were euthanized, and the entire ovarian complex was dissected in PBS with magnesium and calcium. Samples were then placed on agar blocks (1.5%) soaked in PBS with magnesium and calcium. The distal tip of the EOR was identified and punctured using a tungsten needle (0.001 mm tip diameter, Fine Science Tools, 10130-05). A microinjection unit (Picospritzer III microinjector) and fine capillary glass needle (5–10 um) loaded with 2–3 nl dextran solution (1.25 mg/ml dextran, PBS, 0.05% phenol red) was used to inject dextran into the opening of the EOR.

Samples were then placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and ‘pressed’ for fluid using a disposable pellet pestle. The sample was then spun down and the supernatant was collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sample was then submitted to the Duke University Proteomics Core for mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis uncovered 4252 proteins present in the pressed fluid. To exclude proteins that may have contributed due to cell lysis, results were cross-referenced against a database of secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meinken et al., 2015</xref>). Overlapping proteins were then cross-referenced to our E16.5 ScRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbarci et al., 2024</xref>), and candidate proteins were determined by gene expression specific to the EOR cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis</title><p>The sample was subjected to a Bradford (Pierce) protein measurement and 10 ug was removed for downstream processing. The sample was brought to 4% SDS, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 20 min at 55°C, alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature, and then subjected to S-trap (Protifi) trypsin digestion using manufacturer-recommended protocols. Digested peptides were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 50 ul of 0.2% formic acid/2% acetonitrile. The sample was subjected to chromatographic separation on a Waters MClass UPLC equipped with a 1.8 μm Acquity HSS T3 C18 75 μm × 250 mm column (Waters Corp.) with a 90 min linear gradient of 5–30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nl/minute with a column temperature of 55°C. Data collection on the Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with a FAIMS Pro device was performed for three difference compensation voltages (–40v, –60v, –80v). Within each CV, a data-dependent acquisition mode of acquisition with a <italic>r</italic> = 120,000 (@ m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375–1500 with a target AGC value of 4e5 ions was performed. MS/MS scans with HCD settings of 30% were acquired in the linear ion trap in ‘rapid’ mode with a target AGC value of 1e4 and max fill time of 35 ms. The total cycle time for each CV was 0.66 s, with total cycle times of 2 s between like full MS scans. A 20 s dynamic exclusion was employed to increase depth of coverage. The total analysis cycle time for each sample injection was approximately 2 hours.</p><p>Raw LC-MS/MS data files were processed in Proteome Discoverer 3.0 (Thermo Scientific) and then submitted to independent Sequest database searches against a <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein database containing both forward and reverse entries of each protein. Search tolerances were 2 ppm for precursor ions and 0.8 Da for product ions using trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation (+57.0214 Da on C) was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation (+15.9949 Da on M) was considered a dynamic mass modifications.

In their study, Anbarci and colleagues have delineated the markers and developmental dynamics of three distinct regions of the RO - the intraovarian rete (IOR), the extraovarian rete (EOR), and the connecting rete (CR). Notably focusing on the EOR, the authors presented evidence illustrating that the EOR forms a convoluted tubular structure culminating in a dilated tip. Intriguingly, microinjections into this tip revealed luminal flow towards the ovary containing potentially secreted functional proteins. Additionally, the EOR cells exhibit associations with vasculature, macrophages, and neuronal projections, proposing the notion that the RO may play a functional role in ovarian development during critical ovariogenesis stages. By identifying marker genes within the RO, the authors have also suggested that the RO could serve as a potential structure linking the ovary with the neuronal system.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the reviewer commends the authors for their systematic research on the RO, shedding light on this overlooked structure in developing ovaries. Furthermore, the authors have proposed a series of hypotheses that are both captivating and scientifically significant, with the potential to reshape our understanding of ovarian development through future investigations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the manuscript lacks conclusive data to support many of its conclusions, the authors provide highly constructive discussions that offer valuable insights for future research on the rete ovarii in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96662.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Anbarci</surname><given-names>Dilara N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McKey</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Levic</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Capel</surname><given-names>Blanche</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not always clear what the novel findings are that this manuscript is presenting. It appears to be largely similar to the analysis done by McKey et al. (2022) but with more time points and molecular markers. The novelty of the present study's findings needs to be better articulated.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous study focused on placing the Rete Ovarii in the context of ovarian development. The current study focuses on the novel findings that the EOR is a active structure that sends fluid/information to the ovary. We show this by characterizing the presence of secretory proteins in the RO epithelial cells, by dye injections into the EOR and observing transport of the dye to the ovary, and by collection of EOR fluid followed by proteomic analysis. We also show that RO is embedded in an elaborate vascular network and contacted by neurons. None of this data was not discussed in the McKey 2022 paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Clarifications:</p><p>(1) Is there any comparative data on the proteomics of RO and rete testis in early development? With some molecular markers also derived from rete testis, it would be better to provide the data or references.</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no available proteomic datasets of the embryonic or early postnatal mouse Rete Testis or Epididymis. The authors agree that having this information would be very useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Although the size of RO and its components is quite small and difficult to operate, the researchers in this article had already been able to perform intracavitary injection of EOR and extract EOR or CR for mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, can EOR, CR, or IOR be damaged or removed, providing further strong evidence of ovarian development function?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to genetically ablate the RO by expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) in RO cells and adding DT. This approach was not successful in ablating the RO. We also tried to use Pax2/8 homo- and heterozygous mutants for ablation (as used in the McKey 2022 paper), but so far, we cannot find a genetic combination that ablates the RO, but not the oviduct, uterus and/or kidneys. We have also embarked on a study to surgically remove the RO. This assay is taking some time to optimize. The goal of the current study was to characterize the cells along the length of the RO and to present evidence that it is a secretory appendage of the ovary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although IOR is shown on the schematic diagram, it cannot be observed in the immunohistochemistry pictures in Figure 1 and Figure 3. The authors should provide a detailed explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>An annotation has been added to Figure 1 to indicate the IOR. As the images within the panels are of maximum intensity projections, it is often difficult to clearly see the IOR as it is deeper within the ovary. In Figure 3, the view of the ovary is from the ventral side: this view does not allow for clear visualization of the IOR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is a lack of conclusive data supporting many conclusions in the manuscript. Therefore, the paper's overall conclusions should be moderated until functional validations are conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moderated the conclusions where appropriate</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The introduction is relatively brief and does not mention some historical data/hypotheses on the role of the RO in ovarian function (e.g. regulation of meiotic entry) or development (e.g. Mayère et al., 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>Mayere 2022 was cited in line 57. Steins hypothesis about entry into meiosis has been added line 58.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) L82-84: It is stated that KRT8 was first identified as a potential RO marker by sc/snRNAseq (Anbarci et al., 2023) and then validated in this manuscript. However, KRT8 was used by McKey et al. (2022) as a RO marker, and they noted there that KRT8 was enriched in the EOR. It is not clear why McKey et al. is not cited as the primary reference validating KRT8 as an EOR marker.</p></disp-quote><p>The embryonic and neonatal timecourse description from KRT8 expression is first identified in this paper. McKey 2022 only highlights KRT8 at E18.5 A reference has been added to address this line 85</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1: Can the IOR be seen in these images? If so, please label.</p></disp-quote><p>The label has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) L107: It is hypothesized that &quot;the RO may respond to or interpret homeostatic cues.&quot; Can transcriptomics data shed light on what signals the RO may be capable of responding to? E.g. what receptors are expressed by cells of the RO (e.g. ER, LHCGR, FSHR)?</p></disp-quote><p>The RO expresses ESR1, PGR, INSR, IGF1R. The IOR exclusively expresses LHCGR and FSHR.This has been added to the manuscript line 309</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) L152: Mass spec was used to identify proteins secreted into the lumen of the RO. These proteins were then compared to the mammalian secretome to filter out possible nonsecreted protein contaminants. Finally, the candidates were compared to the RO scRNAseq data from Anbarci et al., (2023). This method gives a very conservative candidate list. However, it may also be informative to compare the sc/snRNA-seq gene list directly to the secretome to ID other possible candidate-secreted proteins that may not have been detected in the mass spec data set.</p></disp-quote><p>There are quite a number of secreted proteins that are also not actively secreted. This is a good suggestion for future analysis. For the current study we wanted to take a more conservative approach, and chose to do proteomics to determine proteins that are actively secreted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) L195: It is not clear if IGFBP2 is expressed by both OR and granulosa cells or only granulosa cells. It would be informative to know what ovarian cell types express both IGFBP2 and IGF1R (e.g. from sc/snRNA-seq)? This information is referenced in the discussion (L285-287) but would be better to reference it in the results section for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Both RO and granulosa cells express IGFBP2 and IGF1R. A sentence has been added to results for clarity. (Line 197)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) L295: &quot;...the RO participates in endocrine signaling...&quot; might be more accurate to say &quot;...the RO responds to endocrine signaling...&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agreed that this statement is more accurate and the changes have been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Several issues significantly affect the paper's quality in the current version. Firstly, there is a lack of conclusive data supporting many conclusions in the manuscript. For instance, the assertion in line 105 that &quot;EOR was directly innervated by neurons&quot; lacks substantial evidence beyond basic immunofluorescent staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the term “innervated” might be a step too far since we rely on IF evidence. We changed the wording of this sentence to say, “The EOR was directly contacted by neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In another pivotal experiment illustrated in Figure 3, the provided images lack temporal continuity and quantitative analysis, suggesting the incorporation of time-lapse imaging for improved sequential presentation in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>The microscope where we can perform injections cannot record movies. We have tried moving the rete to another microscope after injection, but so far, we have been unable to capture dextran moving through the RO. We therefore believe that transport is rapid, but future experiments will be needed to optimize this imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, relying solely on proteomics analysis, as seen in lines 188-189, makes it challenging to assert conclusions such as &quot;EOR actively secretes proteins.&quot; Therefore, the paper's overall conclusions should be moderated until functional validations are conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>The findings that (1) the cells of the EOR express SNARE complex proteins at their apical surfaces and (2) luminal fluid expelled from the EOR contains abundant secreted proteins strongly suggest that the RO is involved in active secretion. We use the word “suggest” in this sentence, lines 188-189 as we realize that further experiments should be done to validate this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the predominant methods in this study involve immunostaining and imaging. However, the current images exhibit a notable inconsistency in color definitions for different markers by the authors. For instance, in Figure 2.A/C, PAX8 is portrayed as cyan, while in D, it is represented in yellow. Similarly, in Figure 4, E-CAD is depicted using both cyan and yellow. Utilizing different colors for the same protein within a figure can significantly confuse readers' interpretation of the experiments. Rectifying these inconsistencies is essential to enhance the clarity and comprehension of the experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>These colors were chosen to be visible to those with color image impairments. We typically used cyan and magenta to emphasize the most important markers in the image. When E-Cad and KRT8 were often used to emphasized or landmark a structure by localization of these protein. When KRT8 and E-Cad were highlighted, they were represented in cyan and magenta for visibility. When these proteins were used as a landmark to orient the reader and not as the main point, they were labeled in yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At last, many markers in this study are derived from bulk and single-cell sequencing of developing RO. However, it seems that these important data were separated into another paper as a preprint. If this data were incorporated into the current manuscript, the manuscript would become more comprehensive for guiding future research on the RO.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we have single cell and single nuclei data from fetal and adult estrus and metestrus stages, we found that incorporating all this data into the present manuscript was overwhelming. Instead, we devoted another manuscript to presenting and validating that data. We believe a quick look at the sequencing manuscript will make this clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
