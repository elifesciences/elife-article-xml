We designed and implemented a novel device that allows Neuropixels probes to be customized for chronically implanted experiments in freely moving mice. We demonstrate the ease and utility of this approach in recording hundreds of neurons during an ethological behavior across weeks of experiments.

Electrophysiology in freely moving rodents has been used to observe place and grid cell dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), cortical dynamics during attentional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>), the role of oscillations during fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>), whisking behavior during exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kerekes et al., 2017</xref>), the effect of environmental context on neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Whitlock et al., 2012</xref>), and the control of sensory selection in divided attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>), to name a few. Although freely moving recordings can be challenging, recording from unrestrained mice enables researchers to investigate behaviors that involve natural movements and offers ethologically valid insight into neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Juavinett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>). Electrophysiology in freely moving animals is commonly performed with static electrode arrays or microdrives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Okun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vandecasteele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Voigts et al., 2013</xref>). These techniques have contributed much to the field, but are not at pace with the spatiotemporal coverage of cutting edge recording techniques, such as Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Steinmetz et al., 2018</xref>). Given the experimental tractability of the mouse and the increasing interest in ethological approaches in neuroscience research, we sought to develop a system that would enable researchers to perform repeatable high-yield recordings.</p><p>Recent advancements in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of high-density silicon probes known as Neuropixels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). The linear recording shank can record from 384 contacts across 3.84 mm (selectable from 960 available sites on a 10 mm length shank). In the mouse brain, which is at most 6 mm deep, this span of contacts means researchers can simultaneously record from more than half of the depth of the brain. Further, Neuropixels probes have low baseline noise levels (&lt;6 µV RMS), comparable to other silicon probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Steinmetz et al., 2018</xref>). However, Neuropixels probes also have on-site amplification and digitization, thereby enabling simultaneous recording of hundreds of cells across brain regions in an unprecedented low-noise, high-throughput manner. Importantly, methods have also been developed to automatically sort spikes from these recordings, and even correct for probe drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jaeyoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Neuropixels probes have already proved invaluable for neuroscientists conducting acute experiments in mice, or chronic experiments in freely moving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jaeyoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Krupic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Vélez-Fort et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is limited work with these probes in unrestrained mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Evans et al., 2018</xref>), likely because of the difficulty designing small, lightweight recording devices. Still, there is plentiful interest in behaviors and computations that involve movements of the animal’s head in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Vélez-Fort et al., 2018</xref>), foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lottem et al., 2018</xref>), pup retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>), or naturalistic fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). Further, although these probes have been very successful in freely moving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jaeyoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Krupic et al., 2018</xref>), there is not an established method to recover them after the experiment.</p><p>The opportunity to explant and reuse Neuropixels probes is transformative. Given the cost ($1000 each, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neuropixels.org/">https://www.neuropixels.org/</ext-link>) and limited availability of the probes, many researchers will only be able to use them if it is possible to recycle them after experiments. The ability to recover these probes would enable researchers to repeat their experiments in different animals, boost the statistical power of their experimental findings, and thus enhance reproducibility of experimental data. We therefore sought to design a device for the Neuropixels probe that would allow experimenters to chronically implant it, run an experiment, and explant it for future experiments.</p><p>Several major innovations are required to design a removable holder for chronic implants of Neuropixels probes in unrestrained mice. First, the current design of the probe has several components that need to be securely mounted onto the small mouse skull. Further, these sensitive onboard electronics need to be protected while the mouse is in its home cage. Most importantly, the shank of the probe must be secured to ensure consistent recordings across weeks of recording. In previous work, this required permanently mounting the biosensor using adhesive, which was effective but made it nearly impossible to remove the probe afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Okun et al., 2016</xref>). We also opted to use a 3D printed device in order to limit the use of acrylic in our design and ensure that it would be lighter than alternative designs.</p><p>To address these needs, we designed the Apparatus to Mount Individual Electrodes (AMIE), a device that fully encases and protects the sensitive onboard electronics of the Neuropixels probe, allowing long term, freely moving experiments. Moreover, the Neuropixels AMIE allows explantation and recycling. Our design and protocol is applicable to laboratories that wish to adapt the Neuropixels probe, or similar silicon probes, for recording in freely moving mice. With the drawings, materials and instructions, our device can be implemented not only by labs with years of expertise in electrophysiological recordings, but also by labs with different expertise that encounter a new need to study neural activity during behavior. Researchers that are using this technology in primates, rats, or in acute mice experiments may also find aspects of this approach useful.</p><p>With this design we have successfully recorded ~100 neurons simultaneously from unrestrained mice while observing freely moving behavior, and explanted the Neuropixels probe with a functioning recording shank. Further, because the AMIE is designed to allow implantation of a headbar (if desired), we recorded from the same mice in head-fixed experiments using systematic presentation of traditional visual stimuli. This feature of the AMIE allows experimenters to study neural activity in both psychophysical and ethological paradigms, affording the chance to build a bridge between the two.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design overview</title><p>The entire AMIE device weighs ~1.5 g (with cement:~2.0 g) and is assembled from three parts: the Neuropixels probe, the internal mount (IM), and external casing (EC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The IM attaches directly to the Neuropixels PCB board with adhesive and is the core of the assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). On the backside of the IM is a slot for a stereotax adapter (SA) which allows for easy handling of the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The IM attaches to the EC via a rail system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During the implantation procedure, all adhesive binding the assembly to the rodent’s skull exclusively contacts the EC, which acts as a protective shell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47188.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of Neuropixels AMIE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probe base mounted onto 3D printed internal casing and attached to machined metal stereotax adapter.

In early testing, we suspended the flex and headstage above the mouse’s head during recording. However, we found that the flex very quickly twisted, potentially damaging it. In addition, the headstage added swinging weight above the mouse’s head. With these observations in mind, we designed the encasing with a space for the headstage to be semi-permanently affixed. The probe flex wraps in an ‘S’ shape behind the implant, and attaches to the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In this way, the recording cable can be attached to the top of the implant, suspended above the mouse’s head.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Protocol overview</title><p>At least one day prior to implant, we attach the probe to the internal mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Silicone is added to further secure the base of the recording shank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Once this is dry, the internal mount is slid into the rails of the external casing and secured with cement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This cement will be drilled away in order to explant the probe. When the entire AMIE assembly is dry, it is ready to be implanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The surgery to implant the probe and encasing typically takes ~3 hr (see Materials and methods for details). During this surgery, a headbar can also be implanted, which does not interfere with the encasing. The external casing is the only part of the assembly that is attached to the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In a typical experiment, we implant the probe and encasing without the headstage attached. We wait ~3–4 days for the mouse to recover, and then add the headstage. The headstage can be removed after each experiment, if desired. After ~1 day of habituation to the additional weight of the headstage (~1 g), we begin recording during behavior.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47188.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mounting and implanting the Neuropixels probe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The internal mount (IM) is attached to the stereotax adapter (SA) with two screws, and probe is attached to the internal mount using an epoxy.

To evaluate the suitability of the AMIE for use during behavior, we assessed the impact of the device on both spontaneous and stimulus-driven movements. For spontaneous behavior, we analyzed video data taken while mice explored an open arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Even while tethered, implanted mice were typically agile and active (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref><underline>)</underline>. To quantify behavior and compare for implanted vs. naive mice, we calculated three metrics from video data: the percentage of time spent moving, the maximum velocity and the maximum acceleration. For all three metrics, considerable overlap was apparent in the distribution of values for implanted and naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although implanted mice moved slightly less and were slightly slower, the differences failed to reach significance for any metric. In fact, the mouse with the highest max acceleration was implanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, middle panel).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47188.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Behavior in implanted mice is comparable to naive mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral testing arena, with a camera to track the position of the mouse and a monitor on top to present visual stimuli.

The distribution of values for the metrics tested (mean/max velocity and max acceleration) again overlapped considerably for naïve vs. implanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although we observed no significant changes, a few naive mice achieved max acceleration during their escapes at values unobserved in implanted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). A possible explanation is that naive mice were free from the weight of the device and thus were able to accelerate very quickly when motivated to do so by a threatening stimulus. Taken together, these behavioral observations argue that although the presence of the AMIE may have idiosyncratically slowed mice slightly, they remained active in an open arena and showed species-typical responses to threatening stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neuropixels AMIE allows for 60–100 simultaneously recorded neurons across weeks of freely moving behavior</title><p>We recorded spiking activity across multiple brain areas during freely moving behavior over the course of 1–2 weeks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates an experiment with the probe implanted in medial visual cortex, subiculum, and midbrain. We isolated ~60–100 units for each session in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), during which the mouse moved freely around the arena and was exposed to looming stimuli. The number of single units we were able to isolate ranged across mice and experiments from ~20 to 145, but these numbers were fairly consistent within each mouse across recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This variability is likely dependent on the probe that was used (Phase 3A Option four probes used in mouse #3 and #4 had 270 rather than 374 recordable channels; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>), recording noise, and brain region. The absolute number of isolated units depends on the quality of the sorting and the experimenter’s manual curation of Kilosort output, which does present challenging edge cases and can be difficult to assess with drift in the experiment. Overall, these numbers are less than has been previously reported with acute experiments in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>), possibly because of the chronic recording environment or inability to completely reduce noise.

The ability to head-fix animals critical for two reasons.

Moreover, it affords the opportunity to measure neural activity in response to traditional psychophysical stimuli after the freely moving recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This makes it possible to connect the neural responses obtained during an unrestrained, ethological task with those obtained during more traditional sensory electrophysiology context (simple stimuli defined by parameters that are systematically varied).

With silicone added to the base of the shank, 4/4 explant attempts were successful, whereas 1/6 explants were successful without the silicone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Second, careful alignment of the probe, internal mount, and external casing will help ensure that the shank is being removed at the appropriate angle. Third, we only had success with Phase 3A Option three probes, suggesting that it may be easier with these, possibly due to the fact that the recording shanks on these probes are longer (10 mm) than Option 1 (5 mm). Fortunately, the shank of Phase 3B probes (now on the market) is also 10 mm long.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a significant advance in our ability to use and recycle high-density silicon probes such as Neuropixels. Our device, the AMIE, and accompanying methods, allow researchers to perform recordings in both restrained and unrestrained conditions, and critically, to explant and reuse probes after experiments. This approach will enable researchers to capitalize on important technological advances to understand the complexity of brain activity during ethological behaviors, and to bridge the gap between ethological and psychophysical behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gomez-Marin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although Neuropixels probes were not designed for unrestrained recording in mice, our AMIE customizes them so that they are ideally suited to this purpose. The AMIE has a slim enclosure for the probe as well as the headstage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), that mice can easily handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is worth noting that the Neuropixels design featured here is 3A, but the 3B (Neuropixels 1.0) version is the one currently commercially available. AMIE designs for both probe generations are available in the resources for this paper (see Materials and methods). Our design can also be readily adapted to other types of silicon probes (e.g. Neuronexus).</p><p>Unlike other electrophysiology systems, the current Neuropixels recording tether is not easily commutated due to heavy data demands. While this has not been a problem for recording from chronically-implanted rats in large arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>), it can be challenging for recordings from mice in smaller arenas, requiring constant monitoring of the mouse’s position and occasional intervention from the experimenter to untangle the cord. In our experience, this is manageable, requiring the experimenter to stop an hour-long session once or twice to unplug the cord and untangle. Importantly, here we report similar behavior both during open field exploration and looming-evoked escape responses in implanted and naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The Neuropixels AMIE can be used to record in both restrained and unrestrained conditions, with similar yields in numbers of isolated units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), although a direct comparison of yields across publications is challenging due to potential differences in spike sorting criteria across labs. The ability to restrain the mouse for passive stimulation enables researchers to obtain additional information about their recordings that may ultimately aid in uncovering the function of cells and brain regions. Remarkably, during our headfixed experiments we found that even cells deep in the midbrain showed clear visual responses to drifting gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This demonstrates the power of Neuropixels to uncover signals relevant to decision-making and other behaviors in uncharted brain territories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type/resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Medical-grade clear silicon adhesive</td><td>Mastersil</td><td>912MED</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Loctite Instant Adhesive 495</td><td>ULINE</td><td>S-7595</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Medigel CPF</td><td>Clear H20</td><td>74-05-5022</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Isoflurane</td><td>Allivet</td><td>50562</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>C and B Metabond 'B' Quick Base</td><td>Parkell</td><td>S398</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>C and B Metabond 'C' Quick Base</td><td>Parkell</td><td>S371</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>C and B Metabond Radiopaque L-Power</td><td>Parkell</td><td>S396</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Optibond Solo Plus</td><td>Kerr</td><td>31514</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Vetbond</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-361931</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Charisma A1 Syringe</td><td>Net32</td><td>66000085</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Eye Ointment</td><td>Rugby</td><td>370435</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Dental Cement</td><td>Stoelting</td><td>5217307</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>DiI</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>D282</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Silicone Gel Kit</td><td>Dow Coning</td><td>3–4860.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound/drug</td><td>Bleach</td><td>Amazon</td><td>B01K8HT54G</td><td>Any brand bleach ok</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Neuropixel Probe</td><td>Neuropixel Stock Center (Neuropixels.org)</td><td>Neuropixel 1.0 Probe</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>3D Printed Internal Mount</td><td>‘this paper’ - Github repository</td><td>IM_Neuropixel1.stl</td><td>Internal mount design file (.stl) can be downloaded from the following github repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/churchlandlab/ChronicNeuropixels">https://github.com/churchlandlab/ChronicNeuropixels</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>3D Printed External Casing</td><td>‘this paper’ - Github repository</td><td>EC_Neuropixel1.stl</td><td>same as above</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Sterotax Adapter</td><td>‘this paper’ - Github repository</td><td>stereotax adapter v4.ipt</td><td>same as above</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>2-56A Screws</td><td>Amazon</td><td>B00F34U238</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Silver Wire</td><td>WPI</td><td>AGW1010</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>4’ post holder with thumbscrew</td><td>Thorlabs</td><td>PH4</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Slim right angle bracket</td><td>Thorlabs</td><td>AB90B</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Aluminum Breadboard</td><td>Thorlabs</td><td>MB624</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>M6 Cap Screw</td><td>Thorlabs</td><td>SH6MS20</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>M6 Nut</td><td>Thorlabs</td><td>HW-KIT2/M</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Kapton Tape</td><td>ULINE</td><td>S-7595</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Kimwipes</td><td>Kimtech</td><td>34120</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Oxygen Cylinders</td><td>Airgas</td><td>OX USP300</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Mouse Anesthesia System with Isoflurance Box</td><td>Parkland Scientific</td><td>V3000PK</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Small rodent sterotax fitted with anesthesia mask</td><td>Narishige</td><td>SG-4N</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Dental Drill</td><td>Osada</td><td>EXL-M40</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>0.9 mm burrs for micro drill</td><td>Fine Science Tools</td><td>19007–09</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>T/Pump Warm Water Recirculator</td><td>Kent Scientific</td><td>TP-700</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Warming Pad for warm water recirculator</td><td>Kent Scientific</td><td>TPZ</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Cotton Applicators</td><td>Fisher Scientific</td><td>19-062-616</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Surgical Spears</td><td>Braintree Scientific Inc.</td><td>SP 40815</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Printing and machining parts</title><p>To conduct this experiment, researchers will need Neuropixels probes.

Mice were given medicated (carprofen) food cups (MediGel CPF, Clear H20 74-05-5022) 1–2 days prior to surgery.</p><p>During surgery, the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane. We cut away the skin and cleared any connective tissue. Tissue at the edges of the skull was glued down with Vetbond (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. no. sc-361931). The skull was cleared and dried, using a skull scraper or blade to add additional texture. A boomerang shaped custom Titanium headbar was cemented to the skull, just posterior to the eyes, near Bregma. A burr hole was drilled for the ground screw, which was carefully screwed into the skull. We applied Optibond Solo Plus (Kerr, cat No. 31514) to the skull, and used UV light to cure it. We used Charisma (Net32, cat. No. 66000085) to create a base for the implant, and add additional support around the ground screw. Using a dental drill, a small craniotomy (1–2 mm) was made over visual cortex (2–2.5 ML,−3.4–3.5 AP relative to Bregma). The entire Neuropixels assembly (SA, IM, and EC) was placed in the stereotax. After carefully applying DiI (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. D282, 0.5% in DMSO) to the probe, the shank was slowly lowered into the brain at a ~ 16 degree angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The ground wire is wrapped around the ground screw, and Metabond cement was carefully applied to attach the EC to the skull.

Implanted mice were tested in an arena with an inset nest; the data presented here are random excerpts of the mouse’s activity while outside of the nest.

Events are temporally (&lt;1 ms) and spatially (~50 µm radius) consistent events with amplitudes (on any site) that exceed six times the median absolute deviation (MAD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we computed the signal-to-noise ratio SNR for each event. As previously described, the event SNR is the ratio of peak amplitude of the site with largest amplitude (negative peak) in the event to 0.6745 × MAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jun et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Probe explantation</title><p>To explant the probe, we first anesthetized the mouse with isoflurane and loosely positioned the mouse into the earbars. The SA was placed in the stereotax and aligned with its slot in the IM. We carefully lowered the SA into the IM, and put the two screws back into place. It was important that the SA was properly aligned with the IM so that no unnecessary tension was placed on the implant. We carefully drilled away the cement at the boundary of the IM and EC, unraveled or cut the ground wire, and slowly raised the SA+IM+probe assembly. The mouse was perfused and the brain was fixed in 4% PFA for sectioning. We were able to find DiI signals in the brain even 1 month after implantation (we did not test later time points).</p><p>A detailed surgical protocol for mounting, implanting, and explanting the probe is located on Github (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ChronicNeuropixels">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ChronicNeuropixels</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work represents the collective input and knowledge of a burgeoning Neuropixels community (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuropixels.org">http://www.neuropixels.org</ext-link>).</p><p>We would like to acknowledge Tim Harris for his leadership on the development of the Neuropixels probes and his constant encouragement of this project.</p><p>The UCL Neuropixels course, taught by Nick Steinmetz, Matteo Carandini, Andrew Peters, Adam Kampff, was imperative in getting this project off the ground (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/courses">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/courses</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nick Steinmetz (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has consolidated their comments and discussion into this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have presented a method and specifications for achieving chronic Neuropixels recordings in freely-moving mice and, importantly, for recovering the probes afterwards. Due to the financial cost and limited availability of Neuropixels probes, chronic implantation of these probes is currently challenging (i.e., researchers may not want to &quot;waste&quot; a probe by chronically implanting it). This paper presents a potential solution to this problem. Many labs have ordered Neuropixels probes since they were made available, so reviewers agreed that these methods provide a useful resource for many in the community. The proposed system consists of two main components: 1) an internal mount permanently fused to the probe base and 2) a removable casing (Apparatus to Mount Individual Electronics: AMIE) that adapts the probe and internal mount to a chronic implant. In addition to carrying the probe, the AMIE protects and holds the flex-cable and head stage. Reviewers found the paper to be clear and appreciated the authors' honesty about potential pitfalls (e.g., broken probes, early attempts with low yields). Reviewers appreciated that the authors made their surgical protocol and 3D printer files publicly available. However, a number of major concerns were raised that need to be addressed before the paper can be deemed suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers felt that the manuscript misses key data showing that the Neuropixel can be re-used without a significant drop in signal quality. Specifically, in Table 1 average numbers of isolated units are missing for NP13, 15 and 16 (i.e. the cases in which Neuropixels were implanted and then successfully explanted and re-implanted in a second mouse). These numbers are key (particularly NP16), as the authors claim that the &quot;quality of the recording did not noticeably change in the second mouse&quot;, but do not provide any quantitative data to support their claim. Instead, they show 5 example units from NP14 and 16, which only demonstrates they could find at least 5 units in both recordings (Figure 6C). Additional quantification would also be bolster the manuscript's reusability claims. It would be useful to compare noise levels on the first implantation to that on the second for a given probe. This can be computed straightforwardly e.g. with this function (https://github.com/cortex-lab/spikes/blob/master/analysis/computeRawRMS.m). The authors should also run kilosort2 on all recordings (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2), which automatically assigns 'good' and 'mua' labels. This is not necessarily perfectly accurate, but at least it would provide a rapid and unbiased analysis that would be comparable to yields reported in other recordings (e.g. comparable to this dataset https://janelia.figshare.com/articles/Eight-probe_Neuropixels_recordings_during_spontaneous_behaviors/7739750). Alternatively, the authors could repeat the manual process that they did for some recordings already for at least one recording from each of the other mice in Table 1. The same argument applies to the comparison between restrained and unrestrained, which needs similar automatic (i.e., KS2) or manual quantification or both. The reusability of the probes is critical for the paper's significance, because (as the authors note) techniques without explanation already exist to chronically implant Neuropixels in freely moving mice and re-use (Introduction, fifth paragraph, Okun, 2016).</p><p>2) A further concern is how the authors demonstrate that behavior in implanted vs. naïve mice is comparable. Quantitatively, they do this by reporting non-significant p-values on rank-sum tests of differences between behavioral measures in implanted vs. naïve mice. However, using non-significant p-values to argue for the null-hypothesis is not statistically valid; failing to reject the null hypothesis is not evidence for the null hypothesis. It's just as likely that the authors didn't use enough mice to have sufficient statistical power to show the effect. Indeed, visual inspection of Figure 3 makes this appear highly likely – clear changes in several activities can be seen in Figure 3 (most notably for % time moving, max acceleration and mean escape velocity). For instance, time moving declines from about 40% to 30%, and it's hard to believe that with additional samples this would remain non-significant, especially given that p = .0502. Relatedly, the authors claim that the correct critical value should be p = .0167 due to multiple comparisons. The meaning of a multiple-comparisons correction is difficult to interpret when the researcher's goal is to show that a difference isn't significant. Then, one could perform rank-sum tests on an arbitrarily large number of behavioral measures to reduce the critical value, and find no differences whatsoever between populations. A simple and more interpretable approach would be to simply report the effect sizes instead of p-values. Though there is a small reduction in exploratory behavior/ escape velocity, this is relatively small and essentially unavoidable due to the weight of any probe/casing being placed on the mouse's head.</p><p>3) Currently shipping probes do not have the same geometry as the probes described in this manuscript. That is, the probes that are now on sale at neuropixels.org have a slightly different shape than the &quot;Phase 3A&quot; probes employed in this paper. The authors need to describe how their system could be adapted to other probe geometries (and future designs will almost certainly evolve in this regard). It would be extremely valuable if the authors could provide an updated design based on the changes to the probes. Even though it may only be subtly different, it will save others from having to replicate the work.</p><p>4) Reviewers had trouble visualizing the exact shape of the pieces and how they fit together. One suggestion was that the authors could make a short video that shows someone putting the pieces together by hand with a dummy probe. Some sort of additional visual aid such as this would greatly help readers to understand what screws onto what, how things slide, etc. Another suggestion was that it could perhaps somehow be done with the 3D renderings from Figure 1.</p><p>5) A concern was raised about whether the authors' system for recovering the probe might compromise the stability of the probe, since most of the body of the probe itself is not really directly attached to the skull, but only via a thin 3D printed piece. A potential way to test this that was suggested could be to plot a comparison of waveforms like in Figure 4F, but for the same neuron recorded during periods of high acceleration versus stationary periods. An even better test would be to compute a metric of waveform similarity between moving and stationary periods, which could be compared to a recording in which the probe was attached in a fixed way. Perhaps such a recording would be available from Evans et al., who may have performed chronic recordings in freely moving animals with a probe fixed in place in the manner of Okun et al., 2016. Other reasonable ideas about how to address this concern would also be acceptable.</p><p>6) Some discussion of why this technology would be useful even if probes were less expensive and more accessible (or how/whether the approach would be modified under such conditions) would help extend the impact of this paper, assuming that limitations of the neuropixels purchasing scheme will be alleviated in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47188.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers felt that the manuscript misses key data showing that the Neuropixel can be re-used without a significant drop in signal quality.

We have added the number of isolated units for our re-implanted probe (NP16/Mouse #7) as well as an additional mouse (NP15/Mouse# 6) to Figure 4C, and have added the average number of isolated units to Table 1.

We have added new panels to Figure 6 that address the concern about noise levels on the probe. These panels (6D and 6E) show the detected event rate and SNR for the re-implanted probe (using the recommended code and following the example in Jun et al., 2017). Although there is a drop in detected event rate and a slight drop in SNR in the re-implanted probe, we note that it is still possible to isolate many units (43.6 ± 17.8). Two points should be considered when evaluating this yield. These are described below.</p><p>First, variability across yields in individual animals even for a new probe (Figure 4C) leaves open the possibility that yields on re-implanted probes might sometimes be higher than what we observed. To test this, we sorted an additional, previously unsorted dataset from a new mouse (NP13) which had a probe that was re-implanted after being in NP12. We had not originally included NP13 in this dataset because of issues with the grounding wire and screw after surgery, enabling us to only record one session. We are pleased to report that sorting of this session yielded 145 well-isolated, ‘good’ units. This number is now included on Figure 4C, highlighting that high yields are possible even for re-implanted probes.</p><p>Second, yields of ~40 neurons, while not ideal, are likely acceptable to many researchers because Neuropixels probes are still available in very limited numbers. The recent release of 3B probes from IMEC was a first step towards increased availability, but even many well-established systems neuroscience labs were only granted 10/year (indeed, the last author of this paper was provided with that number). This is a small number even for a single project, especially one that involves a trainee who will have to learn to use the probes and may even break a few. For such labs, which are probably the vast majority in Neuroscience, a yield of 43 simultaneously recorded neurons for a re-implanted probe has tremendous value.</p><p>The corresponding results text can be found in the subsection “Printing and machining parts”. We thank the reviewer for pushing us to include additional data on yields and feel that this has greatly strengthened the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also run kilosort2 on all recordings (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2), which automatically assigns 'good' and 'mua' labels.

To evaluate whether Kilosort2 differed from our approach, we implemented it for two separate analysis. First, we implemented Kilosort2 on the first experiment with the re-implanted probe in NP16. Neuron yields with Kilosort2 were similar to our original sorting method, which was reassuring (77 for</p><p>Kilosort2 compared to 69 with our original sorting). The slightly higher yield for KS2 may reflect the conservativeness of our original approach. Second, we implemented Kilosort2 during a head-restrained experiment and again, our original yields were similar, if slightly more conservative (63 for Kilosort2 compared to 60 for our original approach). The similar neuron yields for our original approach and KS2 suggest that our criteria for spike sorting were effective: robust units with clear waveforms, reasonable interspike intervals, and minimal drift in depth. The similarity of our original approach to Kilosort2 made us disinclined to re-analyze all the datasets used for the comparisons in the paper. Nevertheless, we include the numbers above in the revised manuscript (subsection “Researchers can also conduct headfixed recordings to further characterize neurons”) as readers may find these observations useful in evaluating spike sorting methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A further concern is how the authors demonstrate that behavior in implanted vs. naïve mice is comparable.

Ultimately, this does not change our claim because none of our comparisons achieved p&lt;0.05, better yet the corrected p&lt;0.0167 criteria. Text in the Results, Materials and methods, and Figure 3 legend has been changed to reflect this. Further, the overall language is toned down: the key conclusion is that implanted mice remain active and show species-typical behavior. Small and idiosyncratic changes in speed are in keeping with this conclusion. The new text in the Results section reads:</p><p>“To evaluate the suitability of the AMIE for use during behavior, we assessed the impact of the device on both spontaneous and stimulus-driven movements. […] Taken together, these behavioral observations argue that although the presence of the AMIE may have idiosyncratically slowed mice slightly, they remained active in an open arena and showed species-typical responses to threatening stimuli.”</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation to report effect sizes for these comparisons.

We are working with collaborators at CSHL and UC San Diego to test these new designs with the Neuropixels 1.0 probes and will continue to update the available designs as needed, including making them available in Autodesk, which is freely available to students.

For a session from Mouse</p><p>#7 (implanted with a recycled probe), we defined periods where the mouse was moving</p><p>(&gt;15 cm/sec) or stationary (&lt;5 cm/sec). A velocity of 15 cm/s is quite fast, while also common enough to enable the extraction of enough waveforms to compute a mean. We computed mean waveforms from 50 different spikes from 9 different units. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows, these waveforms are almost identical regardless of whether the mouse is moving or stationary. We computed correlation coefficients for moving vs. stationary mean waveforms, finding that all waveforms were very highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.00001).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47188.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of mean waveforms (n=50) across periods where the mouse was moving (&gt;15 cm/sec) or stationary (&lt;5 cm/sec).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47188-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Several of these units show notable changes in absolute voltage, which could be for a number of reasons. For one, there are slow oscillations in the absolute voltage of the signal over time, so extracting a limited number of waveforms from different periods of the recording may reflect these slow changes in voltage. Second, it could be that the probe does slightly move relative to the recorded neuron during movement periods, leading to a change in the extracellularly recorded voltage. Additional analyses across multiple mice and probe depths would be needed to identify the cause of this shift. Regardless, it is clear that the waveforms recorded during movement and stationary periods are almost identical, providing further evidence that these recordings using our device are stable and that it is possible to isolate the same unit even in periods of fast movement. During manual spike sorting, we were also able to observe whether the waveforms changed over the course of the experiment, and found them to be quite stable.</p><p>Although we feel this was an important check, a full treatment of this topic warrants many additional analyses (e.g., multiple mice, different parameters to define movement periods) that are beyond the scope of this paper. We are however open to suggestions to include a reference in the manuscript to the preliminary analyses we have conducted if the reviewers or editors think this would be useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some discussion of why this technology would be useful even if probes were less expensive and more accessible (or how/whether the approach would be modified under such conditions) would help extend the impact of this paper, assuming that limitations of the neuropixels purchasing scheme will be alleviated in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In the revised Introduction, we highlight 3 advantages of our design. First, the AMIE can be readily adapted to different types of silicon probes, extending its significance beyond Neuropixels probes. Second, the AMIE is lighter than alternative designs because of the limited use of acrylic. Finally, by providing the drawings, materials and instructions, our device can be implemented not only by labs with years of expertise in electrophysiological recordings, but also by labs with different expertise that discover a new need to study neural activity during behavior. Existing methods for implanting electrodes are non-standardized, and rely on designs and surgical protocols that are part of lab lore and are not publicly available. This leaves new researchers in the dark about how to implant probes securely. Our thorough protocols make the AMIE within reach of these labs. Even if such labs are amongst those rare researchers without the need to re-use probes, they will still benefit from the use of standardized, open source hardware that this manuscript provides.</p></body></sub-article></article>
