Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from a single cell and its effect on the neighboring cells. Here, by observing confluent Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells expressing fluorescent biosensors, we demonstrate that calcium transients in a single cell cause PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in neighboring cells. By in vivo imaging, RSPA was also observed in the basal layer of the mouse epidermis. Experiments with an optogenetic tool revealed a switch-like PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge in response to the increasing cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The cell density of MDCK cells correlated with the frequencies of calcium transients and the following RSPA. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation also enhanced the frequency of RSPA in MDCK and in vivo. Thus, the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge is regulated temporally by calcium transients and ERK activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prostaglandin

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is an eicosanoid lipid mediator that regulates a plethora of homeostatic functions, including vascular permeability, immune response, and mucosal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narumiya, 2007</xref>). The metabolic pathway of PGE<sub>2</sub> production, which is a major branch of the arachidonic acid cascade, was extensively studied in the mid to late 20th century. This cascade starts from the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Increased intracellular calcium induces the translocation and activation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and perinuclear membrane, where cPLA2 cleaves arachidonic acid out of the membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evans et al., 2001</xref>). The arachidonic acid is then presented to cyclooxygenases, COX1 and COX2, to yield PGH<sub>2</sub>, which is further converted to PGE<sub>2</sub> by prostaglandin E synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith and Langenbach, 2001</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesized de novo is secreted to the extracellular space either by passive diffusion or by active transport by multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reid et al., 2003</xref>). The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> exerts its actions by acting on four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), EP1 to EP4, expressed in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Narumiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Regan, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although it is largely believed that the PGE<sub>2</sub> action is primarily regulated by the expression and activation of COX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinski, 2012</xref>), cPLA2 appears to play a more important role in the short-term regulation of PGE<sub>2</sub> production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leslie, 2015</xref>). It was shown that the secretion of arachidonic acid is induced within a few minutes after the calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to endo-membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirabayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evans et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, ERK and p38 MAP kinases also contribute to the activation of cPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 1993</xref>), which may be calcium-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gijón et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, these earlier biochemical studies did not elucidate the dynamics of the production and secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> at the single-cell level, leaving many questions unanswered. For example, do all cells contribute to the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>? Does each cell keep secreting PGE<sub>2</sub> upon stimulation?</p><p>Genetically encoded biosensors based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) allow us to visualize the dynamics of intracellular signaling molecules at the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyawaki and Niino, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwald et al., 2018</xref>). The development of transgenic mice expressing FRET biosensors has opened a window to the visualization of signaling molecule activity in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terai et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, by using the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and ERK MAP kinase as surrogate markers, we can also visualize the intercellular communications mediated by Gs-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors in live tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Konishi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we show that PGE<sub>2</sub> discharged from a single cell causes radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in neighboring cells in tissue culture and the mouse epidermis. By combining a chemical biology approach, optogenetic stimulation, and a simulation model, we quantitatively analyzed the PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion and found that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge is regulated temporally by calcium transients and quantitatively by growth factor signaling and cell density.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates RSPA</title><p>In an attempt to understand intercellular communication under physiological conditions, we observed the PKA activity of Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by using the FRET biosensor Booster-PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We noticed that PKA activation propagates from a single cell to neighboring cells under a confluent condition. We named this phenomenon radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) and pursued underlying mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In a typical example, approximately 100 neighboring cells located within a 100 µm distance exhibit firework-like spread of PKA activation, which decays within several minutes. To characterize this phenomenon without preoccupations, we developed a program to identify and characterize RSPA under various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The frequency, but not the radius, of RSPA depended on the cell density; that is, RSPA was observed only when cells were maintained at more than 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The probability of RSPA in each cell was also increased in a cell density-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To examine whether the PKA activation correlates with increased intracellular cAMP concentration, we employed another FRET biosensor for cAMP, hyBRET-Epac, and performed a similar experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ponsioen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Although the increment of the FRET ratio was not so remarkable as that of Booster-PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This discrepancy between hyBRET-Epac and Booster-PKA may be partially explained by the difference in the dynamic ranges for cAMP signaling in each FRET biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watabe et al., 2020</xref>). Previous transcriptome analysis of MDCK cells showed that ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor EP2 are the most abundant GsPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shukla et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we examined the contribution of the ATP receptor and PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 by using specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Inhibitors against EP2, EP4, and COX, but not the ATPase apyrase, abolished RSPA, indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates RSPA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Radial spread of PKA activation (RSPA) in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme of Booster-PKA, a PKA sensor.

We previously observed that ERK MAP kinase activation is propagated radially among the basal layer cells of the mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>), but we failed to observe a similar propagation of PKA activation. We reasoned that this failure was due to the low frequency and short duration of this phenomenon.

In HeLa cells, we quantitated PGE<sub>2</sub> secreted from a single cell by combining fluorescence microscopy and a simulation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watabe et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>It would be clear that the physiological relevance of RSPA remains. In MDCK cells, the treatment of NSAIDs, which perturb RSPA, did not show a detectable change in cell growth, ERK wave propagation during collective migration, migration velocity, cell survival, or apoptosis. In mice epidermis, the frequency of RSPA was not remarkably changed by inflammation or corrective migration, evoked by TPA treatment or wound, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge from a single cell is a stochastic and switch-like event in the confluent MDCK cells and mouse epidermis. The secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> can transiently activate PKA in cells within a few hundred micrometers from the producer cell. The question of why cells adopt this pulsatile rather than continuous secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> awaits the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>ONO-AE3-208, PF-04418948, clozapine N-oxide, and PGE<sub>2</sub> were purchased from Cayman Chemical.

What the author discovered is that waves of PKA occur both in vitro, in MDCK epithelial monolayers, and in vivo, in the ear epidermis in mice. The PKA waves are the consequence PGE2 discharge, that in turn is triggered by Calcium bursts. Calcium level and ERK activity intensity control that mechanism by acting at different levels.</p><p>This article is a technological tour de force using different biosensors and optogenetic actuators. However, what makes this article interesting is the ability of combining these tools together to dissect a complex signaling pathway at the single-cell level and with highly dynamic processes. For this reason, this paper represents the essence of modern cell biology and paves the way for the cell biology of the future.</p><p>However, we think that the paper in this stage is still partly descriptive in its nature, and more measurements are needed to increase the strength of the mechanistic insights. Here below the points that we believe that need some improvement.</p><p>1)Even though the phenomenon of PGE2 signal propagation is elegantly demonstrated and well described, the whole paper is mostly of descriptive nature - the PGE2 signal is propagated via intercellular communication and requires Ca transients as well as MAPK activity, however function of these RSPAs in dense epithelium is not taken into consideration.</p><p>What is the function of these RSPAs in cellular crowding? - Does it promote cell survival or initiate apoptosis? Does it feed into epithelial reorganization during cellular crowding? Still something else? The authors discuss possible roles of this phenomenon in cell competition context, but show no experimental or statistical efforts to answer this question. I believe some additional analysis or simple experiment would help to shed some light on the functional aspect of RSPAs and increase the importance of all the elegant demonstrations and precise experimental setups that the manuscript is rich of. Monolayer experiments using some perturbations that challenge the steady state of epithelial homeostasis - drug treatments/ serum deprivation/ osmotic stress/ combined with live cell imaging and statistical methods that take into account local cell density might provide important answers to these questions. The authors could consider following some of these ideas to improve the overall value of the manuscript.</p><p>1. In the line 82-84 the authors claim: &quot;We found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA&quot;. In our opinion, this conclusion is not well-supported by the results. The authors should at least show that some measurement of the two patterns show correlation. Are the patterns of cAMP of the same size as the pattern of PKA? Do they have the same size depending on cell density? Do they occur at the same frequency as the PKA patterns, depending on the cell density? Do they have an all or nothing activation as PKA or their activation is shading with the distance from the source?</p><p>2. In general, the absolute radius of the waves is not a good measurement for single-cell biology studies, especially when comparing different densities or in vivo vs in vitro experiments. We suggest the authors to add the measurement of the number of the cells involved in the waves (or the radius expressed in number of cells).</p><p>3. In 6D, the authors should also show the single-cell trajectories to understand better the correlation between PKA and ERK peaks. Is the huger variability in ERK activity ratio dues to different peak time or different ERK activity levels in different cells? The authors should show both the variability in the time and intensity.</p><p>4. In lines 130-132, the authors write, &quot;This observation indicates that the amount of PGE2 secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE2 secretion&quot;. How could the author exclude that the amount of PGE2 is not regulated in its intensity as well? For sure, there is a threshold effect regarding calcium, but this doesn't mean that PGE2 secretion can be further regulated, e.g. by further increasing calcium concentration or by other mechanisms.</p><p>5. The manuscript shows that not all calcium transients are followed by RSPAs. Does the local cell density/crowding increase the probability of overlap between calcium transients and RSPAs?</p><p>The revision of the Watabe T paper provides additional data and analyses in response to the reviewers' comments. On our side, we are satisfied by these improvements.</p><p>In the answer to our first question, the authors claim that they did multiple experiments to understand the function of RSPA in MDCK cell, all providing negative results. The authors could consider publishing the negative results as well, as they can be useful for the community.</p><p>In sum, we are convinced of the value of this article, and we thank the authors for the work that has been done.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86727.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study visualizes a specific localized form of cell-to-cell communication and conveys very well with what dynamics and sensitivity this biological phenomenon occurs.</p><p>Using a FRET-based PKA biosensor, the authors observed that radial localized kinase activity changes spontaneously occur in adjacent cells of certain cell density. This phenomenon of radial propagation of PKA activity changes in groups of cells was further mechanistically elucidated and characterized. Interestingly, the authors found that individual cells in the cell groups form spontaneous Ca2+ transients, which at a certain strength can trigger the biosynthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 then acts on the neighboring cells and triggers the increase of cAMP levels and the associated activation of the PKA via G-protein-coupled receptors (EP2 and EP4). In systematic, well-structured experiments, it was then found that the frequency of occurrence of such radial activations depends not only on the cell density but also on the activation state of the ERK MAP kinase pathway.</p><p>Strength</p><p>In this study, the authors skillfully used various modern genetically encoded biosensors and other tools such as optogenetic tools to visualize and characterize an interesting biological phenomenon of cell-to-cell communication. The insights gained with these investigations produce a better understanding of the dynamics, sensitivity, and spatial extent with which such communications can occur in a cell network. It is also worth noting that the authors have not limited the studies to 2D cell culture in vitro, but were also able to confirm the findings in an animal model.</p><p>Weakness</p><p>The work is hardly conclusive as to the actual biological significance of the phenomenon. It would be interesting to know more under which physiological and pathological conditions PGE2 triggers such radical PKA activity changes. It is not well explained in which tissues and organs and under what conditions this type of cell-to-cell communication could be particularly important.</p><p>The authors also do not explain further why in certain cells of the cell clusters Ca2+ signals occur spontaneously and thus trigger the phenomenon. What triggers these Ca2+ changes? And why could this be linked to certain cell functions and functional changes?</p><p>What explains the radius and the time span of the radial signal continuation? To what extent are these factors also related to the degradation of PGE2? The work could be stronger if such questions and their answers would be experimentally integrated and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86727.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Watabe</surname><given-names>Tetsuya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yamahira</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Takakura</surname><given-names>Kanako</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thumkeo</surname><given-names>Dean</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Narumiya</surname><given-names>Shuh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kyoto University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kyoto</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Terai</surname><given-names>Kenta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tokushima University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokushima</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study reports investigation of the dynamics of PKA at the single-cell level in in vitro and in epithelia in vivo.

I believe some additional analysis or simple experiment would help to shed some light on the functional aspect of RSPAs and increase the importance of all the elegant demonstrations and precise experimental setups that the manuscript is rich of. Monolayer experiments using some perturbations that challenge the steady state of epithelial homeostasis - drug treatments/ serum deprivation/ osmotic stress/ combined with live cell imaging and statistical methods that take into account local cell density might provide important answers to these questions. The authors could consider following some of these ideas to improve the overall value of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer’s comment. Although we have intensively tried to identify the physiological relevance of RSPA, we could not detect the function at present.</p><p>In the case of MDCK, the treatment of NSAIDs, which cancels RSPA, did not affect its cell growth, ERK wave propagation during collective migration, migration velocity, cell survival, or apoptosis. In mouse epidermis, the frequency of RSPA was NOT affected by inflammation and collective cell migration, evoked by TPA treatment and wound, respectively.</p><p>Notably, RSPA also occurs in the normal epidermis, implying its relevance in homeostasis. However, at the current stage, we believe that the PGE2 dynamics and its regulation mechanism in the normal epidermis would be worth reporting to researchers in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the line 82-84 the authors claim: &quot;We found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA&quot;. In our opinion, this conclusion is not well-supported by the results. The authors should at least show that some measurements of the two patterns show correlation. Are the patterns of cAMP of the same size as the pattern of PKA? Do they have the same size depending on cell density? Do they occur at the same frequency as the PKA patterns, depending on the cell density? Do they have an all or nothing activation as PKA or their activation is shading with the distance from the source?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text (line85)</p><p>“Although the increment of the FRET ratio was not so remarkable as that of Booster-PKA, Wwe found that the pattern of cAMP concentration change is very similar to the activity change of PKA, indicating that a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GsPCR) mediates RSPA.

In general, the absolute radius of the waves is not a good measurement for single-cell biology studies, especially when comparing different densities or in vivo vs in vitro experiments. We suggest the authors add the measurement of the number of the cells involved in the waves (or the radius expressed in number of cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have analyzed our results to demonstrate the number of cells as in Fig2E, which would be easy for readers to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In 6D, the authors should also show the single-cell trajectories to understand better the correlation between PKA and ERK peaks. Is the huger variability in ERK activity ratio dues to different peak time or different ERK activity levels in different cells? The authors should show both the variability in the time and intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a few representative results as Fig. S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In lines 130-132, the authors write, &quot;This observation indicates that the amount of PGE2 secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE2 secretion&quot;. How could the author exclude that the amount of PGE2 is not regulated in its intensity as well? For sure, there is a threshold effect regarding calcium, but this doesn't mean that PGE2 secretion can be further regulated, e.g. by further increasing calcium concentration or by other mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have modified the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The manuscript shows that not all calcium transients are followed by RSPAs. Does the local cell density/crowding increase the probability of overlap between calcium transients and RSPAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have also hypothesized the model. However, we did not see the correlation that the reviewer pointed out. Currently, the increment of the RSPA frequency at high density is partially caused by the increment of calcium transients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The work is hardly conclusive as to the actual biological significance of the phenomenon. It would be interesting to know more under which physiological and pathological conditions PGE2 triggers such radial PKA activity changes. It is not well explained in which tissues and organs and under what conditions this type of cell-to-cell communication could be particularly important.</p><p>The greatest weakness of the study seems to be that the biological significance of the phenomenon is not clearly clarified. Although it can be deduced that PKA activation has many implications for cell signaling and metabolism, the work lacks the actual link to physiological or pathological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer’s comment.

The authors do not explain further why in certain cells of the cell clusters Ca2+ signals occur spontaneously and thus trigger the phenomenon. What triggers these Ca2+ changes?

Although we have intensively studied that point, we have omitted the results because of its complications. In HeLa cells, but not MDCK cells, we demonstrate the meaning of the radius of RSPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37813623/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37813623/</ext-link>)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors could consider whether they could investigate the subcellular translocation of cPLA2 in correlation with cytosolic Ca2+ signals using GFP technology and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy with their cell model.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we tried to monitor the cPLA2 translocation using GFP-tagged cPLA2. However, the translocation of GFP-cPLA2 was detected, only when the cells were stimulated by calcium ionophore.

It is not clear whether this may be related to the lower frequency (~300 cm-2 h-1) and smaller radius of RSPA in the basal layer cells compared to MDCK cells (Fig. 2E).&quot; Wasn't the relationship with cell density the opposite, higher density higher frequency? Isn't then this result contradicting the &quot;cell density rule&quot; that the authors argue is there in the in vitro system? The authors need to revise their interpretation of the data obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Currently, we do not find the &quot;cell density rule&quot; in mouse epidermis. It would be difficult to identify common rules between mouse epidermis and MDCK cells. However, although it is descriptive, we believe it is worth comparing the MDCK results at this moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Similarly, the authors over conclude on the explanation of lack of change in the size of RSPA size when the change in fluorescence for the calcium reporter surpasses a threshold by saying that &quot;This observation indicates that the amount of PGE2 secretion is predetermined and that there is a threshold of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration for the triggered PGE2 secretion.&quot; First, the study does not really measure directly PGE2 secretion. Hence, there is no way that they can argue that the level of PGE2 secreted is &quot;predetermined&quot;. Instead, there could be an inhibitory mechanism that is triggered to limit further activation of PGE2 signaling/PKA in neighboring cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have omitted the context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. To rule out a transcription-dependent mechanism in the apparent cell density-regulated sensitivity to PGE2, the authors need to inhibit transcription.We agree that our RNA-seq analysis would not 100% rule out the transcription-dependent mechanism. However, we believe that shutting down all transcription will show a severe off-target effect that indirectly affects the calcium transients and the PGE2-synthetase pathway. Therefore, our conclusion is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>1. EGF is reported to increase the frequency of RSPA but the change shown in Fig. 6F is not statistically significant, hence, EGF does not increase RSPA frequency in their experiments.</p><p>We have toned down the claim that EGF treatment increases the frequency (line172).</p><p>&quot;Accordingly, the addition of EGF faintly increased the frequency of RSPA in our experiments, while the MEK and EGFR inhibitors almost completely abrogated RSPA (Fig. 6F), representing that ERK activation or basal ERK activity is essential for RSPA.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Thus, it does not seem appropriate to compare the kinetics of both reporters as a proxy of the comparison of the kinetics of propagation of both kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that we should discuss the comparison of the activity propagation between ERK and PKA. First, among many protein kinases, only ERK and PKA activities have been shown to spread in the epithelial cells. Second, both pathways are considered to be intercellular communication. Finally, crosstalk between these two pathways has been reported in several cells and organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

It is important to assess whether ERK activation depends of PGE2 signaling to better place ERK in the proposed signaling pathway. In fact, the authors argue that &quot;ERK had a direct effect on the production of PGE2.&quot; But it could be that ERK is downstream PGE2 signaling instead.</p></disp-quote><p>It could be possible in other experimental conditions via EP1 and/or EP3 pathways. However, we never detected an effect of RSPA on ERK activity by analyzing our imaging system. In addition, treatment with NSAIDs or COX-2 depletion, which completely abolishes RSPA, did not affect ERK wave propagation. Thus, in our context, we concluded that ERK is not downstream of PGE2. This notion is also supported by the NGS results in Fig. 5D.</p><p>We have refrained from discussing the pathway of PGE2-dependent ERK activation because it would be redundant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In Fig. 5D, &quot;The average intensity of the whole view field of mKate2 or mKOκ, at 20 to 30 min after the addition of PGE2, was applied to calculate the mKate2/mKOκ ratio.&quot; But this means that overlapping/densely plated cells in high density will show stronger changes in fluorescence. This should be done per cell not per field of view. It is obvious that the higher density will have more dense/brighter signal in a given field of view.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the confusion.
