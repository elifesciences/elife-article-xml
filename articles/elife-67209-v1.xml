due to technical difficulties. Especially in the field of autoimmune diseases, promising pathogenic B cells have not been adequately studied to date because of its rarity. In this study, functions of autoantigen-reactive B cells in autoimmune disease were analyzed at the single-cell level. Since topoisomerase I is a distinct autoantigen, we targeted systemic sclerosis as autoimmune disease. Decreased and increased affinities for topoisomerase I of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells led to anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine production associated with the inhibition and development of fibrosis, which is the major symptom of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased affinity of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells suppressed fibrosis. These results indicate that autoantigen-reactive B cells contribute to the disease manifestations in autoimmune disease through their antigen affinity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>systemic sclerosis</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>single cell analysis</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell analysis revealed that autoantigen-reactive B cells changed the type of cytokines they produced from anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-35 to pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-23 as affinity to autoantigen increased.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B lymphocytes have diverse functions in the immune system, such as producing antibodies, presenting antigens, and secreting cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshizaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshizaki, 2016</xref>). For example, B cells produce interleukin (IL)-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. B cell populations producing these cytokines are termed as effector B cells and regulatory B cells, respectively, which have the function of inducing, promoting, or inhibiting inflammation, and thereby they are also involved in the differentiation and activation of other immune cells, including helper T (Th) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshizaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lund and Randall, 2010</xref>). However, it is still unclear what factors determine the ability of B cells to produce different cytokines.</p><p>Such versatile functions of B cells are thought to play a critical role in autoimmune diseases. In fact, rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 antibody that eliminates B cells, has shown efficacy in many autoimmune diseases, strongly suggesting that B cells are clinically important in the development of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Randall, 2016</xref>). Systemic sclerosis (SSc), one of the autoimmune diseases, is a poor prognosis disease characterized by three main features: fibrosis in the skin and visceral organs, especially the lung, vasculopathy, and immune abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoshizaki and Sato, 2015</xref>). Since the pathological mechanisms are not yet understood, a fundamental treatment has not been established. Autoantibodies to nuclear antigens, such as topoisomerase (topo) I and centromere (CENP), are detected in SSc patients even before fibrosis and vasculopathy become apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burbelo et al., 2019</xref>). Autoantibody specificities are closely associated with SSc subsets: anti-topo I antibody is linked to a severe form of SSc, while anti-CENP Ab is often accompanied by a milder form of SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kayser and Fritzler, 2015</xref>). Despite the close clinical correlation of autoantibodies in SSc, the pathogenic relationship between autoantibodies and the clinical manifestations of SSc remains unknown because autoantigens are generally intracellular components critical for cell mitosis and there is little evidence to show that autoantibodies are internalized into the cell. The putative autoantigen is inaccessible to these Ab specificities, and therefore, it is unclear how such autoantibodies could contribute to fibrosis. Furthermore, it is completely unknown how the inhibition of cell mitosis-related functions of autoantigens, such as topo I and CENP, by autoantibodies could induce fibrosis. Therefore, autoantibodies are not thought to contribute to tissue damage in SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2004b</xref>). However, autoreactive B cells themselves are expected to play a role in the SSc pathogenesis, independent of autoantibody production; indeed, improvement of fibrosis following B cell depletion by an anti-CD20 antibody is observed in SSc even before serum autoantibody levels are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ebata et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, memory B cells, including autoreactive memory B cells, are abnormally activated in SSc patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsuchiya et al., 2004</xref>). Studies in mice have also shown that induction of an autoimmune response to topo I causes skin and lung fibrosis characteristic of SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoshizaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maier et al., 2017</xref>). However, in the absence of clear role for autoantibodies in disease progression, we wish to examine whether B cells might play an Ab-independent role.</p><p>However, few studies have directly investigated the role of autoantigen-reactive B cells in the pathogenesis of SSc at the protein level. There are three possible reasons for this. First, the number of autoantigen-reactive B cells obtained from patients is low. In general, 10<sup>4</sup> cells are required to analyze proteins, including cytokines produced by the cells. However, due to the small number of autoantigen-reactive B cells present in vivo, it is difficult to obtain the necessary amount for analysis from blood samples, which are limited in quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pollmann et al., 2019</xref>). Second, cytokines produced by a single B cell are very small. Although there are few studies examining cytokines produced by each B cell, a large number of studies analyzing 10<sup>4</sup> B cells indicate that the amount of cytokines produced by a single B cell is assumed to be at the level of fg-ag/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yoshizaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pollmann et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, conventional assays, which have a quantitative limit on pg-fg/ml levels, lack the power to analyze cytokines produced by a single autoantigen-reactive B cell. Moreover, the responsiveness of B cells to antigens is defined by the affinity of the B cell receptor (BCR) to antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), and autoantigen-reactive B cells may also have the different affinities for an autoantigen via a different degree of somatic hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to analyze autoantigen-reactive B cells at the single-cell level to accurately clarify their functional significance. Third, in order to determine functions of autoantigen-reactive B cells, it is essential to examine cell-to-cell interactions with immune cells, such as T cells. However, the volume of conventional cell culture plates is more than 10<sup>6</sup> times larger than that of cells, which means that the conventional device size is too large for the reaction field of the small number of cells. Therefore, it is likely that cell-to-cell interactions in vivo have not been adequately simulated ex vivo. For these reasons, the role of autoantigen-reactive B cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including SSc, remains a black box.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the function of autoantigen-reactive B cells from SSc patients and SSc model mice at the single-cell level using the recently established unique single-cell protein analysis device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohashi et al., 2009</xref>) and microspatial cell interaction device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakao et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakao et al., 2019b</xref>). These novel analyses demonstrate that low and high affinities for topo I of topo I-reactive B cells were related to anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, respectively, which were further associated with the inhibition and development of fibrosis, respectively. Moreover, affinities for topo I also related to helper T (Th) cell differentiation in close contact with T cells. These results indicate that autoantigen-reactive B cells may be involved in the disease manifestations in SSc through their distinct cytokine production and interaction with Th cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frequencies of peripheral blood topo I-reactive B cells in anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients</title><p>In many autoimmune diseases, the CD27<sup>+</sup> B cell fraction, memory B cells, is enriched with autoantigen-reactive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matsumoto et al., 2014</xref>). CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells are also highly activated in SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2004a</xref>). Therefore, we focused on CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells in this study to examine topo I-reactive B cells from human SSc patients. First, to determine the number of topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells in SSc patients, frequencies of topo I-APC<sup>+</sup> topo I-PE<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood were examined with flow cytometric analysis. Their frequencies were significantly higher in anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients (n = 111) than in healthy individuals (n = 50) and anti-CENP antibody-positive SSc patients (n = 50; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Blocking analysis showed that these signals were specific for topo I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the mean number of topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells in the peripheral blood was 22 ± 21 cells/ml. In the conventional method, 10<sup>4</sup> B cells are required to determine the concentration of cytokines produced by B cells, which means that 500–50,000 ml of blood is needed to obtain the sufficient number of topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells for the analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to directly examine topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells by conventional methods. In the present study, we used a unique microfluidic-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (μELISA) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohashi et al., 2009</xref>), which enables quantitative analysis of the trace amount of proteins as shown below.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Frequencies and cytokine production ability of topo I-reactive B cells in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequencies of topo I-reactive cells in CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells obtained from the peripheral blood of 50 healthy controls (HC), 50 anti-CENP antibody-positive SSc patients, and 111 anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients were examined with flow cytometric analysis.

Topo I-APC<sup>+</sup> topo I-PE<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the peripheral blood as single cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 48 hr. Then, levels of IgG anti-topo I antibodies and total IgG in the culture medium were examined using the μELISA system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this study, titers of IgG anti-topo I antibodies were defined as values obtained by dividing OD values of IgG anti-topo I antibodies by total IgG OD values. Titers of IgG anti-topo I antibodies produced by topo I-APC<sup>-</sup> topo I-PE<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells, which are topo I-non-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells, served as background. We found that only topo I-APC<sup>+</sup> topo I-PE<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells from anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients produced IgG anti-topo I antibodies with an average titer of +6 SD or higher, but these B cells from healthy individuals or anti-CENP antibody-positive SSc patients did not produce IgG anti-topo I antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This result suggests that topo I-APC<sup>+</sup> topo I-PE<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells from healthy individuals and anti-CENP antibody-positive SSc patients are non-specific topo I-bound B cells, and that topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells are detected only in anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients.</p><p>To investigate cytokines produced by topo I-reactive B cells, cytokine mRNA expression levels were measured by single-cell PCR.

Interestingly, most B cells produced mainly one type of cytokines, and only a few B cells produced multiple types of cytokines. In contrast, topo I-non-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells used as a control showed almost no expression of these cytokines. Moreover, both topo I-reactive and topo I-non-reactive B cells stimulated ex vivo produced multiple cytokines, and the difference between them found under unstimulated conditions was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells are already stimulated by self-antigens in vivo, and that this affects the difference in cytokine profiles between topo I-reactive B cells and non-reactive B cells under unstimulated conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The affinity of B cells for topo I regulates their cytokine production capacity</title><p>Typically, B cells exposed to an antigen in vivo will increase their affinity for the antigen by somatic hypermutation until the antigen is eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meffre et al., 2001</xref>). Ongoing somatic hypermutation is observed for autoantibodies in human autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>). For topo I-reactive B cells, the affinity for topo I is also expected to increase over the disease course. Therefore, we hypothesized that different affinities for topo I affect the cytokine production ability of topo I-reactive B cells. To this end, topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells (200 cells from 58 anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients) were divided into the low-affinity group (80 cells) and high-affinity group (120 cells), according to IgG anti-topo I antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): titers of IgG anti-topo I antibodies in the low-affinity group were 2–4 SD above the background, whereas titers of the high-affinity group were 6–8 SD above it. The high-affinity group has actually low Kd value (high affinity) and the low-affinity group has high Kd value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Almost all of these cells were CD38<sup>-</sup>CD95<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80/86, ICOSL, and CD40) in topo I-non-reactive B cells and topo I-reactive B cells (topo I-PE<sup>+</sup>Topo I-APC<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) with low or high affinity for topo I in anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-β1 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-35, was examined at the single-cell level in these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The low-affinity group showed higher frequencies of B cells producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-35, while the high-affinity group exhibited higher frequencies of B cells producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-23. On the other hand, frequencies of B cells producing IL-2 and TGF-β1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. Furthermore, the protein expression of cytokines by IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, IL-35, and TGF-β1-producing B cells was measured at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The production of IL-6 and IL-23 was significantly higher in the high-affinity group than in the low-affinity group (p&lt;0.005, respectively); conversely, the low-affinity group exhibited significantly higher production of IL-10 and IL-35 relative to the high-affinity group (p&lt;0.005, respectively). There was no significant difference in the amount of IL-2 and TGF-β1 production between the two groups. Thus, topo I-reactive B cells with high affinity for topo I predominantly produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-23, whereas those with low affinity for topo I mainly produced anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-35. μELISA system revealed relationships between cytokine profiles, autoantigen affinity, and intracellular kinase activity. In IL-10-producing B cells, intracellular signaling and NF-kB signaling were reduced, and were mediated by p38 kinase, Jak1, Stat3, and ATF1 transcription factor. Similarly, IL-35-producing regulatory B cells were related to EOLA1 activation, which inhibits IL-6 signaling, HPK1, which terminate signaling cascade, and Fos transcription factor. IL-6-producing effector B cells were associated with themis2 and HCST, which strengthen signaling pathway, BRAF, KICSTOR complex, SYK, FYN, STAT1, and NFkB2 transcription factor. IL-23-producing B cells were associated with RAF1, JKAMP, and CRTC3 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The relationship between the affinity for topo I in topo I-reactive B cells and their ability to produce cytokines in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Topo I-non-reactive B cells and topo I-reactive B cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients, and topo I titers were measured at the single B cell level.

Therefore, we examined the effect of topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells on the differentiation of Th cells. Topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells with low affinity and high affinity for topo I (100 cells each) and control topo I-non-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells (100 cells) were determined from the peripheral blood of anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients and co-cultured with 10<sup>4</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells on a 96-well plate for 48 hr. Subsequently, <italic>FOXP3</italic> and <italic>RORC</italic> mRNA expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was examined by real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); however, none of the CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells affected <italic>FOXP3</italic> and <italic>RORC</italic> expression using the 96-well plate. We hypothesized that the reason why topo I-reactive CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells did not affect T cells was that the 96-well plate could not mimic the size of the reaction field in vivo, that is, cytokines produced by B cells could diffuse before fully acting on T cells. Therefore, we used the unique microculture plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which enables cell culture in a microspace, and cultured the cells in the same way as the 96-well plate. The volume of culture medium is 200 μl for the 96-well plate, whereas 1 μl is sufficient for the microculture plate. In co-culture with the microculture plates, CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells with low affinity for topo I upregulated <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells with high affinity for topo I upregulated <italic>RORC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Upregulated Foxp3 and ROR<italic>γ</italic>t protein expression in these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was also confirmed by fluorescent cell staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies against IL-10 or IL-35 inhibited Foxp3 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while anti-IL-6 or IL-23 antibodies suppressed ROR<italic>γ</italic>t expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, topo I-reactive B cells induced Th cell differentiation in close contact with T cells, and the ability to induce Th cell differentiation depended on the cytokine production profile determined by differences in the affinity for topo I.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of topo I-reactive B cells on the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients.</title><p>B cells with low affinity for topo I and those with high affinity for topo I as well as topo I-non-reactive B cells were obtained from anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients (n = 111).

Further analysis at the single-cell level showed that titers of IgG anti-topo I antibodies produced by topo I-APC<sup>+</sup> topo I-PE<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> cells (100 cells) from mice immunized four times with topo I were significantly increased compared to those immunized once (100 cells; p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Adoptive transfer experiments of B cell-specific Blimp1 CKO mice (PRDM1 CKO) induced skin sclerosis and lung fibrosis.

These results suggest that the B-T interaction is important in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this model, it was thought that B cells activated T cells, causing skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis. Collectively, topo I-reactive B cells suppressed fibrosis when their affinity for topo I was low, while they induced or exacerbated fibrosis if their affinity was high, and that these functions were exerted through distinct cytokine production by topo I-reactive B cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of the affinity for topo I in topo I-reactive B cells on the development of fibrosis in the topo I-induced systemic sclerosis (SSc) model mice.</title><p>Topo I-reactive B cells (10<sup>4</sup> cells) from mice immunized once or four times with topo I were adoptively transferred into wild-type (WT) mice, and 14 days later, these WT mice were immunized with topo I three times every 2 weeks (<bold>A</bold>). 56 days after the adoptive transfer, the skin (original magnification, ×40) and lung tissues (×100) were obtained, and the dermal thickness and lung fibrosis score were examined histologically (<bold>B</bold>).

Each cytokine was associated with the corresponding transcription factors or signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In addition, topo I-reactive B cells affected Th cell differentiation when they interacted with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the microspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): B cells with low-affinity BCRs for topo I differentiated Th cells into regulatory T cells, while B cells with high affinity induced Th17 cell differentiation. Similarly, in the SSc mouse model, B cells with low affinity to topo I inhibited fibrosis, while B cells with high affinity induced or exacerbated it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, higher frequencies of B cells with high affinity correlated with the more severe fibrosis in SSc patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Finally, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by topo I-reactive B cells and suppression of increased affinity of BCRs for topo I inhibited fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that autoreactive memory B cells are involved in the development of SSc through their cytokine production and interaction with Th cells.</p><p>Autoantibodies in SSc appear early in the onset, and their specificities are closely associated with the disease subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoshizaki and Sato, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kayser and Fritzler, 2015</xref>). Since patients with anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc are associated with severe skin sclerosis and interstitial lung disease, the presence of anti-topo I antibodies is a clinical indicator of poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kayser and Fritzler, 2015</xref>). Although anti-topo I antibody is generally thought to be epiphenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2004b</xref>), anti-topo I antibody titers correlate with the activity and severity of SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that topo I-reactive B cells themselves may contribute to the disease manifestations in SSc, independent of anti-topo I antibodies. Consistently, our results show that the increased affinity for topo I of topo I-reactive B cells changed the cytokine production by these B cells from inhibitory IL-10 and IL-35 to pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which was associated with the development of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). B cells exposed to exogenous antigens, such as viral antigens, increase the affinity of BCR by somatic hypermutation through cognate interaction with T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hwang* et al., 2015</xref>). The increased affinity of BCR enhances the ability of antibodies to bind to antigens, resulting in efficient elimination of antigens. However, the pathogenic relevance of the increased affinity of antigen-reactive B cells in autoimmune diseases has not been clarified. The results of this study suggest that topo I-reactive B cells with enhanced antigen affinity after long-term exposure to topo I contribute to the development of fibrosis in SSc.</p><p>In autoimmune diseases, cytokines are important factors that shape the disease. Indeed, in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, anticytokine therapy has shown excellent therapeutic efficacy and is attracting attention as a new treatment method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Randall, 2016</xref>). In SSc, a large clinical trial using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, was recently conducted and showed a significant inhibitory effect on the progression of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Khanna et al., 2016</xref>). IL-6 enhances collagen production by fibroblasts and directly induces fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dufour et al., 2018</xref>). Various cells, including macrophages, produce IL-6, but it has been suggested that IL-6 produced by B cells is particularly important in SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshizaki, 2016</xref>). However, because cytokines produced by B cells, including IL-6, are trace, as shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), the mechanisms by which cytokine-producing B cells are involved in the development of SSc have not been clarified. In the present study, topo I-specific B cells differentiate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into regulatory T cells or Th17 cells only when they interact with T cells in the microspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In vivo, cognate interaction of B and T cells takes place primarily in spatially restricted lymphoid follicles. The microspace device used in this study is thought to mimic the B cell-T cell interaction space in vivo, suggesting that cytokines produced by topo I-reactive B cells directly affect T cell differentiation.</p><p>Multiple subsets of B cells that produce IL-10, including CD24<sup>hi</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells, a memory B cell phenotype, have been reported and are collectively referred to as regulatory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mauri and Menon, 2017</xref>). As there is no specific phenotype signature for regulatory B cells, they should be regarded by their suppressive function in the immune system rather than by lineage or process of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wąsik et al., 2018</xref>). The current study is the first to identify autoreactive memory B cells with low affinity for topo I that produce IL-10 in human SSc (Figures 2 and 3), which may be regarded as regulatory autoreactive B cells. In the SSc model mice, adoptive transfer of these regulatory autoreactive B cells attenuated fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that regulatory autoreactive B cells have inhibitory functions and may form one of the defense mechanisms that suppress the progression of fibrosis at an early stage. However, upon further exposure to topo I, these cells may transform into pathogenic autoreactive B cells with high affinity for topo I, resulting in the development of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Recently, B cell depletion therapy has been shown to be effective for SSc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshizaki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yoshizaki and Sato, 2015</xref>). Its effectiveness varies from patient to patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohammed et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the therapeutic effect may be determined by relative abundance of pathogenic B cells with high affinity for topo I. Our results also demonstrate that inhibition of affinity maturation to topo I by BTK inhibitors induced regulatory autoreactive B cells and thereby suppressed skin and lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that BTK would be a potential therapeutic target for SSc. On the other hand, cytokine elimination therapy targeting IL-6 and IL-23 produced by pathogenic B cells with high affinity for topo I could also be new treatments for SSc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). High-affinity topo I antibody-producing B cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23, while low-affinity topo I antibody-producing B cells produce inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-35. In IL-10 producing B cells, proteins that inhibit signaling pathway, NF-kB inhibitory proteins, MKNK2, p38 kinase, Jak1, stat3, and ATF1 transcription factor were detected, suggesting that IL-10 production is mediated by these proteins. Similarly, regulatory B cells producing IL-35 were found to be mediated by EOLA1, which inhibits IL-6, HPK1, which terminates signaling cascade, and FOS transcription factors. In each of the IL-6- or IL-23-producing effector B cells, the signaling-enhancing proteins were abundant and were associated with distinct signaling factors and transcription factors. These factors also might be a potential therapeutic target for SSc.</p><p>The unique single-cell protein analysis used in this study has revealed for the first time that topo I-reactive B cells promote fibrosis as their affinity for topo I increases, suggesting that autoreactive memory B cells contribute to the disease manifestations in SSc. The strategy used in this study can be applied to other autoimmune diseases, which may pave the way for the elucidation of the mechanisms of other autoimmune diseases and the development of new treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>All samples were obtained from each of the 111 anti-topo I antibody-positive SSc patients, 50 anti-CENP antibody-positive SSc patients, and 50 healthy controls, all of whom provided their signed informed consent for the study.

Specific ELISA kits were used to measure anti-topo I and anti-CENP antibodies (Medical &amp; Biological Laboratories, Nagano, Japan). Recently, we successfully integrated an immunoassay into a microchip, applying basic ELISA methods to a μELISA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ohashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2002</xref>). This system can measure the very low concentration (1–1000 fg/ml) of several proteins using bead-bed immunoassay, which is proceeded on microchip composed by 5–100 µm depth of flow channels. We have also developed a laser-induced thermal lens microscope (TLM), which is especially useful for ultrasensitive determination in a microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashcroft et al., 1988</xref>). In this study, the microchip was filled with antibodies-coated polystyrene beads. After beads introduction, 1 µl of samples was loaded into the microchip. In this assay, a highly sensitive detection method with high space resolution is indispensable because there are very small amounts of analytes in a microchip. During the µELISA, dye molecules produced by the enzymatic reaction are detected by our sensitive TLM. A comparison with conventional methods demonstrated excellent performance in sensitivity (1–1000 fg/ml), analysis time (10–20 min), and sample volume (1 µl). To analyze intracellular proteins, 10× RIPA buffer (ab156034, abcam) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

analysis revealing the roles of autoantigen-reactive B lymphocytes in autoimmune disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claimed that B cells with &quot;high affinity&quot; B cell receptor (BCR) to topo I induce differentiation of Th cells and fibrosis whereas B cells with &quot;low affinity&quot; BCR play protective roles. However, their definition of high and low &quot;affinity&quot; throughout this paper is problematic. They defined &quot;high affinity group&quot; as topo I-reactive B cells that secrete high titer anti-topo I IgG divided by total IgG. But what they measured with microfluidic ELISA (μELISA) was &quot;titer&quot; of IgG that was secreted from in vitro cultured B cells. Affinity of antibody was not directly measured in this study. Because the conclusions throughout the manuscript refer back to this analysis, it would be important to take an orthogonal approach to measure affinity (and/or SHM) directly in human samples.</p><p>2) The authors sorted CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells with topo I reactive BCR from SSc patients. These are referred to as memory B cells, but this fraction includes memory B cells and also plasmablasts (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31681331/). Memory B cells are usually in resting state and don't produce antibody efficiently unless stimulated to differentiate into plasma cells. Based on IgG production ex vivo, a considerable amount of plasmablasts may be among the sorted cells. And the high proportion of plasmablasts in CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells in SSc patients could account for the high titer of IgG relative to healthy controls. Actually, it looks like there are two distinct populations within topo-I reactive cells based on IgG production according to Figure 2A. If &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; are mainly plasmablasts and &quot;low affinity B cells&quot; are memory B cells, the cytokine data are consistent with that secreted from each cell type. For instance, circulating plasmablasts are known to produce IL-6 (J Immunol. 2015;194(6):2482-5.). The authors should address this possibility by staining CD38 and/or CD138 for CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p><p>Moreover, the correlation between the ratio for high affinity B cells/low affinity B cells and clinical parameters could be explained by accumulation of plasmablasts over time. Skin fibrosis and lung function get worse with disease duration. In fact, &quot;high affinity B cell dominant group&quot; had longer disease duration than &quot;low affinity dominant group&quot;. The authors should investigate whether accumulation of &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; (or plasmablasts if proved) correlates with disease duration. If correlated with disease duration, the argument that &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; correlate with disease severity does not make sense.</p><p>3) The authors used topo I-induced SSc model mice to investigate the role of &quot;high affinity B cells&quot;. They compared topo-I reactive B cells from the mice that immunized only once and immunized 4 times. The B cells in 4 times immunized mice is clearly qualitatively different from prime immunization since they had been boosted and stronger immune reactions were induced. So, I don't think it is a fair comparison and the data seems merely reflection of the differences between prime versus boost responses. It is more compelling to compare the cells with strongly and weakly topo-I reactivity within the same animal. Moreover, related to point 2 above, gated mouse B cells are CD19<sup>+</sup> Topo I binding. It would be important to clarify whether plasmablasts or memory B cells or even GC B cells are being pulled out and sorted, and whether those phenotypes help account for distinct cytokine profiles.</p><p>4) Figure 7.

In this context, authors should at least examine the status of CD80/CD86, ICOSL, CD40.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Fukasawa et al. isolated TopoI-reactive CD19<sup>+</sup> CD27+ memory B cells from patient with systemic sclerosis (SSc), and demonstrated difference in cytokine production between high and low affinity B cells. High affinity B cells produce inflammatory cytokines whereas low affinity B cells produce inhibitory cytokines. They showed that co-culture of low and high affinity B cells induces differentiation of CD4 T cells to different T helper cell subsets, and that the frequency of high affinity B cells is correlated to fibrotic symptoms in SSc patients, suggesting that cytokine production of low and high affinity B cells regulates disease severity. They also showed similar findings in a mouse model and potential therapeutic effect of a BTK inhibitor. The differential cytokine production in high vs. low affinity B cells and its role in the regulation of disease severity are novel and interesting. However, cytokine production from B cells may be affected by factors other than antibody affinity such as inflammation, and disease severity may be affected by other factors such as the titer of anti-TOPOI antibody. In this study, the authors did not carefully address the role of these other factors. Also, the authors fail to address an important question whether affinity-dependent cytokine production of B cells is restricted to TOPOI-reactive B cells or applicable to antigen-stimulated B cells in general.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) Figure 1. The authors addressed anti-TopoI IgG production from TOPOI-reactive CD19<sup>+</sup> CD27+ cells cultured without stimulation. Although the authors describe CD27+ cells as memory B cells in the result section, memory B cells are thought to produce antibodies only after differentiation to plasma blasts. Are these IgG-secreting CD27+ cells memory B cells or plasma blasts? Related to this point, the authors should also show how much fraction of CD27+ cells produce IgG. Do TopoI-reactive B cells from healthy individuals and SSc-CENP patients produce anti-TopoI antibody when they are stimulated?</p><p>2) Figure 4. The authors isolated high and low affinity anti-TopoI IgG-producing B cells from mice immunized with TopoI once and four times, respectively, and demonstrated differential cytokine production between high and low affinity B cells. The mice immunized four times may have more severe inflammation than those immunized once. The differential cytokine production might be the consequence of the severity of inflammation. To exclude this possibility, the authors may be able to use low affinity B cells obtained by immunization with TopoI once followed by injection of adjuvant alone three times.</p><p>3) Figure 6A-D. The authors transferred TopoI-reactive B cells from mice immunized with TopoI. The authors should show whether sufficient amount of anti-TOPOI IgG is produced by transfer of TopoI-reactive B cells.</p><p>4) Figure 6F. The authors transferred TOPO-I-reactive B cells from mice deficient in IL-6 or IL-23. The authors should show whether production of anti-TOPOI antibody in these recipient mice is comparable to those transferred with wild-type B cells. Treatment with anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-23 antibody after transfer (Figure 6E) may circumvent this problem, but these antibodies might modulate non-B cells.</p><p>5) Figure 7. Treatment with a BTK inhibitor might reduce production of anti-TOPOI antibody, and reduction of anti-TOPOI antibody might be involved in modulation of disease severity. The authors should address the contribution of antibody production vs. cytokine production in the beneficial effect of BTK inhibitor.</p><p>6) It is important to address whether differential cytokine production between low and high affinity B cells is restricted to TOPO-I-reactive B cells. This may be done by immunizing the mice with foreign antigens and examining cytokine production from low and high affinity B cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors sought to argue that in patients and an SSc mouse model, B cells with high or low affinity binding to autoantigen Topo I have distinct pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles and this can in turn promote or ameliorate disease. Use of both human and mouse approaches, a well-characterized SSc patient cohort, as well as powerful single cell functional technologies are strengths. However, there are major concerns about interpretation of the data and identity of B cell subsets captured in this study:</p><p>Authors claim that high affinity and low affinity Topo I-specific B cells are captured and profiled from patients but:</p><p>(a) Affinity is never directly measured.</p><p>(b) CD27+ gate can capture both memory and plasmablast human B cell populations and this latter distinction could account for differences in Ab measures and cytokine profiles rather than 'affinity'.</p><p>Finally, use of mouse model is laudable, but comparison between 1x immunized and 4x immunized CD19<sup>+</sup> Ag-specific B cells is not fair since the b cell populations may be very different (memory v. plasmablast v. GC). It would be appropriate to characterize B cell subsets and also to make comparison of low and high affinity B cells within individual mice to support claims of the paper.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1.

As you mentioned, we conducted orthogonal affinity analysis in “high affinity” (=high anti-Topo I IgG/total IgG, n = 10) and “low affinity” (=low anti- Topo I IgG/total IgG, n = 10) Topo I-PE+ Topo I-APC+ CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27+ B cells in PBMCs in anti-Topo I antibody positive SSc patients. (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) As a result,”high affinity” B cells defined by titers have low Kd value (= high affinity), and ”low affinity” B cells defined by titers have high Kd value (= low affinity). -log<sub>10</sub>Kd was correlated with Topo I-IgG(OD)/total IgG(OD). The correlation coefficient was r=0.96, and p-value was p&lt;0.0001 and significant. In this analysis system, we can think of titer as affinity. “High affinity” B cells defined by both titers or Kd value produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-23. “Low affinity” B cells defined by both titers or Kd value also produce regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 or IL-35.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors sorted CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells with topo I reactive BCR from SSc patients.

We stained Topo I-PE+ Topo I-APC+ CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27+ B cells in PBMCs in anti-Topo I antibody positive SSc patients with anti-CD38 antibody and anti-CD95 antibody. As a result, Topo I reactive fraction was almost all CD95+CD38-. The frequencies of these Topo I reactive fraction were significantly higher than that of TopoI non-reactive fraction (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Therefore, these Topo I reactive CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27+ fraction was CD38-CD95+, which was activated memory B cells.</p><p>The titer of Topo I-non-reactive B cells fraction, or Topo I-reactive B cells fraction in HC or SSc-CENP were not elevated. It was equivalent to background. That means they do not produce anti-Topo I antibody. Almost all of the topo I-reactive B cells in SSc-Topo I produced anti-Topo I antibody. With regard to SSc-Topo I, the Topo I titer divided by total IgG (Topo I-IgG/total IgG) was high or low in B cells that actually produced Topo I antibodies. When we measured the affinity (Kd value) of these samples using the orthogonal approach, they still corresponded to high affinity and low affinity, respectively. We found that both were the same, activated memory B cells, but showed differences in their affinity. Later experiments showed that these differences in affinity corresponded to differences in cytokine production.</p><p>From the above experiment, the Topo I reactive fraction was found to be CD38 negative, indicating that it was not a plasmablast but activated memory B cells. As you pointed out, we analyzed the correlation between the duration of the disease and the ratio for high affinity B cells/low affinity B cells, and the correlation coefficient was r=0.69, p&lt;0.0001, which is a significant correlation. The relationship between duration and disease severity is inextricably linked. It is true that the human correlation data suggests that high affinity B cells (not plasmablast) may be responsible for the accumulation, but later mouse experiments have shown that high affinity B cells have inflammatory and pathogenic functions, while low affinity B cells have inhibitory and regulatory functions. In addition, since the patient group in this study was untreated, we believe that our results are consistent with clinical experience in that the longer the duration of the disease (the later the detection), the more severe the indicators such as skin hardening and ILD become.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors used topo I-induced SSc model mice to investigate the role of &quot;high affinity B cells&quot;.

Cytokine production was also higher at low affinity for inhibitory cytokines and higher at high affinity for pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Analysis of Topo I-PE+Topo I-APC+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells showed that most of the Topo I reactive B cells were CD38-CD95+ (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). On the other hand, in Topo I non-reactive B cells, the percentage of CD38-CD95+ was only a few percent (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Of the Topo I reactive B cells, both Low affinity B cells and High affinity B cells were obtained from this fraction, suggesting that affinity, not cell surface markers, is what is important in determining cytokine profiles and production. It was found to be CD38- and that means they are not plasmablasts.</p><p>A rigorous examination of memory B cells in mouse spleen must be performed several months after TopoI immunization. Due to the short period of time between immunization and collection, it was difficult to rigorously examine resting memory in this model. Based on the results of CD38 and CD95 staining in this study, it was thought that the study was performed with the difference by TopoI reactivity (high vs. low) of activated B cells or B cells in the germinal center.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7.

The results suggest that BTK inhibitors inhibit B cells, especially high affinity B cells, and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23, which are produced by B cells, results in suppression of skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis.　 It is possible that suppressing antibody production modifies disease severity, but we believe that the effect of suppressing cytokines is more likely.　We believe that this idea is also suggested by the results using anti-cytokine antibodies and cytokine knock out mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Despite the interesting manuscript, by itself it is not well written.

As you mentioned, we generated and analyzed B cell-specific Blimp1 CKO mice and B cell-specific Class II CKO mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Since the transfer of TopoI-reactive B cells from B cell-specific Blimp1 CKO mice induced skin sclerosis and lung fibrosis, it is likely that activated memory B cells play an important role in this model, rather than plasmablast or plasma cells, as we have analyzed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).

These co-stimulatory molecules were not related to affinity, and the combination of affinity and cytokines was thought to determine the direction of T cell differentiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Figure 1. The authors addressed anti-TopoI IgG production from TOPOI-reactive CD19<sup>+</sup> CD27+ cells cultured without stimulation. Although the authors describe CD27+ cells as memory B cells in the result section, memory B cells are thought to produce antibodies only after differentiation to plasma blasts. Are these IgG-secreting CD27+ cells memory B cells or plasma blasts? Related to this point, the authors should also show how much fraction of CD27+ cells produce IgG. Do TopoI-reactive B cells from healthy individuals and SSc-CENP patients produce anti-TopoI antibody when they are stimulated?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. The results of staining with CD38 and CD95 showed that the TOPOI-reactive CD19<sup>+</sup> CD27+ cells were CD38-CD95+, indicating that they were not plasmablasts, but activated memory B cells. Almost all of these fractions yielded significant antibody titers using micro-ELISA. The fractions of TopoI-responsive B cells obtained from HCs and SSc-CENPs did not produce antibodies, nor did they produce antibodies upon stimulation, suggesting that the reaction was nonspecific. Since we could not obtain any significant titer, we could not analyze the affinity using the orthogonal approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4. The authors isolated high and low affinity anti-TopoI IgG-producing B cells from mice immunized with TopoI once and four times, respectively, and demonstrated differential cytokine production between high and low affinity B cells. The mice immunized four times may have more severe inflammation than those immunized once. The differential cytokine production might be the consequence of the severity of inflammation. To exclude this possibility, the authors may be able to use low affinity B cells obtained by immunization with TopoI once followed by injection of adjuvant alone three times.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The study was conducted using the TopoI 1 time + Adjuvant 3 time model (Incomplete model Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Skin thickness and lung fibrosis were comparable to the PBS group (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). The number of Topo I-reactive B cells was significantly higher than that in the PBS group (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C), and the antibody titer produced by single B cells was also significantly higher (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). The obtained cytokine profile was similar to that of the single-immunization mouse model (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). TopoI-reactive B cells in incomplete model had significantly higher levels of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-35 and significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23 compared to the complete model (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). Similar to the single-immunization model mice, skin hardening and lung fibrosis were suppressed in the Incomplete group compared with the non-immunized group in the model immunized with Topo I after adoptive transfer (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G, 1H). Adoptive transfer alone showed no significant change in the Incomplete group compared to the non-implanted group (Figure 6—figure supplement 1I, 1J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6A-D.

The authors transferred TOPO-I-reactive B cells from mice deficient in IL-6 or IL-23. The authors should show whether production of anti-TOPOI antibody in these recipient mice is comparable to those transferred with wild-type B cells. Treatment with anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-23 antibody after transfer (Figure 6E) may circumvent this problem, but these antibodies might modulate non-B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. The anti-TopoI antibody titer was similarly elevated in IL-6KO, IL-23KO, and WT mice. Therefore, we thought that cytokine production would have a greater impact on skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis than antibody titer. The importance of cytokines is also suggested by the fact that it is known that antibody titer itself does not decrease easily even if symptoms improve after cytokines are suppressed by treatment of scleroderma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7.

From the experiment shown in Figure 6, it was thought that the effect of inhibiting cytokine production on skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis was greater than that of antibody titer. The Topo I-IgG(OD)/total IgG(OD) values in Figure 6B represent those obtained from individual single B cells, and are thought to correspond to affinity from the experiment in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We believe that the BTK inhibitor reduced the number of high affinity B cells and increased the number of low affinity B cells, resulting in a shift from significant pro-inflammatory cytokines to significant inhibitory cytokines, thereby suppressing skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis. As a result, it is cytokines that are functioning, but we believe that affinity is important in producing cytokines. Upstream is reactivity to self-antigens, and downstream is cytokines. It is thought that the difference in affinity to self-antigens changes the ability to produce cytokines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is important to address whether differential cytokine production between low and high affinity B cells is restricted to TOPO-I-reactive B cells. This may be done by immunizing the mice with foreign antigens and examining cytokine production from low and high affinity B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that this is probably true for other proteins as well. The usefulness of anti-cytokine therapy and B cell removal therapy suggests that it is not the antibody titer but the B cells and cytokines produced by the B cells that are important in the pathogenesis.

The authors claimed that B cells with &quot;high affinity&quot; B cell receptor (BCR) to topo I induce differentiation of Th cells and fibrosis whereas B cells with &quot;low affinity&quot; BCR play protective roles. However, their definition of high and low &quot;affinity&quot; throughout this paper is problematic. They defined &quot;high affinity group&quot; as topo I-reactive B cells that secrete high titer anti-topo I IgG divided by total IgG. But what they measured with microfluidic ELISA (μELISA) was &quot;titer&quot; of IgG that was secreted from in vitro cultured B cells. Affinity of antibody was not directly measured in this study. Because the conclusions throughout the manuscript refer back to this analysis, it would be important to take an orthogonal approach to measure affinity (and/or SHM) directly in human samples.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In the essential revision 1) above, as an orhogonal approach to measure affinity, micro-ELISA was used to analyze affinity in human samples. Since Titer and affinity were correlated, we thought that anti-TopoI IgG/total IgG could be considered as affinity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors sorted CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells with topo I reactive BCR from SSc patients. These are referred to as memory B cells, but this fraction includes memory B cells and also plasmablasts (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31681331/). Memory B cells are usually in resting state and don't produce antibody efficiently unless stimulated to differentiate into plasma cells. Based on IgG production ex vivo, a considerable amount of plasmablasts may be among the sorted cells. And the high proportion of plasmablasts in CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells in SSc patients could account for the high titer of IgG relative to healthy controls. Actually, it looks like there are two distinct populations within topo-I reactive cells based on IgG production according to Figure 2A. If &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; are mainly plasmablasts and &quot;low affinity B cells&quot; are memory B cells, the cytokine data are consistent with that secreted from each cell type. For instance, circulating plasmablasts are known to produce IL-6 (J Immunol. 2015;194(6):2482-5.). The authors should address this possibility by staining CD38 and/or CD138 for CD27+CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p><p>Moreover, the correlation between the ratio for high affinity B cells/low affinity B cells and clinical parameters could be explained by accumulation of plasmablasts over time. Skin fibrosis and lung function get worse with disease duration. In fact, &quot;high affinity B cell dominant group&quot; had longer disease duration than &quot;low affinity dominant group&quot;. The authors should investigate whether accumulation of &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; (or plasmablasts if proved) correlates with disease duration. If correlated with disease duration, the argument that &quot;high affinity B cells&quot; correlate with disease severity does not make sense.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. I have answered this question in Essential revision 2) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors used topo I-induced SSc model mice to investigate the role of &quot;high affinity B cells&quot;. They compared topo-I reactive B cells from the mice that immunized only once and immunized 4 times. The B cells in 4 times immunized mice is clearly qualitatively different from prime immunization since they had been boosted and stronger immune reactions were induced. So, I don't think it is a fair comparison and the data seems merely reflection of the differences between prime versus boost responses. It is more compelling to compare the cells with strongly and weakly topo-I reactivity within the same animal. Moreover, related to point 2 above, gated mouse B cells are CD19<sup>+</sup> Topo I binding. It would be important to clarify whether plasmablasts or memory B cells or even GC B cells are being pulled out and sorted, and whether those phenotypes help account for distinct cytokine profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your question.

In Topo I-induced SSc model mice, there was no difference in serum anti-Topo I level between mice treated with or without BTK inhibitors (newly added Figure 7B). In contrast, skin sclerosis and ILD were improved by BTK inhibitor treatment (Figure 7B). As an explanation for the discrepancy between antibody titer and therapeutic effect of BTK inhibitors, we focused on cytokines produced by B cells. Treatment with BTK inhibitors decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23 produced by topo I-reactive B cells (Figure 7, C and D). On the other hand, inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-35 produced by topo I-reactive B cells increased (Figure 7, C and D). Analysis using anti-cytokine antibodies and cytokine knockout mice also supports these results (Figure 6, E and F). Based on the above, we hypothesized that cytokines produced by B cells are more important in the pathogenesis of skin sclerosis and ILD than antibodies themselves. The mechanism of action of the BTK inhibitor was thought to be that it improved the condition of SSc by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines from B cells rather than by its effect on antibody production.</p><p>For more supportive data, we have recent data on the use of Rituximab (RTX; anti-CD20 antibody) in human SSc patients. Like BTK inhibitors, this treatment acts on B cells and eliminates almost all CD20-expressing B cells. In this trial, skin sclerosis and ILD were significantly improved by RTX treatment compared to the placebo group. However, the serum antibody titer remained consistently the same in both the actual drug group and the placebo group (Ebata, S, et al. Lancet rheum, 3; E489-E497, 2021. Supplement Figure 8).</p><p>In a new study of 10 consenting patients from a different population, data from one year after RTX showed an average improvement of about 6 points in mRSS, while titer remained the same (newly added Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>These results suggest that it is less the production of antibodies from B cells that is important in the pathogenesis of SSc, such as skin sclerosis and ILD, but rather the cytokines produced by B cells and the effects of B cells on T cells in the micro. As for the mechanism of therapeutic effect of BTK inhibitors, they did not change the antibody titer in serum, but suppressed inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting that they improve the condition by suppressing inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>The above information has been added to the text and Figure and Figure Legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
