Specifically, acute stress due to physical restraint induces stress-induced analgesia (SIA). However, where and how acute stress and pain pathways interface in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we describe how the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a forebrain limbic nucleus, facilitates SIA through its downstream targets in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of mice. Taking advantage of transsynaptic viral-genetic, optogenetic, and chemogenetic techniques, we show that the dLS→LHA circuitry is sufficient to drive analgesia and is required for SIA. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dLS→LHA pathway is opioid-dependent and modulates pain through the pro-nociceptive neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Remarkably, we found that the inhibitory dLS neurons are recruited specifically when the mice struggle to escape under restraint and, in turn, inhibit excitatory LHA neurons. As a result, the RVM neurons downstream of LHA are disengaged, thus suppressing nociception. Together, we delineate a poly-synaptic pathway that can transform escape behavior in mice under restraint to acute stress into analgesia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>chronic pain</kwd><kwd>analgesia</kwd><kwd>septum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/19/2/504640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barik</surname><given-names>Arnab</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2021/1005124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barik</surname><given-names>Arnab</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Acute stress and anxiety can suppress pain, here we reveal a multi-nodal circuit in the brain that connects the two.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Descending modulation of pain is the mechanism through which the brain imparts control over somatosensory information processing in the spinal cord. Forebrain and midbrain regions encoding internal states such as stress and hunger can harness the brainstem circuits that project to the spinal cord neurons to alleviate pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tracey and Mantyh, 2007</xref>). Such analgesic mechanisms are critical for survival since they prepare animals and humans to cope with the stressors or enable them to meet their physiological needs on time. Moreover, harnessing the underlying modulatory mechanisms may lead us to novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain. SIA is one such incidence where an acute stressor, such as physical restraint, can result in analgesia. However, the neural mechanisms that facilitate SIA remain poorly understood.</p><p>Experiments involving human subjects in the 1950s and 1960s have shown that direct electrical stimulation of the dLS has anti-nociceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gol, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olds and Milner, 1954</xref>) effects. In rats, dLS activation suppressed behavioral responses to foot-shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breglio et al., 1970</xref>) or sustained noxious stimuli such as intraplantar formalin injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Melzack, 1978</xref>). Furthermore, septum inactivation or lesion renders rats hypersensitive to sensory stimuli, and as a result, they display exaggerated stimulus-driven defensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Wong, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Köhler, 1976</xref>). dLS neurons receive nociceptive inputs from the thalamus and somatosensory cortices, as well as anxiogenic information from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menon et al., 2022</xref>). Neurotensin expressing dLS neurons with projections to the LHA mediate acute stress mediated suppression of food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these convincing leads indicating the involvement of dLS neurons in the processing of noxious somatosensory stimuli, mechanistic investigation of the role of dLS in nociception remains scarce. Classical studies involving lesions to lateral parts of the septal nucleus resulted in a phenomenon known as septal rage, which leads to heightened defensive responses against non-threatening stimuli, indicative of increased levels of stress and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brady and Nauta, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brady and Nauta, 1955</xref>). Interestingly, dLS is essential to sensing acute stress and instrumental in stress-induced fear and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terrill et al., 2018</xref>). This involvement of dLS in acute stress-induced anxiety is reflected in behavioral phenotypes and the elevated blood corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singewald et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, dLS neurons were shown independently to mediate the effects of both nocifensive behaviors and acute stress. However, the role of dLS neurons in pain modulation in the event of an ongoing stressful stimulus remains unexplored. Hence, we hypothesized that dLS might play a facilitatory role in SIA.</p><p>The dLS neurons communicate primarily through their inhibitory neurotransmitters and have prominent projections to brain areas involved in nociception and pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>). Of note are the projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) and the LHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dafny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shelton et al., 2012</xref>). The midbrain LHb can modulate the affective aspects of pain via its projections to the brainstem periaqueductal gray (PAG) and dorsal raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shelton et al., 2012</xref>). LHA neurons have strong connections to the pain-modulatory nuclei in the brainstem, such as the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and the lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPBN). In addition, recent studies have reported that LHA neurons can sense noxious stimuli and suppress pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siemian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carr and Uysal, 1985</xref>), and specifically, the projections to the RVM were shown to have anti-nociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behbehani et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dafny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franco and Prado, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fuchs and Melzack, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holden and Pizzi, 2008</xref>). Notably, LPBN neurons are one of the primary targets of the ascending nociceptive projection neurons from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Todd, 2010</xref>), and are instrumental in determining nociceptive thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>) and mediating nocifensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arthurs et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that the dLS→LHA circuitry, through downstream circuits, may mediate SIA.</p><p>Here, we have explored the mechanisms through which acute restraint stress (RS)-responsive dLS neurons recruit downstream circuits to provide pain relief. Taking advantage of the anterograde trans-synaptic and retrogradely transporting viral genetic tools for anatomic circuit mapping, we have traced a pathway that originates in the dLS, and routes through LHA while finally terminating onto the spinally-projecting RVM neurons. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of the activity of each node of this pathway informed us on how they play interdependent roles in transforming restrain-induced stress into the suppression of acute thermal pain. Fiber photometry recordings revealed how the inhibitory dLS neurons may suppress the excitatory LHA neurons upon stress, which can disengage pro-nociceptive RVM cells, resulting in analgesia. Taken together, our data propose a mechanism that can explain how RS can suppress pain and lead to understanding how the circuitries dedicated to detecting stress can interface with the ones built for modulating pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dLS neurons drive acute stress and SIA</title><p>The dLS neurons have been known to be engaged by stressful stimuli such as physical restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm this, we compared the expression of c-Fos, a molecular proxy for neural activation, in the dLS of control mice with the mice subjected to the RS assay (see methods). Mice that underwent RS showed increased cFos expression in the dLS as compared to the control unstressed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that dLS neurons may be involved in mediating acute stress, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubo et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, internal states, such as stress, can determine nociceptive thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amit and Galina, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler and Finn, 2009</xref>). Despite extensive investigation into the dLS’s role in stress, not much is known about the involvement of these neurons in pain modulation. Thus, we tested if artificial stimulation of the dLS neurons in the CD1 strain of mice can affect the animal’s latency to response on the tail-flick test and nocifensive behaviors such as licks on the hot-plate test. Tail-flick and hot-plate tests can reveal the involvement of spinal and supraspinal circuitries in behavioral responses to noxious thermal stimuli, respectively. Since most of the dLS neurons are inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we expressed the Gq-coupled excitatory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>) under the inhibitory neuron-specific <italic>Gad1</italic> promoter (dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq-mCherry</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Upon intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the ligands CNO or DCZ, hM3Dq enables neuronal firing. When dLS neurons were activated by administration of i.p. DCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>), the mice exhibited stress and stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors as confirmed by blood corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the light-dark box test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), and the open field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Nocifensive behaviors like licks on the hotplate were suppressed post-DCZ administration in dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq-mCherry</sup> mice, with no changes in the jumping behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). The tail-flick latency in these mice was significantly increased, the number of licks on the hotplate was reduced and the latency to lick initiation increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). Mice with activated dLS neurons showed higher thresholds for mechanical pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Similar changes in mice behavior were observed when these tests were combined with optogenetic activation of the dLS neurons (dLS<sup>Gad1-ChR2-GFP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–M</xref>). Furthermore, it was seen that the analgesic effects of dLS neurons lasted for up to 30 min post optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and this timeline was like the analgesic effects induced by RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Concluding, that the RS-induced thermal analgesia and pain-modulation attained by artificial activation of dLS neurons are comparable. This phenomenon, known as SIA, has previously not been associated with the septal neurons. Furthermore, to investigate whether these dLS neurons are necessary for bringing about SIA, we blocked the spike-evoked neurotransmitter release of dLS neurons by expressing the tetanus toxin light chain protein fused with GFP (TetTox-GFP) (dLS<sup>Gad1-TetTox-GFP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). The efficacy of the tetanus toxin virus was confirmed by testing its effect on mouse behavior in pairing with the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Post-silencing of the dLS neurons, we observed that the stress caused by RS was unable to cause analgesia that was previously seen on both the tail-flick assay and the hotplate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). Again, no difference was seen in the jumping behavior of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Concluding, that the dLS neurons are both sufficient and necessary for SIA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal lateral septum (dLS) neurons are both sufficient and necessary for causing acute restraint-induced analgesia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representing the restraint stress (RS) assay used to induce stress in mice.

To that end, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in the dLS neurons (dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), and performed fiber photometry recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Fiber photometry enables activity monitoring from the genetically and anatomically defined neuronal population in behaving mice and can provide critical insights into how neural activity corresponds to animal behavior in response to a particular stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, we observed spontaneous transients in the dLS neurons of mice expressing GCaMP6s but not in the neurons with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, in mice under RS, dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons were active only when the animals in the RS assay apparatus (see methods) struggled and not when they were freely moving in their home cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that the increased neural activity during the struggle bouts in mice under RS is not simply due to the increased physical activity but due to the need and inability to escape the restraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Similarly, we restrained the mice acutely by hand, and dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons were active during the initial immobilization phase while the mice struggled, after which the activity was reduced when they were unable to move due to the restraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The neurons were active again when the mice were released from the hand restraint and were free to run away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, in agreement with the previous result, the dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons were active when the mice actively struggled to escape any physical restraint. Another acute stress assay that engaged the dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons was the tail hanging assay, wherein mice were suspended in the air by holding their tails for 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Since artificial stimulation or blocking dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> neuronal activity had suppressive effects on pain thresholds, we next tested if the dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons respond to noxious thermal stimuli (52 degrees for 1 min on the hot plate). The dLS<sup>Gad1-GCaMP6s</sup> neurons were found to be inactive during the hot-plate test at innocuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>), as well as at a noxious temperature when the mice exhibited nocifensive behaviors such as licks and shakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>).

Selective activation of the dLS<sup>Gad1-ChR2</sup> terminals in the LHA resulted in increased latency on the tail-flick assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and a reduced number of licks with an increased threshold on the hot-plate assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggestive of analgesia. These observations were like the results from the experiments where the cell bodies of dLS<sup>Gad1-ChR2</sup> neurons were stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that stimulating dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> cell bodies or their axon terminals in the LHA is sufficient to cause analgesia. In complementary experiments, we chemogenetically activated dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> terminals in the LHA. To that end, we devised a novel microparticle (MP)-based delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jain, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sharma et al., 2022</xref>) for CNO (for the MP-based delivery system, hM3Dq agonist CNO was used due to greater hydrophobicity, which is essential for MP packaging, compared to DCZ), which can be injected specifically in the LHA where dLS neurons terminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Compared to the widely-used method for in-vivo drug delivery at deep brain nuclei through cannulae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell and Marchant, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stachniak et al., 2014</xref>), our poly-DL-lactic-co-glycolic (PLGA) microparticle (MP-CNO) based system (see methods) can serve as a stable, cost-effective, non-invasive, site-specific, and sustained method for CNO delivery. To demonstrate the efficacy of the MP-CNO, we stereotaxically injected MP-CNO in the dLS of dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq</sup> and recorded cFos expression in the dLS to confirm that the beads were able to activate the neurons. We observed peak cFos expression on Day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which is in agreement with our observations of analgesic behavior in the mice. In the dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq</sup> mice, MP-CNO was analgesic, and the effects were pronounced between 48–96 hr of delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). Remarkably, the MP-CNO-induced analgesia was comparable to that of i.p. CNO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H, I</xref>). The control mice (dLS<sup>Gad1-tdTomato</sup>) did not demonstrate any difference in behavior over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). Finally, we delivered MP-CNO in the LHA of dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq</sup> mice for terminal activation and observed increased tail-flick thresholds, fewer licks, and higher lick thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J–L</xref>). Thus, our acute optogenetic and chronic chemogenetic axon terminal activation experiments demonstrate that dLS neurons could bring about analgesia through their projections to the LHA.</p><p>Next, we chemogenetically stimulated the dLS neurons whose axon terminals arborize and synapse onto the LHA neurons (dLS<sub>pre-LHA</sub>). To that end, we injected retrogradely transporting AAV (AAVRetro-Cre) in the LHA and DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry in the dLS. This intersectional genetic strategy facilitated excitatory DREADD expression exclusively in dLS<sub>pre-LHA</sub> neurons (dLS<sub>pre-LHA-hM3Dq-mCherry</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). i.p administration of DCZ in the dLS <sub>pre-LHA-hM3Dq-mCherry</sub> mice had similar analgesic effects as seen with dLSGad1activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>), indicating that activation of a specific subset of dLS neurons (dLS<sub>pre-LHA</sub>) is sufficient for altering thermal nociception in mice. In the following experiments, we asked what the effect of chemogenetic activation of the LHA neurons downstream of dLS (LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub>) on thermal nociceptive thresholds would be. To address this, we chemogenetically activated LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons by injecting AAVTrans-Cre in the dLS and AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry in the LHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). I.p. administration of DCZ in mice expressing hM3Dq in LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons reduced the latency to react on the tail-flick assay, increased the number of licks, and decreased the latency to lick on the hot-plate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>). Intriguingly, our data suggest that when activated, dLSGad1 neurons inhibit LHA neurons to cause analgesia, and so when LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons are artificially activated, it has the opposite effect on nocifensive behaviors and leads to hyperalgesia. In addition, given that dLS neurons project to the Hb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and Hb neurons have been shown to have anti-nociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen and Melzack, 1985</xref>), we tested if activating Hb neurons post-synaptic to dLS (Hb<sub>post-dLS</sub>) can alter thermal pain thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). DCZ administration had no effect on thermal pain thresholds in Hb<sub>post-dLS-hM3Dq mice</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N and O</xref>). Furthermore, we tested the effects of silencing the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons on RS-induced SIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). TetTox-mediated LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> silencing abolished SIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q and R</xref>). In summary, the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons are functionally downstream of dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> neurons, and simultaneous transient activation has identical effects on nociceptive thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>dLS neurons synapse onto the Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2)-expressing LHA neurons</title><p>We then tested if the LHA neurons receiving inputs from dLS are excitatory or inhibitory, given that LHA is composed of both <italic>Slc17A6</italic> (encoding the gene for VGlut2) and Vesicular Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Transporter (VGat) or <italic>Slc32A1</italic> expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), with a relatively smaller population of VGlut2-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), which have recently been implicated in pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singewald et al., 2011</xref>). To test if VGlut2 +LHA neurons receive direct inputs from dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> neurons, we took three complementary approaches. First, we injected AAV1-FlpO with anterograde transsynaptic transmission properties (AAV1-hSyn-FlpO or Transyn-FlpO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>) in the dLS of VGlut2-Cre transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Simultaneously, we injected DIO-GFP and fDIO-tdTomato in the LHA of the same mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that 34.2 ± 9.6% (n=8 sections, 3 mice) tdTomato expressing cells (LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub>) were GFP +ve, indicative of their excitatory status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Second, we delivered the anterograde transsynaptic Cre (AAV1-hSyn-Cre or AAVTransyn-Cre) in the dLS of Rosa26<italic><sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> transgenic mice to label the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons with tdTomato and performed multiplex fluorescent in-situ hybridization for VGlut2 and tdTomato mRNA in the LHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that 28.5 ± 11.2% (n=12 sections, 2 mice) tdTomato neurons colocalized with VGlut2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Third, we labeled the synaptic terminals of dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> neurons and post-synaptic densities of LHA-VGlut2 neurons by expressing synaptophysin-fused GFP (SynGFP) in the dLS<sup>Gad1</sup> neurons and Cre-dependent inhibitory postsynaptic protein, Gephyrin fused with red fluorescent protein tagRFP (DIO-GephryrintagRFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>) in the LHA of VGlut2-Cre mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

To test this, we labeled LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons with GCaMP6s (LHA<sub>post-dLS-GCaMP6s</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) and recorded calcium transients from these neurons as mice underwent RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) as well as when they were exposed to noxious thermal stimulus.

This indicates that the activity of pre-synaptic dLS and post-synaptic LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons increases in a coordinated manner at the onset of struggle in mice undergoing RS-assay. However, after the initial activity, LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons can potentially be suppressed by inhibitory dLS inputs causing a reduction in the firing of these post-synaptic neurons.

In previous studies, activation or silencing of LPBN neurons did not alter the reflexive withdrawal thresholds or coping responses, such as licks in response to noxious thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2015</xref>). However, RVM neurons are known to modulate pain bi-directionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">François et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, SIA is opioid-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finn, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vaccarino et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and RVM is a major substrate for endogenous opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields, 2004</xref>). We confirmed the opioid-dependent nature of SIA induced by septal activation, by simultaneous administration of mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone and DCZ in dLS<sup>Gad1-hM3Dq</sup> mice, which lead to the blocking of dLS activation-induced analgesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that the projections of the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons synapse onto RVM neurons and facilitate RS-induced analgesia. To that end, first, we sought to establish the anatomical location and projections of the RVM neurons (RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub>) — that are postsynaptic to the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons. We labeled the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and SynRuby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) separately, using the anterograde intersectional viral genetic strategy used before (AAVTransyn-Cre in LHA; DIO-GFP or DIO-SynRuby in RVM). We observed that the cell bodies of the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons were distributed in the midline area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>) of the medulla. We noticed abundant axon terminals of RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons in the LHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and projections in the deeper layers (VI/ VII) of the lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This implies that the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons may modulate nociceptive thresholds through their local synaptic connections within the RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchand and Hagino, 1983</xref>), recurrent connections with the PAG, or direct interactions with spinal cord neurons. Second, using the monosynaptic retrograde rabies tracing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Callaway and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>), we determined if the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons are the direct postsynaptic partners of the LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons. We expressed G and TVA-GFP proteins in LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons (AAVTransyn-Cre in dLS; DIO-G; DIO-TVA-GFP in LHA) and injected ΔG-Rabies-mCherry in the RVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). As expected, we observed the starter cells that co-expressed TVA-GFP (LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub>) and ΔG-Rabies-mCherry (retrogradely transported from the RVM; LHA<sub>pre-RVM</sub>) in the LHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Remarkably, retrogradely transported rabies-mCherry was found in the dLS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Indicating that the dLS neurons are directly upstream of the RVM projecting LHA neurons. Third, in a complementary approach, we took advantage of the GRASP synaptic labeling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), where presynaptic neurons expressed one-half of the GFP protein, and the postsynaptic neurons expressed the other half. At the functional synapses between the two GFP-subunit expressing neurons, GFP is reconstituted and can be visualized through a fluorescent microscope. In our experiments, we injected Pre-GRASP in the dLS, fDIO-Post-GRASP in the LHA, and AAVRetro-FlpO in the RVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) of the same mice. Simultaneous injection of the three AAVs successfully labeled the synapses between the dLS and LHA<sub>pre-RVM</sub> neurons with GFP in the LHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Calcium transients in the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons increased spontaneously when the mice were subjected to RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, when the mice struggled under restraint, RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neuronal activity was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). The activity of the RVM<sub>post-LHA-GCaMP6s</sub> neurons increased when the mice shook or licked their paws on the hot-plate test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Notably, the rise in activity of the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons preceded the licks and shakes, indicating a facilitatory role of these neurons in nocifensive behaviors. To further confirm this facilitatory role, performed two additional assays. First, we recorded calcium transients from the RVM<sub>post-LHA-GCaMP6s</sub> neurons while the mice were on the hot plate set to a gradient of 32–52 degrees over a period of 5 min. We observed that the neurons started firing only once the hot plate reached noxious temperatures, with no specific activity seen at innocuous temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Second, we subjected the mice to the tail-flick assay and observed a peak in neural firing preceding the tail-flick instance caused by the thermal pain caused by the concentrated beam of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). From these series of experiments, we were able to further confirm the facilitatory role of the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons in nocifensive behaviors. The facilitatory pro-nociceptive population of RVM neurons is otherwise known as ON-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fields et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fields et al., 1991</xref>) Thus, we hypothesized that these RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons are pro-nociceptive and likely ON cells. They are activated by acute stress and suppressed when the mice struggle to escape stress-causing restraint. When we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the Z-score of the recordings from the dLS, LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub>, and RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons while the mice struggled in the RS assay, the data indicated that the dLS activity increased while at the same time LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub>, and RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> activity decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Activating the excitatory ON cells results in hypersensitivity to noxious stimuli, whereas inhibiting the same neurons results in analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>). Since the chemogenetic activation of the pro-nociceptive RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons resulted in thermal hyperalgesia and inhibition leading to pain suppression, we hypothesized that the RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons are excitatory. Thus, to test our hypothesis, we expressed Syn-GFP in the LHA of VGlut2-Cre mice, and PSD95-tagRFP in the RVM of the same mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). When we visualized the RVM with confocal and super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we found close apposition between the GFP-expressing pre-synaptic terminals and tagRFP-expressing VGlut2 expressing RVM neurons. Thus, we concluded that the excitatory LHA neurons impinge upon the excitatory RVM-ON neurons to facilitate RS-induced analgesia. The struggle to escape restraint engages dLS inhibitory neurons. The activated inhibitory dLS neurons silence excitatory LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons, which consequently disengages the pro-nociceptive RVM<sub>post-LHA</sub> neurons to drive RS-induced analgesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The dLS has been traditionally considered a key brain region for mediating stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azevedo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singewald et al., 2011</xref>). However, the role of the dLS in SIA is poorly understood. In this study, we have delineated the downstream partners of dLS and elucidated the mechanisms through which dLS neurons translate stress into pain suppression. We found that the dLS neurons are specifically geared towards coping with stress and, through their connections with the spinal cord via the LHA and the RVM, inhibit responses to noxious stimuli. In conclusion, our study has comprehensively evaluated the involvement of a key neural circuit in SIA by anatomically tracing their connections, monitoring, and manipulating neural activity.</p><p>We wondered what the etiologically relevant function of SIA might be, evolutionarily what benefits SIA might provide, and how dLS plays a role in it. SIA enables animals and humans to physiologically and behaviorally evade or cope with stressors in their immediate environment. When the perceived pain is attenuated, attention is drawn toward escaping the stressor. Several experiments support this view, including studies where rats were subjected to mild electric shocks from a floor plate in either an inescapable or an escapable chamber. It was observed that analgesia occurred when the rats could not escape the chamber after experiencing the electric shocks as opposed to when they could escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maier et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Terman and Liebeskind, 1986</xref>). In line with these studies, we experimentally observed SIA only when mice were restrained for enough time (~1 hr) or when dLS neurons were activated for ~30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). We propose that acute restraint drives animals to attempt to escape, and during these attempts dLS neurons are engaged. When the dLS neurons are activated repeatedly, it provides a short-term analgesia.</p><p>SIA can be particularly pertinent in individuals with chronic pain, where pathological pain can impede the ability to react to a stressor on time. The role of dLS neurons in chronic pain is unclear. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that the dLS neurons promote both pain and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). This is contrary to our data which shows that dLS activation has analgesic effects. The contradiction may be since dLS neurons may play opposing roles under acute and chronic stress conditions. In contrast to acute stress, mechanisms of which we have explored here, chronic stress which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2023</xref> studied, is known to exacerbate pain. In addition, the targeted coordinates for dLS used in the study are medial compared to the ones used in our study. However, as mentioned before, lesion studies in humans or animals have consistently indicated that dLS or medial septum stimulation is anti-nociceptive, irrespective of the nature of the noxious stimulus. Notably, chronic stress can cause hyperalgesia, and the underlying circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. It will be interesting to test if the dLS-LHA circuitry is involved in the reduced pain thresholds observed in mice with chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jennings et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Early studies showed that SIA could either be opioid-dependent or independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Watkins and Mayer, 1986</xref>). Naltrexone administration blocked SIA in rats who had undergone electric shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Drugan et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maier et al., 1980</xref>). Surprisingly, it was found that acute stress can sequentially induce both opioid dependent as well as opioid-independent SIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grau et al., 1981</xref>). Mutant mice without functional ß-endorphin (endogenous ligand for the mu-opioid receptor, OPRM1) lacked opioid-dependent SIA (mild swim stress), however, they displayed opioid-independent SIA (cold-swim stress) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinstein et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, opioid-dependent SIA was primarily induced when the animals underwent stress in inescapable chambers. Thus, successful induction of SIA may depend on the mode of stress delivery, and the opioid dependence may be decided by the exposure time. Our data also suggests that dLS-mediated RS-induced analgesia is opioid dependent, as we found that SIA induced by dLS activation is reversible by naltrexone administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Furthermore, we show that RVM-ON cells play a critical role in dLS-mediated SIA. This observation is supported by a recent study that demonstrated the necessity of kappa-opioid receptors expressing RVM neurons in SIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>). Together, the restraint-induced silencing of LHA excitatory neurons by dLS may turn downstream mu-opioid receptor-expressing RVM-ON cells amenable to enkephalin and endorphin-mediated modulation and consequent analgesia. Typically, RVM-ON cells target enkephalinergic and GABAergic spinal interneurons in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn that gate pain in turn through their connections with the somatosensory primary inputs to modulate pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">François et al., 2017</xref>). However, the neurons of our interest in the RVM target the deeper layers (V/VI) in the dorsal horn and may modulate nociceptive thresholds through independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition to the opioidergic system, SIA is known to be mediated by the endogenous endocannabinoid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hohmann et al., 2005</xref>). Brief and continuous electric shocks result in SIA that is not reversed by naltrexone, but can be blocked by endocannabinoid receptor antagonists. Since, the dLS-mediated SIA is suppressed by naltrexone, it is unlikely to be dependent on the endogenous endocannabinoid pathways.</p><p>Interestingly, LHA is known to have direct spinal projections and thus can directly modulate pain by passing RVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hancock, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Willis and Coggeshall, 2012</xref>). LHA neurons can modulate pain through direct orexinergic inputs to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van den Pol, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The direct orexinergic LHA inputs to the spinal cord terminate in the superficial layers of the spinal cord. At the same time, the LHA neurons of our interest provide indirect inputs via RVM to the deeper layers of the spinal cord. Thus, two independent neural pathways (direct and indirect) originating from the LHA may mediate SIA. The orexinergic system housed in the LHA is recruited by acute stress and thus can supplement the LS-LHA-RVM-spinal cord circuitry in stress-induced pain modulation. We did not find direct inputs of LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons in the spinal cord with an AAV-mediated labeling strategy; however, these neurons can have partial overlap with the orexin population, and our method may not be sensitive enough to label the axon terminals in the spinal cord.</p><p>Notably, LHA neurons are known to respond to stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Owens-French et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and thus can cause SIA independently of dLS. The dLS-independent SIA mechanisms might be driven by the direct orexinergic inputs to the spinal cord from LHA or the PV-expressing LHA neurons can mediate SIA through projections to the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siemian et al., 2021</xref>). This is reflected in our results where we observed transient activation of LHA<sub>post-dLS</sub> neurons when the mice struggled in the RS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition to the excitatory projections tested here, there are inhibitory neurons in the LHA that project to the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moga et al., 1990</xref>). We primarily focused on the excitatory targets of dLS in the LHA, however, LHA is rich in GABAergic neurons and the potential roles of inhibitory targets of dLS in stress-responses remain to be tested. How both excitatory and inhibitory outputs from the LHA can modulate responses to noxious stimuli remains to be investigated. Decades of circuit tracing and functional anatomy studies have revealed synaptic targets of LHA across the brain, including the dLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cassidy et al., 2019</xref>). Such bidirectional connections also exist between the RVM and LHA and exploring the roles of recurrent connections between dLS-LHA/ LHA-RVM in stress-induced pain modulation will further delineate circuit mechanisms of SIA. We developed the microparticle-based CNO administration tool for projection-specific chronic DREADD ligand delivery. The same tool, by tweaking the release rates of the CNO, can be effectively used for chronic neuronal activation/silencing. Finally, the mechanistic interrogation of dLS-centric SIA circuits has revealed a hypothalamic coordinate that effectively connects dLS with RVM to influence nociceptive thresholds. We have primarily focused on thermal nociceptive thresholds, however, it will be interesting to explore how dLS-LHA circuitry influences the effects of stress on other somatosensory modalities, such as itch.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal care and experimental procedures were performed following protocols approved by the IAEC at the Indian Institute of Science.

This study is interesting and important and the conclusions are largely supported by the data. I have a few concerns as follows:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for finding our study “interesting”, “important”, and “conclusions are largely supported by data”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The present data show that activation of dLS neurons produces SIA, however, this manipulation is non-specific. It may be better to see the effect of specific manipulation of stress-activated c-Fos positive neurons in the dLS using a combination of the Tet-Off system and chemogenetic/optogenetic tools.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that activating the stress-“trapped” neurons will be more specific way to induce SIA through septal activation, compared to the activation of entire dLS strategy pursued by us. In most likelihood, we expect to see a robust SIA if specifically stress responsive dLS neurons are observed. We are in the process of acquiring the genetic tools required for “Trapping” stress neurons and expect to be able to perform the experiments suggested by the reviewers in the coming months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Depending on its duration, and intensity, stress can exert potent and bidirectional modulatory effects on pain, either reducing pain (SIA) or exacerbating it (stress-induced hyperalgesia, SIH). Is the circuit in the manuscript involved in SIH?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, it would be reasonable to suspect that the dLS neurons are involved in SIH. However, we believe that the experiments to test this hypothesis is outside the scope of this paper, since here we have focused on the circuit mechanisms for SIA. However, in the revised discussion section, we have included the possibility of dLS neurons driving SIH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is well-accepted that opioid and cannabinoid receptors participate in the SIA, and the evidence is especially strong for the RVM endocannabinoid system. Given this, why did the authors focus their study on the opioid system?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that dLS-mediated SIA may work through neural circuits centered on RVM expressing receptors for either or both opioids and endocannabinoids. We primarily focused on the opioidergic system in the RVM as decades of mechanistic work has revealed how the ON, OFF, and neutral neurons modulate pain through the endogenous opioids and even mediate SIA. In the revised discussion, we have included the possibility of involvement of both pain modulatory systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Does silencing of the dLS neurons affect stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors? Alternatively, what is the relationship between SIA and the level of stress-induced anxiety?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test if the silencing of dLS would affect stress-induced anxiety, as our focus was on the pain modulatory effects of dLS activation. The relationships between levels of SIA and stress-induced anxiety will be interesting to explore in future. We believe we would need better behavioral assays compared to the existing ones to quantitatively measure levels of stress-induced anxiety and SIA levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Direct electrophysiological evidence should be provided to confirm the efficacy of the MP-CNO.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that ex-vivo electrophysiology experiments will substantiate the effectiveness of the MP-CNO. However, we do not have the expertise, or the instrumentation required to perform these experiments in our laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Is the LHA a specific downstream target for SIA, and is the LHA involved in stressinduced anxiety-like behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>Several lines of evidence points to the fact that LHA neurons are involved in stressinduced anxiety. We have also shown that the dLS downstream neurons in the LHA are activated by acute restraint by fiber photometry recordings. Thus, we expect activation of the LHA neurons will cause stress-induced anxiety. However, we wanted to focus on the pain modulation aspect of the dLS-LHA-RVM circuitry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Do LHA neurons have direct projections to the RVM? If yes, what is its role in the SIA?</p></disp-quote><p>Our anatomical studies using transsynaptic anterograde and retrograde viral strategies in the Figure 6 shows that the LHA neurons have direct projections to the RVM, and these neurons are sufficient in driving hyperalgesia, as well as necessary for SIA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shah et al. explore the function of an understudied neural circuitry from the dLS -&gt; LHA -&gt; RVM in mediating stress-induced analgesia. They initially establish this neural circuitry through a series of intersectional tracings. Subsequently, they conduct behavioral tests, coupled with optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations, to confirm the involvement of this pathway in promoting analgesia. Additionally, fiber photometry experiments are employed to investigate the activity of each brain region in response to stress and pain.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the study is comprehensive, and the findings are compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for finding our manuscript “comprehensive” and “compelling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One noteworthy concern arises regarding the overarching hypothesis that restrainedinduced stress promotes analgesia. A more direct interpretation suggests that intense struggling, rather than stress per se, activates the dLS -&gt; LHA -&gt; RVM pathway that may drive analgesic responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data can be interpreted as “intense struggling”, rather than the “acute stress” might have altered the pain thresholds in mice. However, we would like to point out that the restraint induced stress model that we have used has been long regarded as a standard for inducing stress. Moreover, we have demonstrated that dLS activation results into acute stress by measuring the blood corticosterone levels, and showed that dLS activations caused stress-induced anxiety through lightdark box tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please find below my other comments for improvements.</p><p>Introduction: The authors claimed that &quot;dLS neurons receive nociceptive inputs from the thalamus and somatosensory cortices.&quot; However, citations are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 B&amp;C: Although this paper focuses on the dLS, it would be informative to also include vLS c-Fos images (maybe in a supplementary figure), given that these data appear to be already acquired. The inclusion of vLS data will provide critical information regarding potential specificity (or lack of) across LS subregions in stress responses.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have added the vLS c-Fos images as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D: Quantification of Vgat vs. Vglut neurons is missing. It is unclear if the Vgat neurons are restricted to small clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not add the Vglut vs, Vgat quantification since from both of our experiments and publicly available data from the Allen Brain Atlas show that almost all of the neurons in the LS are gabaergic. We found very rare,0-2 Vglut2 expressing neurons per section in the the LS of the mouse brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G: The Y-axis label is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the axis in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The authors claimed that dLS neurons are preferentially tuned to stress caused by physical restraint. However, it appears that these neurons are specifically tuned to intense struggle behavior (transient) rather than stress (prolonged).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the SIA observed in mice with dLS activation, can be interpreted as the effect of transient struggle behavior rather than the prolonged stress. However, we would like to point out that the acute restraint for one hour is known to produce prolonged stress, and is backed up by increased blood coticosterone levels and stress-induced anxiety (Fig1-Fig Supplementary 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The authors provided compelling evidence that dLS neurons synapse on LHA Vglut2 neurons. However, it is unclear if they exclusively target the Vglut2 neurons or also synapse on LHA Vgat neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that even though the majority of the dLS downstream neurons in the LHA are glutamatergic, as now shown in the Fig. 4D, few neurons do not express Vglut and thus must be Gabaergic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5D: It is unclear if the trace represents dLS or LHA calcium signal (in the main text, the authors claimed both).</p></disp-quote><p>Now, we have mentioned the neurons on the LHA we have recorded from at the top of Figure 5C, D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 G&amp;H: Presumably, ΔG-Rabies does not transmit across neurons due to the deletion of the glycoprotein (G) gene. Thus, it is unclear why dLS and LHA neurons express mCherry after injecting rabies into RVM.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of the rabies experiment was to test that the cells in the LHA that receive inputs from the dLS are the same ones that send projections downstream to the RVM. To this end, we used a monosynaptic rabies virus that has retrograde properties. Hence, when injected into the RVM, it was taken up by the terminals of the LHA neurons in the RVM and traveled to the cell bodies in the LHA. We injected the AAV1-Transsyn-Cre in the dLS, so only the cells downstream of the dLS in the LHA can express the Credependent glycoprotein (G) gene. Thus, the rabies-mCherry virus infected the LHA neurons downstream of dLS specifically, and jumped a synapse, to label the upstream dLS neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that &quot;RVMpost-LHA neurons may modulate nociceptive thresholds through their local synaptic connections within the RVM, recurrent connections with the PAG, or direct interactions with spinal cord neurons.&quot; It is unclear what the &quot;local synaptic connections within the RVM&quot; means. It is also unclear whether there is evidence of recurrent connections between the RVM and PAG.</p></disp-quote><p>We meant by local connections as intrinsic connections within the RVM, as in some or few of the RVM neurons, post LHA might be interneurons and mediating SIA by modulating the ON or OFF cells. There are some anatomical evidence for the ascending inputs from RVM to the PAG and the we have now included the citation in the mentioned section of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
