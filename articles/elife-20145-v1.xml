Using the gnotobiotic zebrafish, we discovered that the normal expansion of the pancreatic β cell population during early larval development requires the intestinal microbiota and that specific bacterial members can restore normal β cell numbers. These bacteria share a gene that encodes a previously undescribed protein, named herein BefA (β Cell Expansion Factor A), which is sufficient to induce β cell proliferation in developing zebrafish larvae. Homologs of BefA are present in several human-associated bacterial species, and we show that they have conserved capacity to stimulate β cell proliferation in larval zebrafish. Our findings highlight a role for the microbiota in early pancreatic β cell development and suggest a possible basis for the association between low diversity childhood fecal microbiota and increased diabetes risk.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20145.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20145.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20145.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a long time, genes and carefully orchestrated chemical signals from the mother’s body have been known to shape the earliest phases of an embryo’s development. More recently, researchers have started to appreciate that environmental cues – such as signals from nearby bacteria – also shape animal development.</p><p>The body is home to a teeming community of bacteria and other microbes, called the microbiota. Because the gut houses more microbes than any other part of the body, the role that the microbiota plays in gut development has been investigated. Less is known about how the microbiota affects the development of the other organs involved in digestion, such as the pancreas. In developing fish and mammals, the pancreas grows its population of insulin-producing beta cells during the same period of development in which the microbial population of the gut becomes established.</p><p>Now, Hill et al. show that certain gut bacteria are necessary for the pancreas to populate itself with a robust number of beta cells during development. Normally, the number of beta cells in zebrafish larvae increases steadily in the first few days after hatching. However, developing zebrafish that were reared in a microbe-free environment maintained the same number of beta cells as they had before hatching. Exposing the microbe-free fish to certain bacteria restored their beta cell populations to normal levels. Further investigation revealed that these bacteria release a protein called BefA that causes the beta cells to multiply.</p><p>Some bacteria in humans produce proteins that are similar to BefA. Hill et al. performed experiments that showed that these proteins also stimulate beta cell development in microbe-free fish. Future studies are now needed to investigate the mechanism by which the proteins affect beta cell development, and to find out whether they have the same effect in humans and other animals. This will help us to understand whether a lack of gut microbes could contribute to the development of diseases, such as diabetes, that are characterized by insufficient numbers of beta cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20145.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20145.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>beta cells</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM098911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guillemin</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007413-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Jennifer Hampton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01HD22486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guillemin</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A previously undescribed protein produced by certain resident intestinal bacteria induces zebrafish pancreatic beta cell expansion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host-associated microbes play important roles in the development of animal digestive tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Semova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013</xref>). Using the gnotobiotic zebrafish model, our group has shown previously that resident microbes promote host processes in the developing intestine such as epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2006</xref>) and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheesman et al., 2011</xref>). The role of microbes in the development of other digestive organs remains underexplored, despite the fact that many diseases in peripheral digestive organs are correlated with microbial dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Lin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gülden et al., 2015</xref>). The ability to manipulate resident microbes in the larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milligan-Myhre et al., 2011</xref>), combined with the optical transparency and sophisticated genetic tools of the zebrafish model, make it a powerful platform to investigate this question. Here, we use gnotobiotic zebrafish to demonstrate a role for resident microbes in promoting pancreatic β cell development.</p><p>The zebrafish has a well-characterized program of β cell development, which is highly conserved with that of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kinkel and Prince, 2009</xref>). In the zebrafish embryo, initial β cells arise from precursors within the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biemar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Field et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The two buds fuse by 52 hr post fertilization (hpf), and give rise to the fully fated pancreas with only a single islet of hormone-secreting endocrine cells, by 3 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biemar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Field et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar, 2003</xref>). Coinciding with the approximate time of larval emergence from the chorion by 3 dpf, these newly fated β cells begin to expand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hesselson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moro et al., 2009</xref>). β cells derived from the dorsal bud become quiescent, while ventral bud derived β cells begin to undergo expansion via mechanisms of both proliferation and neogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hesselson et al., 2009</xref>). Between 3 and 6 dpf, the number of β cells within the primary islet will almost double (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moro et al., 2009</xref>). Intestinal colonization with microbes occurs concurrently with this early larval period of β cell expansion. Following development of the gut tube within the sterile embryo, the intestine of the emergent larva becomes open to the environment at both the mouth and the vent by 3.5 dpf, allowing for inoculation by environmental microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2006</xref>). Within the larval gut, bacteria proliferate rapidly, such that a single species in mono-association can reach the luminal carrying capacity within several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jemielita et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Human post-natal β cell expansion also occurs concurrently with intestinal tract colonization by commensal microbes. In utero, β cells are produced via differentiation from progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Georgia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanger et al., 2007</xref>) and at birth this newly fated cell population begins to expand by self-proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgia and Bhushan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kassem et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teta et al., 2007</xref>). β cell proliferation rates peak at 2 years of age and then steadily decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregg et al., 2012</xref>). By 5 years of age, most of the β cell mass has become slow cycling and will not expand significantly again unless stimulated by elevated metabolic demands, such as obesity or pregnancy. At birth, infants are exposed to their mothers’ vaginal, fecal and skin associated microbes, which immediately begin to colonize the neonatal intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biasucci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>). By 3 years of age, the composition and complexity of the microbiota typically resembles that of an adult associated community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murgas Torrazza and Neu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>). However, factors such as diet, birth mode and antibiotic exposure can result in reduced microbial taxonomic diversity during these early years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, factors that reduce microbiota diversity are also associated with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knip et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of β cell function through autoimmunity results in abnormal glucose homeostasis and is the cause of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in humans. Recent studies have shown that decreased taxonomic diversity of the intestinal microbiota is correlated with T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giongo et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, loss of bacterial diversity precedes the onset of T1D in children, and may play a causative role in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kostic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, no one has yet investigated a role for the gut microbiota in the development of pancreatic β cells. Communication between the intestine and the pancreas is critical for overall homeostasis. The two organs are therefore connected physically, metabolically, and developmentally in order to carry out their essential functions. We propose that this established and important connection might also mediate the influence of resident microbes on developmental processes in the pancreas. Here we examine the effects of microbial colonization on initial expansion of zebrafish primary islet β cells. We find that β cell mass expansion, up to at least 6 dpf, is promoted by the presence of the microbiota. Using a culture collection of zebrafish intestinal bacteria, we show that certain strains can restore β cell expansion in germ free (GF) fish. We report the discovery of a secreted protein, shared among these strains and named herein β cell expansion factor A (BefA) that is sufficient to recapitulate this effect. Homologs of the <italic>befA</italic> gene are present in the genomes of a subset of human intestinal bacteria, and we show that two of the corresponding proteins share BefA’s capacity to induce β cell expansion in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The microbiota is required for normal expansion of the larval β cell mass</title><p>To investigate a possible role for the microbiota in pancreas development and specifically in β cell expansion, we quantified total β cells in GF and conventionally reared (CV) <italic>Tg(-1.0insulin:eGFP)</italic> fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">diIorio et al., 2002</xref>) at 3, 4, 5 and 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) we identified those proteins from our candidate list that were, first, predicted to be encoded by the genomes of the four bacterial strains with β cell expansion capacity, and second, absent from the strains lacking this capacity. Our analysis identified one single candidate gene, denoted by the locus tag, <italic>M001_10165 (10165),</italic> predicted to encode a putative protein of 261 amino acids.

Because our 48-hr EdU pulse labeled β cells born from both events, our experiment did not distinguish the exact cell population undergoing proliferation in response to BefA. Due to their low rates of proliferation, dividing β cells are difficult to detect without pulse labeling. Neogenesis of β cells from progenitors is also rare, but can be detected as the appearance of insulin positive cells in the extra-pancreatic duct (EPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hesselson et al., 2009</xref>).

BefA and related homologues are predicted to contain a C-terminal SYLF domain, which has been described in proteins from organisms in all kingdoms of life, including humans, but for which little is known functionally beyond a possible role in lipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasegawa et al., 2011</xref>). Genes encoding BefA and related proteins are found in a small subset of all bacteria genera, with a predominance in genera of host-associated bacteria, but <italic>befA</italic> homologues are not ubiquitously present in any of these genera.</p><p>Our finding of a role for specific secreted bacterial proteins in β cell development raises the possibility of a new link between the resident microbiota and diseases of β cell paucity, such as diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes (T1D), is caused by both genetic and environmental factors, as indicated by the 50% disease discordance among monozygotic twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerblom et al., 2002</xref>). One environmental factor associated with T1D is microbiota composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gülden et al., 2015</xref>). Mechanistic models for the role of the microbiota in T1D etiology have focused on the capacity of the microbiota to modulate the development and function of the immune system, and thus influence the propensity of genetically susceptible individuals to develop autoimmunity to β cell antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gülden et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple aspects of host immune cell development and function known to play a role in T1D are altered by the loss of microbes, including development of lymphoid tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macpherson and Harris, 2004</xref>) and T cell differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farkas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ivanov et al., 2008</xref>). We hypothesize an additional role for the early microbiota in establishing the β cell population size that would either buffer against, or render individuals susceptible to, β cell depletion by autoimmune destruction.</p><p>In humans, β cells undergo a period of postnatal expansion, before becoming quiescent around age two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregg et al., 2012</xref>). Differences in β cell growth during this time are thought to account for the wide variation in β cell mass observed in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>). The idea that early life β cell census could influence diabetes risk is supported by studies in both rodents and humans, and has been theorized as an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaijser et al., 2009</xref>), a disease which is also influenced strongly by microbiota composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox and Blaser, 2014</xref>). Compromised β cell development in rats results in an insufficient number of cells to adequately control glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Figliuzzi et al., 2010</xref>). In mice, perinatal β cell proliferation rates can be tuned via the modulation of Gi-GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2015</xref>). Changes to early β cell proliferation capacity in these mice correlates directly with adult β cell mass, which subsequently impacts glucose regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, meta analysis of human data has revealed a correlation between an early age of β cell loss and more rapid onset of T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klinke, 2008</xref>), consistent with the model that failure to generate a reserve of β cells early in development increases disease risk.</p><p>We hypothesize that neonatal microbiomes with a low abundance of BefA equivalents would result in reduced β cell proliferation, lower β cell mass, and increased diabetes risk. We do not know how many different microbiota-derived molecules can stimulate β cell proliferation, but for the case of <italic>befA</italic> homologues, we know these to be sparsely distributed in bacterial genomes, such that microbiomes of low taxonomic diversity could lack these genes. The idea that microbiota-derived factors capable of protecting against diabetes are not widely conserved is consistent with human microbiota profiling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>), our own functional assays of bacteria in gnotobiotic zebrafish, and other gnotobiotic rodent experiments. For example, specific bacterial lineages have been shown to attenuate disease in diabetes models, including <italic>Segmented Filamentous Bacteria</italic> (SFB) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kriegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yurkovetskiy et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Lactobacillus johnsonii</italic> in the Biobreeding rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valladares et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, Wen and colleagues have shown that certain microbial assemblages, but not others, confer disease protection in neonatal NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). Additional recent work by Wen and colleagues demonstrates early development as a critical window for microbiota modulation of disease risk in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). We have shown that BefA acts during early developmental stages in zebrafish, and we hypothesize that β cell expansion during this developmental window is important for disease prevention, and may be a critical period for clinical intervention for infants at risk for T1D development. Further work will be required to determine whether BefA is capable of inducing proliferation of adult β cells in zebrafish or other animals.</p><p>Why certain bacteria produce BefA is unclear. In the context of the zebrafish intestinal environment, BefA confers a slight colonization advantage to <italic>A. veronii</italic>, however this is unlikely to be related to its capacity to induce β cell mass, because the colonization requirement is only apparent in the context of co-colonization with wild type <italic>A. veronii</italic> that induce normal β cell numbers. It is possible that bacterial modulation of host β cell number serves a purpose for the bacteria not measured in our assay. Alternatively, bacteria may produce BefA for a purpose independent of β cell expansion and the host simply uses this bacterial molecule as a cue for its own developmental program. Learning the molecular basis for BefA sensing by the host, and whether it interacts directly or indirectly with β cells, will help shed light on the nature and evolutionary conservation of this interspecies signaling. It will also be important to understand the bacterial function of BefA in order to be able to manipulate its abundance for potential therapeutic purposes.</p><p>The incidence of autoimmune diseases such as T1D has been increasing markedly in developed nations over the past several decades. One theory to explain this phenomenon is the disappearing microbiota hypothesis, which proposes that over time, as our modern lifestyles have become increasingly sterile, we have lost ancestral microbial symbionts important for specific aspects of our health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaser and Falkow, 2009</xref>). Our discovery of a specific class of bacterial proteins that promote β cell expansion in early development is consistent with the hypothesis that loss of specific microbial taxa from gut microbiota could underlie increased diabetes risk. Specifically, we suggest that BefA-like proteins promote the establishment of a robust β cell population that is more resilient to subsequent β cell loss. Because <italic>befA</italic> is a relatively rare component of the microbiome, we cannot measure it directly from available metagenomic sequence data to test our hypothesis that <italic>befA</italic> abundance correlates with reduced diabetes risk. The low abundance of <italic>befA</italic> in metagenomes also highlights the challenge of discovering disease determinants from metagenomic data, and emphasizes the importance of functional screening approaches. The larval zebrafish has served as a valuable high-throughput vertebrate model for the identification of new compounds and pathways that can increase β cell numbers exogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015a</xref>). We have employed the gnotobiotic zebrafish to explore how microbial cues modulate β cell development. Our discovery of BefA highlights the importance of the microbiota in shaping the development of an extra-intestinal tissue and influencing the overall metabolic state of the host. We postulate that resident bacteria are a rich and underexplored source of functionally conserved molecules that shape early host development in ways that impact disease risk in later life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gnotobiotic zebrafish</title><p>All zebrafish experiments were performed using protocols approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Care and Use Committee and followed standard protocols.

Entire experiments or technical replicates were repeated multiple times, resulting in pooled data sets of about 20–50 biological replicates. These data are represented in the figures as box and whisker plots, which display the data median (line within the box), first and third quartiles (top and bottom of the box), and 95% confidence interval (whiskers). Any data point falling outside the 95% confidence interval is represented as a solid dot. These pooled data were analyzed through the statistical software RStudio. For experiments comparing just two differentially treated populations, a Student’s t-test with equal variance assumptions was used. For experiments measuring a single variable with multiple treatment groups, a single factor ANOVA with post hoc means testing (Tukey) was utilized. A p-value of less than 0.05 was required to reject the null hypothesis that no difference existed between groups of data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Graf for providing us with the <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> HM21strains, T Wiles for guidance in the construction of the <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> HM21<italic><sup>ΔbefA</sup></italic> strain, A Rolig and A Banse for technical advice with CFS preparation, E Goers Sweeny for technical advice with protein purification, P De Verteuil for assistance with colonization experiments, R Sockol and the University of Oregon Zebrafish Facility for maintenance of zebrafish lines, and JPostlethwait, J Eisen, A Powell, A Rolig and T Jones for critical reading of the manuscript.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A conserved bacterial protein induces pancreatic beta cell expansion during zebrafish development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Daniel Hesselson (Reviewer #2) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this elegant paper from the Guillemin lab, the authors report the surprising discovery of a bacterial protein that positively regulates the number of pancreatic β cells in zebrafish by inducing β cell proliferation. The data are in general of high quality (see below for some concerns) as is the writing, and the significance of the findings is very high.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The variability of the wild-type sample in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (especially at 6 dpf) is really quite surprising (previous publications have not reported such variability) and could be due to a number of factors including the method used to count (transgene vs. Ab), the imaging platform, the counting method itself (by hand vs using a particular software), whether the fish are well synchronized and healthy (and thus with a similar amount of yolk left), and whether they are fed or not(the variability in control animals in the later figures appears to be reduced).</p><p>[Ideally, the combination of a membrane and a nuclear marker would be best.]</p><p>It is also possible that the variability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> comes from non-random sampling of the cohort. If the authors started with a pool of animals at 3 dpf and chose the healthiest/most developed larvae each day then collected the remainder at 6 dpf that would explain the apparent loss of β cells and increased variability between 5 dpf and 6 dpf in the CV controls. Perhaps this experiment should be repeated with a defined sampling plan.</p><p>2) In the germ free animals (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), what is the identity of the other cells in the islet? The authors should stain the animals for glucagon and somatostatin to determine A) whether CV vs GF conditions affect differentiation of the other endocrine cell types and B) if α/δ cell mass is affected whether this activity is also mediated by BefA. It is also possible that BefA affects hormone expression rather than cell differentiation which would also be an interesting observation.</p><p>3) Does the microbiota/BefA act solely by stimulating proliferation of mature β cells or does it also have effects on endocrine progenitors? In mammals these processes are temporally separated with the vast majority of neogenesis occurring before birth under sterile conditions followed by diet (and now possibly microbiota) induced proliferation postnatally. In zebrafish both of these processes occur concurrently during early larval development and contribute to the expansion of the β cell mass from 3 to 6 dpf. The 48 h EdU pulse used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would have labeled proliferating endocrine progenitor cells that subsequently differentiated into β cells in addition to proliferating β cells. Phospho-histone H3 staining should be used to clarify whether BefA stimulates proliferation of mature β cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20145.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The variability of the wild-type sample in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (especially at 6 dpf) is really quite surprising (previous publications have not reported such variability) and could be due to a number of factors including the method used to count (transgene vs. Ab), the imaging platform, the counting method itself (by hand vs using a particular software), whether the fish are well synchronized and healthy (and thus with a similar amount of yolk left), and whether they are fed or not (the variability in control animals in the later figures appears to be reduced).</italic> </p><p><italic>[Ideally, the combination of a membrane and a nuclear marker would be best.]</italic> </p><p><italic>It is also possible that the variability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> comes from non-random sampling of the cohort.

The data were also randomly sampled, as we raised a separate pool of fish for each day samples were taken.</p><p>The data in our manuscript is displayed using box plots, with whiskers denoting 5-95% of the values of the <italic>entire</italic> data set, whereas the data from other manuscripts quantifying β cell number is most often displayed using a histogram, with error bars representing either the standard error (SE) or the standard error of the mean (SEM) (Andersson et al. Cell Met. 2012, Hesselson et al. <italic>PNAS</italic>. 2009, Wang et al. <italic>eLife</italic>. 2015, Ye et al. Development. 2015). We chose to use box plots to represent our data to convey maximal information and transparency, as discussed by Krzywinski and Altman in Nature Methods in 2014. It is difficult to get an indication of the total variation of a data set from SE and SEM. These measurements are usually much smaller than the total variation we have shown in our box plots. Therefore, it is understandable that our figures appear to have larger than normal variation. For comparison, we transformed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> into a histogram with error bars representing SEM, and placed it next to a similar graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel G) from Andersson et al. Cell Met. 2012, which also used SEM. Of note, the error bars from both works are similar in size. The exact numerical values for the standard deviation as well as the SEM for all of our data can also be found in the corresponding source data file. Descriptions of our graphical representations are also indicated in our manuscript within the figure legends and methods.</p><p><italic>2) In the germ free animals (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), what is the identity of the other cells in the islet? The authors should stain the animals for glucagon and somatostatin to determine A) whether CV vs GF conditions affect differentiation of the other endocrine cell types and B) if α/δ cell mass is affected whether this activity is also mediated by BefA. It is also possible that BefA affects hormone expression rather than cell differentiation which would also be an interesting observation.</italic> </p><p>We have added quantifications of both glucagon-expressing α and somatostatin-expressing δ cells in GF, CV and BefA treated larvae to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Text descriptions of these results start in the last paragraph of the subsection “BefA facilitates β cell expansion by inducing proliferation”. We found no change in the total numbers of either of these cell types across treatments.</p><p><italic>3) Does the microbiota/BefA act solely by stimulating proliferation of mature β cells or does it also have effects on endocrine progenitors? In mammals these processes are temporally separated with the vast majority of neogenesis occurring before birth under sterile conditions followed by diet (and now possibly microbiota) induced proliferation postnatally. In zebrafish both of these processes occur concurrently during early larval development and contribute to the expansion of the β cell mass from 3 to 6 dpf. The 48 h EdU pulse used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would have labeled proliferating endocrine progenitor cells that subsequently differentiated into β cells in addition to proliferating β cells. Phospho-histone H3 staining should be used to clarify whether BefA stimulates proliferation of mature β cells.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we performed anti-PH3 antibody staining on 6 dpf larvae to determine whether BefA or other microbes could increase proliferation of mature β cells. We found PH3 marked β cells to be very rare in all treatments. Based on the initial results from our experiment of about 50 fish per treatment, we calculated the number of samples needed to adequately power a study that <italic>would</italic>be able to detect a difference in PH3 staining between our treatments. We approximated that 1300 fish per treatment were required to be confident that no difference actually exists in PH3 staining. We are unable to perform an experiment of this scale and therefore we cannot support or refute the possibility that BefA acts by inducing proliferation of existing β cells.</p><p>In parallel, we measured the effect of the microbiota on neogenesis. Since differentiation of β cells from 4-6 dpf occurs within the extra-pancreatic duct (EPD) (Dong et al., 2007; Hesselson et al., 2009), we quantified the number of insulin positive cells located in the region of the EPD in 6 dpf GF and CV larvae. Again, detection of β cells in this region at a single moment in time is a relatively rare event, but we were able to use larvae from past experiments to gather sufficient sample sizes to power this study. We found that there were significantly more EPD localized insulin+ cells in CV fish than in GF fish. We have included a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) with these data. We also quantified EPD localized β cells in BefA treated fish, however we did not have a sufficient sample size (which we calculated to be about 200 fish) to detect a statistically significant difference, although the result is trending in the direction of CV larvae.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot conclusively determine the mechanism by which BefA increases EdU incorporation in β cells. We have changed the text to reflect the possibilities discussed above, in the subsection “BefA facilitates β cell expansion by inducing proliferation”. We believe that this question is important, and should be more extensively explored in a future publication focused on how the host detects and interprets BefA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
