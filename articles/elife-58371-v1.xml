pachyptila</italic> hosts a single 16S rRNA phylotype of intracellular sulfur-oxidizing symbionts, which vary considerably in cell morphology and exhibit a remarkable degree of physiological diversity and redundancy, even in the same host. To elucidate whether multiple metabolic routes are employed in the same cells or rather in distinct symbiont subpopulations, we enriched symbionts according to cell size by density gradient centrifugation. Metaproteomic analysis, microscopy, and flow cytometry strongly suggest that <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont cells of different sizes represent metabolically dissimilar stages of a physiological differentiation process: While small symbionts actively divide and may establish cellular symbiont-host interaction, large symbionts apparently do not divide, but still replicate DNA, leading to DNA endoreduplication. Moreover, in large symbionts, carbon fixation and biomass production seem to be metabolic priorities. We propose that this division of labor between smaller and larger symbionts benefits the productivity of the symbiosis as a whole.</p></abstract><kwd-group

<italic>Riftia pachyptila</italic> (here <italic>Riftia</italic>), provides all nutrition for its gutless host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavanaugh et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Endoriftia) densely populates <italic>Riftia</italic>’s trophosome, a specialized organ in the worm’s trunk, where the bacteria are housed intracellularly in host bacteriocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hand, 1987</xref>). Here, fueled by the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (mainly sulfide), the symbionts fix CO<sub>2</sub> and produce considerable amounts of biomass, which constitutes the host’s source of nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavanaugh et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Felbeck et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Childress et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Goffredi et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Girguis and Childress, 2006</xref>). <italic>Riftia</italic> acquires these nutrients mainly by directly digesting parts of the symbiont population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hand, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boetius and Felbeck, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the symbionts possibly also actively secrete carbon compounds into the bacteriocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Felbeck and Jarchow, 1998</xref>). Thus provided, <italic>Riftia</italic> grows rapidly and reaches nearly 2 m in body length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Jones, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Lutz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">McClain et al., 2015</xref>), despite its lack of a digestive system. This enormous productivity is underpinned by a multitude of symbiosis-specific adaptations of both host and symbiont. These include host proteins involved in substrate transport from the hydrothermal vent environment to the symbionts, such as ATPases and carbonic anhydrases for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Goffredi et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">De Cian et al., 2003</xref>), and specialized extracellular hemoglobins which simultaneously and reversibly bind sulfide and oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Childress et al., 1984</xref>). Moreover, symbiont cells in the highly vascularized trophosome contain globules of elemental sulfur, an intermediate of sulfide oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Pflugfelder et al., 2005</xref>). As trophosome sulfur content is positively correlated with sulfide concentrations in the surrounding water and decreases in the absence of external sulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Childress et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Robidart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Scott et al., 2012</xref>), sulfur in the symbionts likely serves as an energy reserve for times of sulfide deprivation.</p><p>Although the symbiont population consists of a single 16S rRNA phylotype (comprising one dominating and several minor genotypes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Polzin et al., 2019</xref>), it was previously shown to exhibit remarkable metabolic versatility and redundancy: As demonstrated by proteomic analyses, symbionts from the same host animal expressed enzymes of two CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways, the Calvin cycle and the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, as well as enzymes for both glycogen generation and glycogen degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Markert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gardebrecht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, proteins involved in utilization of hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate as energy sources were expressed simultaneously by the same symbiont population; as were proteins for the use of nitrate and oxygen as electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that individual, metabolically distinct symbiont subpopulations in the trophosome may exist.</p><p>These presumptive subpopulations are likely congruent with symbionts of different cell sizes: Individual Endoriftia cells exhibit pronounced morphological diversity, ranging from small rods to small and large cocci in ultimate proximity to each other within the same host specimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hand, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>). In individual trophosome lobules, which measure approximately 200–500 µm in diameter, the smallest, rod-shaped symbiont cells are located close to the central blood vessel, whereas toward the lobule periphery, symbionts gradually increase in size and become coccoid, before they are degraded in the outermost lobule zone. Only small Endoriftia cells and the host bacteriocytes in which they reside appear to undergo cell division, indicating that small and large symbionts belong to a common cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>). Previous microscopy-based studies indicated that small and large <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts differ not only with regard to their frequency of cell division, but also with regard to carbon incorporation rates, amount of stored glycogen, and area of sulfur storage vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bright et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sorgo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Pflugfelder et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that individual cell sizes may indeed have dissimilar metabolic properties.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to analyze and compare the metabolic profiles of individual <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont subpopulations. Unlike previous molecular analyses that studied the uncultured <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont’s metabolic capabilities on the population level in a mixture of all cell sizes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Markert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gardebrecht et al., 2012</xref>), precluding comparisons between putative subpopulations, we used a more sensitive approach. We enriched Endoriftia cells of different sizes by gradient centrifugation of trophosome tissue homogenate and subjected these enriched gradient fractions to separate metaproteomic analyses. Statistical evaluation using clustering and random forests allowed us to deduce cell size-dependent differences in protein abundance and metabolic functions. To assess whether these differences might be influenced by naturally occurring variations in energy supply, we conducted our analyses with symbionts from both sulfur-rich and sulfur-depleted trophosomes. Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-FISH analyses, and flow cytometry complemented these experiments. Our results suggest a division of labor between different developmental stages of the symbiont, which leads to remarkable physiological heterogeneity within the symbiont population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enrichment of individual symbiont cell sizes by gradient centrifugation</title><p>Our rate-zonal gradient centrifugation approach allowed us to enrich distinct symbiont cell sizes from <italic>Riftia</italic> trophosome tissue. Based on CARD-FISH microscopy, we defined four size ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): very small symbiont cells (≥2.0 –&lt;3.9 µm diameter), small (≥3.9 –&lt;5.3 µm), medium (≥5.3 –&lt;6.8 µm), and large symbiont cells (≥6.8–20.0 µm; see also Appendix section A). For subsequent comparative metaproteomic analyses, we chose those gradient fractions that were most enriched in one of these cell size ranges. In the following, these four gradient fractions are referred to as XS (containing the highest percentage of very small symbiont cells) to L (containing the highest percentage of large cells). The enrichment procedure was highly reproducible, particularly for symbionts isolated from sulfur-rich trophosome tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CARD-FISH images of <italic>Riftia </italic>symbiont cells after density gradient centrifugation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) images of <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont cells after density gradient centrifugation of trophosome homogenate.

To identify distinguishable bacterial cell populations, we examined Syto9-stained cells in <italic>Riftia</italic> trophosome homogenate and in gradient fractions from the upper and lower parts of the gradient (enriched in smaller and larger symbionts, respectively) with regard to their light scattering properties. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) usually correlate with cell size and cell granularity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouvier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Tracy et al., 2010</xref>). Amongst a number of particle groups with different properties (see also Appendix section C), we found two populations, 1 and 2, which were abundantly detected in non-enriched trophosome homogenate, but showed very dissimilar frequencies in fractions enriched in larger or smaller symbionts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>): While population 1, which exhibited relatively lower FSC and SSC signals (indicative of smaller cell size and lower cell complexity), was highly abundant in fractions enriched in smaller symbionts, this population was notably less prominent in fractions enriched in larger symbionts. Simultaneously, population 2, which gave higher FSC and SSC signals (indicative of larger cell size and higher complexity), was highly abundant in fractions enriched in larger symbionts but nearly absent in gradient fractions enriched in smaller symbionts. This suggests that populations 1 and 2 consist of smaller and larger symbionts, respectively. This assumption was verified by FACS-separation of both populations from trophosome homogenate, and examination of the sorted cell suspensions by fluorescence microscopy along with unsorted enriched gradient fractions and homogenate samples for reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For quantification of DNA in smaller and larger symbionts, we compared median fluorescence intensities (MFI) per particle between populations 1 and 2 in non-enriched homogenate and in enriched gradient fractions.

Bacterial histone-like DNA-binding proteins like HU and IHF structure the chromosome and modulate the degree of supercoiling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dorman and Deighan, 2003</xref>).

Although the reason for this congruence is yet unknown, one might speculate that cell-division-related processes require elevated levels of chaperones and stress proteins, for example, to ensure correct assembly of all parts of the division machinery or (in case of intracellular bacteria) to counteract some sort of yet to be determined host-induced stress.</p><p>Possibly, such host-induced stress may also involve the production of ROS in symbiont-containing bacteriocytes, similar to animal and plant hosts, which generate ROS to defend themselves against pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Heath, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Lynch and Kuramitsu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D'Haeze and Holsters, 2004</xref>). Small symbionts, which are relatively loosely packed in their host cell vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and have a comparatively high surface-to-volume ratio, might be particularly exposed to this presumptive ROS stress, while larger symbionts, which are more tightly packed, may face lower ROS levels. This would explain the observed higher abundance of the ROS scavengers rubrerythrin (Rbr2), superoxide dismutase (SodB), and alkylhydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) in small symbionts. In line with this assumption, a superoxide dismutase and also the chaperones ClpB, HtpG, and DnaK were suggested to be involved in ROS protection in <italic>Serratia symbiotica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Renoz et al., 2017</xref>), and ClpB protease expression has been shown to increase during oxidative stress in the intracellular pathogen <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Twine et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we found no indications of a strong bacterial stress response in fraction L, indicating that imminent digestion by the host poses no particular stress to the large symbionts.

Porins are water-filled channels in the outer membrane, through which small hydrophilic molecules can diffuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fernández and Hancock, 2012</xref>). In the oyster pathogen <italic>Vibrio splendidus</italic>, the porin OmpU serves as adhesin or invasin and is involved in recognition by the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Duperthuy et al., 2011</xref>), while in <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, a porin inhibits phagocytosis by human immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Mosleh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Lorenzen et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the phagocytosis-inhibiting action of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> porin apparently involves interference with the host’s oxidative burst; that is, the porin allows the pathogen to evade killing by host-produced ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Lorenzen et al., 2000</xref>). Although the exact function of Endoriftia porin has not been elucidated yet, we suggest that it may have a similar function in resistance against host stress or ROS. This would be in line with elevated levels of ROS scavengers in small <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts (see above). Porins are furthermore not only known to be involved in recognition by the host (e.g. in the squid symbiont <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Nyholm et al., 2009</xref>), but were also shown to be involved in survival in and communication with the host in other intracellular and pathogenic bacteria, rendering <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> more resistant against antimicrobial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Mathur and Waldor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">van der Hoeven and Forst, 2009</xref>).

This would be of particular importance for small symbionts, as it would ensure survival of the symbiont ‘stem cell’ subpopulation and sustain their division capability.</p><p>Besides porin, the symbiont’s outer membrane efflux pump TolC was also most abundant in fraction XS, suggesting that it may play a similar role in host interaction or persistence. TolC is a versatile export protein of Gram-negative bacteria, which interacts with different transporters of the cytoplasmic membrane to export proteins and drugs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Koronakis et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic>, TolC is apparently involved in establishing the symbiosis with legumes, possibly by conferring increased stress resistance and by secreting symbiosis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cosme et al., 2008</xref>), whereas <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> TolC enables re-emission of the antimicrobial compound berberine and is thus essential for <italic>Erwinia</italic> growth in plant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barabote et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Microbe-host interactions with particular relevance in smaller Endoriftia may furthermore also be mediated by chaperones and stress proteins, which were most abundant in fraction XS (see above). Chaperones have been shown to play a role in host interaction and in intracellular survival in several pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria. For example, DnaK appears to be essential for growth of <italic>Brucella suis</italic> in phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Köhler et al., 1996</xref>), while HtpG seems to be involved in virulence and intracellular survival of <italic>Leptospira</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">King et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Verbrugghe et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dang et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in the post-transcriptional regulator <italic>hfq</italic> often lead to reduced fitness and virulence in bacterial pathogens (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chao and Vogel, 2010</xref>).

Although we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that non-symbiont-related host organelle-bound proteins may also have accumulated in this fraction (e.g. the ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins we identified), it appears very likely that the candidates discussed below may facilitate direct host-microbe interactions or enable the host to provide optimal conditions for the symbiont. (1) Peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, for example, are involved in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kang et al., 1998</xref>) and have previously been shown or suggested to participate in symbiotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Troll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Royet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Wippler et al., 2016</xref>). (2) Since oxygen concentrations in the trophosome might be comparatively low (benefitting the microaerophilic symbionts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>), the hypoxia up-regulated <italic>Riftia</italic> proteins we detected may present a protective adaptation of the host to these hypoxic conditions. In support of this idea, Hyou1 was shown to have a protective function during hypoxia in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Ozawa et al., 1999</xref>). (3) Moreover, enrichment of beta carbonic anhydrase 1, which interconverts bicarbonate and CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goffredi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">De Cian et al., 2003</xref>), suggests that this host protein serves to optimally provide the symbionts with CO<sub>2</sub> for fixation. (4) The host transmembrane protein 214-B (TMP214-B), which was exclusively detected in symbiont-enriched fractions (but not in trophosome homogenate) may be involved in cell death of symbiont-containing bacteriocytes by an apoptosis-related mechanism. This would be in line with our previous suggestion that apoptosis-related proteins may play a role in symbiont and bacteriocyte cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>) and is further supported by the fact that TMP214-B was shown to be involved in apoptosis caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Li et al., 2013</xref>). (5), Finally, the detection of degradation proteins such as cathepsin Z, legumain, glucoamylase 1, and lysosomal alpha-glucosidase in fractions XS and S may imply that the host digests not only large symbiont cells in the degradative trophosome lobule zone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but that small symbionts might also be exposed to host digestion (although we did not see any evidence for this in the TEM images).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Metabolic diversity among symbiont size classes</title><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Large symbionts focus on carbon fixation and biosynthesis</title><p>Highest individual abundances of various carbon fixation and biosynthesis-related enzymes as well as highest overall abundances of all biosynthetic categories (including carbon-, amino acid-, lipid-, nitrogen-, and cofactor metabolism; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) in fraction L suggest that large Endoriftia cells are relatively more engaged in the production of organic material than smaller symbiont cells.

Large <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts thus presumably not only benefit from higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, but also have more biosynthetic capacities at their disposal than small symbionts.</p><p>This facilitates a division of responsibilities between the symbiont subpopulations: Small Endoriftia invest a considerable part of their resources in cell division and the expression of putative host interaction-related proteins that ensure survival of the ‘stem cell’ population (see above). In contrast, large symbionts apparently divide less frequently and may be less endangered of host interference (before they reach the degenerative lobule zone) and can thus allocate more energy to production of organic material. Such a division of labor provides the combined advantage of multiple genome copies with resulting increased transcription efficiency and productivity in large cells, and a focus on cell division in small cells. At the same time, the respective disadvantages are avoided (large Endoriftia would need to invest much more resources in cell division and replication of their multiple genome copies than small cells, while smaller Endoriftia could not produce as much biomass as large symbionts). Increased metabolic efficiency as a consequence of specialized bacteria performing complementary tasks has also been reported for different bacterial species and strains working together in other symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankrah et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>Riftia</italic>, the largest symbionts that are digested at the trophosome lobule periphery are those with the highest nutritional value. They carry not only abundant carbon but also contain plenty of N-rich biomolecules in their multiple genome copies, and are likely easier to digest than smaller symbionts, due to their lower sulfur content (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Small Endoriftia store more sulfur and are more involved in sulfide oxidation</title><p>Smaller symbionts produce relatively more sulfur globules for sulfur storage than larger symbiont cells, as indicated by relatively higher abundance of sulfur globule proteins in fraction XS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).

Although this finding was not supported by a subsequent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Pflugfelder et al., 2005</xref>), our results do point to different amounts of S storage in different Endoriftia subpopulations. Storing relatively more sulfur in small Endoriftia, but less in large symbionts might aid symbiont digestion by the host (S-poor symbionts being less toxic compared to S-rich cells), a strategy that was also suggested for the thiotrophic <italic>C. orbicularis</italic> symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caro et al., 2007</xref>).

In our study, the highly abundant TusA, several DsrC copies as well as DsrEFH were all detected with highest abundances in fraction XS, thus supporting the idea of relatively more re-mobilization of sulfur and subsequent utilization of reduced sulfur compounds in small Endoriftia. As the highly abundant adenylylsulfate reductase AprAB, the ATP-sulfurylase SopT, and sulfide dehydrogenase subunit FccB were also detected with higher abundances in fractions XS or S than in M or L, one might conclude that sulfide oxidation itself also plays a more prominent role in smaller symbionts than in larger symbionts. More sulfide oxidation would also be the most straightforward explanation for the observed higher amounts of stored sulfur in small symbionts (see above). However, as we detected the dissimilatory sulfite reductase DsrAB, the third key enzyme of cytoplasmic sulfide oxidation, with a rather ambiguous abundance pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3e</xref>), this idea remains speculative and requires further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>In large symbionts, thiosulfate oxidation plays a more prominent role</title><p>Larger symbionts may rely relatively more on thiosulfate oxidation – in addition to sulfide oxidation – than smaller Endoriftia, as suggested by highest abundance of SoxZ and detection of several other (low-abundant) Sox proteins in fraction L.

This could be due to a concentration gradient (as proposed above for CO<sub>2</sub>) and/or possibly also a result of host thiosulfate production. The <italic>Riftia</italic> host appears to be able to oxidize toxic sulfide to the less toxic thiosulfate in its mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). Higher abundance of host thiosulfate sulfurtransferase in symbiont-enriched fractions compared to non-enriched trophosome homogenate in our present study suggests that this putative detoxification process could be particularly important in the symbiont-containing bacteriocytes. With sulfide supposedly reaching the trophosome lobule periphery first with the blood flow, free sulfide concentrations might be higher there and, consequently, host sulfide oxidation to thiosulfate might be more frequent in bacteriocytes at the lobule periphery than in the center. The idea of more thiosulfate oxidation in large Endoriftia is further substantiated by highest abundance of six rhodanese family proteins in fraction L, as rhodanese-like proteins can cleave thiosulfate into sulfite and sulfide and were proposed to be involved in thiosulfate oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Hensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Welte et al., 2009</xref>). The combined use of both sulfide and thiosulfate has also been reported for chemoautotrophic symbionts of snails and mussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beinart et al., 2015</xref>). In these symbioses, thiosulfate oxidation supported carbon fixation just as effectively as sulfide (or even more effectively). Using thiosulfate as their (additional) energy source may therefore not be an energetic disadvantage for <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts. Moreover, thiosulfate oxidation in Endoriftia may have the positive side-effect of reducing competition for sulfide between larger and smaller symbionts.</p><p>Interestingly, overall abundance of all proteins involved in the symbiont’s energy-generating sulfur metabolism, the most abundant of all metabolic categories, remained relatively unchanged across the four fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This indicates that sulfur oxidation-based energy generation, a fundamental basis of all other metabolic processes, is equally important throughout the symbiont’s differentiation process, even if individual contributions of reduced sulfur compounds may differ. (For a detailed overview of sulfur oxidation reactions in Endoriftia see Appendix section F).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-4"><title>Hydrogen oxidation is more relevant in large symbionts</title><p>In large symbionts, the use of hydrogen may furthermore play a more prominent role than in smaller symbiont cells, as suggested by increasing abundances of the Isp-type respiratory H<sub>2</sub>-uptake [NiFe] hydrogenase large subunit HyaB, a Fe-S oxidoreductase (GlpC) encoded next to HyaB, and the hydrogenase expression/formation protein HypE from fraction XS to L. The small hydrogenase subunit HyaA (Sym_EGV51837.1) and an additional hydrogenase expression/formation protein (HoxM, Sym_EGV51835.1), both of which are encoded upstream of HyaB in the symbiont genome, were detected with increasing abundance toward fraction L as well (although at very low concentrations; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>), supporting the idea of relatively more hydrogen oxidation in large symbionts. Like for CO<sub>2</sub> and thiosulfate, this might be due to a concentration gradient with highest hydrogen concentrations at the lobule periphery and lowest concentrations toward the lobule center. Use of hydrogen as an energy source has been described or suggested for free-living sulfur oxidizing bacteria like <italic>A. vinosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Weissgerber et al., 2011</xref>), and for a variety of thiotrophic symbionts of marine invertebrates, including <italic>Riftia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). However, above-seafloor hydrogen concentrations in diffuse-flow fluids at our particular sampling site were reported to be very low (&lt;2 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">McNichol et al., 2018</xref>), and it is presently unclear whether and how ambient hydrogen would reach the intracellular symbionts in the trophosome. Nevertheless, taking advantage of hydrogen oxidation in addition to sulfide- and thiosulfate oxidation, that is, using a broader repertoire of electron donors, would potentially enhance the metabolic flexibility, particularly of large Endoriftia. However, H<sub>2</sub> was recently suggested to be involved in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis rather than working as electron donor in the <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>), and hydrogenase may in fact also play a role in sulfur metabolism (as suggested for <italic>A. vinosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Weissgerber et al., 2014</xref>); Appendix section F). Therefore, the exact role of hydrogen oxidation in Endoriftia and why it might be relatively more relevant in larger symbionts remains to be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-5"><title>Small and large symbionts favor separate parts of the denitrification pathway</title><p>Our results suggest that small <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts rely relatively more on the NarGHI-mediated first step of anaerobic respiratory nitrate reduction to nitrite. In contrast, Nap-mediated nitrate reduction and all subsequent denitrification steps via NO and N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> seem to be more prominent in larger symbionts. While Endoriftia has the genomic potential for complete denitrification to N<sub>2</sub> and was experimentally shown to use nitrate for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Hentschel and Felbeck, 1993</xref>), our results thus point to differential use of separate parts of this pathway in small and large symbionts. Since expression of membrane-bound nitrate reductase Nar is inhibited by oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999</xref>), highest NarGHI abundance in fraction XS suggests that O<sub>2</sub> levels might be particularly low around smaller symbionts. This is presumably due to an oxygen gradient from lobule periphery to center (see also Appendix section G). Following this idea, increasing abundances of NapCHG, subunits of the periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap complex, from fraction XS to L indicate that Nap could take over the role of Nar in larger symbionts. As the inhibitory effect of oxygen on denitrification was proposed to be largely due to inhibition of nitrate transport across the cytoplasmic membrane to Nar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Denis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Moir and Wood, 2001</xref>), the periplasmic Nap nitrate reductase is not affected by elevated oxygen concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Moreno-Vivián et al., 1999</xref>). Some denitrifying bacteria therefore couple Nap to nitrite reductase Nir, nitric oxide reductase Nor and nitrous oxide reductase Nos under oxic or microaerophilic conditions for aerobic denitrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ji et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that large Endoriftia adopt this strategy of aerobic denitrification when exposed to higher oxygen levels at the lobule periphery. Presumed higher nitrate concentrations around large Endoriftia may additionally facilitate increased expression of Nap, Nir, Nor, and Nos (compared to smaller symbionts). Moreover, while Nar is an energy-conserving enzyme and generates a proton motive force, which is potentially advantageous during cell division in small symbionts (see Appendix section B), the periplasmic Nap conserves less energy and does not contribute to the proton gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 1993</xref>). Only larger symbionts may therefore be able to afford Nap.</p><p>While the above scenario of anaerobic nitrate reduction in small Endoriftia and aerobic denitrification in large Endoriftia seems quite plausible in the context of our findings, some aspects of this hypothesis are still unclear. Nar, Nap, and Nir may not be exclusively involved in respiration, but could as well operate in nitrate assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). Highest NarGHI and Nap abundances in small and large Endoriftia, respectively, may therefore be due to either of the two functions or (more likely) a combination of both. Also, the fate of nitrite produced by NarGHI during dissimilatory nitrate reduction in small symbionts is dubious. Nitrite is toxic and needs to be removed from the cells either by conversion into ammonium or by export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Moir and Wood, 2001</xref>). Although assimilation appears to be the most likely option, Endoriftia’s assimilatory nitrite reductase was not detected in fractions XS and S (but only in fractions M and L and at extremely low abundance; large subunit NirB) or not detected at all (small subunit NirD, Sym_2601635198). Similarly, the nitrite extrusion protein NarK had its lowest abundance in fraction XS. Whether nitrite assimilation in Endoriftia relies on enzymes other than NirBD, or whether nitrite is removed from the small symbionts by other exporters or by diffusion, and possibly even passed on to large Endoriftia for further reduction, therefore needs to be elucidated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-6"><title>Regulation of gene expression may be less stringent in large symbionts</title><p>Relative abundance of the RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoD decreased from fraction XS to L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3h</xref>) in S-rich and in S-depleted samples, pointing to relatively more growth-related activities in small Endoriftia (see also Appendix section B). RpoD is the primary sigma factor for vegetative growth (σ70), which regulates transcription of most genes involved in exponential growth in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Helmann and Chamberlin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fujita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ishihama, 2000</xref>). This would be in agreement with the idea of small <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts being mainly occupied with cell division and proliferation in a quasi-exponential growth phase, while large symbionts function as biosynthetic ‘factories’, focusing on carbon fixation and biomass production. Interestingly, RpoS, the master transcriptional regulator of stationary phase gene expression and antagonist of RpoD, was not detected in any of our samples (although it is encoded in the symbiont genome). RpoS abundance increases upon stress and limitation during transition to the stationary phase in free-living model bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hengge-Aronis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fujita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ishihama, 2000</xref>). Its absence in the <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont’s proteome suggests that, unlike free-living bacteria, the symbiont does not experience a stationary phase-like growth arrest even in later developmental stages, probably because it is ideally supplied with all necessary substrates by the host. The symbiont likely adapts to this ‘lack’ of stress or limitation by less stringent regulation of gene expression, which could explain the metabolic diversity we observed particularly in large symbionts, such as multiple ways of energy generation (thiosulfate- and hydrogen oxidation in addition to sulfide oxidation) and two CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathways. Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle are in fact in all likelihood expressed in the very same (large) symbiont cells, as suggested by our HCR-FISH experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Under these premises, the previously observed simultaneous expression of such seemingly redundant metabolic pathways in <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>) very likely reflects this presumptive ‘de-regulation’ of gene expression in large parts of the symbiont population (i.e. in the large symbionts), which allows Endoriftia to fully exploit its versatile metabolic repertoire to the advantage of the symbiosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that Endoriftia cells of different differentiation stages likely employ distinct metabolic profiles, thus confirming our initial hypothesis. The symbionts divide responsibilities: Whereas small Endoriftia ensure survival of the symbiont population, large Endoriftia are primarily engaged in biomass production.</p><p>The factors that trigger Endoriftia’s development from smaller to larger cells remain to be elucidated. For <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, a steep O<sub>2</sub> concentration gradient inside legume nodules was proposed to be involved in signaling for symbiont differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Soupène et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, some of the differences we observed in small and large Endoriftia might also be connected to the availability of electron donors or acceptors, and hence differentiation of Endoriftia cells might depend on substrate availability. Symbiont differentiation in <italic>Riftia</italic> might furthermore be induced by specific host effectors, for example, histone-derived antimicrobial peptides, which were recently proposed to play a role in symbiont cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>), or other compounds that allow <italic>Riftia</italic> to modulate the symbiont’s expression of certain metabolic pathways. Besides such direct interference, <italic>Riftia</italic> likely also exerts indirect influence on symbiont gene expression by providing copious amounts of all necessary substrates to the bacterial partner.</p><p>We speculate that this constantly high nutrient availability inside the host causes Endoriftia’s biosynthetic pathways to be regulated less stringently (compared to what we would expect in free-living bacteria). This would explain the previously observed metabolic versatility of symbionts in the same host: Large Endoriftia can afford to employ multiple – even redundant – metabolic pathways at the same time. Division of labor between subpopulations, which enables such an ‘advantageous deregulation’ in specialized cells, thus likely enhances symbiont productivity during symbiosis. We suggest that such symbiont differentiation into functionally dissimilar subpopulations with complementary roles in the same host might be an important key to success of microbe-host associations in various environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection and enrichment of symbiont subpopulations</title><p><italic>Riftia</italic> samples for enrichment of symbiont subpopulations were collected at the East Pacific Rise hydrothermal vent field at 9°50’ N, 104°17’ W in a water depth of about 2500 m during a research cruise with R/V Atlantis in November 2014 (AT26-23). Samples for electron microscopy were obtained during a second cruise (AT37-12) at the same site during March-April 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>).

For proteomic analyses, we used seven healthy-looking <italic>Riftia</italic> specimens, of which four had S-rich trophosomes and three had S-depleted trophosomes. (Note that sulfur content does not provide any information on the symbiosis’ state of health, that is, worms with S-depleted trophosomes are not ‘unhealthier’ than worms with S-rich trophosomes.) Since trophosome sulfur content is positively correlated with habitat sulfide concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Childress et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Robidart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Scott et al., 2012</xref>), it can serve as an indicator for the energetic situation of the symbiosis at the time of sampling.</p><p>To enrich symbiont cells of varying sizes (i.e. morphologically distinct symbiont subpopulations), <italic>Riftia</italic> specimens were dissected onboard the research vessel immediately after recovery of the worms. Approximately 3 ml trophosome tissue were homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer in 6 ml imidazole-buffered saline (IBS, 0.49 M NaCl, 0.03 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.011 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.003 M KCl, 0.05 M imidazole). As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hinzke et al., 2018</xref>, the homogenate was subjected to rate-zonal density gradient centrifugation, which allows to separate particles based on their size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Graham, 2001</xref>). In brief, an 8–18% Histodenz density gradient was created using a dilution series of Histodenz in IBS (1% steps, 1 ml per step), which was stacked in a 15 ml tube so that Histodenz concentration was highest at the bottom and lowest at the top. On top of this gradient, 0.5 ml tissue homogenate was layered and the gradient was centrifuged (1000 x g, 5 min, 4°C) in a swing-out rotor. Smaller symbiont cells were thus enriched in less dense gradient fractions (lower Histodenz concentrations) in the upper part of the gradient, while larger cells migrated to lower gradient fractions. After centrifugation, gradients were disassembled by carefully fractionizing the entire gradient volume into 0.5 ml subsamples, giving a total of 24 fractions. Enrichment of distinct symbiont subpopulations in these subsamples was confirmed using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH, see below). For this purpose, 20 µl of each gradient fraction subsample and 15 µl of homogenate was fixed in 1% PFA in IBS, and symbiont cells were subsequently filtered onto GTTP polycarbonate filters (pore size 0.2 μm, Millipore) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Ponnudurai et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>CARD-FISH</title><p>Enrichment of symbiont cell sizes in gradient fractions was analyzed employing fluorescence microscopy with samples labeled by CARD-FISH in five biological replicates (<italic>Riftia</italic> specimens) with S-rich trophosome and three biological replicates with S-depleted trophosomes.

For counterstaining, 0.1% (w/v) 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to the embedding medium (4:1 Citifluor AF1 (Citifluor) and Vectashield (Vector Laboratories)). CARD-FISH filters were analyzed using an Axio Imager.M2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). For semi-automated cell counting and to measure the longest cell dimension, we used a custom Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) macro with the Fiji plugins Enhanced Local Contrast (CLAHE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Saalfeld, 2010</xref>) and Bi-exponential edge preserving smoother (BEEPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Thévenaz et al., 2012</xref>). After image processing, we excluded objects with a size of less than 2 µm (as these were mainly artifacts) and set the maximum object size to 20 µm. To assign cell sizes to size classes (i.e. cell size ranges), we used a quartile split: We calculated quartiles of cell sizes in non-enriched homogenate samples (i.e. 25% of all cells in homogenate samples were assigned to each class). This resulted in the four calculative size classes very small (≥2 µm –&lt;3.912 µm), small (≥3.912 µm –&lt;5.314 µm), medium (≥5.314 µm –&lt;6.83275 µm), and large (≥6.83275 µm – 20 µm). The majority of cells in all size classes were coccoid. Rod-shaped cells were almost exclusively present in the smallest size class. Individual gradient fractions (subsamples) were screened for their respective share of cells in each size class and the subsample with the highest percentage of cells in the respective quartile was chosen for metaproteomic analysis. For example, if of all 24 subsamples of a sample, the fifth fraction (counted from the top of the gradient) had the highest percentage of very small cells, that is, most of the cells in fraction 5 were between 2 µm and 3.912 µm in diameter (as measured by our Fiji macro), this fraction was chosen as representative of very small symbiont cells in the respective biological replicate (worm). The fraction containing the highest percentage of very small cells is referred to as ‘fraction XS’ in the manuscript. The fractions containing the highest percentages of small, medium, and large symbiont cells are referred to as ‘S’, ‘M’, and ‘L’, respectively. If the same subsample had the highest percentage of cells in two size classes, this subsample was chosen as representative for one of these size classes, and for the other size class, the subsample with the second highest percentage of cells in that class was used as representative. Cell size distributions in the four size class representatives are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We used an HCR-FISH v2.0 Custom Kit (Molecular Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Probes targeted the <italic>Rifti</italic>a symbiont’s 16S rRNA (fluorescence marker: Alexa Fluor 488), and the mRNAs of ATP-citrate lyase subunit AclB (Alexa Fluor 647) and RubisCO (Alexa Fluor 594). Assisted by the probe manufacturer, we designed five individual probes per target RNA (for 16S and AclB) and four probes for RubisCO, each of which targeted a 50 nucleotides long sub-sequence of the respective RNA of interest. The sub-sequences were spread out across the length of each target RNA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for the probe sequences). In brief, filter sections were washed twice with 50% hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x sodium chloride sodium citrate (SCSC, 0.75 M NaCl, 75 mM Na<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), 9 mM citric acid, pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/ml heparin, 1x Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate) in 2x mPBS (89.8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.9 M NaCl) at 45°C for 30 min for pre-hybridization, and incubated overnight (16 hr, 45°C) with probe solution (1 pmol of each probe in 500 µl hybridization buffer). Excess probes were removed with several washing steps in 75–25% probe wash buffer (50% formamide, 5x SCSC, 9 mM citric acid, pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/ml heparin in 5x SCSC) for 15 min at 45°C, 300 rpm, and subsequently in 5x SCSC for 30 min at 45°C and 300 rpm. Samples were pre-amplified with DNA amplification buffer (5x SCSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% dextran sulfate). Hairpins were activated by snap-cooling and added to the samples. After overnight incubation (16 hr, room temperature) with the hairpin solution, samples were washed with 5x SCSC, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (room temperature, 300 rpm, four times 5 min, two times 30 min), and embedded in Mowiol 4–88 (Carl Roth GmbH) embedding medium prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 meta equipped with a 100x/1.3 oil immersion objective. Probes were excited with laser lines 633 (ATP-citrate lyase), 561 (RubisCO) and 488 (16S rRNA) and signals were detected with filters suitable for dye maximal emissions at 670 nm, 595 nm and 527.5 nm, respectively. Signal intensities and cell sizes (from eight frames showing a total of 33 cells on a filter from one biological replicate, n = 1) were quantified using the Fiji software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Individual cells were defined as regions of interest (ROI), in which signal intensity per pixel was recorded. Mean pixel intensity of ROI was calculated and background was corrected. Global background values were calculated for every channel based on up to six ROIs randomly placed in each image frame. The following cell size parameters were calculated: (i) Feret's diameter (the longest distance between any two points along the boundary of the ROI) and (ii) the area of the ROI. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Nikolakakis et al., 2015</xref>, two negative control preparations were performed to identify artifact signals: Two filters from the same biological replicate as above were incubated (a) without probes but with fluorophore-carrying hairpins (n = 1; to test for non-specific amplification of hairpins) and (b) without probes or hairpins (n = 1; to test for autofluorescence), and analyzed using an Axio Imager.M2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). Since Endoriftia is uncultivable as yet, a target-free control sample (i.e. an Endoriftia knockout mutant without the respective RNAs of interest) is not available at this point. Nonspecific binding of the probes to non-target RNAs was therefore excluded based on the following considerations: (i) In nucleic acid hybridizations, the hybridization rate decreases to zero when mismatches increase to more than 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Wetmur, 1991</xref>). (ii) There is only one symbiont phylotype in <italic>Riftia,</italic> preventing false-positive binding to other bacterial RNAs, and (iii) false-positive matches to host RNAs could be excluded, since symbiont cells were co-labeled with the 16S rRNA-specific probe which confirmed the identity of the cells.

Optical filters were set up to detect the emitted Syto9 fluorescence signal at 530/30 nm (FITC channel). All fluorescence data were recorded at logarithmic scale with the FACSDiva 8.02 software (Becton Dickinson). Prior to measurement of experimental samples, the proper function of the instrument was determined by using the cytometer setup and tracking software module (CS and T) together with the CS and T beads (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). During sample measurements, the present populations were shown in a side scatter (SSC)-area versus forward scatter (FSC)-area dot plot.

Fractions S and particularly XS contained relatively more host proteins, leading to a lower total number of detectable symbiont proteins. (Note that these values were not normalized to protein size, so that a protein’s relative abundance changes can be followed across different samples, but abundances cannot be compared between proteins).

Filtered and RLE-normalized data were log-normalized, repeat data were defined to be from different time points and data were clustered using the STEM method with default options.

For correction, the false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.05. Profiles were clustered with a minimum correlation percentile of 0.5. Other parameters were left at default values. Proteins which were assigned to model profiles, that is, all proteins which were not removed by filtering and showed a consistent trend in all replicates, were used for further analysis. This means that differences in protein abundance patterns were considered significant if proteins were detected with a consistent abundance trend across all replicates (increase, decrease, or alternating increase and decrease of abundance from fraction XS to L).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Random forests</title><p>For random forest analysis, we used the ranger package v. 0.10.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Wright and Ziegler, 2015</xref>) in R v. 3.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>). Random forests are a machine learning technique, which can be used to find the variables – here proteins – that allow to predict which datasets or samples are similar (and which ones are not; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Degenhardt et al., 2019</xref>). For variable importance calculation, we employed the method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Janitza et al., 2018</xref> as implemented in the ranger package. This method uses a heuristic approach, where a null distribution for p-value calculation is generated based on variables with importance scores of zero or negative importance scores. For pairwise comparisons, the data set was subjected to an additional filtering step, so that only proteins with a minimum of five spectral counts in at least six out of eight (S-rich) or four out of six (S-depleted) samples were included. The comparison of all 16 S-rich samples included only such proteins which had a minimum of five spectral counts in at least five samples, and the comparison of all twelve S-depleted samples included only proteins with five or more spectral counts in a minimum of four samples. The filtered and RLE-normalized data were used for random forest analysis as follows: 2000 forests with 10,000 trees per forest were grown for pairwise comparisons as well as for comparisons including the samples representing all four size classes. Proteins which had a p-value below 0.05 in &gt;90% of the forests were included in further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Significant differences in protein abundance</title><p>Proteins that showed significant abundance differences as determined by STEM analysis or by random forest analysis (see above) or by both methods were included in a common list. Please note that this approach of determining significant protein abundance differences was not based on individual p-values. For proteins with significant abundance differences, we clustered the z-scored mean abundances using hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation, complete linkage) in R to visualize their abundance trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). For this purpose, we employed the R base package stats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) as well as the packages cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Maechler et al., 2018</xref>) and ComplexHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).

For evaluation of host protein enrichment, we used fractions XS and S, enriched in the two smallest symbiont size classes (i.e. fractions collected from the upper part of the gradient). As the lower gradient fractions sometimes contained the gradient pellet, in which host proteins can also accumulate when host tissue fragments are pelleted, these fractions were not used for host protein analysis. Comparisons of relative host protein abundance between trophosome homogenate and fractions XS and S were performed using the R package edgeR v. 3.24.3. Spectral count data were filtered to include only proteins which had at least five spectral counts in at least four (for S-rich specimens) or three (in S-depleted specimens) samples and RLE-normalized abundance values were compared between samples.

to 2 µm to more than 15 µm (main text: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is in line with previous microscopy-based observations, which suggested that the symbiont cells differentiate from small rod-shaped cells in the trophosome lobule center to larger coccoid cells towards the lobule periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>). With an about 10-fold increase in diameter, Endoriftia cells enlarge their volume by a factor of ~1000 during their development from smallest to largest coccoid symbiont cells. Considerable enlargement of bacterial cells in the course of symbiotic differentiation has also been observed in the intracellular thiotrophic symbiont of the shallow water clam <italic>Codakia orbicularis</italic> (increases 10-fold in length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caro et al., 2007</xref>), in <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> in alfalfa nodules (increases four- to seven-fold in length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Oke and Long, 1999</xref>), in symbionts of the nematode <italic>Eubostrichus</italic> (increase up to 13-fold in length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Pende et al., 2014</xref>), and in the giant bacterium <italic>Epulopiscium fishelsoni</italic>, intestinal symbiont of surgeon fish (increases up to 3,000-fold in volume; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bresler and Fishelson, 2003</xref>). Such enormous size gradients are rather the exception than the rule in bacteria, however. Cell sizes, that is, length or diameter, of free-living model bacteria like <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> usually vary only by factor 2 (during cell division), that is, mathematically, these bacteria may increase their volume twofold (assuming a cylindrical shape) to eightfold (assuming a spherical shape) at most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chien et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the remarkably large size range observed for Endoriftia presents a consequence of its symbiotic life style.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>B. Comparative analysis of enriched symbiont fractions from S-rich vs. S-depleted <italic>Riftia</italic> specimens</title><sec id="s10-1"><title>Overview</title><p>Our comparative analyses of symbiont-enriched fractions XS to L revealed that in both S-rich and S-depleted samples, protein profiles differed with increasing symbiont cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Many groups of proteins (e.g. carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins) showed similar trends across size classes in S-rich and S-depleted specimens, even if individual protein abundances differed. Statistical testing for significant differences in protein abundance between S-rich and S-depleted fractions of the same size class returned only very few (edgeR) or no (random forest) hits. This may in part be due to the less effective enrichment of symbionts from S-depleted trophosome tissue homogenate. However, very similar abundance patterns in symbionts from sulfur-rich and sulfur-depleted hosts might also reflect the fact that symbionts are very well buffered against environmental changes (as previously suggested, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>) and, therefore, functional differences between symbiont morphotypes in S-rich vs. S-depleted symbionts might largely be negligible. Some of these differences, however, seemed to be specific for the respective energy situation and are outlined below.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Abundance trends of 465 <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont proteins with significant abundance differences between the four analyzed gradient fractions XS (enriched in very small symbiont cells) to L (containing the highest percentage of large symbiont cells) in S-rich and S-depleted <italic>Riftia</italic> trophosomes.</title><p>Heat maps show relative protein abundances (z-scores of edgeR-RLE-corrected spectral count values; see Methods for details) and line graphs indicate trends in the observed differences.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58371-app1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s10-2"><title>Cell division</title><p>In sulfur-depleted hosts, <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts appear to divide less frequently than in sulfur-rich specimens, as indicated by lower abundance of the major cell division protein FtsZ in all S-depleted fractions compared to their S-rich counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; please note that, due to its low abundance, FtsZ was not included in statistical analysis in S-depleted samples). In S-depleted fraction XS, FtsZ abundance was about 3.5 times lower than in S-rich fraction XS.</p><p>Less symbiont cell division in S-depleted <italic>Riftia</italic> accords with the idea of severe energy limitation in sulfur-depleted symbionts and is in agreement with our previous finding that symbiont proteinaceous biomass is lower in trophosomes of S-depleted specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). In this previous study, we suggested that S-depleted hosts digest a larger part of their symbiont population as compared to S-rich tubeworms. As the host mainly digests large symbionts at the trophosome lobule periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> main text; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref>), one might expect that more digestion leads to relatively more smaller symbionts in S-depleted trophosomes as compared to S-rich hosts. This was, however, not the case, as symbiont size distribution was quite comparable in trophosome homogenates of S-rich and S-depleted trophosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, main text). Such similar distributions would be in line with the hypothesis that the host may digest small symbionts, too, besides large Endoriftia (see main text). However, as we could not see evidence for small symbionts in the process of digestion in any of our TEM images, we rather propose that both more symbiont digestion and less symbiont cell division co-occur in S-depleted worm specimens, leading to the previously observed loss in total symbiont biomass.</p></sec><sec id="s10-3"><title>Carbon fixation</title><p>Enzymes of the two autotrophic pathways, Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle, did not show significant differences in protein abundance patterns when comparing S-rich and S-depleted gradient fractions. However, based on our SIF analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>, see below), both pathways could be differentially used between the two sample sets: Throughout all gradient fractions, S-depleted samples had a notably more positive δ<sup>13</sup>C value than the respective S-rich fractions. This indicates that in S-depleted Endoriftia, the relative contribution of the rTCA cycle to overall carbon fixation is higher than in S-rich symbionts. This is in good agreement with earlier findings of comparative proteomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Markert et al., 2007</xref>). Since the rTCA cycle is more energy-efficient than the Calvin cycle, this shift towards a higher contribution of the less costly autotrophic pathway might be beneficial during energy limitation.</p></sec><sec id="s10-4"><title>Growth-related processes</title><p>Highest abundance of RNA polymerase subunits, transcription elongation factors, transcription antitermination protein and various translation-related proteins in fraction XS of S-rich and S-depleted specimens indicates that small symbionts devote relatively more energy and resources to protein synthesis than large symbionts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3h</xref>). This is in agreement with the idea that small Endoriftia function as actively dividing and growing ‘stem cells’ of the Endoriftia population, whereas large symbionts have the role of highly efficient biomass producers (see main text).</p><p>This proposed greater importance of growth-related processes in small symbionts may result in higher intracellular pyrophoshate levels, as suggested by high abundance of pyrophosphatases in fraction XS. The highly abundant pyrophosphate-energized proton pump HppA (Sym_EGV49909.1) and the inorganic pyrophosphatase Ppa (Sym_EGV49908.1) had their highest abundances in fraction XS in S-rich samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Pyrophosphatases play an important role in energy metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphates (PP<sub>i</sub>), which are produced at particularly high rates by biosynthetic reactions in growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Klemme, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 1990</xref>). By removing PP<sub>i</sub>, pyrophosphatases shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to favor reactions like DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Lahti, 1983</xref>).</p><p>HppA may furthermore have an additional growth-related function: During PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis, HppA pumps protons into the periplasm, thus establishing a proton motive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Maeshima, 2000</xref>). As cell division is an energy-expensive process, which requires not only ATP but also proton motive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Goehring and Beckwith, 2005</xref>), HppA may be upregulated to accommodate this increased demand in small, dividing Endoriftia. At the same time, HppA presumably increases energy efficiency of the Calvin cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, HppA abundance was notably lower in S-depleted XS fractions, supporting the idea of reduced cell division in energy-depleted symbionts (see above).</p><p>Besides HppA, highly abundant nitrate reductase NarGHI showed a very similar abundance pattern with (i) decreasing abundance from fraction XS to L and (ii) notably lower abundances in S-depleted fractions compared to their respective S-rich counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). NarGHI, which catalyzes the first step of anaerobic denitrification (see main text), also produces a proton motive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertero et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore speculate that it may also support cell division in small symbionts, and that its lower abundance in S-depleted samples correlates with less cell division in these symbionts.</p></sec><sec id="s10-5"><title>Host interactions</title><p>Proteins which may protect the symbiont from digestion by the host could be most important in small symbiont cells and particularly so in S-depleted <italic>Riftia</italic>, as suggested by highest abundances of an ankyrin protein and of the FK506-binding protein FkpA in S-depleted fraction S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>In S-rich and S-depleted samples, the ankyrin-like symbiont protein (Sym_EGV51005.1) decreased in abundance from fraction S to L. Endoriftia ankyrin repeat-containing proteins were previously suggested to be involved in microbe-host interactions, possibly to counteract digestion by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hinzke et al., 2019</xref>). As small Endoriftia are the main dividing symbiont subpopulation and thus ensure survival of the symbiont population as a whole, digesting those cells would harm not only the symbiont, but also the host itself. The ankyrin protein could fulfill a protective role especially for these smaller symbionts.</p><p>The <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont’s FK506-binding protein (Sym_EGV50540.1), which showed a comparable abundance trend, might have a similar role.

This heterogeneity may, to a minor degree, result from contaminating host organelles, but is presumably mostly due to the fact that (a) symbionts exist not only as small or large cells, but also adopt any intermediate size, and (b) intracellularly stored sulfur influences the cells’ light-scattering properties (especially side scatter, SSC), considerably (as shown for thiotrophic lucinid symbionts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We sorted one of the additional populations, with SSC between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> and FSC between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> (i.e. with higher SSC but lower FSC than populations 1 and 2) to examine it separately. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that this population consisted mostly of medium-sized symbionts, which – unlike populations 1 and 2 – contained numerous sulfur globules (images not shown). It could be assumed that other symbiont cell populations, for example, small S-rich and large S-rich cells, might also be present. This hypothesis awaits confirmation in future studies. To estimate symbiont DNA content in the present study, we only included populations 1 and 2, which were readily comparable due to their similar sulfur content (i.e. there were hardly any sulfur globules visible).</p><p>As also described for a thiotrophic lucinid symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caro et al., 2007</xref>), cell populations were not entirely congruent across the two bioreplicates in our Endoriftia flow cytometry analyses. Consequently, individual fluorescence intensity (FI) values varied by a factor of 2 (on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Nevertheless, both replicates clearly showed the same trend, that is, higher FI per particle in population 2 compared to population 1 across all samples, strongly indicating multiple genome copy numbers in large symbionts.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>D. CO<sub>2</sub> metabolism is differentially regulated across Endoriftia cell sizes</title><sec id="s12-1"><title>Small and large Endoriftia differ with regard to their autotrophic pathway use</title><p>Relative contributions of Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle to autotrophic net carbon fixation appear to differ distinctly between small and large Endoriftia, as revealed by our analysis of stable carbon isotope fingerprints (SIFs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). The Calvin cycle, with its type II RubisCO, fixes preferentially <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> rather than <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, that is, it discriminates against <sup>13</sup>C with a shift of −5 to −25‰. In contrast, the rTCA cycle discriminates only with −2 to −13‰ against <sup>13</sup>C, which makes it possible to distinguish between carbon fixed by either of the two pathways or by varying contributions of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Pearson, 2010</xref>). The differences in SIF values we observed point to differential use of Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle in small vs. large symbionts: Fraction XS had the most negative of all δ<sup>13</sup>C values, indicating that relatively more of the carbon in these samples was fixed by the Calvin cycle key enzyme RubisCO than in the other fractions, that is, the Calvin cycle’s relative contribution to autotrophy is highest in small symbionts. With growing symbiont cell size, this contribution appears to decrease, as indicated by more positive δ<sup>13</sup>C values. Highest relative δ<sup>13</sup>C values in fractions M and L suggest that the relative contribution of the rTCA cycle to fixed carbon was highest in large symbionts.</p><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Protein stable carbon isotope values (δ<sup>13</sup>C values) of <italic>Riftia</italic> gradient fractions enriched in symbionts of different cell size (XS – L) relative to fraction XS of S-rich trophosome as baseline.</title><p>Light squares: S-rich symbionts (average values, n = 4), dark triangles: S-depleted symbionts (n = 3).

Potential differences in mRNA fluorescence intensity of the rTCA cycle key enzyme ATP-citrate lyase subunit B (AclB) were poorly distinguishable between smaller and larger symbiont cells.

However, expression of other (r)TCA cycle enzymes was surprisingly inconstistent, that is, while abundance of some enzymes increased towards fraction L (including the key enzymes AclA and KorAB), other enzymes showed the opposite, albeit non-significant, trend and became less abundant (e.g. AclB, isocitrate dehydrogenase Icd; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Further contributing to this ambiguous pattern, the AclB mRNA signal was detected with very similar (and very low) abundances in small and large Endoriftia cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). A possible explanation for these observations might be that Endoriftia’s (r)TCA cycle enzymes can run in either direction, depending on cellular requirements. While certain key reactions of TCA and rTCA cycle have long been considered as irreversible, this seems not always to be the case, as, for instance, reported for citrate synthase, key enzyme of the oxidative TCA cycle, which can also operate in the reverse direction, cleaving citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Mall et al., 2018</xref>). Endoriftia’s citrate synthase (although encoded in the genome) was not detected at all on the protein level in this study, allowing for the speculation that AclAB might functionally replace citrate synthase in the oxidative version of the TCA cycle by running in reverse, possibly even producing ATP in the process. Assuming that the observed discrepancies in Endoriftia (r)TCA cycle enzyme abundance trends are thus indeed caused by flexible changes in the enzymes’ operating directions, Icd could, for example, produce oxaloacetate (e.g. for glutamate synthesis) and NADH in small symbionts, while in large symbionts, Icd might fix CO<sub>2</sub> by running in the reverse direction. Further studies are required to solve the regulation of the symbiont (r)TCA cycle. The recently described combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and FISH (metaFISH), which allows for discrimination of symbiont subpopulations based on the metabolites they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Geier et al., 2020</xref>), might be a promising tool for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s12-4"><title>Large symbionts may take up organic compounds in addition to CO<sub>2</sub></title><p>Our detection of five <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont TRAP transporter subunits and four ABC transporter components putatively involved in uptake of organic material with increasing relative abundance from fraction XS to L indicates that Endoriftia imports small organic compounds, particularly in the late stage of differentiation, that is, in large cells. ABC transporters can mediate uptake of small molecules (such as sugars, amino acids, or vitamins), and metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>), while TRAP transporters facilitate import of C4-dicarboxylates like fumarate, succinate, and malate (Dct type; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Mulligan et al., 2011</xref>) or of amino acids like glutamate and glutamine (TAXI type; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Mulligan et al., 2007</xref>). All these compounds may be relevant heterotrophic substrates in large Endoriftia, which could channel amino acids and peptides into protein biosynthesis, while sugars could be stored as glycogen. Heterotrophy in thiotrophic symbionts was previously shown for a ciliate symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Seah et al., 2019</xref>) and for ectosymbionts of shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Ponsard et al., 2013</xref>). Although the <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont’s potential for mixotrophy, that is, for both autotrophy and heterotrophy, had been predicted from the symbiont’s genome, it was previously assumed that heterotrophy might be particularly relevant in free-living Endoriftia, but not during symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Robidart et al., 2008</xref>). Our results challenge this assumption and suggest that Endoriftia relies on mixotrophy even when in symbiosis, which would allow re-cycling of carbon from host to symbiont.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s13"><title>E. Small Endoriftia might be nitrogen-limited</title><p>Small Endoriftia may rely relatively more on the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT) pathway for ammonia assimilation, while large symbionts cells seem to preferably use glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) for this purpose. In both S-rich and S-depleted samples, a glutamine synthetase copy (GlnA), glutamate synthase subunit GltB and nitrogen regulatory protein P-II (GlnB) were detected with decreasing abundance from fraction XS to L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> main text, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3f</xref>). In contrast, glutamate dehydrogenase (GdhA) showed the opposite trend with lowest abundance in XS and highest abundance in L (S-rich) or M (S-depleted). The GS-GOGAT pathway, which is energetically more expensive than the GDH-pathway, was shown to be used under energy-rich conditions or during nitrogen limitation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Reitzer, 2003</xref>). GS-GOGAT was furthermore shown to have a higher affinity towards ammonium than GDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Reitzer, 2003</xref>). This suggests that small symbionts could be nitrogen-limited, either due to a concentration gradient (with highest nitrogen levels in the peripheral lobule zones), and/or due to their own high demand for nitrogen compounds for growth. Further investigations are required to evaluate this speculation.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>F. Sulfur metabolism</title><p>While many of the energy-generating reactions of the uncultured <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont’s sulfur metabolism have been elucidated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Markert et al., 2011</xref>), several details remained vague.

One of them, Sym_EGV52266.1, was one of the most abundant symbiont proteins, pointing to considerable physiological importance of this protein. Similar to the situation in Endoriftia, three putative DsrC copies were found in the <italic>Calyptogena okutanii</italic> symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Harada et al., 2009</xref>), and DsrC was also the single most abundant sulfur metabolism mRNA in the <italic>Solemya velum</italic> symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). DsrC has been described to fulfill a key role in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism, including a putative function in transcription regulation and a function as a sulfur trap to allow for maximum DsrAB efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Venceslau et al., 2014</xref>). Considering this role of DsrC as enhancer of sulfide oxidation efficiency, highest abundance of all Endoriftia DsrC copies in fraction XS (and lowest DsrC abundance in fraction M or L), corroborates our hypothesis of relatively more H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation for energy generation in small <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts (see main text).</p><p>SoeABC: In addition to AprAB and SopT, two of the key enzymes of cytoplasmic sulfide oxidation, we also found SoeABC to be expressed in Endoriftia.

In <italic>A. vinosum</italic>, concentration of the Isp-type hydrogenase HydLS was shown to increase substantially in the presence of sulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Weissgerber et al., 2014</xref>), leading to the proposition that hydrogen-derived electrons may be fed into sulfide oxidation via hydrogenase as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>. <italic>A. vinosum’s</italic> HydL (Alvin_2036) and Endoriftia’s HyaB (EGV51840.1) protein sequences are 75.69% identical (NCBI BlastP), indicating that both may have similar functions in sulfur oxidation.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>G. Considerations on the blood flow direction in <italic>Riftia</italic> trophosome lobules</title><p>Blood flow across <italic>Riftia</italic> trophosome lobules is commonly accepted to proceed from the lobule periphery inwards to the lobule center, based on observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">van der Land and Nørrevang, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Felbeck and Turner, 1995</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bright and Sorgo, 2003</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the main text). This direction would facilitate a potential substrate gradient with highest concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, reduced sulfur compounds and other substances at the lobule periphery and lowest concentrations in the lobule center. Such a periphery-to-center gradient is in agreement with and corroborates many of our findings. For example, (1) lower oxygen concentrations in the lobule center accord with increasing abundances of all four cytochrome c oxidase subunits (Cco: Sym_EGV51283.1, Sym_EGV51282.1, Sym_2601635240, Sym_EGV51284.1; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) from fraction XS to M or L. Lowest oxygen levels around the smallest symbionts would furthermore explain highest levels of nitrate-reducing NarGHI in fraction XS. (2) Highest CO<sub>2</sub> levels at the lobule periphery support higher abundances of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes in large symbionts, and (3) highest abundances of thiosulfate oxidation proteins in large symbionts may be related to more host sulfide oxidation at the lobule periphery, where sulfide concentrations are highest. Providing highest raw substrate concentrations to the large symbionts would support them in their role as major biomass producers in the symbiosis. Moreover, (4) nutrients released during symbiont digestion in the lobule periphery would likely enter the blood stream and subsequently be transported inwards. Decreasing relative abundances of TRAP-type transporters from fraction L to XS (see section D above) suggest that these compounds are imported by the symbionts along the way, with largest Endoriftia benefiting from highest nutrient concentrations.</p><p><italic>Riftia</italic>‘s blood flow and ensuing putative substrate gradients thus go hand in hand with symbiont differentiation.

It is also worth mentioning that although the symbiosis was discovered in 1981, no one has managed to obtain a pure culture of these symbionts. This study is a major breakthrough in understanding symbiont physiology and interactions with the host. The authors propose that this genetically homogenous symbiont population is structured into distinct functional sub-populations, from a population of smaller “stem cell” symbionts that devote their effort to cell division and surviving host digestion, and larger “workhorse” symbionts that build biomass and synthesize vitamins and cofactors needed for the host's nutrition before being digested intracellularly. This study is based on identification of expressed proteins, an “omics” method, which provides comprehensive information about expression of a diverse range of pathways. For example, they revealed that smaller symbionts appear to express the first step of denitrification, the larger symbionts the subsequent steps. Although the reason for this is not well understood, this is an intriguing result. Going beyond omics, their results are consistent with some previous measurements of symbiont activity under some conditions, in particular carbon fixation, which showed that the larger symbionts incorporate radiolabeled inorganic carbon more rapidly than the smaller symbionts. Cell division is also more often observed in electron micrographs of the smaller symbionts than the larger symbionts, in this study and in others. This is therefore an exciting and reliable study!</p><p>The reviewers have a number of comments for improving the paper:</p><p>1) There are 2 main research lines included in the manuscript- one focused on symbiont size and associated metabolic variation and the other with a comparison of worms with “sulfur rich” or sulfur poor (unhealthy?) trophosome. Most of the paper emphasizes comparisons between large and small symbionts- indeed nearly all of the Discussion focuses on this, while the differences between S-rich and S-poor worms are included in the figures, but not really discussed and I think distracts from the current focus. The authors may want to consider writing up the sulfur rich/poor comparison a separate manuscript (or if there are good reasons to keep the datasets together, the authors should provide more context about what S rich/ poor difference means for the physiology of the worm).</p><p>2) More context from the literature about symbiont/host physiology is needed as part of the Introduction and/or Discussion to help the non-specialist interpret your findings and conclusions. For example, it's important to provide context about the delivery of substrates to the symbionts through modified hemoglobin and the mode of nutrient acquisition by the host through digestion rather than milking their symbionts. Note that this occurs in the region that overlaps in part where the “large” symbionts are located and how this might impact the findings. The paper could be strengthened by discussing prior physiological experiments that support the semi-quantitative proteomics data here- for example, without context of prior experiments demonstrating that denitrification was been measured in <italic>riftia</italic> trophosome (e.g. citing experiments done by some of the co-authors on this work Hentschel and Felbeck, 1983, etc).</p><p>3) An overview figure that summarizes the current understanding of blood flow, symbiont location, symbiont digestion in addition to the TEM mosaic (again this would help readers not familiar with <italic>riftia</italic> ultrastructure/ physiology) would be extremely helpful. Also, a figure or table that summarizes the main metabolic/ physiological differences highlighted in the paper for large and small symbionts.</p><p>4) General thought (expanding on the comment in subsection “Metabolic diversity among symbiont size classes”): It is interesting that the symbiont cells that are ultimately digested are large, have multiple genome copies and enhanced rates of CO2 fixation. Perhaps investing more cellular resources in N-rich biomolecules rather than more refractile lipids prior to digestion provides a greater nutritional advantage the host? Also, I imagine a shift from S storage to low S content in the large symbionts would also aid in digestion. It would be great to see a little more discussion/ interpretation from the host side and the symbiosis rather than focusing primarily on differences in symbiont metabolism.</p><p>5) Two key drivers of gene expression in larger symbionts are postulated - relaxation of control of gene regulation, and adaptation to distinct microenvironments. These seem to contradict each other. The shift to a different metabolism tends to point to adaptation rather than relaxed control, which would simply mean that those pathways expressed by the small symbionts, plus many others, are expressed by the large symbionts. This should be clarified.</p><p>6) Link from hydrogen oxidation to sulfur metabolism - this is shown as electron flow to H2 to DsrC in Appendix—figure 4, but there was not anything that would directly link the hydrogenase to DsrC in the relevant references (Mitchell, Weissgerber). Please either explain why the link is shown so directly between these two systems, or end the arrows from the hydrogenase with a question mark if this is unclear.</p><p>7) The terms “stem cell” and “differentiation” are regularly applied to bacterial symbiont cells in <italic>Riftia</italic> and in plant nodules, but these strictly only apply to processes known from eukaryote cells. If you would like to keep these terms, perhaps put them in inverted commas to reflect this?</p><p>8) HCR-FISH can be multiplexed, different fluorophores were used for each target in this study. This MS still does not address the question (but the methods used could!) of whether the same symbiont cell expresses the Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle simultaneously. A negative control for the HCR-FISH experiments is also missing - a no-probe control at the minimum would be required. A nonsense probe (e.g. reverse complement) would also be important.</p><p>9) There is a reverse trend in the sulfur-starved animals with respect to RuBisCO expression in small vs large symbiont cells. Small symbiont cells look like they express more RuBisCO when the animal is generally experiencing energy limitation. This seems to contradict one of your major conclusions, this should be clarified.</p><p>10) You propose that partitioning metabolic roles into different symbiont sub-populations increases overall productivity. I have to admit that although this theory is cited often in symbiosis, I don't fully understand it. Also, here, what exactly would be the benefits of such partitioning? How would partitioning cell division, host interaction, sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation increase overall productivity? Outlining the arguments for this would help. See a new paper in the ISME Journal (Ankrah et al., for some thoughts about this). Alternatively, you raise the possibility that these distinct metabolic functions reflect adaptation to microenvironments with differing availability of substrates in the worm's trophosome. The current data doesn't really allow you to identify which is the controlling factor here.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bacterial symbiont subpopulations have different roles in a deep-sea symbiosis&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by the original reviewers and Gisela Storz as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved. The reviewers appreciated your detailed response to all questions and suggestions. They felt the restructuring of the paper, focusing on the physiological heterogeneity in different size classes, and shifting most reporting and discussion on differences between S-rich and S-poor samples has improved the manuscript. The addition of the relative stable carbon isotope values of proteins also strengthened the study. Additionally, the new schematic (Figure 6) is well done and a great addition to the manuscript.</p><p>However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There were still questions about the HCR-FISH results. Results should be placed in an appendix or supplement if they are less relevant to the core message of the paper, not if they are questionable, which seems to be implied by the response to point 8 (“did not yield satisfying results so far”). The same standards of robustness and reliability should apply to results in the main text and the supplement. We do not agree that a control for non-specific detection of targets (NSD according to the nomenclature of Nikolakakis et al., 2015) is optional, if a justification based on RNA hybridization behavior is given and can be backed up by literature. “Tremendous costs” also is a weak argument for not including a particular negative control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58371.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have a number of comments for improving the paper:</p><p>1) There are 2 main research lines included in the manuscript- one focused on symbiont size and associated metabolic variation and the other with a comparison of worms with “sulfur rich” or sulfur poor (unhealthy?) trophosome. Most of the paper emphasizes comparisons between large and small symbionts- indeed nearly all of the discussion focuses on this, while the differences between S-rich and S-poor worms are included in the figures, but not really discussed and I think distracts from the current focus. The authors may want to consider writing up the sulfur rich/poor comparison a separate manuscript (or if there are good reasons to keep the datasets together, the authors should provide more context about what S rich/ poor difference means for the physiology of the worm).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we pursued two interconnected research lines, with (i) the comparison of small and large symbionts being the main focus of the study, and (ii) the analysis of how cell size-specific features may vary depending on the energetic situation of the symbiosis (in S-rich and S-depleted trophosomes) as an additional question of interest. Sulfur-depletion in the trophosome is not an indicator of unhealthiness, but merely shows that these symbionts had less stored sulfur and were therefore probably energy-limited (unlike in the S-rich worms, whose symbionts were not energy-limited). Since the symbionts are uncultured, the influence of the prevailing micro-energy regime (S content) on, for example, cell size-dependent metabolic differences in symbiont subpopulations can only be investigated by comparing naturally occurring S-rich and S-depleted trophosomes. Interestingly, throughout all gradient fractions in our study, only very few Endoriftia proteins showed significantly different abundances between S-rich and S-depleted samples. S-rich and S-depleted datasets thus support each other. In light of this mutual support (S-depleted samples functioning as “quasi-replicates” for the S-rich samples), we kept both datasets in the manuscript, but thoroughly adjusted the text and figures for enhanced clarity. We better explained this rationale in the manuscript and extended the definition of “S-rich” and “S-depleted” (Introduction, Materials and methods). Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the two lines of research might be confusing, and the S-rich vs S-depl comparison may distract from the main focus of the study. In the heat map in Figure 3, we therefore now only compare protein abundances across gradient fractions XS – L of S-rich samples. The previous Figure 3 with S-rich and S-depleted samples was moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Moreover, we removed the “S-depl” columns in Figure 4 altogether. In the results, we added a sentence explaining that sulfur-rich and sulfur-depleted samples showed overall quite similar symbiont cell size distributions and protein abundance patterns. “The following results will therefore not discriminate between both sample types and subsequent figures will focus on S-rich samples (unless otherwise stated)” (subsection “Protein identifications and relative protein abundance”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More context from the literature about symbiont/host physiology is needed as part of the introduction and/or discussion to help the non-specialist interpret your findings and conclusions. For example, it's important to provide context about the delivery of substrates to the symbionts through modified hemoglobin and the mode of nutrient acquisition by the host through digestion rather than milking their symbionts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be helpful and added a paragraph with additional general background information on the physiology of the symbiosis, including nutrient transfer from symbionts to host and substrate supply from host to symbionts as suggested (Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note that this occurs in the region that overlaps in part where the “large” symbionts are located and how this might impact the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental approach we used – density gradient centrifugation – does not support the enrichment of symbiont cells in the state of being digested (labelled as S* in Figure 5). This is because only intact symbiont cells remained after homogenization of the tissue (while host cells were broken) and only these intact symbiont cells would migrate through the gradient, while debris from broken cells (including half-digested cells) – accumulates at the very top of the gradient, which we did not analyze (e.g., proteins, membrane fractions). Although our “large symbionts” are in situ located closer to the digestive trophosome lobule zone than the smallest symbionts, we did not observe elevated levels of stress proteins or other signs that would indicate that the physiology of large symbionts is in any way impacted by imminent digestion (as stated in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper could be strengthened by discussing prior physiological experiments that support the semi-quantitative proteomics data here- for example, without context of prior experiments demonstrating that denitrification was been measured in riftia trophosome (e.g. citing experiments done by some of the co-authors on this work Hentschel and Felbeck, 1983, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We added references for experimental evidence of nitrate respiration in <italic>Riftia</italic> (subsection “Hydrogen oxidation is more relevant in large symbionts”), for the function of host carbonic anhydrase (subsection “Interaction-specific host proteins”), for sulfur storage in globules (subsection “Small Endoriftia store more sulfur and are more involved in sulfide oxidation”), and for sulfide and thiosulfate use in Endoriftia (subsection “In large symbionts, thiosulfate oxidation plays a more prominent role”) in the Discussion. Unfortunately, dedicated literature about the individual physiological properties of smaller and larger <italic>Riftia</italic> symbionts, which we could summon in support of our results, is rather limited. Nevertheless, a broader background about the physiology of the symbiosis is certainly helpful for the reader, which is why we added additional general information and references, including most of those suggested by the reviewers at the end of this letter, in the Introduction. We also cite our comprehensive metaproteomic analysis of host and symbiont physiology, which was published previously (Hinzke et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An overview figure that summarizes the current understanding of blood flow, symbiont location, symbiont digestion in addition to the TEM mosaic (again this would help readers not familiar with riftia ultrastructure/ physiology) would be extremely helpful. Also, a figure or table that summarizes the main metabolic/ physiological differences highlighted in the paper for large and small symbionts.</p></disp-quote><p>We seized the reviewer’s suggestion and included a new figure (Figure 6) which illustrates where the symbionts are located (in the worm and in the tissue lobules), where the smaller and larger symbionts are and where the latter are digested, and in which direction the host’s blood flows. To summarize the essential findings of our study, we also included the small and large symbionts’ most distinguishing features that determine their respective roles in the symbiosis in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) General thought (expanding on the comment in subsection “Metabolic diversity among symbiont size classes”): It is interesting that the symbiont cells that are ultimately digested are large, have multiple genome copies and enhanced rates of CO2 fixation. Perhaps investing more cellular resources in N-rich biomolecules rather than more refractile lipids prior to digestion provides a greater nutritional advantage the host? Also, I imagine a shift from S storage to low S content in the large symbionts would also aid in digestion. It would be great to see a little more discussion/ interpretation from the host side and the symbiosis rather than focusing primarily on differences in symbiont metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We added a sentence about the advantage of multiple genome copies (N-rich biomolecules, subsection “Metabolic diversity among symbiont size classes”), and one regarding the benefit of less sulfur in large symbionts for host-mediated digestion in the Discussion. We also elaborate some more on the host’s side of the symbiosis in the introduction and on the advantages of labor division for the holobiont in the discussion. This should provide a more comprehensive picture of the entire symbiosis to the reader and complements our research focus, i.e., the comparative analysis of differently sized symbiont cells and their physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Two key drivers of gene expression in larger symbionts are postulated - relaxation of control of gene regulation, and adaptation to distinct microenvironments. These seem to contradict each other. The shift to a different metabolism tends to point to adaptation rather than relaxed control, which would simply mean that those pathways expressed by the small symbionts, plus many others, are expressed by the large symbionts. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Maybe this was a bit misleading: Rather than considering “less stringent control” and “adaptation to micro-conditions caused by a substrate gradient” as two different key drivers, we believe that relaxed control in larger symbionts is an adaptation as well. Large symbionts adapt to their specific micro-environment – in which all substrates are plentifully provided and cells are not notably restricted by host interference – by expressing much of the metabolic repertoire simultaneously. We clarified this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Link from hydrogen oxidation to sulfur metabolism - this is shown as electron flow to H2 to DsrC in Appendix—figure 4, but there was not anything that would directly link the hydrogenase to DsrC in the relevant references (Mitchell, Weissgerber). Please either explain why the link is shown so directly between these two systems, or end the arrows from the hydrogenase with a question mark if this is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure was inspired by Weissgerber et al., who suggested this link between hydrogenase and DsrC in their model of sulfur oxidation in <italic>Allochromatium vinosum</italic> (their Figure 3), and labelled it with a question mark to illustrate that it is as yet hypothetical. We indicated the hypothetical character of this connection using a dotted grey line in Appendix—figure 4 and mention in the figure legend that the role of hydrogen in sulfur oxidation in <italic>Riftia</italic> is questionable. To make it even more visible that this link is not based on experimental evidence, we now added a question mark to the arrow in Appendix—figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The terms “stem cell” and “differentiation” are regularly applied to bacterial symbiont cells in Riftia and in plant nodules, but these strictly only apply to processes known from eukaryote cells. If you would like to keep these terms, perhaps put them in inverted commas to reflect this?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers concern, but would like to keep the terms “stem cells” and “differentiation”. To acknowledge that they were not originally used for bacteria, we put “stem cells” in inverted commas throughout the manuscript and added a short statement explaining our use of the word “differentiation” in the Discussion. “Differentiation” is commonly used to describe the varying morphologies of, for example, <italic>Rhizobia</italic> during their different infection stages in legume root nodules (Van de Velde et al., 2010, Kondorosi et al., 2013) or of heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria (Flores and Herrero, 2010). We would therefore like to adopt the term – in its less strict sense – also for the morphological transformations we see in Endoriftia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) HCR-FISH can be multiplexed, different fluorophores were used for each target in this study. This MS still does not address the question (but the methods used could!) of whether the same symbiont cell expresses the Calvin cycle and rTCA cycle simultaneously.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, thank you for pointing this out. The HCR-FISH analyses were conducted to address exactly the question whether or not RubisCO and the rTCA key enzyme AclB are expressed in the same symbiont cells or if they are expressed by distinct subpopulations in separate trophosome lobule zones. Unfortunately, while the method worked well on isolated symbiont cells, our in situ analyses in trophosome tissue sections did not yield satisfying results so far, preventing an answer to the second part of the question. (We therefore included the HCR-FISH images in the Supplementary Results rather than in the main text.) However, we do see that both enzymes are expressed in the same cells in Appendix—figure 3 (all three panels showing the same symbiont cells with different probes). We made sure to stress this result more clearly in our manuscript (Discussion, Appendix (Supplementary Results and Discussion)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A negative control for the HCR-FISH experiments is also missing - a no-probe control at the minimum would be required. A nonsense probe (e.g. reverse complement) would also be important.</p></disp-quote><p>Two kinds of negative controls were used: (i) Some of the filters were incubated without probes, but with hairpins (to exclude unspecific binding of the fluorophore-carrying hairpin to the tissue), and (ii) some filters were incubated without probes and without hairpins to test for auto fluorescence. In both cases, all negative control images were empty. We added a statement explaining this in the Materials and methods and in the figure caption of Appendix-figure 3. Given the high target-specificity (and tremendous costs) of HCR-FISH probes, a nonsense probe was not considered necessary. There is only one target sequence for RubisCO and AclB in the <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont genome, and hybridization conditions for RNA probes are so strict that we can exclude unspecific binding to other RNAs or DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There is a reverse trend in the sulfur-starved animals with respect to RuBisCO expression in small vs large symbiont cells. Small symbiont cells look like they express more RuBisCO when the animal is generally experiencing energy limitation. This seems to contradict one of your major conclusions, this should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Protein abundance values for RubisCO from S-depleted animals are indeed ambiguous. While CbbM abundance increases significantly (i.e., consistently throughout all replicates) from small to large cells in S-rich samples, the trend in the S-depleted samples is not significant (i.e., replicates were quite variable) and abundance differences are relatively small in S-depleted samples. There is no clear trend visible. Possibly – as indicated by our new stable isotope fingerprinting (SIF) analyses (Supplementary Results and Discussion) and by previous results (Markert et al., 2007) – this could be because the Calvin cycle seems to become less relevant in S-depleted (energy-limited) trophosomes, whereas the less “expensive” reductive TCA cycle plays a relatively more important role in symbionts in S-depleted samples. We moved the heat map showing the S-depleted data from Figure 3 to the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) You propose that partitioning metabolic roles into different symbiont sub-populations increases overall productivity. I have to admit that although this theory is cited often in symbiosis, I don't fully understand it. Also, here, what exactly would be the benefits of such partitioning? How would partitioning cell division, host interaction, sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation increase overall productivity? Outlining the arguments for this would help. See a new paper in the ISME Journal (Ankrah et al. for some thoughts about this). Alternatively, you raise the possibility that these distinct metabolic functions reflect adaptation to microenvironments with differing availability of substrates in the worm's trophosome. The current data doesn't really allow you to identify which is the controlling factor here.</p></disp-quote><p>Like in multicellular organisms, dividing responsibilities between dedicated cell populations increases the efficiency of the “holo-organism”. In case of Endoriftia, this specialization (differentiation) allows the symbiont to benefit from both, (i) multiple genome copies with resulting increased transcription efficiency and productivity in large cells, and (ii) high cell division rates in small cells, while at the same time circumventing the individual disadvantages of both stages. These being that large Endoriftia would need to invest much more resources in cell division and replication of their multiple genome copies than small cells, while the smaller cells would not be able to produce as much biomass as the large ones. We included this argumentation in the Discussion. Putative substrate gradients across the trophosome lobules could be one of the drivers of this advantageous specialization, in addition to host-derived influences or effectors. Indeed, we cannot distinguish between potentially controlling factors at this point. Instead, we suggest that a combination of both, the evolutionary advantage of specialization, and different microenvironments, have favored the symbionts’ observed physiological diversity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved. The reviewers appreciated your detailed response to all questions and suggestions. They felt the restructuring of the paper, focusing on the physiological heterogeneity in different size classes, and shifting most reporting and discussion on differences between S-rich and S-poor samples has improved the manuscript. The addition of the relative stable carbon isotope values of proteins also strengthened the study. Additionally, the new schematic (Figure 6) is well done and a great addition to the manuscript.</p><p>However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There were still questions about the HCR-FISH results. Results should be placed in an appendix or supplement if they are less relevant to the core message of the paper, not if they are questionable, which seems to be implied by the response to point 8 (“did not yield satisfying results so far”). The same standards of robustness and reliability should apply to results in the main text and the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>The HCR-FISH results presented here are not questionable at all – our apologies if the previous comment was a bit misleading. The results clearly show that both enzymes, RubisCO and AclB, are expressed in the same cells of different sizes in a symbiont cell suspension (specifically: in a gradient fraction enriched in larger Endoriftia after centrifugation of homogenized trophosome tissue).</p><p>(What “did not yield satisfying results so far” were hybridizations of the same HCR-FISH probes in trophosome tissue sections or pieces, where tissue autofluorescence posed a considerable difficulty.

In their paper on HCR-FISH as a powerful tool in symbiosis research, these authors specify three kinds of controls that should be performed to “identify possible artifacts and confounding effects”: (a) without probes or hairpins, (b) without probes but with hairpins, and – if possible – (c) a “Non-Specific Detection of targets (NSD) control” without the target RNA, but with probes and hairpins.</p><p>We followed this recommendation and performed negative control preparations of the (a) and (b) type. A more detailed description of our negative controls in reference to Nikolakakis et al., (2015) was added in the methods section. As Nikolakakis et al., state, an NSD control would only be applicable in two cases, namely (i) where a knockout version or wildtype missing the target is available, or (ii) when the locus of expression of a non-ubiquitous endogenous RNA is known beforehand (in which case the surrounding tissue can be regarded as target-free NSD control). Since Endoriftia is not cultivable (as yet), preventing the generation of knockout strains, and since we did not know the locus of RNA expression in the tissue or cells beforehand, a target-free Endoriftia control sample was, regrettably, unavailable. We did, therefore, take great care to ensure specificity of our HRC-FISH experiment even in the absence of a target-free control sample.</p><p>In nucleic acid hybridizations, the hybridization rate approaches zero when mismatches increase to more than 30% (Wetmur, 1991). Consequently, only rather similar target sequences could (theoretically) elicit an “unspecific” binding event, while random binding events to non-similar sequences are excluded based on RNA hybridization behavior. Unlike in other symbioses or in environmental samples, there is only one symbiont phylotype in <italic>Riftia</italic> (Polzin et al., 2019). This considerably reduces the complexity of our sample and eliminates the risk of unspecific binding to RNAs from bacteria other than Endoriftia. Finally, false-positive matches to host RNAs can be excluded for the RubisCO and AclB probes in our images, as symbiont cells were co-labeled with a 16S rRNA-specific probe which confirmed the identity of the cells.</p><p>To ensure probe sequence specificity, we searched the <italic>Riftia</italic> symbiont genome assemblies (NCBI whole-genome shotgun projects) NZ_AFOC00000000.1 and NZ_AFZB00000000.1 for matches to our AclB and RubisCO mRNA probe sequences before we started our experiments. Using the selected probe sequences as queries in a BLAST search with parameters set at a low stringency level (BLASTn optimized for somewhat similar sequences, seed length: 7, expectation threshold: 1), several potential off-target hits were identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, all of these off-target matches were characterized by short sequence coverage (usually between 15 to 30 bp of the total 50 bp probe length) and several mismatches. To test whether the off-target matches could still lead to false-positive detections in our experiment, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of their hybridization behavior using mathFISH, an online tool for evaluation of oligonucleotide probes for FISH (Yilmaz et al., 2011), at 25% formamide, 45°C, 1 M sodium, and 2 nM probe concentration. As a result of these calculations, all off-target matches yielded hybridization efficiencies of 0%, while all probe sequences produced 100% hybridization efficiency.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Blast results of HCR-FISH probes and <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of their hybridization behaviour.</title><p>Four RubisCO-specific probes and five AclB probes were searched against the NCBI whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequences NZ_AFOC00000000.1 and NZ_AFZB00000000.1, containing the complete genomes of the <italic>Riftia pachyptila</italic> symbiont and the <italic>Tevnia jerochonana</italic> symbiont, respectively (both symbionts belong to the same 16S rRNA phylotype; Gardebrecht <italic>et al</italic> ., 2012). At low stringency settings (BLASTn optimized for “somewhat similar sequences”, seed length: 7, expectation threshold: 1), most probe sequences (queries) had matches (subjects) not only in their respective target genes, but also produced off-target matches of lower % identity (%Id) and with higher numbers of gaps (g) and mismatches (m) in the alignment.
