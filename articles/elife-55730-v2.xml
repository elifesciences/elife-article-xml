Jambusaria et al. recently demonstrated that ECs in various tissues surprisingly possess mRNA signatures of their underlying parenchyma. The mechanism underlying this observation remains unexplained, and could include mRNA contamination during cell isolation, in vivo mRNA paracrine transfer from parenchymal cells to ECs, or cell-autonomous expression of these mRNAs in ECs. Here, we use a combination of bulk RNASeq, single-cell RNASeq datasets, in situ mRNA hybridization, and most importantly ATAC-Seq of FACS-isolated nuclei, to show that cardiac ECs actively express cardiomyocyte myofibril (CMF) genes and have open chromatin at CMF gene promoters. These open chromatin sites are enriched for sites targeted by cardiac transcription factors, and closed upon expansion of ECs in culture. Together, these data demonstrate unambiguously that the expression of CMF genes in ECs is cell-autonomous, and not simply a result of technical contamination or paracrine transfers of mRNAs, and indicate that local cues in the heart in vivo unexpectedly maintain fully open chromatin in ECs at genes previously thought limited to cardiomyocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>cardiology</kwd><kwd>vascular biology</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>cell identity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HLDK114103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arany</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AHA/Allen Initative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arany</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 DKO7314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yucel</surname><given-names>Nora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial cells in the heart have transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of cardiomyocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are the most abundant non-blood cells in the body, and form the inner layer of all vessels in all organs. ECs carry out a wide range of critical functions, including providing a barrier between blood and the underlying parenchyma, regulating transport of nutrients and waste across that barrier, regulation of immune cell extravasation, maintaining intravascular hemostatic homeostasis, and controlling blood flow and systemic vascular resistance. These numerous roles differ widely depending on anatomical site, developmental stage, and physiological state. Consistent with this remarkable variability of function, extensive transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of ECs across tissue types, vascular localization (e.g. arterial, venous, or lymphatic), and developmental stage has been characterized in a number of studies. However, the chromatin landscape underlying these differences remains poorly understood.</p><p>Interestingly, numerous investigators have noted anecdotally, in discussions at various meetings, that cardiac ECs contain mRNAs that encode various myofibrillar proteins normally expressed in cardiomyocytes, including myosins, troponins, and titin. Most recently, Jambusaria et al. collated EC-specific RNAseq datasets from heart, brain, and lung, to formally show that ECs in these three tissues contain mRNAs normally ascribed to their respective underlying parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jambusaria et al., 2020</xref>). This observation has been variably ascribed to technical artifacts during RNA preparations (i.e. contamination by RNAs from cardiomyocytes) or to presumed transfer in vivo of RNAs from cardiomyocytes to ECs via, for example, exosome transfer (although this has never been demonstrated), but these conclusions have been controversial. An alternative hypothesis is that cardiac ECs may in fact express these RNAs intrinsically. In this context, it is relevant to note that cardiac ECs originate from tri-potential precursor cells that differentiate to cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and ECs. It may therefore be that cardiac ECs maintain epigenetic memory of a cardiomyocyte-like precursor.</p><p>To distinguish these possibilities, we use here single-cell RNAseq as well as bulk ATACSeq to characterize the chromatin accessibility signature of cardiac ECs in vivo. We show that cardiac ECs in fact maintain chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of myofibrillar genes typical of underlying cardiomyocyte parenchyma, but not of the immediately surrounding stromal cells. The presence of these mRNAs in cardiac ECs is thus a direct consequence of their expression in ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cardiac ECs express myofibrillar genes normally associated with cardiomyocytes</title><p>We first sought to define the complete signature of actively translated mRNAs in cardiac ECs. To do so, we leveraged the NuTRAP mouse model, in which ribosomes are genetically tagged with GFP, conditional on Cre expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roh et al., 2017</xref>). EC-specific Cdh5-Cre NuTRAP mice thus allow for immuno-precipitation of ribosome-bound, and thus actively translated, RNA strictly from ECs, without the need for cell-isolation. RNASeq from NuTRAP-tagged cardiac ECs showed, as expected, enrichment of known EC-specific genes. Surprisingly, however, we also found significant contribution of mRNAs from cardiomyocyte myofibril (CMF) genes which, although depleted compared to the non-endothelial fraction, were still amongst the highest expressed genes in cardiac ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To begin to ascertain whether this contribution was due to technical contamination, that is pulldown of mRNAs originating from cardiomyocytes instead of ECs, we performed Kendall-Tau rank-order analysis. As did Jambusaria et al, we reasoned that contamination would reflect the relative expression levels of CMF genes from the whole heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Endothelial and non-endothelial heart expression of highly expressed genes were only poorly correlated (0.216), suggesting that the presence of CMF mRNAs is not solely due to contamination.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cardiac endothelial cells express myofibrillar genes normally associated with cardiomyocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNASeq of Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) endothelial RNA freshly isolated from hearts of Cdh5-NuTRAP animals.

We focused on datasets that used prospective isolation of ECs by flow cytometry using either genetic or surface markers in order to minimize contamination by the underlying parenchyma. All data analyzed was from uncultured, freshly isolated ECs or endothelial material. Three mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cleuren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coppiello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nolan et al., 2013</xref>) and one study using human fetal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Marcu et al., 2018</xref>) were identified. We first focused on the Cleuren, et al dataset, which, akin to the NuTRAP system we used above, used the <italic>Rpl22<sup>fl/fl</sup> Tek-Cre<sup>+/0</sup></italic> mice to characterize the endothelial translatome in various tissues. Similar to our own analyses, as well those published by Jambusaria et al, we found significant expression of CMF genes in the EC translatome in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, the expression of these genes was limited to heart ECs, and not seen in translatomes from ECs in other organs. Kendall Tau rank analysis of the expression of the top 300 highest expressed genes (which included CMF genes) in ECs vs the total heart translatome again showed low correlation (0.05–0.28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), casting doubts on the notion that CMF mRNAs in ECs originate from contaminating cardiomyocyte-derived mRNAs. To take an unbiased approach to this question, we clustered by principle component analysis the translatome RNAseq datasets, comparing various whole tissues to their respective ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Multidimensional scaling of these data showed that ECs surprisingly cluster closer to their tissue of origin than to other ECs, and this was particularly true in the heart.</p><p>The next three datasets used FACS-isolated ECs to separate EC mRNAs, rather than immunoprecipitated EC-specific translatomes. Despite the different approach, analyses of these datasets again showed an enrichment of CMF gene expression in cardiac ECs, but not in ECs from other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). In contrast, expression of known cardiomyocyte-specific transcription factors, as well as metabolic genes highly enriched in cardiomyocytes, were not significantly different in cardiac ECs compared to other ECs. Together, analyses of these datasets demonstrate that CMF gene expression in ECs: (1) is unique to cardiac ECs; (2) is generally limited to CMF genes and not to other genes highly expressed in cardiomyocytes such as mitochondrial genes; and (3) has been detected by numerous previous studies, including most recently Jambusaria et al.; and (4) is unlikely to be caused solely by contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Expression of at least one CMF gene is seen in ~60% of cardiac ECs</title><p>We next wanted to determine if CMF gene expression in ECs is ubiquitous to all cardiac ECs, or is limited to a subset of ECs. In addition, we wanted to determine whether CMF gene expression is also present in other resident cell types in the heart. To do so, we leveraged <italic>Tabula Muris</italic> single-cell RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), and compared CMF gene expression in cardiac ECs and fibroblasts. We first used the single-cell analysis package Seurat v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) to identify marker genes characteristic of cardiomyocytes, ECs or fibroblasts, that is signatures for each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the cardiomyocyte signature, we selected 15 genes that were expressed in &gt;60% of cardiomyocytes, and whose expression was at least 10-fold higher than that in non-cardiomyocytes cells. Expression of each of these 15 genes was then evaluated in single cardiac and lung ECs and fibroblasts. The number of cardiac ECs identified as expressing each of these cardiomyocyte signature genes was dramatically higher than lung ECs or fibroblasts, and 2–4 fold higher than heart fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A total of 59.3% of all cardiac ECs expressed at least one of the 15 CMF genes, 1.75-fold more often than cardiac fibroblasts, and about five times more often than lung ECs (which were driven primarily by one gene, <italic>Myl4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The majority of CMF-expressing ECs only showed expression of one or two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This distribution, as opposed to one subpopulation of cells expressing all CMF genes, suggests that expression is not being driven by cardiomyocytes misclassified as ECs, or by EC/cardiomyocyte doublets, again arguing against contamination.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of at least one CMF gene is seen in ~59% of cardiac ECs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Analysis of mouse heart and lung single cell data from Tabula Muris in Schaum, et al (Nature, 2018).

We reasoned that contaminating RNAs from cardiomyocytes would originate largely from the cytosol, and therefore be primarily mature, spliced RNA. Velocyto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>) was used to quantify spliced and unspliced gene counts for cardiomyocyte, EC, and fibroblast cell subsets as annotated in <italic>Tabula Muris.</italic> Within each subset, cells were merged, and the ratio of unspliced mRNAs/total mRNAs was calculated for each population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We focused on cardiomyocyte genes with detectable unspliced mRNAs (&gt;1%; a total of 53 genes). In this gene set, the median spliced percentages for cardiac ECs and fibroblasts cells were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively, markedly higher than in cardiomyocytes (2.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). An example of this is shown in the RNA-seq track for <italic>Myom2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, illustrating: (1) significant expression of these genes in cardiac ECs, but not in lung ECs and (2) importantly, significant presence of unspliced introns in ECs, but not in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Overall, these data demonstrate: (1) that EC expression of CMF genes is limited to cardiac ECs; (2) that cardiac fibroblast cells also express these genes but much less frequently than cardiac ECs; (3) that at any given time only a subset of cardiac ECs express only a subset of CMF genes, suggesting stochastic expression; and (4) that cardiac ECs express both spliced and unspliced RNAs from CMF genes, the latter at a higher frequency than cardiomyocytes, indicating cell-intrinsic expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CMF mRNAs are detectable in EC nuclei ex vivo and in situ in vivo</title><p>The results above strongly suggest, but fall shy of formally proving, that the presence of CMF mRNAs in cardiac ECs is not caused by contamination from cell-free RNA derived from cardiomyocytes, whose cytoplasmic volume is much larger than fibroblasts or ECs. To address this possibility in yet another way, we isolated EC nuclei, rather than whole cells, from mouse hearts, by fluorescent sorting from Cdh5-Cre/NuTRAP animals. To confirm specificity of the sorting strategy, nuclei were co-stained with PCM-1, known to specifically mark cardiomyocyte nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergmann et al., 2011</xref>), which revealed no overlap between GFP+ (EC) and PCM-1+ (cardiomyocyte) nuclei populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Doublets were eliminated by FSC-A/FSC-H and as well as DAPI gating (2 n) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the observed ~20% GFP+ (EC) nuclei and ~30% PCM-1+ (cardiomyocyte) nuclei matched previously estimated reports of cardiac cell content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). Quantitative PCR with RNA from GFP+ (EC) nuclei showed strong enrichment (~5-fold) of EC-specific transcripts (<italic>Pecam1, Gpihbp1</italic>), and depletion (10–15 fold) of fibroblast/pericyte-specific transcripts (<italic>Dpt, Cspg4, Pdgfrb</italic>). In contrast, CMF genes were depleted to a much lesser extent (2–3 fold; <italic>Tnnt2, Myh6, Myh7, Actc1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

Quantification of nuclei with co-localization of both <italic>Cdh5</italic> and <italic>Tnnt2</italic> RNA showed presence of <italic>Tnnt2</italic> in ~12% of endothelial (<italic>Cdh5</italic>+) cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>), a proportion that is similar to the number of ECs in Tabula Muris that are Tnnt2 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Altogether these results unambiguously show that expression of CMF genes in ECs is not due to contamination from parenchymal cells, and strongly suggest that expression of CMF genes stems from direct expression from EC chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cardiac ECs maintain open chromatin at CMF genes</title><p>The presence of CMF transcripts in ECs, if not technical contamination, could potentially reflect a biologic paracrine contribution of cardiomyocyte-derived RNAs transmitted to ECs via, for example, exosomes or microvesicles, as previously described in non-cardiac contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, our single-cell analysis, RNAScope and nuclear sorting data strongly suggested EC-intrinsic transcription of CMF genes. To distinguish these possibilities, we used ATAC-Seq to determine directly whether cardiac ECs have open chromatin at CMF genes, reasoning that if there is EC-intrinsic expression, there should also be some detectable open chromatin at cardiomyocyte-specific genes. We performed genome-wide ATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>) on nuclei sorted from Cdh5-Cre/NuTRAP animals, and compared GFP positive (endothelial) and GFP negative (non-endothelial) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

Moreover, the presence of open chromatin at cardiomyocyte-specific genes, as well as the nuclear expression of these genes in ECs, demonstrates significant EC-intrinsic transcriptional contribution of these mRNAs. A gene expression signature in ECs that mirrors the underlying parenchyma is also apparent in public datasets from other studies, and was recently reported in the literature for the first time by Jambusaria et al. These studies, however, left open the question of the mechanism by which these mRNAs were to be found in cardiac ECs. In numerous unofficial discussions at scientific meetings, the observation has in general been ascribed to either technical contamination, or to cardiomyocyte-derived mRNA transferring to ECs via extracellular vesicles or other paracrine mechanism. Our results, in contrast, demonstrate that these CMF mRNAs originate in ECs themselves, via active maintenance of open chromatin and transcription. It must be noted that the functional consequence of this shared signature, and whether it results in translation of CMF transcripts, remains to be determined.</p><p>The notion that ECs actively express CMF genes has been contentious. However, at this point, the arguments against contamination as an explanation for the presence of CMF mRNAs in cardiac ECs are numerous and compelling:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Kendall Tau correlations demonstrate lack of correlation between genes highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and those potentially contaminating ECs.

However, these data do not indicate whether CMF genes are also translated, and serve similar functions in ECs as they do in cardiomyocytes.</p></list-item></list><p>Interestingly, we find that the expression of CMF genes, including immature, unspliced transcripts, in ECs is detectable in only a subset of cells (~60%), and that in general only 1–2 genes are detectable, and not always the same ones. In contrast, the chromatin at these genes, although evaluated only in bulk, appears to be as open as that of cardiomyocytes. These observations suggest that chromatin is maintained open at these genes in all cardiac ECs, but that rates of transcription are relatively low and stochastic, and that there may not be a defined subset of ECs that express CMF genes. We hypothesize that this fully open chromatin at CMF genes in cardiac ECs may reflect shared developmental origin between cardiomyocytes and ECs. During development, cardiac progenitors that express <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> (primary heart field) or <italic>Isl1</italic> (secondary heart field) give rise to both ECs and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, accessibility of chromatin at cardiomyocyte-specific genes may be due to epigenetic memory of this shared developmental origin.</p><p>An outstanding question remains as to the role of the cardiomyocyte epigenetic and transcriptional signature on endothelial function. Recent studies point towards a potential role in EC maturation. Both developmental and adult cardiomyocyte and ECs share expression of the transcription factor MEF2C, the number one predicted binding site in our analysis of open chromatin peaks shared between cardiac ECs and cardiomyocytes. Endothelial-specific MEF2C has been shown to regulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sacilotto et al., 2016</xref>), cell integrity and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Potthoff and Olson, 2007</xref>), as well as response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). GATA4, whose motif is highly enriched between cardiac ECs and cardiomyocytes, is expressed by cardiac progenitors and in adult cardiomyocytes, but almost undetectable in ECs. Nonetheless, a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Maliken et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated that inducible knockdown of GATA4 in adult ECs resulted in a less mature, PECAM1-‘low’ EC phenotype, including hyperproliferation, reduced differentiation, and impaired tube formation capacity. Although not highlighted in the main figures, the supplementary data from this study reveals that expression of CMF genes, including <italic>Myh6, Myl7, Tnnt2</italic> and <italic>Sln</italic>, are significantly downregulated (25–1.5 fold) upon <italic>Gata4</italic> knockdown. These studies, which show that loss of cardiomyocyte transcription factors results in EC ‘immaturity’, are consistent with our observation that cardiomyocyte-specific gene accessibility is lost in cardiac ECs upon culture. We hypothesize that perhaps cardiomyocyte transcription factors, such as GATA4 and MEF2, are responsible for maintaining the open chromatin signature of CMF genes within ECs in the heart, and that CMF gene expression plays a role in cardiac EC maturity.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate here that cardiac ECs maintain open chromatin and active transcription at a number of myofibrillar genes thought to be uniquely expressed in cardiomyocytes. This shared chromatin accessibility landscape is likely maintained by paracrine cues in vivo, and likely serves to maintain the unique phenotype of cardiac ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6;129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sortm2(CAG-NuTRAP)Evdr</italic>/J</td><td valign="top">Cell Rep. 2017 Jan 24;

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yucel and colleagues propose that cardiac endothelial cells (EC) have an epigenetic and transcriptional profile that partly mirrors that of cardiomyocytes. Specifically, the authors report the expression of cardiomyocyte myofibril genes (e.g., troponin, titin), which are present in cardiac endothelial cells but not in endothelial cells from other organs. The chromatin of these genes is in an &quot;open state&quot; , which appears to be dependent on the cardiac micro-environment. The authors speculate that this tissue-specific gene expression signature may reflect the developmental origin of cardiac endothelial cells. This work is provocative, and as such reviewers felt that more rigorous work is needed to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Essential revisions focus primarily on rigorous experimentation to more unambiguously show that the &quot;cardiac gene expression signature&quot; is indeed cell-intrinsic to EC. It was pointed out that the presence of cardiomyocyte RNAs in the EC single-cell and ATAC seq data might be due to contamination, and that more rigorous data is needed to show in situ endothelial cell expression of cardiomyocyte genes unambiguously. There are also numerous instances of vague descriptions of approaches, methods and analysis that need to be improved. Essential points:</p><p>1) Several reviewers were concerned with the possibility that cardiomyocyte RNAs could be represented in the single-cell datasets but not originate from endothelial cells. They suggested the possibility of cardiomyocyte-EC doublets, or cell-free RNA sticking to antibodies or beads, or to glycocalyx of the EC cells. They point out that the ATAC-seq data is on bulk RNA and so could be contaminated by some cardiomyocytes, and that only the most abundant cardiomyocyte RNAs seem to be expressed by EC and represented in the ATAC-seq data. It was difficult to evaluate the interpretation of the data because the negative population in the TRAP experiment is not clearly defined, and if whole heart tissue is open to contamination from cardiomyocytes. Therefore more rigorous experimentation is required, such as dual single-cell RNA and ATAC-seq to show that bona fide EC have epigenetic patterns suggestive of cardiomyocyte gene expression. It would also strengthen the data to do single-cell RNA seq analysis before and after RNAse treatment to evaluate potential capture of negatively charged RNA by positively charged EC glycocalyx. It was suggested that a better analysis of the epigenetic landscape of cardiac genes in EC would be informative – for example, the chromatin status of other cardiac genes not found in heart EC is of interest. What about epigenetic marks that indicate active transcription of genes? Are these marks found in genes like Tnni, Tnnt2, Tnnc1 an Myh6 when analyzed in cardiac endothelial cells?

We, too, were very concerned about this possibility at first. We wish to clarify our ATAC-Seq data and RNAseq data, and better articulate why such cross-contamination cannot explain our findings:</p><p>1) “ATAC-seq data is on bulk RNA and so could be contaminated by some cardiomyocytes”: the ATAC-seq studies were performed on DNA, not RNA. In addition, for ATAC-Seq, it is important to note that the Tn5 transposase is specific for double stranded DNA, and thus will not be affected by cell-free RNA.</p><p>2) “Cardiomyocyte-EC doublets”: at the level of cells (i.e. Tabula Muris data) this is highly unlikely, as few cardiomyocytes were sorted in this dataset, due to their large size. At the level of nuclei sorting (our data), endothelial cell nuclei were sorted on the basis of DAPI staining, and doublets were excluded during sorting by both DAPI staining and FSC-A/FSC-H gating by flow cytometry. This is shown in a newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We also assessed the exclusion of cardiomyocyte nuclei by co-staining of nuclei for PCM1, a specific marker of cardiomyocyte nuclei, and find no PCM1 signal in our EC nuclei fraction (Figure 3A). It is thus highly unlikely that doublets were included, and even if so, the numbers would be low.</p><p>3) “Only the most abundant cardiomyocyte RNAs seems to be expressed by EC and represented in the ATAC-seq data”. It is important to note that the ATAC-seq data evaluate chromatin, not RNA expression. Thus, contamination would have to occur at the level of chromatin DNA, not RNA, and the level of expression in cardiomyocytes would have no bearing on the ATAC-seq data. So, for example, if 10% of EC nuclear prep was contaminated by cardiomyocyte nuclei, then we would detect 10% open chromatin at the troponin genome locus, no matter the level of expression of troponin. Instead, we find 100% open chromatin at the troponin locus in the EC prep (Figure 4A). Contamination by CM nuclei cannot explain this observation.</p><p>4) “Cell-free RNA sticking to antibodies or beads, or to glycocalyx of the EC cells.” We do not exclude the contribution of contamination from cardiomyocyte RNA, which is inevitable in any RNA-Seq study. However, we performed analyses to demonstrate that such contamination, to the extent that it does occur, is minimal. First, we find that not all abundant cardiomyocyte RNAs are expressed in ECs, while, if contamination was indeed occurring, then all abundant RNAs should be detected, in relative proportion to their abundance. To quantify this observation, we followed the same approach as Jambusaria, et al., 2020, and performed Kendall-Tau rank-score statistical analysis on the highest 300 expressed genes in EC vs. non-EC material. We performed this comparison on both our own TRAP data, as well as TRAP data recently published in Cleuren, et al., 2019. In both our own data, as well as that from Cleuren, et al., there was a low correlation (&lt;0.25), indicating that the ordering of highly expressed genes, of which many are CMF genes, is only poorly correlated in EC vs. non-EC samples. We clarify this important point in the text and new Figure 1B.</p><p>5) “Cell-free RNA sticking to antibodies or beads, or to glycocalyx of the EC cells.” The single cell RNAseq datasets demonstrate this not to be the case, as <italic>only a subset</italic> of ECs contained <italic>only a subset</italic> of CMF genes (most often only one) (Figure 2B). If CMF mRNAs were being captured by ECs (e.g. by positively charged EC glycocalyx), this would be observed in all cells; and even if only a subset of ECs captured CMF mRNAs (e.g. if only some ECs remained covered with glycocalyx) they would capture <italic>all</italic> CMF genes instead of on average only one. In addition, a glycocalyx explanation cannot explain the observations made with ribosome pulldowns, as seen in our data and that of Jambusaria et al., and that of Cleuren et al.</p><p>6) “The chromatin status of other cardiac genes not found in heart EC is of interest”. We agree. Strikingly, the majority of cardiomyocyte-specific genes reveal open chromatin in ECs (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) in particular in promoter regions (Figure 4C). Nevertheless, quantitatively, there are some cardiomyocyte-specific enhancer regions (intronic or intergenic) associated with CMF genes that are not found in endothelial cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). We show a few examples, including an enhancer region upstream of the gene encoding the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5, and an intronic enhancer within the Dmd gene (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Once again, contamination cannot explain these data.</p><p>7) Finally, to provide yet more evidence that the expression of CMF genes in ECs is cell autonomous, we have quantified spliced vs. un-spliced reads, reasoning that if contamination were occurring, few un-spliced CMF mRNAs (i.e. nascent mRNAs) would be detected in ECs. Instead, we find relatively <italic>more</italic> un-spliced CMF mRNAs in ECs (new Figure 2D-E, Supplementary file 2), again supporting the notion that these mRNAs are expressed directly from open chromatin in the ECs themselves.</p><p>In summary, we provide extensive demonstration to address the fundamental question being posed of whether RNAs or DNAs originating from cardiomyocytes are “contaminating” the observed EC-specific RNAseq and ATACseq. We now articulate in the Discussion in more detail the numerous reasons why this cannot be the case, with the following paragraph:</p><p>“(1) Kendall Tau correlations demonstrate lack of correlation between genes highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and those potentially “contaminating” ECs. Were contamination to be occurring, these levels of expression would correlate. […] Thus, if contamination were occurring in this setting, EC chromatin would be, on average, only mildly open (proportional to the level of contamination), because the majority of the signal would still stem from ECs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The RNA scope data was insufficient to determine whether the signals only originate from EC. This needs to be higher resolution and accompanied by antibody staining of EC-specific junction markers to clearly show EC cell borders. It was also suggested that antibodies to the cardiac proteins expressed by EC should be used with EC markers and high-resolution imaging, since the RNAs appear to be abundant (Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We provide new RNAscope data, as suggested, including higher resolution images, and accompanied by antibody staining of EC-specific junction maker Pecam1 (new Figure 3D). Additional images are also provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We find that the proportion of ECs with detectable nuclear Tnnt2 mRNA on RNAscope is nearly identical to the proportion of ECs in the Tabular Muris data that express Tnnt2 (Quantification now moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are numerous places where the methodology is vague, and where approaches and analysis are poorly described or documented.</p></disp-quote><p>Methodologies and explanation of analyses have been expanded to be made more clear throughout.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The RNA scope data is much improved, but some concerns regarding specificity remain.
