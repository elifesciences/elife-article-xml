When propagated in cell lines, certain viruses acquire positively charged amino acids on their surface proteins, enabling them to utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) as an attachment receptor. In this study, we used enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) as the model and demonstrated that, unlike the parental MP4 variant, the cell-adapted strong HS-binder MP4-97R/167 G does not require acidification for uncoating and releases its genome in the neutral or weakly acidic environment of early endosomes. We experimentally confirmed that this pH-independent entry is not associated with the use of HS as an attachment receptor but rather with compromised capsid stability. We then extended these findings to another HS-dependent strain. In summary, our data indicate that the acquisition of capsid mutations conferring affinity for HS comes together with decreased capsid stability and allows EV-A71 to enter the cell via a pH-independent pathway. This pH-independent entry mechanism boosts viral replication in cell lines but may prove deleterious <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially for enteric viruses crossing the acidic gastric environment before reaching their primary replication site, the intestine. Our study thus provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation of HS-binding EV-A71 strains. Not only are these viruses hindered in tissues rich in HS due to viral trapping, as generally accepted, but our research reveals that their diminished capsid stability further contributes to attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic>. This underscores the complex relationship between HS-binding, capsid stability, and viral fitness, where increased replication in cell lines coincides with attenuation in harsh <italic>in vivo</italic> environments like the gastrointestinal tract.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Enterovirus A71</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd><kwd>uncoating</kwd><kwd>virus adaptation</kwd><kwd>virus capsid stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss national foundation </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No 501100001711-10000300 and 501100001711-184777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapparel</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enterovirus A71 adaptation to bind heparan sulfate as receptor comes with compensation that destabilizes its virus capsid.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HS are linear, negatively charged polysaccharides connected to various cell surfaces and extracellular matrix proteins. Expressed on a wide range of cells, they play a pivotal role in various biological processes, and many viruses exploit them to attach and concentrate onto cell surfaces before binding to the main entry receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cagno et al., 2019</xref>). Despite a substantial body of literature on the subject, the actual implication of HS binding on viral infections remains a topic of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cagno et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is an excellent example of the ongoing controversy regarding the impact of HS receptor utilization in viral pathogenesis. This virus is a member of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family and the most neurotropic EV after poliovirus. It causes significant hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries, and is associated with severe neurological complications, notably in small children and immunosuppressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tee et al., 2021</xref>). The virus uses human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2) as the main entry receptor for uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi and Koike, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamayoshi et al., 2013</xref>). Since SCARB2 is mostly localized on endosomal and lysosomal membranes and sparsely on plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi and Koike, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuronita et al., 2002</xref>), it seems to play only a minor role in EV-A71 cell attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, numerous other EV-A71 attachment receptors have been described in the literature, including HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi and Koike, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang et al., 2014</xref>). When propagated in cell culture, EV-A71 rapidly acquires adaptive mutations (i.e. patches of positively charged amino acids on the viral capsid) that allow them to bind HS, sometimes with high avidity. These strong HS-dependent variants grow efficiently in cell culture but show attenuated virulence in animal models, such as mice and cynomolgus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tee et al., 2019</xref>). Analysis of the differential expression of SCARB2 and HS in tissues from monkey or transgenic mice revealed little overlap. Strong HS expression was detected in sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelia, where SCARB2 was not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, HS expression in the brain was mainly found in vascular endothelia but SCARB2 expression was found predominantly in neuronal cells. The authors of these studies concluded that binding to HS on endothelial cells in the absence of SCARB2 leads to viral trapping, abortive infection, and attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Similar observations were shown for other viruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Lobigs, 2002</xref>), Japanese encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Lobigs, 2002</xref>), Sindbis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes and Griffin, 2000</xref>), Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddi and Lipton, 2002</xref>), tick-borne encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandl et al., 2001</xref>), West Nile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) and dengue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1997</xref>). However, epidemiological surveillance of human EV-A71 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>) and experimental evidence from 2D human fetal intestinal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aknouch et al., 2023</xref>), human airway organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Sanden et al., 2018</xref>), and air-liquid interface cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tseligka et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that HS binding may enhance viral replication and virulence in humans. In addition, recent research has shown that EV-A71 can be released and transmitted via cellular extrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moshiri et al., 2023</xref>) or exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), potentially preventing viral trapping of HS-binding strains in the circulation. Further studies are required to evaluate the true impact of HS-binding mutations on the spread and virulence of EV-A71 in both animal models and humans.</p><p>We previously isolated cell-adapted EV-A71 mutants with strong affinity for HS which emerged upon passaging of intermediate HS binders derived from both patient and mouse-adapted MP4 strains in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cordey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). The mutants presented two amino acid changes in the VP1 capsid protein: VP1-L97R mutation in the VP1 BC loop, shown to confer intermediate affinity for HS together with a secondary mutation, VP1-E167G, located in the VP1 EF loop, which significantly strengthened HS binding with reduction of negative charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tseligka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). As previously observed for strong HS-binding variants, we showed that, in contrast to the original mouse-adapted MP4 strain which exhibited virulence in mice, this cell-adapted MP4-97R/167G double mutant was completely attenuated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). In the current study, we used MP4 and MP4-97R/167G mutant as representatives of respectively, weak and strong HS-binders, slow and fast-growing in cell lines and virulent and avirulent in mouse models (as documented previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tseligka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>), to elucidate the consequence of virus adaptation towards HS binding on the viral growth cycle. We demonstrated that these mutations not only increase binding to HS, but also reduce capsid stability, leading to improved uncoating and faster cell internalization in a HS-independent manner. Of note, another strong HS-binder harboring VP1-E145Q substitution also showed decreased capsid stability compared to the wildtype HS-independent variant. These data provide another possible explanation for the <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation of strong HS-binders which may originate from viral trapping but also from decreased capsid stability which would be detrimental to the virus in challenging environments such as the gastrointestinal tract.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lysosomotropic drugs reduce the infectivity of the HS-independent MP4 but enhance the infectivity of the strong HS-binder MP4-97R/167G</title><p>First, we sought to assess whether viruses displaying different dependence on HS exploit different growth cycle pathways. We compared the effect of lysosomotropic drugs, namely hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and bafilomycin A1 (BAF-A1) on MP4 and MP4-97R/167G double mutant. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Vero cells were pre-treated for 1 hr with each drug before infection. These drugs showed no cytotoxic effect at the concentrations used in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Inoculation was then performed for 1 hr in the presence of the drug and inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh drug-free media. To confirm the inhibition of endosomal acidification by the drugs, the presence or absence of acidic lysosomes was assessed by immunostaining of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) and by staining with LysoTracker, a dye specific for acidic compartments. The signal intensity of LysoTracker decreased drastically following treatment with the drugs, confirming the inhibition of endosomal acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The effect of the drugs on viral replication was then compared for the two variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). MP4 infectivity was significantly reduced by both drugs in a dose-dependent manner, while MP4-97R/167G infectivity was in contrast enhanced. These results were confirmed by viral load quantification with real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in RD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>), indicating that drug effects are not cell type-dependent. The different sensitivity of the two variants to acidification inhibitors was more pronounced with HCQ, so we performed a detailed examination of the mechanism of action with this drug.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lysosomotropic drugs inhibit infection by MP4 but not by MP4-97R/167G.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the virus inhibitory assay workflow.

We generated virus stocks labeled with neutral red and performed a neutral red uncoating assay, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, viral stocks were produced in the dark in the presence of neutral red to allow co-encapsidation of the viral genome and the dye within the viral particles. Photoactivation of neutral red causes the dye to cross-link viral genomes to the capsid and block viral uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, upon infection with neutral red-labeled viruses, light exposure only inactivates viruses that have not yet completed uncoating, while viral genomes already released in the cytoplasm remain unaffected. This technique precisely determines the timepoint of viral uncoating. Cells were pre-treated with HCQ and then incubated with neutral red-labeled viruses for 1 hr at 37 °C for infection. Light inactivation was performed at selected timepoints post-infection, and infected cells were quantified 24 hr later by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the absence of HCQ, most viruses had undergone uncoating between 2 and 4 hpi for both variants (30–80% of uncoated viruses for MP4 and 45–90% for MP4-97R/167G, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Quantification of vRNA and capsid colocalization highlighted no significant difference between the two variants at 2 hpi in presence or absence of HCQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, at 4 hpi (prior to the initiation of replication, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), MP4 uncoating appeared to be inhibited by HCQ, as highlighted by a decrease of empty capsids and an increase of capsid/RNA colocalization in presence of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). An opposite effect was observed for MP4-97R/167G, with a reduced capsid/RNA colocalization in the presence of HCQ, indicating that more viruses had undergone uncoating in the presence of HCQ at this time point. Altogether these data indicate that MP4-97R/167G can uncoat at neutral pH and that acidification is instead increasing its replication capacity, while MP4 needs acidic pH to uncoat.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MP4 relies on late endosomes for uncoating, whereas MP4-97R/167G undergoes uncoating in early endosomes</title><p>HCQ is known to inhibit endosomal acidification by accumulating in endosomes in a protonated form. This accumulation leads to endosomal swelling and inhibition of fusion between endosomes and lysosomes within cells, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baradaran Eftekhari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mauthe et al., 2018</xref>) and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We thus hypothesized that the two variants could exploit different entry routes, which could explain the different sensitivity to HCQ. We showed that MP4 needs acidic pH to uncoat and is thus expected to release its RNA in late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, MP4-97R/167G can uncoat in the absence of pH acidification and accordingly in a non-acidic environment. To test this hypothesis, we infected Vero cells transiently expressing a variant of small GTPase Rab5a, a protein involved in the maturation of early endosomes (EE) into late endosomes (LE). This Rab5a-Q79L mutant is constitutively active (CA) and blocks LE maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Viral capsids of MP4 and MP4-97R/167G were observed within EE in both Rab5a WT and CA-expressing cells at 0.5 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 2 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, at 7 hpi, the percentage of cells stained for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker of virus replication, was significantly reduced for MP4 in Rab5a CA-expressing cells but not for MP4-97R/167G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates that MP4-97R/167G genomes were successfully released in the cytoplasm to undergo translation and replication, even in the absence of EE fusion to LE.

We therefore speculated that the varying pH-dependency may be attributed to differences in virion stability. We analyzed the impact of VP1-97R and VP1-167G mutations on their respective local environments at pH 5 and pH 7 with the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bank and Holst, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jurrus et al., 2018</xref>). As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, both L97R and E167G mutations are inducing electrostatic changes at the surface of the capsid within the region of interest and the changes are particularly significant at pH 5. Furthermore, analysis with DynaMut server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>) reveals that the two mutations affect interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The VP1-L97R mutation is predicted to reduce hydrophobic interactions between amino acid 97 and its neighbors VP1-245Y and VP1-246P while the VP1-E167G mutation causes a loss in hydrogen bonding capacity to VP1-165S and reduces the net negative charge. This is consistent with analyses of vibrational entropy change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the presence of two mutations results in enhanced local dynamics, which has previously been correlated with reduced capsid stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chand et al., 2020</xref>).

At acidic pH, there was no notable alteration in the capsid morphology of MP4, which maintained a stable particle diameter of ~31–33 nm across both pH conditions. On the other hand, for MP4-97R/167G, both 2D images and 3D reconstructions highlighted a loss of density at the center of the viral particles, as well as an expansion in size for a subset of particles (diameter ranging from 31 to 41 nm at pH5 versus 31 to 33 nm at pH7), indicating partial virus uncoating. We then performed a temperature sensitivity assay by heating viruses at different temperatures for 1 hr before inoculation on cells.

We observed that MP4-97R/167G but not the MP4 variant lost infectivity upon pre-exposure to sSCARB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We further tested the impact of the uncoating receptor binding by nsEM. MP4 and MP4-97R/167G were incubated with sSCARB2 at pH7.5 for 1 hr and imaged. Based on the inspection of EM images and 2D class-averages of MP4, the percentage of empty capsid particles did not change significantly before and after the incubation with sSCARB2 (&lt;1% in both cases). However, the double mutant exhibited a ~ fivefold increase in empty capsid percentage after treatment with sSCARB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with the functional data above. Altogether, our results confirmed that the MP4-97R/167G mutant is less stable and more sensitive to thermal and acidic stresses as well as receptor binding, which are sufficient triggers to initiate virus capsid disruption and subsequent viral uncoating.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Resistance to HCQ and reduced capsid stability extend to other strong heparan sulfate-binding strains</title><p>To determine if our observations are applicable to human strains, we examined the sensitivity of a closely related clinical strain.

Additionally, we tested a strong HS-binding derivative that harbors the same VP1-L97R and E167G mutations as our MP4 double mutant.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the original human strain was inhibited by HCQ, whereas the double mutant exhibited insensitivity to the drug. We next checked whether our findings could extend to other mutations conferring HS-binding ability. To this end, we used the human EV-A71 strain 41 (5865/SIN/000009, GenBank accession no.

Similarly, for EV-A71, binding to SCARB2 and subsequent endosomal acidification are required for uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we provide new insights on the impact of mutations in the VP1 capsid protein leading to strong HS affinity, on the uncoating process of EV-A71. We show that, unlike the mouse-adapted EV-A71 MP4 strain, the MP4-97R/167G-derived double mutant, which has a high affinity for HS, does not require acidification for uncoating and can release its genome under neutral or weakly acidic environment of early endosomes.</p><p>To demonstrate the importance of acidification on both MP4 and MP4-97R/167G variant uncoating, we used two lysosomotropic drugs, namely BAF-A1 and HCQ, that increase endosomal pH by distinct means. On one hand, BAF-A1 inhibits the vacuolar H+ATPase (V-ATPase), preventing the acidification process and thereby elevating the endosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Redmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mauvezin and Neufeld, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, HCQ, a less toxic derivative of the antimalarial drug chloroquine, acts as a weak base that can be protonated and trapped in the acidic environment of cellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pillat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrezenmeier and Dörner, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to this effect, HCQ can impact other cellular pathways, such as autophagy, a cellular process that has been demonstrated to be induced by EV-A71 to create a favourable environment for its replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). However, we show here that the differential effects on MP4 and MP4-97R/167G occur during the uncoating process rather than in later stages of the cycle, such as virus genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrezenmeier and Dörner, 2020</xref>). Our results thus underline that, despite their distinct modes of action, both HCQ and BAF-A1 influenced virus entry through their effect on endocytic compartments, as both compounds ultimately inhibit the reduction in endosomal pH levels. In addition, the fact that differential sensitivity to HCQ was retained even in cells devoid of HS at their surface by treatment with heparinase or sodium chlorate pointed out that this pH-independent mode of entry of MP4-97R/167G is not linked to the use of HS as an attachment receptor. Interestingly, our experiments using the Rab5a CA to block the transition of EE to acidic LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bucci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serio et al., 2011</xref>), indicate that binding to SCARB2 is sufficient to trigger MP4-97R/167G genome release into the cytosol even in the near neutral pH of the EE (pH ∼6.0–6.5), whereas MP4 requires the acidity of LE and/or lysosomes (pH ∼5.0–5.5) to uncoat efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mercer et al., 2010</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that the two variants exhibit intrinsic differences in capsid stability. We conducted various tests to compare how each variant reacted to heat, sSCARB2, and low pH, and found that MP4-97R/167G was more sensitive to all these conditions. Particularly, we used nsEM to study the properties of viral particles and observed an expansion of MP4-97R/167G capsid following the exposure to pH 5. These data, plus the virus structural dynamics prediction and free energy change computation, all indicate that MP4-97R/167G presents reduced capsid stability compared to MP4.</p><p>One strength of our study lies in the fact that we were able to extend these results to another HS-dependent EV-A71 strain, the VP1-145Q variant. Given that these two HS-dependent variants share the characteristic of having incorporated a less acidic amino acid within the VP1 capsid protein, we hypothesized that an increase in positive charges within the capsid not only enhances affinity for HS but also alters capsid stability, consequently impacting the virus entry mechanism. In the same line, a thermostable EV-A71 variant (VP1-K162E, change of a basic to an acidic residue) isolated from serial passages at higher temperatures was shown to be less efficient at uncoating with poorer cell infectivity but more virulent in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catching et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, this variant showed a more expanded conformation compared to the original non-mutated virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catching et al., 2023</xref>). While the thermostable variant showed no difference in binding to the SCARB2 receptor, the binding affinity to heparin was greatly reduced, an observation consistent with what we noticed for MP4. Additional experiments with cell-adapted, HS-binding viruses will help to define whether HS-binding is always associated with a loss of virion stability and whether these findings could even extend to other groups of viruses. Interestingly, mutations conferring similar <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes were observed for other enteroviruses such as rhinovirus A16 (RV-A16) and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3). For RV-A16, capsid mutations conferring resistance to endosomal acidification inhibitors also abrogated the need for acidic pH for uncoating. More importantly, these mutations were also associated with higher sensitivity to low pH, high temperatures, and binding to soluble receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murer et al., 2022</xref>). For CV-B3, a fast-growing variant was shown to exhibit faster genome release and destabilized capsid, and this led to attenuated virulence in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanahan et al., 2021</xref>). These studies, which report a correlation between capsid instability, earlier uncoating, and attenuation in mouse models align with our findings. This suggests that amino acid changes affecting capsid stability can significantly impact various aspects of the virion and its life cycle, including sensitivity to environmental factors, receptor interactions, and infection rates.</p><p>In the light of these published studies and our data, we propose the following model depicting the relationship between HS-binding, capsid stability, and viral fitness <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Viruses undergo mutations and positive selection to adapt to different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LaTourrette and Garcia-Ruiz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andino and Domingo, 2015</xref>). EV-A71 can take advantage of the high plasticity of its capsid to optimize its fitness upon environmental changes. Many strains adapt to use HS <italic>in vitro</italic> due to the abundant expression of this attachment receptor in cell lines. To do so, they usually acquire additional positively charged amino acids within outward-facing VP1 domains proximal to the capsid fivefold axis. In addition to help the virus to attach to the cell surface and find SCARB2, we show here that these mutations concomitantly decrease virion stability. This further contributes to higher multiplication in cell lines by triggering uncoating rapidly after internalisation, within EE, without the need for acidic pH. Interestingly in our experiments, acidification inhibitors improved rather than inhibited viral fitness of MP4-97R/167G. Although additional experiments are required to define the mechanism behind this observation, it could occur via the protection of virions that have not yet been uncoated when endosomes fuse with lysosomes. In this context, the absence of acidification would improve the chance of these virions to release their genome in the cytoplasm, while exposure to acidic pH would induce viral opening within the late endosomes. The situation may differ significantly <italic>in vivo</italic> as strong HS binders are attenuated. Koike and colleagues have demonstrated that strong binding to HS induces virus trapping <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). Our data suggest that the associated decreased stability may further contribute to viral attenuation. To be virulent <italic>in vivo</italic>, a non-enveloped virus must have a sufficiently stable capsid to resist unfavourable environmental conditions, both during dissemination within a host and during transmission between hosts. This last point is particularly important for EV-A71, which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and must, therefore, resist the acidic pH of the stomach before reaching the intestinal mucosa, its main multiplication site. Capsid stability thus ensures that virus genome release occurs only in a proper environment, but in turn, renders the virus dependent on both SCARB2 and acidic pH for uncoating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Seesaw model depicting the interplay between capsid mutations, heparan sulfate-binding, capsid stability as well as the resulting fitness changes in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings.</title><p>Viruses undergo continuous mutations to optimize fitness across diverse environments. In cell culture, they adapt to attain an ‘<italic>in vitro</italic> advantage’ by decreasing capsid stability while acquiring HS-binding capacity, consequently enhancing their infectivity. Conversely, during human infection, viruses adapt to secure an ‘<italic>in vivo</italic> advantage’ by bolstering capsid stability, relinquishing heparan sulfate (HS)-binding capacity, and thereby evading viral trapping and resisting environmental stresses.

Experimental work in human-relevant tissue culture models also suggests that binding to HS provides an advantage to the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aknouch et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Sanden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tseligka et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we previously showed that intermediate HS-binding affinity can result in increased virulence even in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). We are currently investigating if there is a lack of trapping and/or limited impact on viral stability under these conditions. To conclude, to reach optimal fitness <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the virus needs to find the correct balance between HS binding and capsid stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our study improves the current knowledge of the mechanism behind the <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation of cell culture-adapted viruses. It also opens the doors to new antiviral strategies targeting endosomal acidification as well new principles for vaccine design based on attenuated-acid-independent variants to help combat EV-A71.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Particles were extracted from micrographs and subjected to 2D classification. 3D reconstruction was performed using Ab initio algorithm with icosahedral symmetry imposed. For experiments at pH 5 where the expanded viral particles were observed, the Ab initio reconstruction was performed without the imposition of symmetry (i.e. C1). For imaging the virus in complex with SCARB2, the virus was combined with 1:1 molar ratio of SCARB2 to the viral P1 protomer and diluted to 100 µg/ml with Tris-Acetate-based buffer at pH 5 or pH 7.5 as mentioned earlier.

Our interpretation of the data does not go beyond the resolution limit of this method (~20 Å). Further, map reconstruction was performed using the Ab-initio algorithm and without providing any reference model (with or without imposition of icosahedral symmetry, depending on the sample) (see new version of Figure 5B). Therefore, we believe that the use of reconstructed 3D maps from negative stain EM images is appropriate under these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, the large size of the full capsid has forced us to extract only a subpart of it (a capsid pentamer), in order to set up a system realistically treatable (~468 K atoms for the solvated system). This approach suffers from the fact that we do not model the full capsid, and thus some parts of the capsid lack the proper molecular environment. The truncated model of the capsid highlighted, within the limited timescale sampled, no indications of significant changes due to temperature, pH and mutational effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, we can conclude that if a correlation exists between these conditions and capsid stability, this happens on longer timescales and/or depends on additional factors still poorly understood.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamic simulations of a subpart (corresponding to a capsid pentamer) of the wild type VP1 capsid (a) and the L97R-E167G mutated version (b), each at pH 5 and 7 and at 37°C (310K) and 50°C (323K).</title><p>The extraction of the subpart and the lack of physical constraints around the external-facing regions are inducing artificial moves during the simulation, and preventing its convergence, as witnessed by the high variability of root mean square deviations (RMSDs).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98441-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Methodology: We set up simulations at different pH (5 and 7) and at different temperatures (37°C and 50°C), each during 200ns using GROMACS (Bekker <italic>et al.</italic>, Physics computing, 1993; Abraham <italic>et al.</italic>, SoftwareX, 2015). Due to the large size of the viral capsid, only a subpart of it was simulated. A manual cut around the region of interest was performed, reducing the size of the studied system while giving some sufficient margin to observe the mutations sites, resulting in a complex with 49’905 atoms (468’455 atoms after generating the solvation box).</p><p>We set up the system with CHARMM force field and used TIP3P water as solvent. We performed one minimization step for 20 ps, with an energy tolerance of 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm. We employed the Verlet cut-off scheme, treated long-range electrostatics using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method, and applied constraints on all bonds involving hydrogen atoms using the LINCS algorithm. Following minimization, we performed the equilibration in five steps. The first two steps were performed for 1 ns each, using a 1 fs time step. The subsequent three steps utilized a 2 fs time step for 500 ps each. Throughout the equilibration, we maintained position restraints on the protein. We used the Nose-Hoover thermostat for temperature coupling, with the system gradually heated to the target temperature. From the second step onward, we introduced pressure coupling using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat, set to 1.0 bar with isotropic pressure coupling. We still employed the Verlet cut-off scheme for non-bonded interactions and the Particle Mesh Ewald method for long-range electrostatics and applied the LINCS algorithm to constrain hydrogen-containing bonds. After equilibration, we performed the production MD simulation for 200 ns using a 2 fs time step. The system temperature was maintained at the target temperature using the Nose-Hoover thermostat, while pressure was kept at 1.0 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat with isotropic coupling. We continued to use the Verlet cut-off scheme, the Particle Mesh Ewald method and the LINCS algorithm. Trajectory data, including coordinates, velocities, and forces, were saved every 100 ps for subsequent analysis. Results were compiled and analyzed using the Python package MDAnalysis ([Gowers <italic>et al.</italic>, Sci Py, 2016; Michaud-Agrawal <italic>et al.</italic>, J. Comput. Chem. 2011]). The structural cut performed to make the system simulable had a strong impact on the overall stability, inducing important artificial moves throughout the entire system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, any distinction between the entry pathway of variants needs to be considered.</p><p>The entry pathway of the L97R/E167G variant, in light of enhanced infectivity under elevated endosomal pH, requires more probing.

This suggests that the 97R/167G variant’s reduced capsid stability needs a single trigger (acidic pH or SCARB2 binding in the endosome) to start uncoating. However, we do not think that there is a risk for MP4 97R/167G to uncoat at neutral pH outside the cell. Indeed, several recent studies have highlighted that SCARB2 is localized primarily in lysosome membrane (Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Kuronita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002). Furthermore, EV-A71 does not seem to bind this protein to attach to host cells (Nishimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024; Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). We also observed this with a human EV-A71 variant and a derivative with the same two mutations (Tseligka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Weng <italic>et al.,</italic> 2023), as these two variants bind as efficiently wild-type or SCARB2 CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Therefore, the unstable MP4 97R/167G variant will not bind SCARB2 before endocytosis, and uncoating should not start before the virus reaches endosomes, where SCARB2 and viral particles come in close proximity.</p><p>Finally, in cells treated with heparinase to deplete HS, or in Caco-2 cells known to have low HS levels, both variants exhibit similar binding in presence or absence of SCARB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In addition, as shown in the manuscript, MP4-97R/167G demonstrates enhanced cell binding due to its higher affinity for HS (manuscript Figure 2A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), but HCQ does not impact virus binding, and HCQ effect on viral replication persists even after HS removal or inhibition of cell sulfation by sodium chlorate treatment (manuscript Figure 1C and Figure 2A). Altogether these findings rule out the hypothesis that the differential sensitivity of the two variants to lysosomotropic drugs is related to different interactions with SCARB2 or HS at the cell surface.</p><p>To conclude, our data demonstrate that mutations involved in conferring affinity for HS can in parallel and independently decrease capsid stability and favor pH independent uncoating. However, we did not investigate further the precise entry route for MP4-97R/167G, as we believe that this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Binding of (a) EV71-VP1-97R167G and (b) EV71-VP-97L167E in RD and Caco-2 cells with and without SCARB2 (Cas9 CRISPR KO using two different guide RNAs, g1 and g2) and/or HS expression (heparinase treatment).</title><p>Viral loads were measured by RT-qPCR in whole cell extracts and are expressed as the mean ± SEM.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98441-sa2-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The MP4 particle and the variants can be subjected to Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to understand the difference in stability and for semi-quantification of the difference among variants.

In contrast, MP4-97R/167G shows reduced stability at lower pH. However, the results are difficult to interpret due to the odd shape of the curves for the double mutant. These varying peak depths could stem from intrinsic characteristics of the mutant virus (presence of mixed states of the particles throughout the assay due to lower stability). For this reason, we decided not to include these results in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>PaSTRy assay was performed by incubating virus in citrate phosphate buffer adjusted to pH7 and pH5.</title><p>Viral RNA release from capsid was detected using SYBR green II dye when the virus capsid was heating gradually with temperature increase of 1°C from 25°C to 95 °C.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98441-sa2-fig3-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Instead, we performed additional <italic>in silico</italic> stability analysis using several methods.

The MP4 particles do not seem to form A or B particles even at pH 5.0, will this happen with a conjunction of receptor binding and low pH?</p></disp-quote><p>As EV-A71 is known to bind poorly to SCARB2 at the cell surface (see response to previous comment), it is thus difficult to compare the effect of SCARB2 binding at neutral and acidic pH. We would like to note that, as indicated in the literature, incubation at acidic pH is necessary for performing cryoEM of the EV-A71/SCARB2 complex. Previous studies have also required the use of a mutated EV-A71 strain and the addition of an expansion inhibitor (Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). This suggests that the interaction with SCARB2 is very unstable in standard conditions and also that the virus may quickly detach after binding. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer comment, we conducted nsEM of MP4 incubated with soluble SCARB2 for 30 min at neutral or acidic pH. We could not find evidence that SCARB2 and MP4 form stable complexes. Based on the analysis of 2D classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), particles appear smooth and free of any density on the surface. However, we did observe an increase in the number of empty capsids following the incubation with SCARB2 at pH 5 compared to pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). These data suggest that other triggers occur in the lysosomal compartment to promote genome release in the host cytoplasm.

To address the reviewer comment, we have performed Ab initio reconstruction of these particles without imposing symmetry (i.e., C1).

The hyphen (-) in line 46 between Enterovirus and A71 must be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have implemented this change consistently throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A few references are missing in the introduction or some statements may be based on earlier or later references but this is not immediately evident (e.g. line 45 and line 47).</p></disp-quote><p>The missing references have been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please adjust line 52 and others where SCARB2 is suggested to be important for internalization. It can be referred to as an entry receptor as uncoating is demonstrably an entry step. Alternatively, refer to it as the uncoating receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have introduced this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lines 59-63 are a summary of another study but given the lack of contextualization to the human data this should be removed and/or the human data should be better incorporated in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional references have been included to provide better context in relation to the human data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please add the quantification of Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the quantification data; however, for clarity and because these are control experiments, we have moved them to the Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 153 states that MP4 uncoating was completely blocked but this is not true from Figure 3B. Please adjust.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text according to the reviewer comment. The sentence &quot;completely blocked&quot; has been changed to &quot;greatly inhibited&quot; on page 5, line 164 to accurately reflect the data presented in Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The MOI used for the different experiments is not clear. Please mention this in the figure captions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the MOI used for the different experiments as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Please perform statistical analysis on Figure 2F.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the statistical analysis accordingly and added the P value on the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Please provide the individual panels for some of the fluorescence images such as 1B and 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the individual panels for these fluorescent images (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and revised Figure 3C, respectively) as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Please provide a set of representative images corresponding to Figure 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the representative images for this figure in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In the discussion, it is stated that existing literature aligns with the findings. However, this is existing literature on mice but not humans which is in contrast. Please adjust this section based on the comments above.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have modified this sentence to clarify, and we now provide more details on the differences between observations in animal models and human in the conclusion paragraph (page 9, lines 332-336 and 364-376):</p><p>“These studies, which report a correlation between capsid instability, earlier uncoating, and attenuation in mouse models aligns with our findings. This suggests that amino acid changes affecting capsid stability can significantly impact various aspects of the virion and its life cycle, including sensitivity to environmental factors, receptor interactions, and infection rates.”</p><p>“Of note, although strong HS-binder are clearly attenuated in mice, the situation in humans is more puzzling as strains with Q or G at position VP1-145 have been associated with severe neurological cases and the methodology used in those studies excluded emergence of mutation during cell culture<sup>19,20</sup>. Experimental work in human relevant tissue culture models also suggest that binding to HS provides an advantage to the virus<sup>22-24</sup>. Furthermore, we previously showed that intermediate HS-binding affinity can result in increased virulence even in mouse models<sup>28</sup>. We are currently investigating if there is a lack of trapping and/or limited impact on viral stability under these conditions. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In line 330, it is stated that the pH of the gastrointestinal tract is acidic. However, this is not true for the entirety of the GI tract and some parts are close to neutral pH.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text by changing &quot;gastrointestinal tract&quot; to &quot;stomach&quot; on page 10, line 360.</p></body></sub-article></article>
