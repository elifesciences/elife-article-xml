in the patterning of epithelial structures. Here, we examine how HH controls SMO subcellular localization and activity in a polarized epithelium using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc as a model. We provide evidence that HH promotes the stabilization of SMO by switching its fate after endocytosis toward recycling. This effect involves the sequential and additive action of protein kinase A, casein kinase I, and the Fused (FU) kinase. Moreover, in the presence of very high levels of HH, the second effect of FU leads to the local enrichment of SMO in the most basal domain of the cell membrane. Together, these results link the morphogenetic effects of HH to the apico-basal distribution of SMO and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of a GPCR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>smoothened</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>apico-basal polarity</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut des sciences biologiques</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonçalves Antunes</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanial</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Contremoulins</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Plessis</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Becam</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JA20191209287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plessis</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EurGene</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonçalves Antunes</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universite de Paris Cité</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonçalves Antunes</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hedgehog leads to Smoothened accumulation by favoring its recycling and high Hedgehog levels promote a basolateral enrichment of Smoothened via its phosphorylation by the protein kinase Fused.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, signaling pathways control epithelial morphogenesis by acting on cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. Epithelial cells uniquely display an apico-basal (Ap-Ba) polarity with differential distribution of phospholipids and protein complexes between the different membrane domains (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikenouchi, 2018</xref>). This leads to functionally separated subregions with distinct properties and physiological functions, such as the microvilli in the apical domain, cell-cell adhesion junctions in the lateral domain, and cell-matrix adhesion in the basal domain. Finally, the apical and basal regions are in contact with extracellular environments, which can differ in the nature and dose of signaling molecules. For all these reasons, the control of signaling receptor distribution among these specific subdomains of the plasma membrane is expected to be critical for correct signal transduction.</p><p>The conserved hedgehog (HH) signals play major roles in the development of metazoans. Initially identified in the fly model, HH signaling is involved in the promotion, development, and/or metastasis of numerous types of tumors and drugging this pathway is a major goal for cancer therapies (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingham, 2022</xref>). In flies, HH controls the patterning of many structures including the wing imaginal disc (WID), which has been instrumental in the study of HH signaling (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartl and Scott, 2014</xref>). In this epithelial structure, HH emanating from the posterior (P) cells signals to the anterior (A) cells near the A/P boundary, thus controlling the expression of target genes in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, HH molecules form two gradients in the WID: an apical gradient, required for long-range, ‘low HH’ responses (as in the expression of <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> [<italic>dpp</italic>]) that depend on glypicans, and a basal one, for short-distance, ‘high HH’ responses (as in the anterior expression of <italic>engrailed</italic> [<italic>en</italic>]), that is based on the transport of HH by exosomes associated to filopodia-like structures oriented in the A/P axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Angelo et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>HH transduction requires Smoothened (SMO), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) like protein. In the absence of HH, the HH co-receptor Patched (PTC) inhibits SMO, probably by depleting accessible cholesterol from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinnebrew et al., 2021</xref> and see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>), which promotes the formation of a repressor form of the transcription factor cubitus interruptus (CI). The binding of HH to PTC inhibits its negative effect, which blocks the cleavage of CI, leading to the transcription of pathway target genes by full-length CI. SMO acts as a scaffold to transduce HH signaling to CI via an intracellular complex (called HTC for HH Transduction Complex) bound to its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, which includes CI and a protein kinase called Fused (FU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malpel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robbins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sisson et al., 1997</xref>). SMO activation is associated with conformational switches, both in its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain and in its extracellular domains; these events correlate with its clustering, which seems critical for the downstream activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Su et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several labs—including ours—have highlighted the role of endocytic trafficking and the importance of post-translational modifications in the regulation of SMO’s levels, localization, and activation. SMO activation in the presence of HH is associated with changes in its localization: from internal vesicles to the plasma membrane in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and from the cell body to the primary cilium in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denef et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>). Both events are positively controlled by extensive phosphorylation of SMO’s intracellular tail by multiple kinases (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Jiang, 2013</xref>). Despite significant differences, the processes involved are remarkably conserved as illustrated by the fact that human SMO can be relocalized in response to HH to the surface of fly cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Rivoyre et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, many kinases (protein kinase A [PKA], casein kinase I [CKI], GPCR kinase 2, casein kinase 2, Gilgamesh, atypical protein kinase C [aPKC]) are implicated, which regulate SMO activation and accumulation at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apionishev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). We have also identified a phosphorylation-based positive feedback loop between SMO and the FU kinase, which is required for the response to the highest doses of HH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 1998</xref>). In this process, the initial activation of SMO promotes the recruitment at the cell membrane of FU and its activation, which then further phosphorylates SMO, leading to an enhanced accumulation of the SMO/FU complex at the cell surface and high signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanial et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Are these events polarized along the Ap-Ba axis and what is their link with the gradients of HH? Previous studies indicated that SMO is unevenly distributed along the Ap-Ba axis of the WID epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denef et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanial et al., 2017</xref>). Here, by specifically labeling the population of SMO at the plasma membrane, we show that it is unevenly distributed along the Ap-Ba axis and that HH acts in a dose-dependent manner to increase its accumulation in the most basal region. Blocking the endocytosis of SMO or following its fate after endocytosis, reveal that SMO is initially targeted to the apical membrane and that HH does not dramatically affect its apical endocytosis but affects its post-endocytic fate, favoring recycling over degradation. Moreover, we provide evidence that the HH-dependent basolateral enrichment of SMO relies on a two-step action of the FU kinase, first apically to enhance SMO localization at the cell surface before stabilizing it in the basolateral region. Altogether, these data support a model which connects the HH-dose-dependent activation of SMO to its vesicular trafficking and Ap-Ba localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High levels of HH promote a basolateral enrichment of cell surface SMO</title><p>As HH promotes the accumulation of SMO at the plasma membrane, we set out to determine (i) whether the population of SMO that is present at the cell surface is differentially distributed along the Ap-Ba axis and (ii) whether its Ap-Ba distribution is affected by HH. For that purpose, a fusion between the extracellular N-terminus of SMO and the enzymatic self-labeling SNAP-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tirat et al., 2006</xref>), called SNAP-SMO, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanial et al., 2017</xref>) was overexpressed in the dorsal compartment of the WID (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’</xref> for the organization of this disc).

Of note, for overexpressed SNAP-SMO, the basal population of endogenous SMO or SNAP-SMO expressed at endogenous levels is increased in the presence of hedgehog (HH). However, although both are present in the apical region, they do not strongly accumulate in this region as observed with overexpressed SNAP-SMO (compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold>).

Strikingly, the increased accumulation of SNAP-SMO in the cells in which HH signaling is activated is particularly visible in the lateral section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>) and even more in the basal section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B”</xref>) than in the apical region of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This basolateral enrichment is also highlighted in the reconstituted antero-posterior XZ sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’, C and C’’</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the effects of HH on Surf SNAP-SMO levels and distribution, we measured (using XZ projections of eight sections) both its mean intensity (sum of pixel values over the number of pixels) and the integrated density (sum of pixel values) in three regions along the Ap-Ba axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>): (i) the apical region, estimated here as the 15% most apical region based on Discs large (DLG) staining of the septate junctions, (ii) the basal region, arbitrarily defined as being the 10% most basal part, and (iii) the lateral or intermediate region in between the two others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since HH acts as a morphogen in the wing disc, we performed these quantifications in four regions across the wing disc epithelium, based on the co-immunodetection of the transcription factor CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’ and C”</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>): the P compartment (green, where CI is not expressed) and three anterior regions: (i) the CI-R region (red, corresponding to the FA region), where CI is processed into its shorter repressor form that is not detectable with the antibody used here, (ii) the CI-F region (pink), corresponding to cells that receive medium to low levels of HH that lead to the stabilization of full-length CI, and (iii) the CI-A region (purple), which corresponds to the cells nearer to the A/P border, where CI-F is very active (and called CI-A) but present at low levels due to the repression of <italic>ci</italic> by the anterior expression of <italic>en</italic> promoted by high HH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roberto et al., 2022</xref>). The comparison of the mean intensities of Surf SNAP-SMO in these four regions shows that HH progressively increases the levels of SNAP-SMO, with Surf SNAP-SMO being 1.7-fold more abundant in the P region than in the CI-R region (p-value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, gray columns). These effects are seen in all the regions along the Ap-Ba axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the light, medium, and dark blue colors correspond to the apical, lateral, and basal regions, respectively). However, the calculation of the relative intensities of SNAP-SMO (calculated as the ratio of the integrated density of each region along the Ap-Ba axis over the integrated density of the three regions together, called column) shows that this increase in SNAP-SMO levels is unequal along the Ap-Ba axis, with a relative decrease in the apical fraction associated with a relative enrichment of the lateral and basal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, a similar increase in the basolateral localization of SMO in the anterior region abutting the A/P and the P regions is also seen for immunolabeled endogenous SMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, A”, B</xref>), or when we labeled Surf SNAP-SMO expressed at an endogenous level from a BAC construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, C”</xref>). Note that when we also specifically labeled the intracellular fraction of SNAP-SMO, neither its levels nor its Ap-Ba distribution was affected by HH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, A”’, D, D’, E</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that these changes in the Ap-Ba distribution of Surf SNAP-SMO were indeed due to HH, we performed the same experiment when the HH function was inactivated.

These effects are seen both in the presence (P region) and absence (FA region) of HH but are slightly weaker in its presence.

After the chase, the subcellular localization of Surf labeled SNAP-SMO shifted: its presence at the cell surface decreases, and this is associated with increased localization in dot-like structures that likely correspond to endocytic vesicles as some of them colocalize with RAB7, an endosomal marker required for the trafficking between late endosomes and the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, A’, A”, B, B’, B”</xref>).

Endocytosed SMO can then be sent to the lysosome for degradation (vesicle on the left with gray membrane), recycled to the apical membrane, or transcytosed to the basolateral membrane (represented in blue), where it can, in turn, be re-endocytosed (followed by recycling or degradation). HH controls several of these steps via the graded action of the proteing kinase A (PKA)/casein kinase I (CKI) and Fused (FU) kinases. The double arrow represents the diffusion of SMO in the basolateral plasma membrane. In absence of HH (left panel), a large fraction of endocytosed SMO is targeted for degradation at the expense of its recycling (reduced recycling is indicated by gray arrows). In that situation, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SMO is not phosphorylated and adopts a closed, inactive conformation. Conversely, in presence of HH (see middle and right panels) the degradation of endocytosed SMO is reduced (gray arrows), in favor of its recycling (green arrows), especially in the basolateral region. These effects of HH lead to an increased accumulation of SMO at the cell surface and require the phosphorylation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SMO by the PKA/CKI. This triggers a change in the conformation of this region, which is associated with the activation of SMO. In the presence of intermediate levels of HH (middle panel), SMO accumulation and/or activation reaches a threshold that in turn activates FU, which then retroacts on SMO, further enhancing the stabilizing and activating effects of the PKA/CKI kinases. The fact that FU is required for that effect in the apical region, suggests that the PKA/CKI also acts in this domain. In the presence of high levels of HH (right panel), FU is further activated and promotes the enrichment of SMO in the most basal region by phosphorylating its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which likely increases its clustering. This favors SMO’s trapping in the most basal region, which leads to high levels of HH signaling. The green arrow on the bottom right corner indicates a putative diffusion trapping mechanism, the gray bottom arrow indicates that recycling may be subsequently reduced.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79843-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The stabilization of SMO induced by HH could result from a reduction of its internalization or of its degradation after internalization. Our results indicate SMO endocytosis is little affected by HH and that HH acts on endocytosed SMO, shifting its fate toward recycling rather than degradation. This involves the phosphorylation of SMO by the PKA/CKI, whose effects are further enhanced by a secondary action of FU. Notably, phosphorylation of the β-adrenergic receptor by the PKA has also been shown to increase its recycling to promote its resensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardner et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have previously provided evidence for a double positive SMO-FU feedback loop behind ‘high HH’ signaling: FU recruitment at the plasma membrane by SMO leads to the first level of FU activation, which in turn further activates SMO, which further increases FU activation. Here, tethering of FU to the apical membrane—but not to the basolateral one—is sufficient to ectopically promote both the stabilization of SMO at the cell membrane and the activation of low/medium HH targets. However, in contrast to what is seen in presence of very high levels of HH or when SMO is fully hyperphosphorylated (SMO<sup>PKA-SD FU-SD</sup>), apical FU does not promote high levels of HH signaling and does not lead to a basal enrichment of SMO. Together, these data support the existence of the second effect of FU on SMO, which would occur in the basolateral region and lead to a basal accumulation of SMO, promoting very high HH signaling. Note that the aPKC was also reported to positively modulate SMO activity and to favor (directly or indirectly) its basolateral localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). However, contrarily to the phosphorylation of SMO by FU, the phosphorylation by the aPKC does not seem to affect the ‘high HH’-dependent basal localization of SMO, nor ‘high HH’ signaling.</p><p>Although the entire basolateral membrane is overall considered as a unique membrane domain in which proteins and lipids freely diffuse, many examples of membrane subregionalization exist (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trimble and Grinstein, 2015</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that hyperactivated SMO can be enriched in the most basal region. It could in part be due to a partial reduction of its basal endocytosis (as suggested by our experiments), but it likely also involves other mechanisms that were shown to restrain the localization of transmembrane proteins (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trimble and Grinstein, 2015</xref>). For instance, it could involve an active oriented displacement of endocytic vesicles carrying SMO and FU directly to the basal domain by the kinesin COS2, which is known to be required for high HH signaling and to transport SMO and FU along microtubules in cultured fly cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farzan et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, diffusion trapping or partitioning phenomena (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trimble and Grinstein, 2015</xref>) are also known to lead to local protein enrichment, for instance in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashby et al., 2006</xref>). Here, the changes in SMO electrostatic charges, conformation, and/or clustering, which result from its hyperphosphorylation, could favor such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism leading to this basal subpopulation of SMO, our data show that its presence is correlated to high levels of SMO activation and the basal gradient of HH. Although we cannot exclude that this basal localization is a consequence rather than a cause of SMO activation, for instance, a desensitization mechanism, our data along with published results strongly suggest that it is crucial to promote high HH signaling. Indeed, our results strongly connect SMO basal localization to its ‘high activation’ as: (i) high HH leads to SMO basal localization, (ii) the phosphorylation of SMO by FU is required for both SMO basal accumulation and its highest level of signaling activity, and (iii) on the contrary blocking FU in the apical region reduces both events. We propose that in presence of high levels of HH, SMO could be trapped in basal specialized lipid microdomains that enhance signaling, similarly to what has been shown for the regulation of several GPCR by lipids rafts (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villar et al., 2016</xref>). This possibility is supported by many reports showing that both in flies and in mammals SMO responds to changes in its lipid environment (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) with an emerging key role of accessible cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinnebrew et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> WID cells, SMO also was shown to relocalize in response to HH to cholesterol-rich raft lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane, where it forms higher-order structures (e.g. oligomers) that are required for high HH signaling, but the Ap-Ba localization of these rafts was not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Such microdomains could constitute signaling platforms acting on SMO structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>) enhancing the oligomerization of SMO and the HTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2011</xref>) and /or the interaction of SMO with specific HH signaling protein(s) (as seen with the EvC proteins in the cilia, see below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>]).</p><p>Several lines of evidence point toward the conservation of a diffusion-trapping mechanism that would lead to the activation of SMO via its subcompartmentalization in specific membrane domains of the plasma membrane. Indeed, in response to Sonic HH, the entry of SMO in the primary cilium of mammalian cells, which also depends on its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Jiang, 2013</xref>), was shown to involve the lateral diffusion of SMO from the cell body into the cilium membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milenkovic et al., 2009</xref>) and is followed by its spatial restriction in a ciliary distinct compartment named the EvC zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). This involves the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of SMO with two components of this zone, EvC and EvC2, both acting downstream of SMO to alleviate the negative effects exerted by the Suppressor of FU (SUFU). In that respect, it is worth noting, that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> WID, the negative effects of SUFU need to be suppressed by FU for high ‘HH signaling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and genetics</title><p>All <italic>smo</italic> transgenes, except for the <italic>BAC (CH322-98K24) SNAP-smo,</italic> which was introduced at the landing site 9725 on 3 R (at 75A10), were introduced into the landing site (9738) on 3 R (at 99F8), using the PhiC31 integration system to ensure that they are expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2006</xref>) by BestGene Inc the <italic>fu<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutant was generated by inDroso functional genomics using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The flies were kept at 25°C with three exceptions: for <italic>shibire</italic><sup>ts</sup> experiments, the flies were kept at 18°C before being switched, at the third instar larval stage, to 30°C for 30 min; for <italic>rab5<sup>CA</sup></italic> and <italic>hh<sup>ts2</sup></italic> experiments, flies were kept at 18°C for 7 to 8 days before being switched to 29°C for 24 hr.</p><p>For the genotypes of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains used here, see Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>WID SNAP labeling</title><p>For surface labeling: third instar larvae were dissected in Shields and Sang M3 Insect cell complete medium and incubated for 10 min at 25°C (or at 29°C for <italic>BAC (CH322-98K24) SNAP-smo</italic> experiments and 30°C for <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> experiments) with the SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor (NEB) in complete medium, then fixed 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed three times 10 min in PBS + 0.3% Triton (PBST).

Firstly, the macro determines the shape and limits of the disc. It then asks the user to select a point in the disc (selected at the A/P boundary) from which rectangular regions from apical to basal, with the same width, will be drawn across the disc. Following this, each region is divided into three smaller ones: the apical/subapical, lateral, and basal subregions. The macro considers apical/subapical and basal subregions to be 15% and 10%, respectively, of the disc’s thickness. The 15% value was fixed based on the immunostaining of the septate junctions by DLG. The 10% value is arbitrary and based on image analysis. The macro proceeds to measure the raw integrated density and the mean density of the different regions. Finally, with the help of CI immunostaining, four regions are selected across the disc (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) to do the quantification. For macro description, see Appendix 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics and data representation</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.

The phenotypes under study are subtle – we're talking about a shift of a few percent of Smo from the most apical region to basal. The work appears to have been carefully done, though, with sufficient replicates to allow these small differences to be detected using statistics. However, many of the conclusions are based on a subsequent comparison of the differences of differences (e.g. &quot;a reduction of 46% in the far anterior cells but of only 25% in the posterior cells&quot; p. 9). Given the magnitude of the uncertainty (standard deviation) in the individual measurements, it's not always clear that these differences between the differences are really significant, and this is not tested statistically. In light of the subtlety of some of the effects, applying a statistical analysis to these comparisons would strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now statistically compared the % of decrease in Surf SNAP-SMO between t0 and t15 (calculated as (t0-t15)/t0) in the FA (-HH) and P regions (+HH). This confirms the significance of these comparison. This comparison is shown in the Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, C’.</p><p>Concerning the shi<sup>ts</sup> experiments, we removed the part on comparing the % (lines 147 to 153) as it was unnecessary long, and the effects presented in the graph C were sufficient and statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The images in Figure 1 show a pronounced enrichment of total SNAP-Smo in the apical domain of both far A and P cells, which is not seen when staining for endogenous Smo (shown in Supplement). This could give a bit of a misleading impression about the &quot;normal&quot; distribution of Smo, which is more uniform. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now built a transgenic line carrying a <italic>smo</italic> BAC construct in which we inserted a SNAP tag at the exact same position than in the <italic>UAS SNAP-smo</italic> construct. We show that this construction is fully functional (now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 A, B-B”, see also text lines 114-116). Labelling of Surf SNAP-SMO expressed in this condition is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3C-C”, see also text lines 158-159. No strong apical enrichment is seen. As SNAP-SMO is initially targeted to the apical membrane before being endocytosed, a possibility is that apical endocytosis might be a limiting step when high amounts of SNAP-SMO are synthetized, leading to its apical accumulation. However, SNAP-SMO expressed for the BAC at endogenous levels is -as the case for endogenous SMO and overexpressed Surf-SNAP-SMO-, enriched in the basolateral region of the cells in the Ci-A and P regions, which is the main subject of this work. Note that we could not correctly quantify these images due to a low signal to noise ratio and strong photobleaching, which prevented us from doing Z stacks.</p><p>We now also show that endogenous SMO and SNAP-SMO expressed from the BAC at endogenous levels are also initially targeted to the apical region where they are endocytosed in a RAB5 dependent manner, indicating that (SNAP-SMO overexpression does not affect its apical targeting nor its apical endocytosis). This is now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1G-G”, H-H”. See also the text lines 201-204.</p><p>Altogether these results strongly validate the use of this UAS <italic>SNAP-smo</italic> construct.</p><p>See also the response to reviewer 2, point 1 p8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Although everything is quantified, in a couple of cases the quantification doesn't seem to match the eye test based on what is shown in the images, or the staining is inconsistent from figure to figure. Can the authors comment on the following points?</p><p>3A. The graph in S1D' shows no difference in intracellular SNAP-Smo mean intensity distribution between FA and P cells. In the matching image in Figure 1D', it looks a lot like intracellular Smo levels are much lower in P and Hh-responding A cells than in far A cells – both in the number of Smo+ punctae and in their staining intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We apologize for what is an error in the images frame and we now provide the images with a larger section of the P region and with the Ci staining that allows identification of the different regions. See Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,D’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3B. The differences in surface SNAP-Smo distribution in far A (apical dot like structures, presumably endocytic vesicles) versus P cells (on membranes, fewer vesicles) shown in Fig, 1C and Dare not consistent in other staining’s of the same genotype (e.g. Figure 2A, Figure 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>Some differences reflect the biological variation from one disc to another, which justifies the importance of systematic quantification. In this case, the estimated average intensity of SNAP-SMO labeling was determined after quantification of Z projections, each composed of eight sections, from between 10 and 23 discs and provides more robust information than a single image.</p><p>Moreover, we have now also compared the apico-basal distribution of SNAP-SMO in the experiments quantified for the Figures 1 and 4 and this confirms that the apico-basal distribution of SNAP-SMO is in fact very reproducible. We have added this data as Figure 4—figure supplement 1E.</p><p>Note also that some comparisons are not equivalent, such as the comparison between (i) Z projection and Z sections, (ii) experiments done at different temperature (Figure 2 compared to Figures 1, 3 and 4), and now (iii) experiment done with different confocals as the confocal Zeiss LSM980 spectral Airyscan (63X, reconstructed Z sections) in the novel (Figure 1) and the confocal SP5 AOBS images (40X, direct Z imaging) in almost all the other Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The experiments comparing apical versus basolateral trapping of FU are a bit complicated to interpret. What is the evidence that NVR1 leads to basolateral enrichment of FU? Put another way, how does FU localization when co-expressed with NVR1 compare to its distribution when just expressing FU alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added in an image of GFP-FU in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. Comparison with the Figure 5B’, D’ and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C’, D’ confirms that GFP-FU is indeed relocalized by the Nvr1 and T-48 traps, respectively. See text lines 285-286.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. One caveat to this experiment is that apical targeting of FU will presumably lead to a much higher FU density since the apical domain is fairly small. Spreading the same amount of FU over the entire basolateral domain will result in much less concentration of the protein. Since Fu clustering plays an important role in its activation, can the authors rule out that the basolateral trapping doesn't have much effect because Fu activity is much lower in this condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot formally exclude the possibility raised here to explain the ectopic <italic>ptc</italic> expression (but not the reduced <italic>en</italic> expression). However, to our knowledge, there is no data indicating that increased levels of FU could promote its dimerization nor its activation (on the contrary, overexpression of FU has no effect on HH signaling for instance see Claret et al.). On the contrary, FU levels are decreased in response to HH (Ruel et al., 2013). Moreover, an effect via FU clustering would not explain the effect of T48-anchored FU on SMO localization as (Shi et al., 2011) also showed that dimerized FU activates CI independently of SMO.</p><p>Note also that many labs (Kalderon, Jian, our …) have overexpressed FU, with or without a tag, even at very high levels, and activation of FU or the pathway has not been observed.</p><p>Even if this apical tethering would act indirectly by increasing FU clustering, this would not change the fact that it allows FU-GFP to activate the medium to low HH-targets, but not high levels of the anterior <italic>en</italic>. This also indicates that a secondary event is necessary for the highest level of activation.</p><p>We did not see the points 6 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The conclusion that a basolateral function of FU is missing in the apical targeting experiment would be clear if the experiment was done in a fu mutant background. However, in wild-type cells, shouldn't there be the usual abundance of endogenous FU to carry out the function of FU in the basolateral domain?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated this experiment in a <italic>fu</italic> null mutant background (thanks to <italic>a fu<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutant that we built by the CRISPR method). In this context, apical trapping of GFP-FU has similar effect in the absence as in presence of the endogenous FU protein. They indicate that apically trapped GFP-FU does not act via endogenous FU and reinforce our conclusion that FU is required basally for the full activation of High HH targets. Note that we also checked that GFP-FU rescues the effects of the fu<sup>KO</sup> allele. These data are presented in Figure 6E-H. See also the text lines 316-332.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>p 9 – It's not clear to me why the authors conclude that endocytosis of Smo occurs all along the apical-basal axis in Figure The data in E suggest that endocytosis is primarily occurring apically.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that a strong block of endocytosis (Rab5 CA) leads to an accumulation of SMO in the apical region almost exclusively, revealing that SMO is initially targeted to the apical region where it undergoes a first endocytosis. However, partial blocking of SMO endocytosis (under shi inactivation conditions) leads to an increased accumulation of SMO in both the apical and the basolateral region, which reveals that SMO redistributed to the basolateral region can undergoes a secondary endocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S4E – What condition is being analyzed? I couldn't find it in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologized for this lack of information. This point has now been added in the legend of this Figure now called Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance</p><p>There have long been bits and pieces of data about Smo cycling to the plasma membrane and being internalized, and Ptc affecting this process to keep Smo levels low in the absence of Hh. However, there is no clear picture of the route that Smo takes in response to Hh, at least in flies. (In mammals there is good evidence that Smo goes to cilia upon its activation.) The authors have used an innovative approach to try to address this, by fluorescently labeling surface Smo and trying to follow its fate. While subtle, the conclusions that Smo is delivered to the apical domain, endocytosed, and in response to Hh moves basally are generally convincing, with some exceptions noted above. The data showing that this is controlled by PKA/CKI and FU phosphorylation of Smo are also clear. Aside from these mechanistic experiments, the rest is more descriptive and, as the authors note, the results don't clearly distinguish whether the basal localization of Smo is a consequence rather than a cause of Smo activity. Nonetheless, it's a quality manuscript that will be of interest to many in the Hh field, and likely to people who are more generally interested in GPCR signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the distinction between a consequence or a cause, we formally agree. We have tried to test the “cause hypothesis” by using the GRAB system to target mutant and wild-type forms of SMO-GFP. However, we did not succeed in relocalizing SMO as on the contrary, we observed that SMO-GFP had the ability to relocalize the anchors T48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and NVR1. We therefore see no other possibility to discriminate between these two hypotheses.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79843-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We would however like to mention that while numerous published data show a strong correlation between SMO cell surface localization and SMO activation (i. e. (i) HH leads to both SMO activation and its relocalisation at the cell surface , (ii) SMO relocalisation to the cell surface is sufficient to activate SMO and (iii) blocking SMO phosphorylation by the PKA prevents both its localization at the cell surface and its activation) none of them- to our knowledge- show that this relocalisation is in fact required for its activation. Similarly, all our results strongly connect SMO basal localization to its “high activation” without formally proving that the second requires the first as: (i) high HH leads to SMO basal localization, (ii) the phosphorylation of SMO by FU is required for its basal accumulation, (iii) blocking FU in the apical region reduces both basal localization of SMO and its high activation. We have now added data (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 F-F”, G-G”, lines 266-271) confirming that the phosphorylation of SMO by FU is required for expression of the high HH target gene <italic>en</italic> and some text in the discussion lines 390-394. This further links the connection between SMO basal localization and activation. See also our response to reviewer 3 p19.We want to stress that the significance of our data also has to be evaluated in light of what is known on the HH reception: First, HH is known to form a basal gradient supported by cytonemes and this basal gradient is necessary for high HH signaling (Bischoff et al., 2013). Second, the HH co-receptor PTC, is present both in the apical and basolateral/basal regions and was recently shown to inhibit SMO by removing accessible cholesterol from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, with HH binding to PTC blocking the passage of these cholesterol molecules. As the apical and the basolateral membranes behave as distinct membrane regions, with no exchanges of lipids and proteins; the basal molecules of PTC that receive HH from the basal gradient should need basal SMO to fully activate the pathway. Given all this and our data, we propose that FU would be required to send SMO to the basal region; due to the high levels of HH in that region, SMO would then be fully activated, leading to an increased activation of FU, which would then inhibit its partners and targets COS2 and SUFU to fully activate CI.</p><p><italic>Responses to Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. While SNAP labeling technique is a powerful method for probing protein localization, the main question of this manuscript is whether overexpressed SNAP-Smo reports the true localization pattern of endogenous Smo. As shown in Figures 5B&quot; and S1B as well as in the published literature, endogenous Smo does not show significant apical accumulation but is more basolateral, which is very different from the SNAP-Smo shown in Figure 1B. The authors claimed that SNAP-Smo is functional in vivo by citing Sanial et al. (2017) that overexpressed SNAP-Smo rescues adult wing defects caused by smo RNAi. However, Sanial et al. (2017) did not completely rule out whether an N-terminal SNAP tag would lead to Smo activation, or whether overexpressed SNAP-Smo represented an activated form of Smo. If this is the case, the studies described in this manuscript are less important for understanding the impact of the subcellular localization of Smo in Hh signaling activation. Furthermore, the dimerization requirement for Smo activation further complicates the situation. To vigorously establish the relevance of polarized SNAP-Smo distribution in Hh signaling, it is especially important to express SNAP-Smo at levels comparable to endogenous Smo or knock in the SNAP tag into the smo locus.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of the tagging of SMO with the SNAP-tag and of SNAP-SMO overexpression on SMO apico-basal distribution is addressed in our responses to reviewer 1 point 2. In summary, using a recombinant BAC carrying a SNAP-SMO fusion (expressed under the endogenous promoter of <italic>smo</italic>) we show that, similarly to what is seen with overexpressed SNAP-SMO, SNAP-SMO expressed at endogenous levels (i) fully rescues a <italic>smo</italic> loss of function (viability, wild-type wings and targets, in Figure1—figure supplement 1A, B-B”, (see text, lines 113-116) and (ii) is initially addressed apically where it is endocytosed in RAB5 endosomes Figure2-supplement 1H-H”, text lines 202-204).</p><p>Concerning the possibility that SNAP-SMO overexpression would promote its activation, we provide new data, which shows that overexpression of SNAP-SMO has no effect on <italic>en</italic> expression nor the presence of the CI-A domain, two markers of high HH signaling. These results are now shown in Figure1—figure supplement 1C-C” (text lines 115-116) and confirm publications by numerous labs (Beachy, Kalderon, Thérond, Jia, Jiang, our lab etc…) showing that overexpression of SMO is not sufficient to activate it. These reports are based on the overexpression of various UAS <italic>smo</italic> constructs, untagged or with various tags inserted in various loci (N term or C term).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors claimed that newly synthesized SNAP-SMO proteins display &quot;dot-like structures&quot; when released from the endocytic block, likely corresponding to endocytic vesicles. This claim is untenable unless co-staining is performed with endocytic markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show colocalisation between some of these <italic>Surf SNAP-SMO</italic> “<italic>dot-like structures&quot; and</italic> the endosomal marker RAB7. This is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 A-A”, B-B”. See also the text lines 223-224.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, there are no apparent differences between the mean intensities shown in Figures 3A and 3B. In some cases (lateral and basal), the mean intensity of the surf SNAP-SMO even increased after the 15-minunte chase, which is not consistent with the statistical analysis in Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>As we now add in the Figure 3 legend, the discs were treated in the same conditions and all the images were acquired under the same conditions. However, the dynamic range was automatically adjusted for each image independently by Image J for a better visualization of the subcellular localization of SNAP-SMO. To allow a better eye comparison, we have now replaced these images by images in which the dynamic range is normalized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The XZ images of the apical-basal distribution of SNAP-Smo and endogenous Smo shown in different figures are inconsistent. For example, surf SNAP-Smo accumulated apically in Figures 1D, 1G and Figure 2D, but not in Figures 2A and Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our response to reviewer 1 point 2, only the images 1D and 4A can be compared for Surf SNAP-SMO and we have now added in Figure 4—figure supplement 1E data showing that both sets of experiments display very similar distribution along the apico-basal axis both without and with HH, even if differences in the contrast of the images, may be misleading for the eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in Figure 5B', significant accumulation of endogenous Smo was observed when overexpressed Fu was captured in the apical region. However, the upregulation and basal accumulation of endogenous Smo in Figure S4C' were relatively weak under the same conditions. Although immunostaining results for SNAP-Smo or endogenous Smo may vary, it is necessary to provide more appropriate results consistent with statistical data.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is a misunderstanding as in Figure 5B’, GFP-FU is shown, not SMO and it is enriched in the apical region due to its anchoring by T48. Endogenous SMO, which is shown in Figure 5B”, shows no apical enrichment. As mentioned, above (response to reviewer 1, point 4) we have added as a control the subcellular localization of GFP-FU in the absence of an anchor Figure 5-supplement 1C (text line 285-286). Note also that Figure 5 shows XZ sections in the anterior region (-HH situation, corresponding to the FA region); while in the previous Figure S4 (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1) the XZ sections are in the posterior region (+HH situation): this explains why the effect are weak in the P compartment where SMO is already stabilized and activated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Capture of overexpressed GFP-Fu in the apical region resulted in a marked increase in endogenous Smo proteins, which accumulated slightly in the basal region, and downregulation of high Hh signaling targets, such as en. In contrast, capturing overexpressed GFP-Fu in the basolateral region had no apparent effects on Smo levels or apical-basal distribution. The authors concluded that apical-captured GFP-Fu activates and stabilizes Smo on the cell surface, while basal Fu is required for basal enrichment of Smo and activation of high-level Hh targets. However, previous studies have shown that Fu can dimerize. Therefore, the captured GFP-Fu may indirectly affect the localization of endogenous Fu, thereby affecting its function on Hh target expression. The amount and apical-basal distribution of endogenous Fu should be examined to eliminate this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to reviewer 1, point 8, we now show that the effects of the apically trapped GFP-FU on HH signaling do not depend on the presence of the endogenous FU protein.</p><p>Note also that we have no way to assess the localization of the endogenous FU due the lack of a tool that would allow us to distinguish endogenous FU from overexpressed GFP-FU.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Since this study highlights the effect of Hh and Fu on Smo protein levels and their apical-basal distribution, it is necessary to examine whether reduced expression of hh or fu affects the amount and polarized distribution of endogenous Smo.</p></disp-quote><p>To ensure that the changes in the apico-basal distribution of Surf SNAP-SMO were indeed due to HH, we performed the same experiment when HH function was inactivated, using a thermosensitive allele of <italic>hh</italic>. Under HH inactivation, Surf SNAP-SMO is no longer accumulated in the P and the anterior cells near the A/P, and is no longer enriched in the basolateral region of these cells. We have added this result in Figure 1F-F” and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-F” (text lines 162-169).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In the Discussion, the authors stated that aPKC, a kinase previously known to regulate polarized distribution of Smo, does not affect the &quot;high Hh&quot;-dependent basal localization of Smo. However, no relevant data are provided in the paper and no references are cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion: we meant that the aPKC was a kinase previously known to regulate polarized distribution of SMO but that it is not known whether the loss of aPKC affects the &quot;high Hh&quot;-dependent basal localization of Smo. We have changed the text accordingly to make it accurate (lines 368-370) The reference is Jiang et al., PNAS 2014 and has been added (line 368).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Overexpression of the captured GFP-Fu protein in the dorsal compartment should have no effects on Ci-FL levels in cells localized in the ventral compartment. However, in Figure 6D, Ci-FL levels and activation status (i.e. CiA) in the ventral compartment appear to be altered by overexpression of captured GFP-Fu in the dorsal compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, mostly the dorsal part of the wing pouch is shown.

And I see that in line 285 these cells are finally mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned at the beginning of this document, and following this very useful comment and the following suggestion to simplify Figure1, we have now totally reorganized this Figure, its three figure supplements and the corresponding text section.

However, given that the confocal Zeiss LSM980 spectral Airyscan acquisitions are lengthier and do not allow us to perform direct XZ sections, all the quantifications and most of the other images still correspond to the SP5 images (except for the Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-B”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not know how to reconcile the A-D panels showing staining with the chart in E, which shows the 50% increase in P vs FA regions. Is that because the FA regions are not shown in A-D? E' and E' show scarcely any staining in basal regions, which is what I see in the stained discs. Perhaps the use of a basal marker, analogous to the use of DLG, would clarify the situation. Figure S1A at least has things labeled more clearly, and there too barely any staining is seen (A or P) in the basal region. In Figure S1 the anterior is divided into three regions depending on Ci staining (not shown) with the red R having an arrow to &quot;FA&quot;. Yet the red R region is not very far anterior.</p><p>Overall, therefore, Figure 1 is quite confusing and does not seem to fully agree with the conclusions mentioned in the text. The references in the text to FA and P are not matched by any labels in Figure 1A-D. What I do see, in A, B, C, and D, is higher levels of surface SMO in lateral regions in the posterior vs anterior-and maybe the same for total SMO though A seems to contradict B in that regard. So at line 105, the accurate statement would seem to be &quot;lateral&quot; rather than &quot;basolateral&quot;, and it is not clear that the protein being monitored is only cell surface protein. Part of the problem may be the lack of indication in the figure of what counts as &quot;basal&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this advice, which prompted us to reorganize and improve this Figure 1 and its associates figure supplements 1, 2 and 3, as we described at the beginning of this document.</p><p>The mentioned graph E does not address the apico-basal localization of SMO but shows the increase of SMO levels in response to HH.

The mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling are important for understanding development, birth defects, evolution, and cancer. In this paper the authors examine mechanisms involving the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), a positive regulator in the pathway from received HH signal to the activation of target gene transcription. Subcellular localization of SMO has been shown to be important to its activity state. In vertebrate cells, arrival of a HH signal causes SMO to accumulate on the surface membrane in primary cilia, one of which is present on the surface of every cell. No analogous structure has been discovered in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells used in the present study, but SMO subcellular localization has been found to vary in response to HH, including some of it moving to the cell surface. For example, the present authors found that a positive feedback loop between the FU kinase and SMO increase the accumulation of both proteins at the cell surface.</p><p>Hh signaling was discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and found to be important both during embryonic development and in the imaginal discs, precursors of adult appendages and body wall. Here the authors analyze effects on SMO during Hh signaling in the wing imaginal disc. They find that HH causes SMO to become stabilized during steps of endocytosis and recycling, and that at the highest levels of HH signaling the SMO protein is enriched in basal domains of epithelial cells.</p><p>The authors have done a lot of precise and difficult immunostaining work to look at the localization of SMO. The results show often small changes (10% effects) that are statistically significant but leave open questions of how essential the subcellular localization of SMO is to its functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the answer to these points relies on the complexity of the system that we study and on the fact that in “real life” populations of signaling molecules are both heterogeneous and dynamic.</p><p>First, one has to have in mind that in response to HH, only a part of the SMO population is phosphorylated by the PKA/CKI at a given time and among those, a fraction is also phosphorylated by FU as well (see for instance Sanial et al. 2017). Thus, only a fraction of it is expected to be localized in the basal region. In that respect, the use of mutants that mimic or block its phosphorylation reduce this heterogeneity, making the effect of the phosphorylation more visible and allowing the dissection of the role of the phosphorylation (see Figure 4). For instance, SMO<sup>PKA-SD FU-SD</sup>, which mimics highly phosphorylated SMO, is more enriched basally than unphosphorylated SMO (SMO<sup>WT</sup> in absence of HH) and this effect is reduced when the Fu sites are mutated to prevent their phosphorylation. Of note, we now have included data showing how these mutations of SMO also promote its activity. It shows that SMO<sup>PKA-SD FU-SD</sup> can promote high HH signaling, while SMO<sup>PKA-SD FU-SA</sup> on the contrary, blocks it. All these results further strengthen the link between the basal localization and its signaling activity. See the Figure 4—figure supplement 1 F-F”, G-G” and our response to reviewer 1, p 6-7.</p><p>Second, these effects on SMO trafficking are likely very dynamic and we may have “caught” a transient basal localization of SMO. For instance, the “very active” basal fraction of SMO may undergo subsequent degradation leading to its desensitization.</p><p>Finally, the response to HH levels, may also require the additive, and even possibly synergetic effects of other regulatory loops as those that have been shown to regulate HH signaling (see for instance Strigini and Cohen 1997, Kent et al., 2006, Holmgren 2022).</p><p>See also our response to reviewer 1’s comment, “significance“ section, p6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper is part of the ongoing effort in many labs to understand the molecular biology of HH signal transduction. It will therefore be of interest to others working in this arena, and has implications for developmental biology and cancer. The most striking advance in this paper is the importance of FU kinase subcellular localization and its impact on SMO function and HH target gene activation. The paper could be simplified and made more accessible by focusing it more on these results. Localization of SMO and other transducers has proven to be very important for understanding HH signaling in flies and mammals, so this paper provides some useful new ideas.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
