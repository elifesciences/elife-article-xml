function, yet it is very challenging to study these changes, especially for large protein complexes, under physiological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel isobaric crosslinker, Qlinker, for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes using quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry. Qlinkers are small and simple, amine-reactive molecules with an optimal extended distance of ~10 Å, which use MS2 reporter ions for relative quantification of Qlinker-modified peptides derived from different samples. We synthesized the 2-plex Q2linker and showed that the Q2linker can provide quantitative crosslinking data that pinpoints key conformational and structural changes in biosensors, binary and ternary complexes composed of the general transcription factors TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>crosslinking mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>structural proteomics</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd><kwd>general transcription factors</kwd><kwd>isobaric crosslinkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM136974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranish</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM108908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranish</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM144559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranish</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel pair of isobaric crosslinking reagents is described, which allow relative quantification of crosslinker-modified peptides during mass spectrometry analysis for comparative structural studies of proteins and protein complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins play a central role in the regulation of most biological processes by interacting with other molecules in complexes and interaction networks. Their ability to interact with other molecules to regulate biological processes depends on their structures. Protein tertiary structure is determined by and can be predicted from its primary amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). However, proteins, and protein complexes, are not static entities; they can assume multiple conformations. Conformational changes can be induced by post-translational modifications or through interactions with other molecules, and they allow proteins to execute their functions in a condition-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sannigrahi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sicoli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan and Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darling and Uversky, 2018</xref>). Many disease-causing mutations impact protein function by altering the conformational landscape of a protein or protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mashtalir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prabantu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrell and Gooptu, 1998</xref>). Experimental determination of protein conformational states is crucial in many cases to understand the mechanism of protein function and how function is altered in disease. There are two strategies, direct and indirect, for studying protein conformational changes. The direct strategy involves using methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance , small angle X-ray scattering, or cryo-EM to directly observe/compare structural changes under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catterall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pilla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>). Aside from the difficulties and limitations associated with each method, additional challenges for studying conformational changes include the fact that not all of the conformations can be easily crystallized or resolved, and many physiological conditions are not compatible with these methods. The indirect strategies are not able to directly observe the structural changes but can be used to deduce/infer structural changes based on changes in the output of the approach. These methods include limited proteolysis, immunochemical assays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, chemical footprinting, and chemical crosslinking, some of which can be performed on proteins/complexes under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nadeau and Carlson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta and Udgaonkar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rinas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang and Chance, 2017</xref>). The main challenge for the indirect strategies is interpreting the data to infer the correct conformational/structural change out of numerous possibilities. Due to the limitations of direct and indirect approaches, the field of protein structural dynamics greatly benefits by combining these strategies with computational modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sala et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Several mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods have been developed as indirect strategies to study conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS monitors the isotopic exchange rate between amide hydrogens along the protein backbone and the surrounding solvent to provide information about the folded state of the protein or complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Protein painting-MS distinguishes solvent accessible regions from inaccessible regions, by using chemical dyes which non-covalently bind to solvent accessible regions, protecting them from trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haymond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luchini et al., 2014</xref>). Protein footprinting uses covalent chemical modifications and MS to identify surface exposed regions. Modification methods include dimethylation of lysine residues by formaldehyde and reducing reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bamberger et al., 2021</xref>), glycine ethyl ester /EDC modification of carboxyl groups on aspartic and glutamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), NHS-based modification of lysine residues using isobaric Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou and Vachet, 2013</xref>), isotopic succinic anhydride modification of lysine residues, and isotopic N-ethylmaleimide modification of cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahsai et al., 2011</xref>). Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting, especially the fast photochemical oxidation of proteins, coupled with MS has greatly advanced to permit the study of surface exposed regions of proteins in cell lysates and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hambly and Gross, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Espino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenzie-Coe et al., 2022</xref>). All of these MS-based methods involve reactions with solvent-accessible residues or surfaces, and are suitable for studying structural changes in proteins and complexes. However, since these methods do not provide information about spatial proximities between residues/domains, information about the relative locations of residues/domains in different conformational states is limited, especially for larger assemblies. Also, a conformational change does not necessarily involve a change in solvent accessibility.</p><p>Crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CLMS or CXMS) has been widely used to provide distance restraints between residues and relative positioning of domains in large protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mashtalir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdella et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, when performed in a quantitative manner, CLMS can provide information about conformational changes in proteins and complexes, as well as changes in protein–protein interactions. Multiple quantitative crosslinking-MS (qCLMS) strategies have been developed to study conformational changes. TMT labeling of crosslinked samples has been used to quantify crosslinked and normal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruwolt et al., 2022</xref>). In this approach, two or more crosslinked samples are individually digested with trypsin and then labeled with TMT reagents prior to combining the samples. The multiple steps prior to combining the samples can result in quantification artifacts that are due to sample processing differences rather than to conformational or interaction changes, thus complicating data interpretation. To avoid these issues, qCLMS strategies that involve co-digestion of crosslinked samples have been developed. These approaches employ isotopically labeled crosslinkers such as d0/d4 bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Rappsilber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendes et al., 2019</xref>), d0/d4 <italic>bis</italic>(sulfosuccinimidyl)-glutarate, -pimelate, and -sebacate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2001</xref>), d0/d12 ethylene glycol <italic>bis</italic>(succinimidylsuccinate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrotchenko et al., 2005</xref>), d0/d12 MS cleavable DSBU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ihling et al., 2020</xref>), d0/d8 MS cleavable CBDPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makepeace et al., 2020</xref>), or SILAC-labeled samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>). Relative quantification is based on the MS1 intensities of the isotopically heavy and light crosslinked peptides after identification of the crosslinked peptides. However, like all MS strategies that are based on isotopically heavy- and light-labeled peptides, the differentially labeled samples double or triple the MS1 complexity, which can decrease sensitivity and reproducibility; many identified crosslinked peptides are difficult to confidently quantify because they are of low abundance and difficult to distinguish from the background noise signals; and multiple or differential database searches result in extra difficulties for confident light/heavy crosslinked peptide identification and quantification. Based on their MS-cleavable protein–interaction reporter (PIR) design, Bruce and colleagues have developed 2-plex and 6-plex isobaric quantitative PIRs (iqPIRs) with limited sample handling prior to MS analysis, a single MS1 spectrum for each crosslinker-modified peptide and quantification based on MS2 reporter ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chavez et al., 2021</xref>). However, PIR crosslinkers are bulky molecules that are more suitable for studying dynamic protein–protein interactions rather than conformational and structural changes. In fact, many of the aforementioned crosslinker designs are too complicated for routine studies of conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wippel et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we report a novel, simple, and small, isobaric crosslinker design for studying conformational and structural changes. This new crosslinker, we termed Qlinker, has an optimal spacer arm length (~10 Å) for crosslinking-based studies of protein conformational and structural changes, and uses 1-imino-2.6-dimethylpiperidin-1-ium reporter ions (similar to TMT reporter ions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>) for quantification. We have used the 2-plex Q2linker to study conformational changes in biosensors, binary and ternary complexes composed of the general transcription factors TATA box binding protein (TBP), TFIIA, and TFIIB, and structural rearrangements that accompany the transition of RNA polymerase II (pol II) from a 10 subunit core complex to a 12 subunit holoenzyme. In each of these studies, the Qlinker approach provided quantitative crosslinking data that pinpointed key conformational and structural transitions in the proteins/complexes. We expect that this novel strategy for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes will be easily adopted for routine use by the community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of isobaric Qlinkers</title><p>We sought to develop a simple isobaric CLMS-based strategy, called Qlinker, that permits probing conformational changes in proteins/protein complexes by reliably quantifying the relative abundances of crosslinker-modified peptides derived from samples of the protein/complex in different structural states. An important consideration when designing isobaric amine-reactive crosslinkers is that the m/z’s of the reporter ions do not overlap the m/z’s of other fragment ions, which could skew quantification. Unlike iTRAQ or TMT modified peptides, which cannot generate unmodified b1<sup>+</sup> ions (because all peptide N-termini are labeled), the Qlinker-modified peptides, which are generated by enzymatic digestion after the crosslinking reaction is complete, have free N-terminal amines and will generate unmodified b1<sup>+</sup> ions. (A b1<sup>+</sup> ion is an ion with a charge state of +1 corresponding to the first N-terminal amino acid residue after breakage of the first peptide bond.) Since isoleucine and leucine residues generate b1<sup>+</sup> ions at 114.09 m/z and asparagine and aspartate residues generate b1<sup>+</sup> ions at 115.05 m/z and 116.03 m/z, respectively, we sought to incorporate a moiety into the Qlinker that generates reporter ions with m/z’s that do not overlap with the m/z’s of b1<sup>+</sup> and immonium ions. Thus, we decided to use 1-imino-2.6-dimethylpiperidin-1-ium as the reporter ion moiety, which is the same as the moiety used in 126–134 TMT reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We searched 83,242 mass spectra obtained from the analysis of a BS3 crosslinked sample of the 1 MDa yeast Mediator complex and only found 141 spectra (0.17%) containing 126.128 ions and 18 spectra (0.02%) containing 127.131 ions within a 40 ppm mass tolerance. These results indicated that the 126.128 and 127.131 reporter ions can be used for accurate quantification of Qlinker-modified peptides with little interference from fragment ions derived from peptides that are not modified with Qlinkers.</p><p>Another important consideration in the design of the amine-reactive Qlinker is that it can react with ɛ-amines of lysine that are in close proximity. Iminodiacetic acid, iminodipropionic acid, and iminodibutyric acid were considered as base structures. Due to the flexibility of lysine side chains, it was found that Cα-Cα distances of residues crosslinked with amine-reactive crosslinkers are more useful as distance restraints than the distances between crosslinked ɛ-amines. The BS3 crosslinker has a spacer arm of 11.4 Å when fully extended and can crosslink lysine residues whose Cα atoms are up to 30 Å apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merkley et al., 2014</xref>). The zero-length crosslinker EDC/DMTMM can crosslink a lysine residue and an aspartate or a glutamate residue with Cα atoms up to 20 Å apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leitner et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that crosslinkers based on iminodiacetic acid or iminodipropionic acid with extended crosslinker spacer arms of 7.6 Å and 10.1 Å, respectively, would provide similar structural information, while the backbone of an iminodiacetic acid-based reagent would be more restricted than that of an iminopropionic acid-based reagent. At the same time, iminodibutyric acid quickly generates a dark red color during activation (probably due to lactone formation). We decided to use iminodipropionic acid as the base structure for the new quantitative Qlinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimental procedure and Q2linker quantification</title><p>The two isobaric Q2linkers are named C1q2 and C2q2, synthesized from 1-<sup>13</sup>C and 2-<sup>13</sup>C bromoacetic acid (BAA) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and ‘Materials and methods’). A typical experiment uses equal amounts of C1q2 and C2q2 to crosslink equal amounts of proteins or protein complexes in different structural states. After quenching the reactions with ammonium sulfate, the two samples are combined and mixed well, reduced and denatured, trypsin digested, and analyzed by MS using a stepped HCD MS2 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrich et al., 2013</xref>). The Qlinker-modified peptide spectra are identified as either monolinks or crosslinks by different database search engines. The ion signals from the 126.1277 (C1q2) and 127.1311 (C2q2) reporter ions are then extracted from identified spectra to compute the relative abundance of the modified peptides in the different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The isobaric Qlinker quantitative crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CLMS) approach for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The structure of Q2linkers and the general scheme for qCLMS using Q2linkers.

Examples of a monolinked peptide spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and a crosslinked spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) are shown, with the reporter ion intensities from the indicated mixing ratios. The 126 and 127 reporter ion intensities were extracted from the identified spectra corresponding to 298 monolinks and 32 crosslinks, within a mass tolerance of 0.005 Da (~40 ppm) and adjusted by correction factors calculated from the isotopic distribution (‘Materials and methods’). The measured log2 ratios of 127/126 intensity were then compared with the expected log2 ratios. The measured ratios from both monolink spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and crosslink spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) were strongly correlated with the expected ratios with slopes close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). At each mixing ratio, the average measured ratio was slightly lower than the expected ratio (intercept ~–0.4), with a standard deviation around ±0.25, suggesting that there were slightly more crosslinker-modified peptides in the C1q2 sample prior to mixing. This may be due to some peptide loss in the C2q2 sample during trypsin digestion and C18 preparation prior to mixing, or there was slightly less C2q2 crosslinker in the reaction. This also highlights the importance of combining crosslinked samples at an early stage to minimize sample handling variations. The standard deviation is larger for the samples mixed at 5:1 and 10:1 C1q2 labeled (126) to C2q2 labeled (127) (around ±0.42 and ±0.78, respectively). We think this could be due to either the higher natural isotope contribution (~10%) from the 126 reporter ion to the 127 reporter ion, or interference from other fragment ions. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the Q2 quantification strategy can accurately reflect the relative abundance of Q2linker-modified peptides.</p><p>We then affinity-purified pol II from a yeast strain expressing a FLAG-tagged version of pol II subunit Rpb3 and crosslinked equal amounts of the 12 subunit pol II complex with Q2linkers in the presence and absence of α-amanitin. No major structural rearrangements occur in pol II upon α-amanitin binding (1i3q.pdb for free pol II and 1k83.pdb and 3cqz.pdb for α-amanitin bound pol II). The distributions of log2(127/126) ratios for monolinked (total 174), intralinked (total 154), and interlinked (total 77) peptides were all centered around 0 with no significant differences. Also, 98% of the log2 ratios fell within the range ±0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that Q2linkers provide reliable crosslink and monolink quantification with no abnormal ratios when applied to a protein complex in a situation where no significant conformational changes and/or structural rearrangements are known to occur. We initially designed this experiment thinking that α-amanitin binding to pol II might affect Q2linker modification of a lysine residue(s) near the α-amanitin binding site, and we might be able to identify the α-amanitin binding site by analysis of quantitative Q2linker MS data. Unfortunately, no Q2linker-modified peptides were identified near the site where α-amanitin binds. This experiment also highlights one of the limitations of residue-specific, quantitative CLMS methods in general. Reactive residues must be available near the region of interest, and the modified peptides must be identifiable by MS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The study of conformational changes in biosensors using Q2linkers</title><p>Protein biosensors are polypeptides that undergo conformational changes or switches upon receiving an input signal. We next designed experiments to see whether Q2linkers can detect conformational changes in biosensors. We tested two commercially available proteins: maltose binding protein (MBP) and calmodulin (CaM). MBP is a 370 amino acid polypeptide that buries the maltose ligand between a cleft formed by its two domains and exhibits a conformational change from an open ligand-free conformation (1mpb.pdb) and a closed maltose-bound conformation (1n3w.pdb). However, it is the ‘balancing interface’ on the opposite side of the ligand binding cleft that maintains the open conformation; upon maltose binding, this interface is disrupted and becomes more solvent exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Telmer and Shilton, 2003</xref>). To evaluate the ability of Q2linkers to detect conformational changes in MBP, we performed a crosslinker swapping experiment in which we crosslinked 10 ug of MBP in the presence and absence of 10 mM maltose with C1q2 and C2q2, respectively, in one experiment, and, in a second experiment, we crosslinked MBP in the presence and absence of maltose with C2q2 and C1q2, respectively. In each experiment, we combined the C1q2 and C2q2 crosslinked samples prior to trypsin digestion and C18 cleaning, and used 1 ug for MS analysis. In both experiments, we identified one monolinked peptide (<sub>306</sub>SYEEELAK*DPR<sub>316</sub>) that was fivefold more abundant in the samples containing maltose compared to the samples without maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), suggesting K313 is modified more readily by the Q2linkers when maltose is present. Interestingly, this peptide happens to reside within the ‘balancing interface’ of MBP. In the closed conformation, the sequence between 301 and 312 forms an alpha helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, gray structure) and upon binding to maltose, the alpha helix relaxes and unwinds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> cyan structure). However, K313 itself is solvent exposed in both structures, so the increase in K313 modification in the open conformation cannot be simply explained by an increase in accessibility upon maltose binding. Comparison of the open and closed conformations of MBP reveals that K313 can form a salt bridge with E310 in the open conformation (K313-NE to E310-OE2 distance of ~3.3 Å), and this salt bridge is broken in the closed conformation. It is likely that the salt bridge between K313 and E310 limits the NHS ester-based modification of K313 as revealed by the quantitative difference in the abundance of the Q2linker-modified peptide containing K313.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Q2linkers detect conformational changes in protein biosensors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quantification of a monolinked peptide from maltose binding protein (MBP) with or without maltose.

To evaluate the ability of Q2linkers to detect conformational changes in CaM, we crosslinked 25 ug CaM, in the presence or absence of 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and a nearly 1:1 molar ratio of CBP (8 ug) derived from alphaII-spectrin with C2q2 and C1q2, respectively. After crosslinking, the samples were combined, trypsin digested, and 1 ug of the sample was analyzed by MS. One crosslinked peptide was identified containing a Lys78 to Lys95 linkage, which was fivefold less abundant in the presence of CBP and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that crosslinking between these two residues is greatly inhibited upon calcium and CBP association with CaM. We also identified the corresponding monolinked peptides containing these two residues and found that their abundances were slightly increased upon binding of calcium and CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These results suggest that the reduced abundance of the crosslinked peptide containing the Lys78-Lys95 linkage cannot be explained by limited accessibility of these two sites in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CBP. Indeed, the crystal structures of apo-CaM (1cfd) and CBP-bound-CaM (2bbm) show no changes in the surface exposure of Lys78 and Lys95. However, CBP binds to the region between Lys78 and Lys95 and interferes with the ability of the Q2linker to form a crosslink between them due to either steric hindrance or decreased flexibility of CBP-bound CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The results from the MBP and CaM qCLMS experiments show that the Qlinker approach can detect conformational changes in biosensors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Q2linkers detect structural changes during TFIIA/TBP/TFIIB ternary complex formation</title><p>When proteins interact with one another to form a quaternary protein complex, the complex often will have lower energy states with subtle conformational changes and/or structural rearrangements, albeit many of these changes are unknown and are difficult to detect. We next wanted to see whether Q2linker can be used to detect subtle conformational changes, as well as protein–protein interaction changes during quaternary complex formation. During pol II transcription initiation, general transcription factors, including TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB, play central roles in promoter recognition, preinitiation complex (PIC) formation, and start site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai and Sigler, 2000</xref>). During PIC formation, TBP binds to TATA-containing promoter DNA, and TFIIA, composed of two subunits in yeast, TOA1 (or TFIIA1) and TOA2 (or TFIIA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ranish and Hahn, 1991</xref>), associates with and stabilizes the TBP-TATA DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The C-terminal core domain of TFIIB also interacts with TBP, while the N-terminal zinc ribbon domain and B finger of TFIIB reach into the active center of pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Hahn, 2004</xref>). The central linker region of TFIIB (81-211) snakes down the central cleft of pol II, interacting with the Rpb1 clamp and Rpb2 protrusion loops to stabilize the PIC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>). TFIIA and TFIIB independently interact with the N- and C-terminal lobes of TBP, respectively; no interaction between TFIIA and TFIIB has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andel et al., 1999</xref>). We incubated purified, recombinant TBP with either TFIIA or TFIIB (1:1 by weight for both reactions) to form TBP-TFIIA and TBP-TFIIB complexes, and then crosslinked each complex separately with C1q2 crosslinker. At the same time, we incubated TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB (1:1:1 by weight) to form the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB complex, and crosslinked the sample with C2q2 linker. After quenching the crosslinking reactions, all of the samples were combined, digested with trypsin, fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, and prepared for MS analysis. SCX was used to reduce the complexity of the peptide mixtures. After database searching with both pLink2 and Nexus algorithms, 61 interlinks were identified. We grouped the interlinks between the different proteins in the complexes and found a tight distribution of log2 (127/126) reporter ion intensity ratios centered around 0 with most ratios between 1.4 to –1.4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Two crosslinks between TFIIA1 and TFIIB have large abundance differences (&gt;4.0-fold) because crosslinks between these proteins can only be observed in the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB samples crosslinked with C2q2 (127). TFIIA and TFIIB were not co-incubated in either of the samples crosslinked with the C1q2 (126) crosslinker. 202 intralinks were also identified. Since there is twice as much TBP in the pooled C1q2 crosslinking reactions, the average log2 (127/126) ratio for TBP intralinks is ~–0.5 (~1.4-fold more in the samples crosslinked with the C1q2 crosslinker). We think this is reasonable as the crosslinked peptide ratios are not only related to the protein abundance but also to crosslinking patterns, crosslinking efficiency, monolinks, mis-cleavages, etc. We re-centered the log2 (127/126) ratios for TBP intralinks at –0.5 while leaving the ratios for the other intralinks unchanged to compare the ratio distribution of the intralinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

This is due to the fact that TFIIA and TFIIB independently interact with the N- and C- lobes of TBP, respectively, and no direct interaction between TFIIA and TFIIB is observed in the cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andel et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, only the core, conserved regions of TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA were mapped in the crystal/cryo-EM structures. We used full-length versions of TFIIB, TBP and TFIIA in our study. Most of the interlinks and intralinks identified in our study have no significant abundance changes between the samples, in agreement with previous structural studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). Interestingly, the largest interlink changes, besides the previously described crosslinks between TFIIA1 and TFIIB, involve crosslinks between the N-terminal region of TBP and the central linker region of TFIIB, both of which are unstructured and absent in the crystal structures. The largest ratio changes among the intralinks all involve the central linker region of TFIIB, whose structure has only been observed in complexes containing pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Our results suggest that the addition of TFIIA to the TBP/TFIIB complex induces a change in the conformation of the TFIIB linker region. This may involve the rearrangement of the TBP N-terminal domain (NTD). Previously, it was suggested that TFIIA stimulates TBP binding to DNA by causing a structural change involving the NTD of TBP, which alleviates an inhibitory function of the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bleichenbacher et al., 2003</xref>). This TFIIA induced change in the conformation of the TBP NTD may be reflected by the reduced abundance of the intralink between TBP residues 47 and 83 in the sample containing TBP/TFIIA/TFIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the interaction between TFIIA and TBP not only increases TBP’s affinity for TATA DNA, but also causes a structural rearrangement in both TBP and TFIIB so that TFIIB may be better positioned to interact with pol II for PIC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Hahn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glossop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangur et al., 1999</xref>).

Yeast pol II is a &gt;0.5 MDa protein complex and a good model system to study structural changes in large complexes as the 12-subunit holo-pol II assumes a conformation that is distinct from that of the 10-subunit, core pol II complex, lacking the Rpb4/Rpb7 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushnell and Kornberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oberthuer et al., 2017</xref>).

However, among all of the interlinks that were only identified in one of the experiments, only three in experiment I and four in experiment II exhibit a greater than two fold intensity difference. This suggests that the inability to identify most of these crosslinked peptides in both experiments is mainly due to undersampling during MS analysis of the complex samples, rather than the absence of the crosslinked peptides in one of the experiments. This also highlights the importance of reliable methods for quantification in CLMS experiments involving complex samples, where undersampling of crosslinked peptides is exacerbated due to the increased complexity of the crosslinker-modified samples and the inefficiency of the crosslinking reaction. Considering all of the interlinks identified in both experiments, there is a rough anti-correlation between the ratios measured in experiment I and II (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We labeled all of the interlinks that exhibit more than a twofold abundance difference in both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The crosslinks between Rpb4:80-Rpb7:23, Rpb4:76-Rpb7:23 and Rpb1:2-Rpb7:29, labeled in green, were more abundant in the holo-pol II sample as the ∆Rpb4 pol II sample lacks Rpb4 and contains sub-stoichiometric amounts of Rbp7. Several interlinks and intralinks involving Rpb1:332, Rpb2:507, and Rpb1:1102, labeled in red, are also more abundant in holo-pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Rpb1:332 is located in the Switch 2 region (Rpb1:328–346), which is the main switch responsible for the conformational change from the ‘open’ to ‘closed’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The helix in the open state (cyan) flips out (gray) toward the cleft to contact DNA at the −2, –1, and +2 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnatt et al., 2001</xref>). This conformational change is accompanied by stabilization of the Rpb2 forkloop 2 (Rpb2:503–508). The conformational change in Switch 2 brings Rpb1:332, Rpb1:1102, and Rpb2:507 closer to each other, allowing them to be crosslinked by Q2linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Q2linkers detect conformational changes in pol II complexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Switch 2 (Rpb1:328–346) conformational changes in ∆Rpb4-pol II (cyan) and holo-pol II (gray).

The increase in the abundances of the Rpb1:15-Rpb6:76 and Rpb1:15-Rpb6:72 crosslinks in holo-pol II is likely attributed to the salt bridge between K15 and D1442 in core pol II, which impedes the NHS ester-based reaction between the epsilon amino group of K15 and the crosslinker.

NZ−NZ distances between crosslinked lysines are indicated.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99809-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The crosslinks between Rpb1:15-Rpb6:76 and Rpb1:15-Rpb6:72, labeled in blue, are influenced by a conformational change in Switch 5 (Rpb1:1431–1433), which undergoes a hinge-link bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnatt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In the core pol II structure, Rpb1:K15 forms a salt bridge with Rpb1:D1442 (K15:NZ - D1442:OD2 distance of 3.8 Å). In holo-pol II, Switch 5 bending pulls Rpb1:D1442 away from K15, breaking the salt bridge (NZ-OD2 distance of 6.7 Å). Even though the relative positions of Rpb1:K15, Rpb6:K76, and Rpb6:K72 do not change significantly in the holo- and core pol II structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), the increase in crosslink abundances involving these residues in the ‘open’ state is likely attributed to the salt bridge between K15 and D1442 in the ‘closed’ state, which impedes the NHS ester-based reaction between the epsilon amino group of K15 and the crosslinker. Not all of the crosslink abundance changes can be easily explained. Rpb1:1246 is located in a region that interacts with Rpb9 and Rpb2, and changes from a disordered region (1245–1254) in core pol II to a loop in holo-pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnatt et al., 2001</xref>). The increased abundance of the Rpb1:1246-Rpb9:77 in holo-pol II might reflect this structural change. Rpb10:68 is very close to Rpb2:191, but there is no obvious difference in the location of the residues in both structures. Rpb1:129 is located at the N-terminus of Rpb1 (the major part of the clamp domain 1–346) that moves as a rigid body. A slight orientation difference of Rpb1:K129 may affect its ability to crosslink to Rpb5:K171. The crosslink between Rpb11:37-Rpb1:129 could be a false-positive identification as these residues are located on opposite sides of pol II and the distance between their Cα atoms exceeds the theoretical crosslinking distance of Q2linkers.</p><p>Here, 287 intralinks were identified in both experiments, and 124 and 143 intralinks were identified only in experiments I and II, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The anti-correlation of log2(126/127) ratios for the intralinks identified in both experiments is not strong (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3). All of the intralinks involving Rpb4 are more abundant in holo-pol II sample (even though we do not expect any reporter ion signal from Rpb4 peptides derived from the ∆Rpb4 pol II sample, we still observed reporter ion signals from the channel corresponding to the ΔRpb4 sample, potentially due to the presence of low abundance, co-eluting ions). In this study, the intralinks are less useful for probing conformational changes as the backbones of most subunits align pretty well in both complexes, and there are only small rearrangements for most residues. For example, the Rpb5:161–171 crosslink is enriched in the ∆Rpb4-pol II sample, but there is little structural change for the region involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Rpb5:K161 overlays perfectly in both structures and forms a salt bridge with Rpb5:E172 with NZ-OE2 distances of 2.7 Å and 2.8 Å in the holo- and core pol II structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Rpb5:K171 assumes slightly different orientations in both structures due to the formation of a helical structure between residues 171–175 in holo-pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Rpb5:K171 is slightly more stable in core pol II (cyan, b-factor 74) than in holo-pol II (gray, b-factor 216), which may account for its increased abundance in the ΔRpb4-pol II sample. The Rpb1:689–728 crosslink is enriched in the holo-pol II sample, while these two sites, located in the middle of two alpha-helices, are well-aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The distance between the two NZ atoms of the lysine residues is ~4 Å in core-pol II and ~6.6 Å in holo-pol II. The 4 Å distance in the ΔRpb4-pol II sample may limit the ability of the Q2linkers to react with both ε amines to form a crosslink between the two lysine side chains. Also, 191 monolinked peptides were identified in both experiments and 10 and 11 monolinked peptides were only identified in experiment I or II, respectively. All of the Rpb4 and Rpb7 monolinks are enriched in the holo-pol II sample as expected. Some Rpb1 residues at the N-terminal clamp domain were also enriched in the holo-pol II sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In general, and like intralinks, the monolinks are less informative in this study for probing conformational changes. Interestingly, some Rpb5 monolinks and intralinks are slightly enriched in the ∆Rpb4-pol II sample, even though there is no large conformational or structural rearrangement associated with this region. Rpb5 interacts with the same domains of Rpb6 and Rpb1 that interact with Rpb4 and Rpb7. It is possible that Rpb4/7 stabilizes Rpb1, Rpb6, and Rpb5 and their interactions with one another so that the region is more rigid in holo-pol II and less reactive to Q2linkers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this article, we describe a new approach for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes that is based on quantitative CLMS with a novel set of isobaric crosslinking reagents, called Q2linkers. Q2linkers are small and simple, amine-reactive molecules with an optimal extended distance of ~10 Å for CLMS. After crosslinking, the samples are combined for all subsequent steps in the analysis, including enzymatic digestion, peptide fractionation/clean-up, and MS analysis, thus minimizing variations that may occur during these steps. The ability to avoid technical biases introduced during sample processing is especially important in qCLMS studies where conformational changes may be revealed by small but reproducible quantitative changes in crosslinking efficiency. The MS2-based reporter ion quantification is simple and compatible with most high-resolution mass spectrometers. The isobaric qCLMS technology can capture both conformational changes and structural re-arrangements in complex protein samples, and is well-suited to be adopted as a common strategy to study protein–protein interactions and conformational changes in large protein complexes under different conditions.</p><p>Isobaric crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chavez et al., 2021</xref>) are attractive for studying conformational and structural changes for a number of reasons. Unlike label-free approaches, they allow samples to be combined immediately after crosslinking and analyzed by MS together, thus avoiding potential quantification inaccuracies due to artifacts that can occur during sample processing such as different digestion efficiencies, differential sample losses during additional isotopic labeling and/or purification steps, or different extents of amino acid modifications (i.e., methionine oxidation, or N-terminal glutamate to pyroglutamate conversion). In addition, quantification of crosslinked peptides based on isotope labeling has been shown to be more accurate than label-free based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walzthoeni et al., 2015</xref>), which likely is important for detecting subtle conformational changes. Finally, unlike approaches that employ isotopically heavy and light isotopes, isobaric crosslinkers do not increase the complexity of the MS1 spectra, which may improve sensitivity and reproducibly. Our Qlinker design is one of the simplest for isobaric crosslinkers. While the basic structure could be expanded to iminodiacetic acid and iminodibutyric acid for specific applications, we think the iminopropionic-based Qlinker design may be the most useful for general practice.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges associated with CLMS technology is how to interpret and use the resulting distance restraints. The crosslinking results are often used in integrative modeling approaches to produce low- to medium-resolution structural models or for verification of cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). It is even more challenging to use the crosslinking results to study conformational and structural changes. As we have shown in the ∆Rpb4-pol II and holo-pol II experiments, many interlinks (32–53%) and intralinks (30–33%) were only identified in one of the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Most of the crosslinks identified in only one experiment showed no significant abundance change in the two samples, suggesting that their identification in only one experiment is likely due to undersampling during MS analysis of the complex samples rather than the presence of the crosslinked peptides in only one experiment. This, combined with the potential technical issues associated with label-free qCLMS analyses mentioned above, highlights some of the challenges associated with inferring conformational changes based on label-free qCLMS data. Previously, we performed triplicate label-free qCLMS experiments to study structural changes in the histone octamer upon ISW2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hada et al., 2019</xref>). To alleviate issues due to undersampling, we only considered crosslinked peptides identified in at least two experiments for inferring conformational changes. Unfortunately, this strategy becomes less effective as sample complexity increases and undersampling issues are exacerbated. While computational approaches that align MS runs and match MS1 features across MS runs provide a way to alleviate undersampling issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walzthoeni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Valot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>), these approaches are not ideal. The Q2linker, isobaric crosslinker-based qCLMS strategy alleviates issues due to undersampling and sample handling that are often encountered with label-free approaches, and thus permits reliable identification and quantification of site-specific changes in crosslinker reactivity associated with structural differences in two samples.</p><p>In large protein complexes, such as the pol II complex, interlinks are more informative than intralinks and monolinks for inferring structural changes since they provide information about the proximities of the modified amino acids and their associated domains. MS-based technologies such as H/D exchange and active hydroxyl radical mapping can provide information about changes in surface exposure and residue accessibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKenzie-Coe et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsirigotaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). However, in large protein complexes, changes in surface exposure and residue accessibility are often not associated with structural shifts. For example, compared to ∆Rpb4-pol II, there is a large ‘clamp’ domain movement in holo-pol II, but the clamp moves as a rigid body and this large structural rearrangement is controlled by small conformational changes of several ‘switches’. The monolinks are not informative as the accessibility of surface exposed lysine residues does not significantly change. In fact, even though there is a &gt;30 Å movement at the tip of the clamp, we did not detect significant ratio changes for the crosslinks that map to the clamp domain because the conformation of the domain itself does not change significantly. Instead, we observed changes in the abundances of crosslinks involving residues associated with the switches that cause the large-scale movement. Isobaric qCLMS technology provides a powerful way to characterize conformational changes in protein complexes that is difficult to achieve using currently available structural-MS- approaches. In addition, the Q2linker approach complements the information provided by high-resolution structural approaches such as cryo-EM. Unlike cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography, qCLMS is performed in solution under near physiological conditions. Furthermore, CLMS can provide structural information about flexible or disordered regions, which is often difficult to obtain by high-resolution approaches. However, as the success of CLMS very much depends on the experimental conditions and we cannot predict which crosslinked peptides can be identified, it is very difficult to predict what kinds of changes qCLMS can detect. Additional applications of Qlinker-CLMS are needed to better understand the types of structural changes that can be detected using the approach.</p><p>We found that one of the most important considerations in the design of quantitative CLMS experiments, unexpectedly, is to have a situation where most of the ratios are close to 1:1. If the ratios are skewed toward one condition, it becomes very difficult to interpret the ratio changes. Many steps during sample preparation can result in sample-specific abundance changes, which are unrelated to conformational or structural differences. This can occur even after mixing the crosslinked samples and processing them together. For example, we observed that small proteins were adversely lost during the SP3 protein enrichment step, resulting in high abundance ratios for all crosslinker-modified peptides derived from these small proteins in samples where they interact to form larger complexes. To alleviate this issue, we tried many other methods to denature and enrich proteins before trypsin digestion or direct trypsin digestion without enrichment, such as 1% SDS, TCA precipitation, 50% TFE, 8 M urea, and found that 1% SDC gave us the best results for both peptide recovery and crosslinked peptide identification. Thus, we recommend using 1% SDC to denature crosslinked samples prior to trypsin digestion, especially when the samples contain small proteins. For large protein complexes, the SP3 strategy is also preferable due to its simplicity.</p><p>Like most CLMS approaches, this isobaric qCLMS approach depends on the modification of specific chemical moieties and detection of the modified peptides. It may not capture conformational changes if there are no reactive groups near the region involved in the structural shift or the modified peptides are difficult to detect during MS analysis. We did not observe changes in crosslinker-modified peptide abundances derived from pol II in the presence and absence of α-amanitin. This implies that this strategy, like all MS-based strategies, can only be used for interpretation of positively identified crosslinks or monolinks. Sensitivity and undersampling are common problems for MS analysis of complex samples. Future development of Qlinker will involve the generation of affinity reagents that can enrich the crosslinker-modified peptides to improve sensitivity and quantification, and incorporation of multiple isobaric labels in the Qlinkers, like the TMT labels, so that multiple conditions and replicates can be analyzed simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Then we used a peptoid synthesis strategy to have a one-pot synthesis of di-tert-butyl protected product ‘<bold>2</bold>’ using the 1-<sup>13</sup>C or 2-<sup>13</sup>C bromoacetic acid (BAA) for the two isobaric crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). 0.5 mL di-tert-butyl 3,3'-iminodipropionate (‘<bold>1</bold>’) (~3.2 M, 1 eq), 0.5 ml DIC (~6.4 M, 2 eq), and 280 mg bromoacetic acid 1-<sup>13</sup>C or 2-<sup>13</sup>C (1.25 eq) in 1 ml DMF were mixed for 2 hr at room temperature (RT). Then 10 ml DCM and 10 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were used to extract product di-tert-butyl-3,3'-[(bromoacetyl)azanediyl]dipropanoic acid in the DCM phase. 1.1 ml (~5 eq) dimethylpiperidine was added to the DCM extract and mixed at RT for 2 hr, and the solvent was then evaporated under vacuum. The product di-tert-butyl-3,3'-{[(2,6-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)acetyl]azanediyl}dipropanoic acid ‘<bold>2</bold>’ was then dissolved in 50% ACN/0.1% TFA and diluted to 20% ACN. The precipitates were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded onto a FPLC-RP-C18 cartridge at 5 ml/min and eluted with a 70 min gradient from 20 to 60% ACN. The product was monitored by 215 nm absorption and confirmed by MS analysis using an LTQ (Thermo Scientific). The fractions containing the product ‘<bold>2</bold>’ were then combined and evaporated by rotovap. 5 ml TFA was then added to the dried substance for 2 hr and then evaporated by rotovap. The final product ‘<bold>3</bold>’ of 3,3'-{[(2,6-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)acetyl]azanediyl}dipropanoic acid was then dissolved in 0.1% TFA, loaded onto an FPLC-RP-C18 column, and eluted with a 50 min gradient from 0 to 20% ACN. Product ‘<bold>3</bold>’ with MH+ of 316.34 was collected and was determined to be &gt;95% pure. Product ‘<bold>3</bold>’ was fractionated a second time using the same FPLC-RP-C18 conditions to yield ~50 mg of the final product at ~99% purity (~10% efficiency). In situ activation of Q2linker was achieved by mixing 0.25 M product ‘<bold>3</bold>’ dissolved in dry DMF with an equal volume of 0.5 M TSTU in dry DMF and 1/10th volume of DIPEA at RT for 1 hr. The final stock concentration of Q2linkers was ~0.12 M, and the crosslinkers can be stored at –20°C or –80°C for up to 1 month with little loss of activity. Hydrolysis of the activated crosslinker was observed upon longer storage, possibly due to trace amounts of water in the DMF solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>General crosslinking protocol and workflow optimization</title><p>To perform the crosslinking reaction, we typically used freshly activated crosslinkers or brought the frozen crosslinkers to RT for 30 min before use. A typical crosslinking reaction is carried out in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.9) or 1× PBS (pH 7.5) with 20–100 μg total protein in a volume of 50–400 μl with ~2 mM (50× dilution from the stock) crosslinker. Nearly equal amounts of proteins were first crosslinked with one of the Q2linkers for 1–2 hr at RT and then 10 μl 1 M ammonium sulfate was added to quench each reaction for 10 min. The two crosslinked samples were then combined and vortexed to mix the sample. 10 μl 20 mg/ml SP3 magnetic beads were added to the sample and the sample was mixed well. ACN was then added to 70%, and the sample was incubated in a thermomixer at 60°C for 30 min with mixing. After collecting the beads on a magnetic stand, the beads were washed with 100% ACN and resuspended in 100 μl 8 M urea, 50 mM choloroacetamide (CAA), 50 mM TCEP in 1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 37°C for 1 hr. The beads were then diluted by adding 700 μl pure water and 1/10 (w/w) trypsin to digest the sample overnight at 37°C with rotation. The digested peptides were then purified using C18 micro-tips and dried for MS analysis. Complex samples were fractionated by HPLC using in-house prepared microcapillary SCX columns (200 μm × 20 cm; SCX 3 μm, Sepax Technologies) at a flow rate of 2–3 μl/min. Peptides were eluted with 20 μl of Buffer A (10% ACN, 0.1% FA) containing 30, 50, 70, and 100% Buffer B (800 mM ammonium formate, 20% ACN, pH 2.8), followed by 50 μl Buffer D (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 30% ACN). All fractions were dried in a Speed-vac and resuspended in 0.1% TFA and 2% ACN.</p><p>We used the C1q2 and C2q2 reagents to crosslink BSA and analyzed the sample using a Thermo Oribtrap-Fusion mass spectrometer with an HCD collision energy of 28 or 30%. The monolinked peptide spectra were readily identified by Comet database searching using a differential modification of 297.1770 on lysine residues, but most spectra had very low or no reporter ion intensities. We then increased the HCD collision energy to 35, 40, and 45% and observed higher reporter ion intensities, with 35% energy giving both reasonable fragmentation patterns and high reporter ion intensities, and collision energies above 35% resulting in poor fragmentation spectra and significantly reduced the numbers of identified peptides (data not shown). Synchronous precursor selection coupled with MS3 (SPS-MS3) technology can be used to quantify TMT-labeled peptides because all of the b ions and lysine containing y ions are TMT-labeled and can be selected for MS3 to generate reporter ions at high energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>). However, this technology cannot be used for Q2linker quantification because most fragment ions will not retain the reporter moiety and thus will not yield reporter ions during MS3. At the same time, the Q2linkers are only associated with modified lysine residues and may not produce observable daughter ions in the MS2 spectra that can be selected for MS3, especially for the crosslinked species. The Yates group reported that a stepped HCD strategy increased both the diversity of fragmentation ions and TMT reporter ion intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrich et al., 2013</xref>). Following their suggestion for TMT-labeled peptides, we used stepped HCD settings of 24, 30, and 36% and obtained MS2 spectra with much higher reporter ion intensities as well as better fragmentation across the peptide backbone. The average reporter ion intensity under this condition is about 60% ± 25% of the highest intensity peaks. Thus, this condition was used for all subsequent MS analyses of Q2linker-crosslinked samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Purification of TFIIA, TFIIB, and TBP proteins</title><p>Expression plasmids containing His6-tagged versions of TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB were transformed into BL21 (DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) in LB broth with carbenicillin/kanamycin and chloramphenicol.

For normal peptide and monolinked peptide searches, we used the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP)/Comet searches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:TPP">http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:TPP</ext-link>) with static modification on cysteines (+57.0215 Da) and differential modifications on methionines (+15.9949 Da) and lysines (+297.166962 Da and +279.166397 Da). Spectra identified as peptides with lysine modification(s) with PeptideProphet probability &gt;95% were output as spectra for monolinked peptides. For crosslinked peptide searches, we used two crosslink database searching algorithms: pLink2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and an in-house-designed Nexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mashtalir et al., 2018</xref>) with Q2linker mass of 279.1664 Da against a database containing only yeast pol I or pol II protein sequences and its reverse decoy database(s). Other searching parameters include precursor monoisotopic mass tolerance: ±20 ppm; fragment mass tolerance: ±20 ppm; up to three miscleavages; static modification on cysteines (+57.0215 Da); differential oxidation modification on methionines (+15. 9949 Da), peptide N-terminal glutamic acid (–18.0106 Da), or N-terminal glutamine (–17.0265 Da); and Q2linker modification on lysines (+297.166962 Da). After performing the pLink2 and the Nexus analyses with 5% FDR, the search results were combined and each spectrum was manually evaluated for the quality of the match to each peptide using the COMET/Lorikeet Spectrum Viewer (TPP). The crosslinked peptides are considered confidently identified if at least four consecutive b or y ions for each peptide are observed and the majority of the observed ions are accounted for. Search results that did not meet these criteria were removed.

These observed intensities are designated <bold>I</bold>126 and <bold>I</bold>127, respectively. Like TMT quantification, these observed intensities need to be adjusted based on the natural distribution of monoisotopic elements and the 99% purity of the heavy 13C element. It is relatively simple for the Q2linkers since only two channels need to be considered. We corrected the reporter ion intensities (<bold>A</bold>126 and <bold>A</bold>127) by solving the equations: <bold>A</bold>126 * 0.90754+<bold>A</bold>127 * 0.0 1 = <bold>I</bold>126 and <bold>A</bold>126 * 0.09246 + <bold>A</bold>127 * 0.90724 = <bold>I</bold>127.

In benchmarking experiments, the Q2linkers provide accurate quantitation in mixing experiments. Then the authors show applications of Q2linkers on MBP, Calmodulin, selected transcription factors, and polymerase II, investigating protein binding, complex assembly, and conformational dynamics of the respective target proteins. For known interactions, their findings are in line with previous studies, and they show some interesting data for TFIIA/TBP/TFIIB complex formation and conformational changes in pol II upon Rbp4/7 binding.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This is an elegant approach but the power of isobaric mass tags is not fully leveraged in the current manuscript.</p><p>First, &quot;only&quot; Q2linkers are used. This means only two conditions can be compared. Theoretically, higher-plexed Qlinkers should be accessible and would also be needed to make this a competitive method against other crosslinking quantitation strategies. As it is, two conditions can still be compared relatively easily using LFQ - or stable-isotope-labeling based approaches. A &quot;Q5linker&quot; would be a really useful crosslinker, which would open up comprehensive quantitative XLMS studies.</p><p>Second, the true power of isobaric labeling, accurate quantitation across multiple samples in a single run, is not fully exploited here. The authors only show differential trends for their interaction partners or different conformational states and do not make full quantitative use of their data or conduct statistical analyses. This should be investigated in more detail, e.g. examine Qlinker quantitation of MBP incubated with different concentrations of maltose or Calmodulin incubated with different concentrations of CBPs. Does Qlinker quantitation match ratios predicted using known binding constants or conformational state populations? Is it possible to extract ratios of protein populations in different conformations, assembly, or ligand-bound states?</p><p>With these two points addressed this approach could be an important and convincing tool for structural biologists.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>I raised only two points which they have not addressed: Higher multiplexing of Qlinkers (1) and experiments to assess the statistical power of their quantitation strategy (2).</p><p>I can see that point (1) requires substantial experimental efforts and synthesis of novel Qlinkers would be months of work. This is an editorial decision if the limited quantitative power of the &quot;2-plex&quot; approach they have right now is sufficient to support publication in eLife. While I like the approach, I feel it falls short of its potential in its current form.</p><p>For point (2), the authors did not do any supporting experiments. They claim &quot;higher plex Qlinkers&quot; would need to be available, but I suggested experiments that can be done even with Q2linkers: Using one of the two channels as a reference channel (similar the Super-SILAC strategy published in 2010 by Geiger et al; using an isotope-labeled channel as a stable reference channel between different experiments and LC-MS runs), they could do time-courses or ligand-concentration-series with the other channel and then show that Qlinkers allow quantitative monitoring of the different populations (e.g. conformations or ligand-bound proteins).</p><p>As an additional point, I was a bit surprised to read that the quantitation evaluation in Figure 1 is based on a single experiment (reviewer response document page 6, line 2 in the authors' reply). I strongly suggest this to be repeated a few times so a proper statistical test on experimental reproducibiltiy of Qlinkers can be conducted.</p><p>In summary, the authors declined to do any experimental work to address my concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99809.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The regulation of protein function heavily relies on the dynamic changes in the shape and structure of proteins and their complexes.

However, in its current form, the study some aspects of the study should be expanded upon in order for the research community to assess the true power of these isobaric crosslinkers. Specifically:</p><p>Although the authors do mention some of the current weaknesses of their isobaric crosslinkers and qCSMS in general, more detail would be extremely helpful. Throughout the article a few key numbers (or even discussions) that would allow one to better evaluate the sensitivity (and the applicability) of the method are missing. This includes:</p><p>(1) Throughout all the performed experiments it would be helpful to provide information on how many peptides are identified per experiment and how many have actually a crosslinker attached to it.</p></disp-quote><p>As the goal of the experiments is to maximize identification of crosslinked peptides which tend to have higher charge states, we targeted ions with charge states of 3+ or higher in our MS acquisition settings for CLMS, and ignored ions with 2+ charge states, which correspond to many of the normal (i.e., not crosslinked) peptides that are identified by MS. As a result, normal peptides are less likely to be identified by the MS procedure used in our CLMS experiments compared to MS settings typically used to identify normal peptides. Our settings may also fail to identify some mono-modified peptides. Like most other CLMS methods, the total number of identified crosslinked peptide spectra is usually less than 1% of the total acquired spectra and we normally expect the crosslinked species to be approximately 1% of the total peptides.</p><p>We added information about the number of crosslinked and monolinked peptides identified in the pol I benchmarking experiments (line 173). The number of crosslinks and monolinks identified in the pol II +/- a-amanitin experiment, the TBP/TFIIA/TFIIB experiment and the pol II experiment +/- Rpb4/7 are also provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Of all the potential lysines that can be modified - how many are actually modified? Do the authors have an estimate for that? It would be interesting to evaluate in a denatured sample the modification efficiency of the isobaric crosslinker (as an upper limit as here all lysines should be accessible) and then also in a native sample. For example, in the MBP experiment, the authors report the change of one mono-linked peptide in samples containing maltose relative to the one not containing maltose. The authors then give a great description of why this fits to known structural changes. What is missing here is a bit of what changes were expected overall and which ones the authors would have expected to pick up with their method and why have they not been picked up. For example, were they picked up as modified by the crosslinker but not differential? I think this is important to discuss appropriately throughout the manuscript to help the reader evaluate/estimate the potential sensitivity of the method. There are passages where the authors do an excellent job doing that - for example when they mention the missed site that they expected to see in the initial the pol II experiments (lines 191 to 207). This kind of &quot;power analysis&quot; should be heavily discussed throughout the manuscript so that the reader is better informed of what sensitivity can be expected from applying this method.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the Pol II complex experiment described in Figures 4 and 5, out of the 277 lysine residues in the complex, 207 were identified as monolinked residues (74.7%), and 817 crosslinked pairs out of 38,226 potential pairs (2.1%) were observed. The ability of CLMS to detect proximity/reactivity changes may be impacted by several factors including (1) the (low) abundance of crosslinked peptides in complex mixtures, (2) the presence of crosslinkable residues in close proximity with appropriate orientation, and (3) the ability to generate crosslinked peptides by enzymatic digestion that are amenable to MS analysis (i.e., the peptides have appropriate m/z’s and charge states, the peptides ionize well, the peptides produce sufficient fragment ions during MS2 analysis to allow confident identification). Future efforts to enrich crosslinked peptides prior to MS analysis may improve sensitivity.</p><p>It is very difficult to estimate the modification efficiency of Qlinker (or many other crosslinkers) based on peptide identification results. One major reason for this is that trypsin is not able to cleave after a crosslinker-modified lysine residue. As a result, the peptides generated after the modification reaction have different lengths, compositions, charge states, and ionization efficiencies compared to unmodified peptides. These differences make it very difficult to estimate the modification efficiencies based on the presence/absence of certain peptide ions, and/or the intensities of the modified and unmodified versions of a peptide. Also, 2+ ions which correspond to many normal (i.e., unmodified) peptides were excluded by our MS acquisition settings.</p><p>It is also very difficult to predict which structural changes are expected and which crosslinked peptides and/or modified peptides can be observed by MS. This is especially true when the experiment involves proteins containing unstructured regions such as the experiments involving Pol II, and TBP, TFIIA and TFIIB. Since we are at the early stages of using qCLMS to study structural changes, we are not sure which changes we can expect to observe by qCLMS. Additional applications of Qlinker-CLMS are needed to better understand the types of structural changes that can be studied using the approach.</p><p>We hope that our discussions of some the limitations of CLMS for detecting conformational/reactivity changes provide the reader with an understanding of the sensitivity that can be expected with the approach. At the end of the paragraph about the pol II a-amanitin experiment we say, “Unfortunately, no Q2linker-modified peptides were identified near the site where α-amanitin binds. This experiment also highlights one of the limitations of residue-specific, quantitative CLMS methods in general. Reactive residues must be available near the region of interest, and the modified peptides must be identifiable by mass spectrometry.” In the section about Rbp4/7-induced structural changes in pol II we describe the under-sampling issue. And in the last paragraph we reiterate these limitations and say, “This implies that this strategy, like all MS-based strategies, can only be used for interpretation of positively identified crosslinks or monolinks. Sensitivity and under sampling are common problems for MS analysis of complex samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would be very helpful to provide information on how much better (or not) the Qlinker approach works relative to label-free qCLMS. One is missing the reference to a potential qCLMS gold standard (data set) or if such a dataset is not readily available, maybe one of the experiments could be performed by label-free qCLMS. For example, one of the differential biosensor experiments would have been well suited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be very helpful to establish gold standard datasets for CLMS. As we further develop and promote this technology, we will try to establish a standardized qCLMS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Only a very minor point:</p><p>I may have missed it but it's not really clear how many independent experiments were used for the benchmarking quantitation and mixing experiments for Figure 1. What is the reproducibility across experiments on average and on a per-peptide basis?</p><p>Otherwise, I think the approach would really benefit from at least &quot;Q5linkers&quot; or even &quot;Q10linkers&quot;, if possible. And then conduct detailed quantitative studies, either using dilution series or maybe investigating the kinetics of complex formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a sample of BSA crosslinked peptides to optimize the MS settings, establish the MS acquisition strategies and test the quantification schemes. The data in Figure 1 is based on one experiment, in which used ~150 ug of purified pol I complexes from a 6 L culture. We added this information to the Figure 1 legend. We also provide information about the reproducibility of peptide quantification by plotting the observed and expected ratios for each monolinked and crosslinked peptide identified in all of the runs in Figure S3.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the Qlinker approach would be even more attractive if multiplex Qlinker reagents were designed. The multiplexed Qlinkers are more difficult and more expensive to synthesize. We are currently working on different schemes for synthesizing multiplexed Qlinkers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to the public review I have the following recommendations/questions:</p><p>(1) The first part of the results section where the synthesis of the crosslinker is explained is excellent for mass spec specialists, but problematic for general readers - either more info should be provided (e.g. b1+ ions - most readers will have no idea why that is) - or potentially it could be simplified here and the details shifted to Materials and Methods for the expert reader. The same is true below for the length of spacer arms.</p><p>However - in general this level of detail is great - but can impact the ease of understanding for the more mass spec affine but not expert reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentence to assist the general reader: A b1+ ion is an ion with a charge state of +1 corresponding to the first N-terminal amino acid residue after breakage of the first peptide bond (lines 126-128).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The Calmodulin experiment (lines 239 to 257) - it is a very nice result that they see the change in the crosslinked peptide between residues K78-K95, but the monolinks are not just detected as described in the text but actually go 2 fold up. This would have been actually a bit expected if the residues are now too far away to be still crosslinked that the monolinks increase. In this case, this counteraction of monolinks to crosslinked sites can also be potentially used as a &quot;selection criteria&quot; for interesting sites that change. Is that a possible interpretation or do the authors think that upregulation of the monolinks is a coincidence and should not be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that both monolinks and crosslinks can be used as potential indicators for some changes. However, it is much more difficult to interpret the abundance information from monolinks because, unlike crosslinks, there is little associated structural/proximity information with monolinks. Because it is difficult to understand the reason(s) for changes in monolink abundance, we concentrate on changes in crosslink abundances, which provide proximity/structural information about the crosslinked residues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 267 to 274: a small thing but the structural information provided is quite dense I have to say. Maybe simplify or accompany with some supplemental figures?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the structural information is a bit dense especially for readers who are not familiar with the pol II system. We added a reference to Figure 3c (line 177) to help the reader follow the structural information.</p><p>As qCLMS is still a relatively new approach for studying conformational changes, the utility of the approach for studying different types of conformational changes is still unclear. Thus, one of the goals of the experiments is to demonstrate the types of conformational changes that can be detected by Q2linkers. We hope that the detailed descriptions will help structural biologists understand the types of conformational changes that can be detected using Qlinkers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 280: explain maybe why the sample was fractionated by SCX (I guess to separate the different complexes?).</p></disp-quote><p>SCX was used to reduce the complexity of the peptide mixtures. As the samples are complex and crosslinked peptides are of low abundance compared to normal peptides, SCX can separate the peptides based on their positive charges. Larger peptides and peptides with higher charge states, such as crosslinked peptides, tend to elute at higher salt concentration during SCX chromatography. The use of SCX to fractionate complex peptide mixtures is described in the “General crosslinking protocol and workflow optimization” section of the Methods, and we added a sentence to explain why the sample was fractionated by SCX (lines 278-279).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Lines 354 to 357: &quot;This suggests that the inability to identity most of these crosslinked peptides in both experiments is mainly due to under-sampling during mass spectrometry analysis of the complex samples, rather than the absence of the crosslinked peptides in one of the experiments.&quot;</p><p>This is an extremely important point for the interpretation of missing values - have the authors tried to also collect the mass spec data with DIA which is better in recovery of the same peptide signals between different samples? I realize that these are isobaric samples so DIA measurements per se are not useful as the quantification is done on the reporter channels in the MS2, but it would at least give a better idea if the missing signals were simply not picked up for MS2 as claimed by the authors or the modified peptides are just not present. Another possibility is for the authors to at least try to use a &quot;match between the run&quot; function as can be done in Maxquant. One of the strengths of the method is that it is quantitative and two states are analyzed together, but as can be seen in this experiment, more than two states might want to be compared. In such cases, the under-sampling issue (if that is indeed the cause) makes interpretation of many sites hard (due to missing values) and it would be interesting if for example, an analysis approach with a &quot;match between the runs&quot; function could recover some of the missing values.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that undersampling/missing values is an important issue that needs to be addressed more thoroughly. This also highlights the importance of qCLMS, as conclusions about structural changes based on the presence/absence of certain crosslinked species in database search results may be misleading if the absence of a species is due to under-sampling. We have not tried to collect the data with DIA since we would lose the quantitative information. It would be interesting to see if match between runs can recover some of the missing values. While this could provide evidence to support the under-sampling hypothesis, it would not recover the quantitative information.</p><p>We recommend performing label swap experiments and focusing downstream analysis on the crosslinks/monolinks that are identified on both experiments. Future development of multiplexed Qlinker reagents should help to alleviate under-sampling issues. See response to Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Lines 375 to 393 (the whole paragraph): extremely detailed and not easy to follow. Is that level of detail necessary to drive home that point or could it be visualized in enough detail to help follow the text?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the paragraph is quite detailed, but we feel that the level of detailed is necessary to describe the types of conformational changes that can be detected by the quantitative crosslinking data, and also illustrate the challenges of interpreting the structural basis for some crosslink abundance changes even when high resolution structural data exists.</p><p>To make it easier to follow, we added a sentence to the legend of Figure 5b. “In the holo-pol II structure (right), Switch 5 bending pulls Rpb1:D1442 away from K15, breaking the salt bridge that is formed in the core pol II structure (left). The increase in the abundances of the Rpb1:15-Rpb6:76 and Rpb1:15-Rpb6:72 crosslinks in holo-pol II is likely attributed to the salt bridge between K15 and D1442 in core pol II which impedes the NHS ester-based reaction between the epsilon amino group of K15 and the crosslinker.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Final paragraph in the results section - lines 397 and 398: &quot;All of the intralinks involving Rpb4 are more abundant in holo-pol II as expected.&quot; If I understand that experiment correctly the intralinks with Rpb4 should not be present at all as Rpb4 has been deleted. Is that due to interference between the 126 and 127 channels in MS2? If so, then this also sets a bit of the upper limit of quantitative differences that can be seen. The authors should at least comment on that &quot;limitation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we shouldn’t detect any Rpb4 peptides in the sample derived from the Rpb4 knockout strain. The signal from Rpb4 peptides in the DRpb4 sample is likely due to co-eluting ions. To clarify, we changed the text to:</p><p>All of the intralinks involving Rpb4 are more abundant in the holo-pol II sample (even though we don’t expect any reporter ion signal from Rpb4 peptides derived from the ∆Rpb4 pol II sample, we still observed reporter ion signals from the channel corresponding to the DRpb4 sample, potentially due to the presence of low abundance, co-eluting ions)(lines 395-399).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Materials and Methods - line 690: I am probably missing something but why were two different mass additions to lysine added to the search (I would have expected only one for the crosslinker)?</p></disp-quote><p>The 297 Da modification is for monolinked peptides with one end of the crosslinker hydrolyzed and 18 Da water molecule is added.
