In contexts where sensory information is limited or equivocal, it also allows animals to integrate individually ambiguous stimuli into a clearer or more accurate percept and, thus, react with a more adaptive behavioral response. Although responses to multisensory stimuli have been described at the neuronal and behavioral levels, a causal or direct link between these two is still missing. In this study, we studied the integration of audiovisual inputs in the Mauthner cell, a command neuron necessary and sufficient to trigger a stereotypical escape response in fish. We performed intracellular recordings in adult goldfish while presenting a diverse range of stimuli to determine which stimulus properties affect their integration. Our results show that stimulus modality, intensity, temporal structure, and interstimulus delay affect input summation. Mechanistically, we found that the distinct decay dynamics of FFI triggered by auditory and visual stimuli can account for certain aspects of input integration. Altogether, this is a rare example of the characterization of MSI in a cell with clear behavioral relevance, providing both phenomenological and mechanistic insights into how MSI depends on stimulus properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>goldfish</kwd><kwd>Mauthner cell</kwd><kwd>multisensory integration</kwd><kwd>escape response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2012-1578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2017-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONCYT-ANPCYT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005363</institution-id><institution>University of Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Thalmann Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11220130100729CO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005363</institution-id><institution>University of Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otero-Coronel</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multisensory enhancement of Mauthner cell activity reveals how stimulus modality, intensity, and temporal dynamics shape integration at the single-cell level in a neuron essential for fast escape responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to detect a potential threat and react with an escape behavior is critical for survival. In nature, however, many predators develop strategies such as camouflage or partial hiding to decrease their salience, and sensory stimuli tend to be noisy and ambiguous. Consequently, it is adaptive for animals to have ways to disambiguate the signals from the sensory inflow they receive, especially in contexts where available information is limited.</p><p>One strategy for reducing sensory uncertainty is multisensory integration (MSI), which is defined as the process of combining information coming from multiple sensory streams to form a new percept with reduced ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>). MSI has been extensively documented in animals from nematodes to humans and in a broad range of behavioral contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallace et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metaxakis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gil-Guevara et al., 2022</xref>). In the context of escape behaviors, MSI of threat-like stimuli increases the escape probability and reduces the latency of the evoked response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). In mammals, activation of different parts of the superior colliculus determines whether animals engage in exploratory or defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dean et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the superior colliculus contains neurons that integrate multisensory stimuli due to synaptic convergence of afferents conveying information from different sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kadunce et al., 2001</xref>). These studies established that the effects of MSI are larger when weak or ambiguous stimuli are combined, thus showing an inverse effectiveness relationship with stimulus strength. The underlying hypothesis is that integration of sensory signals from different modalities form a more accurate world percept only if each unisensory signal carries some uncertainty or ambiguity.</p><p>In goldfish, audiovisual MSI increases the probability and reduces the latency of startle escape behaviors, with an inverse relationship between the MSI effectiveness and the stimulus salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McIntyre and Preuss, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). These startle escapes (C-starts) are triggered by a pair of reticulospinal neurons (Mauthner cells) that receive visual and auditory inputs through anatomically segregated pathways. Auditory inputs reach the M-cell lateral dendrite through a disynaptic (2 ms) pathway, while the visual inputs relay information in the optic tectum before reaching the M-cell ventral dendrite through a polysynaptic (20 ms) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zottoli et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korn and Faber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the auditory and visual M-cell dendrites show differences in their cable properties, which appear to be well suited to process inputs from abrupt (i.e. fast raise time) auditory pips and more gradually raising visual looms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unclear how auditory and visual signals are integrated at the level of the M-cell to generate a multisensory response.</p><p>The accessibility of M-cells for in vivo intracellular recordings provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the cellular mechanisms of MSI. Moreover, the one-to-one relationship between a single M-cell action potential and the initiation of a C-start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zottoli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zwaka et al., 2022</xref>) provides a clear link between behavior and the observed integration in the M-cell. As such, the goal of this study was to reveal the cellular mechanism that underlie the multimodal integration of M-cell initiated startle escapes we observed in the behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McIntyre and Preuss, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). Specifically, we studied how visual and auditory presynaptic pathways and intrinsic membrane properties of the M-cell interact to produce MSI to ultimately enhance threat detection. To this end, we performed intracellular in vivo recordings from the M-cell soma using auditory and tectal stimuli with naturalistic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preuss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that the temporal dynamics and strength of stimuli, as well as sensory evoked feedforward inhibition (FFI) affect the magnitude of MSI. The results represent a rare characterization of MSI at a single-cell level in a neuron that is sufficient and necessary to trigger a distinct behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mauthner cell responses are sensitive to the dynamics of tectal stimuli</title><p>MSI is known to be dependent on the saliency of the unimodal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stanford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). To create a stimulus set of variable strength and temporal dynamics, we recorded M-cell responses to different electrical trains delivered in the posterior rim of the tectum. As shown in other species, goldfish adapt rapidly to repeated natural-looming stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marquez-Legorreta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fotowat and Engert, 2023</xref>). Indeed, in previous behavioral experiments we presented looming stimuli with intertrial intervals (ITI) of about 4–5 min to reduce such adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preuss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otero Coronel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). However, ITI of 4–5 min are prohibitively long for steady intracellular recordings. Considering these restrictions, we used tectal stimuli (that bypass the retina) at an ITI of 30 s which does not produce adaptation. This tectal stimulation results in depolarization responses in the ventral (visual) dendrite of the M-cell that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those elicited by visual looming stimuli. While this approach bypasses retinal and tectal processing of visual inputs, it is important to note that the tectum also integrates multisensory inputs, including from the thalamus and other sensory pathways such as the auditory and vestibular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bastian, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger and Tong, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kardamakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poulsen et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, tectal stimulation is likely to recruit projections that are predominantly, but not exclusively, visual. Nonetheless, tectal afferents reach the distal ventral dendrite of the M-cell and produce non-adapting synaptic responses that retain key characteristics of looming responses such as fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) riding on top of a ramped depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preuss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Medan and Preuss, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zottoli et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). M-cell somatic responses reach a plateau after 30–100 ms and decay to resting values 200–300 ms after the end of the tectal train. To characterize how the M-cell responses depend on the frequency and duration of the stimulation trains in the tectum, we recorded responses to 60 Hz trains that varied in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <italic>N</italic> = 18), and 100 ms tectal trains that varied in pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <italic>N</italic> = 11). The responses to both sets of trains exhibited complex temporal dynamics with a tonic component that progressively builds during the train and a fast phasic component after each pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>M-cell responses to tectal stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) M-cell responses to a 60-Hz tectal train of 200 ms were used to measure the evoked depolarization at 1, 33, 100, and 200 ms after stimulus onset during a 12-ms time window (colored vertical boxes).

Increasing the frequency of the 100 ms stimulation trains also drove stronger tectal responses due to a large increase in the tonic component (ANOVA, tonic: <italic>F</italic>(3,30) = 12.29, p &lt; 0.0001). However, increasing the tectal stimulus frequency produced a significant reduction in the amplitude of the phasic component (ANOVA, phasic: <italic>F</italic>(3,30) = 11.29, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Comparing the stimulus trains of variable duration and frequency reveals that modifying the duration of the 60 Hz trains or the frequency of 100 ms trains is similarly effective in tuning the magnitude of the responses. Increasing the duration of a 60 Hz from 33 to 200 ms produced a 45% increase in the total response amplitude (phasic + tonic) while increasing the frequency from 30 to 200 Hz produced a 50% increase in the response amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>). Since multimodal integration is known to depend on the strength of the unimodal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stanford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>), in the following multimodal experiments we leveraged this characterization to generate tectal stimuli of variable strength and dynamics. Although both the 60 Hz trains of variable duration and the 100 ms trains of variable frequency evoked responses of similar total amplitude, we decided to include both sets of trains in our multisensory stimuli to determine whether any detected effect depended on the temporal structure of the stimulus or the ratio of phasic-to-tonic responses.</p><p>One of the principles that guide MSI is the spatial coherence of the different cues being integrated. If the perceived source localizations of two stimuli overlap, these stimuli are more likely to be integrated. Conversely, if the two stimuli arrive from spatially disparate sources the chances of observing an MSI will decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith and Stein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>). The geometrical configuration of the setup in our experiments determined that the loudspeaker used to produce acoustic stimuli was mounted to the right of the fish and electrical stimulation was applied to the left tectum (which normally receives visual signals from the right retina). Whenever possible, we performed recordings from both Mauthner cells. To rule out the possibility of a systematic difference in the responses of either M-cell due to the spatial source of the stimuli, we compared the responses to tectal or auditory stimuli in sequential recordings of the right and left M-cells of the same fish. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows representative trace examples for tectal (100 ms 60 Hz tectal train, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and auditory (5 ms 200 Hz auditory pip, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) stimulation from the left (upper traces) or right (lower traces) M-cell of the same fish. The complex post-synaptic potentials were highly stereotypical in successive presentations of tectal or auditory stimuli within and across cells.

Acoustic stimulation produces a complex response in the M-cell which is composed of a fast EPSP superimposed on a depolarizing envelope termed slow EPSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>). The fast EPSP is composed of fast electrical coupling potentials resulting from firing of the eighth nerve auditory afferences that synapse the distal end of the lateral dendrite of the M-cell (club endings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>).

Although the M-cell is known to respond to stimuli of different modalities, there are no reports on how it combines and integrates information when auditory and tectal sources are co-presented. To determine whether multisensory enhancement occurs in the M-cell, we recorded somatic responses to an auditory pip (unisensory auditory, A), a tectal stimulation train (unisensory tectal, T), and their combination (multisensory audiotectal, M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Multisensory integration in the M-cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of stimulation (left) and response examples (right).

This FFI restricts the temporal window of sensory excitation to terminate the excitatory signal.

Moreover, these results show that auditory stimuli trigger more prolonged inhibition than tectal stimuli of similar amplitude and decay time. The short-lived FFI that follows tectal stimulation suggests that multiple trains or waves of tectal inputs are more likely to be integrated and summed than multiple sounds. This goes in line with the duration of visual looms that are most effective in triggering the M-cell and eliciting visual C-start escapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preuss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>).

First, auditory inputs from the eighth nerve reach the distal lateral dendrite of the M-cell through a disynaptic (≈2 ms) pathway followed by slower inputs from glutamatergic synaptic contacts on the soma and proximal dendrite. Visual inputs reach the ventral dendrite after a polysynaptic (≈20 ms) pathway that includes the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zottoli et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>). Second, M-cell dendritic characteristics determine modality specific filtering differences resulting in stronger attenuation of visual than auditory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). For auditory stimuli, it has been reported that a sound pip that precedes by 20–150 ms a second sound reduces the M-cell response to the second sound, a phenomenon known as auditory prepulse inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumeister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Curtin and Preuss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabor et al., 2018</xref>).

We decided to use a 50-ms interval because it was observed to be a period after which the tectal FFI had returned to baseline values, while the auditory FFI remained at about 4%. The amplitude of the tectal stimulation pulse was chosen so that the M-cell responses to the tectal and auditory stimuli were of similar magnitude (4–8 mV). The initial response to the first stimulus (S1, auditory in the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top trace) decayed passively over the course of 50 ms, and at that point the second stimulus was presented (S2, tectal in the example shown if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom trace).

However, these results represent the average MSI for each group for a specific set of experimental conditions and effectively simplify the diverse range of responses across trials, experimental conditions, and fish. To compare the overall dependence of the multisensory enhancement on the strength of sensory inputs, we pooled the MSI indexes for experiments irrespective of sequence of stimuli (AT and TA, <italic>N</italic> = 18, <italic>n</italic> = 174), tectal train duration (from a single 1 ms tectal pulse to a 200 ms train) and frequency (from a single pulse to 1000 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, MSI/Max and B, MSI/Sum).

A combination of fast afferent circuits, synaptic specialization, special intrinsic properties, and topology of the M-cell contribute in concert to a fast startle escape response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eaton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korn and Faber, 2005</xref>). Here, we show that the M-cell incorporates multisensory information to enhance its responses and characterize how the integration of multiple stimuli is affected by the modality, spatial source, temporal structure, temporal order, and intensity of the stimuli. Although multisensory enhancement has been previously described in different neural populations and across a wide range of species, it was unclear whether the activity of these neurons was necessary, sufficient, or even influenced the execution of behavioral responses to multisensory stimuli. In contrast to other known multisensory structures of vertebrates MSI in the M-cell has an unequivocal function in fish behavior and survival, as it directly determines whether and when a C-start is triggered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McIntyre and Preuss, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Different factors differentially affect the summation and integration of auditory and visual inputs to the M-cell. First, sensory inputs are subject to different passive decays depending on the site of the dendritic arbor at which they arrive. Auditory inputs reach the M-cell distal lateral dendrite through dense mixed electrical and chemical synapses driven through the posterior eighth nerve afferents and the proximal dendrite through indirect glutamatergic inputs conveying information from inner ear endorgans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, visual inputs arriving to the ventral dendrite establish synapses that do not show additional specializations as the club endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zottoli et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cachope et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the geometrical properties of the M-cell lateral and ventral dendrites (length and tapering) impose different filters on the input signal which determine a stronger spatial decay for visual than for auditory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). Third, as excitatory (and inhibitory) signals reach the soma, the active ion conductances decrease the membrane resistance and impact the response to following signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodgkin, 1947</xref>). Finally, the magnitude and dynamics of the stimuli will also affect integration. Both abrupt auditory pips and longer lasting auditory looms generate fast EPSPs that depend on the stimulus frequency and a depolarizing envelope proportional to the stimulus amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>) that slowly decays to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the pathways for auditory and visual inputs are completely different, tectal responses also consist of fast peaks that track stimulus frequency and a tonic depolarizing envelope proportional both to stimulus duration and frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that also decays slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>These temporal dynamics of the responses modulate the effective MSI in the M-cell soma, which emerges as a complex, nonlinear interaction between ‘positive’ (input strength and summation, voltage-dependent depolarizing conductances) and ‘negative’ (temporal and spatial decay, FFI, and depolarization-induced decrease in input resistance) contributions. These factors likely influence integration in any multisensory neuron. However, the accumulated knowledge on the presynaptic pathways and the intrinsic mechanisms operating in the M-cell combined with its functional role in commanding the initiation of the C-start response makes this neuron a unique model for analyzing MSI in a single identifiable neuron.</p><p>We have previously shown that fish exhibit a behavioral multisensory enhancement of the C-start escape response for audiovisual stimuli, and that this effect is reduced when increasing the salience of the unisensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>). Therefore, one of our goals here was to investigate if the inverse effectiveness principle observed behaviorally had its correlation in integration processes taking place in the M-cell. Paralleling our previous behavioral results, here we show through intracellular recordings that the response evoked by an auditory pip can be increased by about 50% when it is preceded by a tectal stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, G</xref>). This enhancement was not affected by relatively large changes in stimulus frequency. The plateau in the tonic depolarization observed 30–50 ms after a sustained stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) combined with the low-pass filtering properties of the membrane could be responsible for the lack of frequency effects. These two mechanisms point to the M-cell role as a ‘sudden’ stimulus detector rather than a precise coder of sensory stimulus properties.</p><p>When we combined a tectal train with an auditory pip to obtain a multisensory stimulus, the response was smaller than the sum of the evoked depolarization of the two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, H</xref>). This sublinear effect was expected in the case of passive integration, since cellular biophysics predict a sublinear integration of subthreshold inputs due to a reduction in the driving force of sodium and the aperture of ion channels that reduce the membrane resistance. Noteworthy, action potentials are all-or-nothing events, so the effects when the membrane potential is close to the threshold, sublinear summation can determine that an otherwise silent neuron fires an AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, a weak (subthreshold) auditory pip combined by a weak visual stimulus in close temporal association might be sufficient for triggering an escape response. Indeed, analysis of 60 M-cells tested with A, tectal and multimodal stimuli showed that auditory stimuli evoked firing in 5% of cells, tectal stimuli in 6.7% of cells but almost 12% of M-cells fired in response to multisensory stimuli. Even though these results are probably an underestimation of actual firing probabilities due to anesthesia and paralyzing agents, they provide a mechanistic support to our previous behavioral observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, for the weakest multisensory stimuli the M-cell response deviated from this sublinear integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). When the sum of unisensory components is less than 2.5 mV (essentially a single tectal stimulus immediately followed by a single auditory pip) summation is linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). This suggests the existence of one or more active mechanism/s of MSI upstream of the M-cell soma, potentially through a presynaptic neuron that also receives audiovisual inputs and projects to the M-cell or locally at the level of the dendritic tree of the M-cell. Moreover, previous work has described the M-cell membrane nonlinearities in the lateral and ventral dendrites which progressively increase M-cell excitability for depolarizations above 5 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faber and Korn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). Such nonlinear properties might enhance MSI of weak stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>) providing a cellular mechanism for the principle of inverse effectiveness of MSI.</p><p>The temporal structure of the multisensory stimuli is crucial to allow the animal to effectively ‘bind’ or associate both signals as coming from a single source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>). In the M-cell, this translates into the time window where the effect on the membrane voltage (excitatory or inhibitory) persists. Here, we found that a delay of 50 ms between the components of a low-amplitude multisensory stimuli result in a linear summation of the signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and that the temporal order of the components produces a slight effect in the integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, AT vs. TA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felch et al., 2016</xref>). As it has been previously suggested, the lengthy decay of the slow EPSP of the auditory pip (or the tonic component of the tectal train) probably contributed to relax the requirement for coincident inputs, effectively broadening the temporal window of integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szabo et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the integration of unisensory stimuli was dependent on the modality of the stimuli: two tectal (TT) stimuli summed linearly while two auditory (AA) stimuli summed sublinearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This difference might be due to differences in both the presynaptic networks that mediate PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabor et al., 2018</xref>) and in the temporal decay of auditory and tectally evoked FFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Auditory stimuli produce a longer-lasting inhibition than tectal stimuli of similar strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and while tectal inhibition is almost extinct 50 ms after a tectal stimulus, auditory inhibition stabilizes at around 50% of the maximum inhibitory effect in a time window of 30–70 ms after an auditory stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the integration of AT stimuli was smaller than that of TA, supporting a differential cross-modal and intra-modal integration of the excitatory or inhibitory components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Another factor that could be contributing to the differential integration between AA and AT stimuli is that FFI inhibition is likely to be heterogeneously spread in the perisomatic area around the M-cell. If auditory stimulation recruits inhibitory PHP neurons that target the proximal lateral dendrite of the M-cell, a subsequent sensory input propagating along the lateral dendrite (i.e, auditory input) would suffer stronger attenuation than one reaching the soma through the ventral dendrite (i.e. tectal input). However, specific studies are required to test this hypothesis as it is still unclear if auditory and tectal afferent fibers synapse the same or different sets of inhibitory neurons and which is the spatial distribution of those inhibitory contacts. Additionally, presynaptic elements could also contribute to the asymmetry in unimodal auditory (AA) vs. unimodal tectal (TT) or multisensory processing. A subset of glutamatergic Gsx1 neurons located in rhombomere 4 have been shown to mediate M-cell auditory presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabor et al., 2018</xref>). These neurons produce presynaptic inhibition of eighth nerve auditory fibers adjacent to the distal portion of the M-cell lateral dendrite but leave unaffected the ventral dendrite. This mechanism could therefore affect the processing of pairs of sensory signals that initiate with an auditory component (AA, AT) and leave the integration of tectal or multisensory stimuli unaffected.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used adult goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>) of both sexes and 7–10 cm of standard body length. Fish were purchased from Billy Bland Fishery (Taylor, AR, USA), Hunting Creek Fisheries (Thurmont, MD, USA) or Daniel Corriarello Aquarium (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and allowed to acclimate for at least a week after transport. Fish were kept in rectangular Plexiglas holding tanks (30 × 60 × 30 cm<sup>3</sup>; 54 l) in groups of up to 10 individuals. Tanks were supplied with filtered and dechlorinated water and maintained at 18°C. Ambient light was set to a 12-hr light/dark photoperiod. Animals were fed floating pellets (Sera, Germany) five times a week.

Sound stimuli were recorded with a microphone (XM8500, Behringer) positioned 10 cm over the head of the fish. Calibration recordings were performed with a hydrophone (SQ01, Sensor Technology, Ontario, Canada) positioned where the submerged fish was placed during experiments. Since we were interested in studying integration of subthreshold stimuli, we used sound intensities known to be subthreshold for evoking behavioral startle responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumeister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martorell and Medan, 2022</xref>).

Post hoc analysis of the M-cell responses in this study revealed that only 3 out of 60 M-cells (5%) fired at least once to an auditory stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optic tectum stimulation</title><p>Tectal stimuli were administered to the mid-anterior rim of the left tectum using a bipolar electrode (#30202 FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA) connected to an isolated stimulator (DS2A; Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK). In most cases, stimulation [100 µs, 0.1–1 mA] in this area was effective in driving subthreshold responses (&lt;4 mV) in the M-cell. To change the strength and dynamics of the tectal stimulation we either used a 60-Hz stimulation train of variable duration (1, 33, 66, 100, and 200 ms) or a 100-ms train of variable frequency (1, 33, 100, and 200 Hz). We deliberately used tectal stimuli that evoked M-cell firing with a very low probability (6.7%, 4 out of 60 M-cells tested fired at least once to any of the tectal stimuli used).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>M-cell intracellular responses to tectal and acoustic stimuli were studied in vivo using standard surgical and electrophysiological recording techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Preuss and Faber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preuss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medan et al., 2018</xref>). To initiate anesthesia, fish were immersed in 1 l of ice water with 40 mg/l of the general anesthetic tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, Western Chemical, Ferndale, WA, USA), until the fish ceased to swim, lost equilibrium and were unresponsive to a pinch on the tail (typically 10–15 min). They were next treated with 20% benzocaine gel (Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) at incision sites and pin-holding points 5 min prior to surgical procedures. Fish were stabilized in the recording chamber by two pins, one on each side of the head, and ventilated through the mouth with recirculating, aerated saline at 18°C (saline [g/l]: sodium chloride 7.25, potassium chloride 0.38, monosodium phosphate monobasic 0.39, magnesium sulfate 0.11, HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) 4.77; calcium chloride 0.24; dextrose 1.01, pH 7.2). The recording chamber was mounted inside an opaque, thin-walled tank filled with saline that covered the fish up to eye level. The recirculating saline also included a maintenance concentration of the anesthetic MS-222 (20 g/l) that does not interfere with auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer and Mensinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordova and Braun, 2007</xref>). Next, the spinal cord was exposed with a small lateral incision at the caudal midbody. Bipolar stimulation electrodes were placed on the unopened spinal cord to transmit low-intensity (5–8 V) electrical pulses generated by an isolated stimulator (A 360, WPI, Sarasota, FL, USA). This allowed antidromic activation of the M-cell axons, as confirmed by a visible muscular contraction (twitch). Surgical procedures were performed before a muscle paralysis agent was injected, which allows monitoring the effectiveness of the anesthetic by watching for an increase of opercula movement frequency (largely reduced in deep anesthesia) and movements/twitches in response to the surgical procedures. Shortly before the recordings started, animals were injected I.M. with <sc>D</sc>-tubocurarine (1 μg g<sup>−1</sup> b.w.; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and a small craniotomy exposed the medulla for electrophysiological recordings. Antidromic stimulation produces a negative potential in the M-cell axon cap (typically 15–20 mV), which unambiguously identifies the axon hillock and allows intracellular recordings from defined locations along the M-cell soma-dendritic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furshpan and Furukawa, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furukawa, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faber and Korn, 1989</xref>). Intracellular recordings were acquired using borosilicate glass electrodes (7–10 MΩ) filled with 5 M potassium acetate and an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Fostefvr City, CA, USA) in current-clamp setting. M-cell responses were acquired with a Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments) at 25 kHz. Electrodes were advanced using motorized micromanipulators (MP-285; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) until reaching the axon cap (defined as a site with an extracellular M-cell AP field <italic>&gt;</italic>10 mV). Next, the electrode was moved 50 μm lateral and 50 μm posterior to penetrate the somatic region. Only trials in which the resting membrane potential was between −90 and −70 mV were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses and experimental design</title><p>To perform statistical analysis, we used R (version 4.0.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and RStudio (version 1.1.456, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/">www.rstudio.com</ext-link>).

We analyzed the contribution of the phasic and tonic components separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>). To do this we considered a 12-ms window following the last tectal pulse (color-shaded areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and defined the tonic response amplitude as the difference between the membrane potential immediately before the arrival of the last pulse (blue bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>) and resting membrane potential.

For this, they focused on the teleost Mauthner cell, long known to be at the core of a fast escape circuit. What is particularly interesting in this work is the naturalistic approach they took. Classically, the M-cell was characterized, both behaviorally and physiologically, using an unimodal sensory space. Here the authors make the effort (substantial!) to study the physiology of the M-cell taking into account both the visual and auditory inputs. They performed well-informed electrophysiological approaches to decipher how the M-cell integrates the information of two sensory modalities depending on the strength and temporal relation between them.</p><p>The empirical results are convincing and well-supported. The manuscript is well-written and organized. The experimental approaches and the selection of stimulus parameters are clear and informed by the bibliography. The major finding is that multisensory integration increases the certainty of environmental information in an inherently noisy environment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99424.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Otero-Coronel and colleagues use a combination of acoustic stimuli and electrical stimulation of the tectum to study MSI in the M-cells of adult goldfish. They first perform a necessary piece of groundwork in calibrating tectal stimulation for maximal M-cell MSI, and then characterize this MSI with slightly varying tectal and acoustic inputs. Next, they quantify the magnitude and timing of FFI that each type of input has on the M-cell, finding that both the tectum and the auditory system drive FFI, but that FFI decays more slowly for auditory signals. These are novel results that would be of interest to a broader sensory neuroscience community. By then providing pairs of stimuli separated by 50ms, they assess the ability of the first stimulus to suppress responses to the second, finding that acoustic stimuli strongly suppress subsequent acoustic responses in the M-cell, that they weakly suppress subsequent tectal stimulation, and that tectal stimulation does not appreciably inhibit subsequent stimuli of either type. Finally, they show that M-cell physiology mirrors previously reported behavioural data in which stronger stimuli underwent less integration.</p><p>The manuscript is generally well-written and clear. The discussion of results is appropriately broad and open-ended. It's a good document. Our major concerns regarding the study's validity are captured in the individual comments below. In terms of impact, the most compelling new observation is the quantification of the FFI from the two sources and the logical extension of these FFI dynamics to M-cell physiology during MSI. It is also nice, but unsurprising, to see that the relationship between stimulus strength that MSI is similar for M-cell physiology to what has previously been shown for behavior. While we find the results interesting, we think that they will be of greatest interest to those specifically interested in M-cell physiology and function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99424.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Otero-Coronel</surname><given-names>Santiago</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Rockefeller University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Preuss</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hunter College, City University New York</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Medan</surname><given-names>Violeta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Buenos Aires</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Concern (Original Comment 1):</p><p>“We think that this is sufficient to address our concern.

As recommended, we have now included additional citations in the revised manuscript to support these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concern (Original Comment 5):</p><p>“We do not feel that this important concern has been addressed. The stats are definitively negative. There is no statistical evidence from these data that multisensory integration is occurring in this assay. The anesthesia, paralysis, and low n may provide explanations for this negative result, but it is still a negative result (p=0.5269). To show two examples of multisensory integration for subthreshold stimuli fits the narrative, but this result is not supported. Examples where individual stimuli caused APs (and combined stimuli did not) also occurred, presumably, and at a rate that is statistically indistinguishable to the examples shown in Figure 5. As such, if results from this assay are going to be in the manuscript, acoustic-only and tectum-only examples should be shown as well, although they would not fit the narrative. To be meaningful, this experiment would have to show that multisensory integration is happening in this circuit. Frustrating though it must be, the experiment has given a negative result to that question.”</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding Figure 5C and the firing of action potentials (APs) in response to multisensory stimuli. We acknowledge that our assay is not suited to answer this question definitively and that our results do not provide statistical support for this hypothesis. In response, we have removed the examples previously shown in Figure 5C, along with the related description in the Results section (lines 420–426), to avoid implying unsupported integration in suprathreshold conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
