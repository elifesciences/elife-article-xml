disorders. Simultaneous interference with their signalling pathways may improve muscle function; however, little is known about their individual and combined receptor signalling. Here, we show that inhibition of TGF-β signalling by simultaneous muscle-specific knockout of TGF-β type I receptors <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1b</italic> in mice, induces substantial hypertrophy, while such effect does not occur by single receptor knockout. Hypertrophy is induced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K and reduced E3 ligases expression, while myonuclear number remains unaltered. Combined knockout of both TGF-β type I receptors increases the number of satellite cells, macrophages and improves regeneration post cardiotoxin-induced injury by stimulating myogenic differentiation. Extra cellular matrix gene expression is exclusively elevated in muscle with combined receptor knockout. <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1b</italic> are synergistically involved in regulation of myofibre size, regeneration, and collagen deposition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TGF-β</kwd><kwd>myostatin</kwd><kwd>type I receptor</kwd><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>injury</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004243</institution-id><institution>Prinses Beatrix Spierfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W.OR14-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hillege</surname><given-names>Michèle MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoogaars</surname><given-names>Willem MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaspers</surname><given-names>Richard T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201808440351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Andi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Muscle hypertrophy and regeneration are critically regulated by combination of TGF-β type I receptors in myofibres.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle wasting disorders, such as muscular dystrophies, cancer cachexia, and sarcopenia are characterised by reduced muscle mass, impaired regeneration and fibrosis, which results in progressive muscle weakness. The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily members TGF-β1, myostatin and activin A are involved in various processes within muscle tissue and overexpression of these proteins contributes to muscle wasting pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernasconi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>TGF-β signalling negatively affects muscle growth by both affecting satellite cells (SCs) and myofibres. TGF-β1, myostatin and activin A inhibit myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Trendelenburg et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibition of myostatin and activin A synergistically results in muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amirouche et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Latres et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McFarlane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zimmers et al., 2002</xref>). These effects are at least partly independent of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, TGF-β1 overexpression in vivo may also cause muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mendias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Narola et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transient TGF-β1 expression may play an essential role during muscle regeneration. TGF-β1 is expressed by inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils as well as by fibroblasts after acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Assoian et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grotendorst et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lawrence et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zimowska et al., 2009</xref>). During muscle regeneration, TGF-β1 is involved in the regulation of the immune response and plays an important role in rebuilding extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillies and Lieber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kehrl et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reibman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tsunawaki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wahl et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wiseman et al., 1988</xref>). However, chronic increased expression of TGF-β is known to contribute to muscle fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, myostatin and activin A have also been suggested to induce substantial skeletal muscle fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, inhibition of TGF-β signalling in the myofibre may substantially reduce connective tissue deposition.</p><p>In animal models, such as murine X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model, cancer cachexia mouse models or aged mice, inhibiting signalling of one or more of these ligands had beneficial effects, such as reduction in fibrosis and maintenance of muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andreetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Latres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murphy et al., 2011a</xref>). Lack of either TGF-β or myostatin has been suggested to improve regeneration after acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accornero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McCroskery et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, inhibiting these growth factors may be a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate muscle wasting pathologies.</p><p>However, interference with signalling of TGF-β family members may be complicated. TGF-β family members regulate various cellular processes throughout the body, thus systemic inhibition of these growth factors may have severe consequences. Furthermore, due to overlap in function of these ligands, inhibition of a single ligand is likely not effective.</p><p>Simultaneous inhibition of TGF-β1, myostatin and activin A through interference with their downstream receptors may be an effective approach. The TGF-β family consists of at least 33 cytokines that can roughly be divided into the TGF-β/myostatin/activins subgroup and the growth differentiation factor/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) group that often have opposing effects. These cytokines regulate gene expression via specific binding to distinct type II and type I receptors. TGF-β1 mainly signals via the type II receptor, TGF-β receptor type-2 (TGFBR2), and via the type I receptor, TGF-β receptor type-1 (TGFBR1 or ALK5). Myostatin signals via the type II receptor, activin receptor type-2B (ACVR2B), and activin A signals via type II receptors, activin receptor type-2A (ACVR2A) and ACVR2B. Activin A signals via type I receptor, activin receptor type-1B (ACVR1B or ALK4). Myostatin has been shown to signal via both TGFBR1 and ACVR1B in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kemaladewi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rebbapragada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">ten Dijke et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Interference with myostatin/activin A signalling by blocking their type II receptors ACVR2A/B may not be an appropriate strategy, since these receptors are also involved in BMP signalling, which stimulates muscle hypertrophy whereas myostatin/activin A signalling is associated with atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sartori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tsuchida et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, interference with signalling via these receptors may cause severe side effects, such as nose and gum bleeds, as has been shown in in DMD boys treated with soluble ACVR2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of type I receptors TGFBR1 and ACVR1B may provide a more specific and effective approach to alleviate muscle wasting pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sartori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tsuchida et al., 2008</xref>). However, very little is known about the role of these receptors in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and regeneration.</p><p>The aim of this study was to obtain insight in how myofibre-specific knockout of type I receptors <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1b</italic> affected muscle size as well as early muscle regeneration, inflammation and collagen deposition in both intact and injured muscle. We hypothesised that individual knockout of these TGF-β type I receptors would have marginal effects. Moreover, simultaneous inhibition of these type I receptors would substantially increase muscle size and enhance early myofibre regeneration, while attenuating fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> expression was successfully reduced after tamoxifen treatment</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate effects of mature myofibre-specific knockout of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1b</italic> on muscle morphology as well as early muscle regeneration, inflammation and collagen deposition in both uninjured muscle tissue and after acute cardiotoxin (CTX) injury.

Previous research has shown that inhibition of myostatin and to a lesser extent activin A is sufficient to induce muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that inhibition of TGF-β1 or activin A signaling via their type I receptor is insufficient to induce muscle hypertrophy.

This is likely the result of myofibre type-related hypertrophic capacity rather than myofibre type-specific receptor knockout bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy et al., 2012b</xref>). It has been suggested that mainly fast twitch myofibres possess the ability to hypertrophy, while slow twitch myofibres are unlikely to increase in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">van Wessel et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, ACVR2B is more abundantly expressed in type II than type I myofibres, thus a more substantial effect on myofibre hypertrophy was expected upon type I receptor depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Babcock et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, type IIB myofibre hypertrophy occurred without apparent accretion of myonuclei, which resulted in an approximately 70% increase in myonuclear domain. The lack of difference in the number of myonuclei per myofibre cross-section together with the lack of difference in myonuclear length in type IIB myofibres of TA indicates that the total number of nuclei per myofibre was not affected by simultaneous knockout of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>. Although for example exercise induced hypertrophy is often accompanied by increased myonuclei number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Conceição et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van der Meer et al., 2011</xref>), the myonuclear domain is known to be flexible and increases in myonuclear domain of 30% have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murach et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of myostatin signalling using soluble ACVR2B leads to hypertrophy without accretion of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that in type IIB myofibres myonuclear domain can increase by at least 70%, without requirement of accretion of myonuclei to sustain myofibre growth. To the best of our knowledge such increase in myonuclear domain has not been reported before.</p><p>Since myonuclei are required for mitochondrial biogenesis, a local reduction in oxidative capacity was expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hock and Kralli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotiadis et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, knockout of both <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> resulted in decreased SDH activity in the low oxidative region of TA. Previous research has shown that an inverse relation exists between myofibre CSA and oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van der Laarse et al., 1989</xref>), whereas myofibre CSA is positively correlated to glycolytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rivero et al., 1998</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that, similar to ‘Warburg effect’ in tumours, in hypertrophying skeletal muscle reprogramming towards a more glycolytic metabolism occurs. Glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2), which is particularly highly expressed in type II myofibres, contributes to the increased hypertrophic potential of type II myofibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Verbrugge et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although lack of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> decreased SDH activity, integrated SDH activity (SDH activity times CSA) was increased. Previous research has shown that integrated SDH activity correlates with the maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) and mitochondrial density, which suggests that the total oxidative capacity of these myofibres in <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van der Laarse et al., 1989</xref>). Present data show that by targeting both receptors simultaneously it is possible to deviate from the tight relation between myofibre size and oxidative metabolism (i.e. simultaneous increases in both myofibre size and oxidative capacity). The role of both receptors in the synthesis of mitochondria warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Lack of both <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> reduces the percentage of type IIB myofibres within the low oxidative region of the TA</title><p>Another remarkable finding was the reduction in the percentage of type IIB myofibres in the low oxidative region of the TA muscle of <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals.

Note that in a genetic knockout mouse model, absence of myostatin precedes myogenesis and may influence skeletal muscle development, whereas in our model TGF-β signalling was inhibited in mature skeletal muscle. The reduction in type IIB myofibres may also be a consequence of local damage to the myofibres, rather than a phenotypical change caused by receptor knockout. Taken together, these results indicate that type I receptor knockout in mature myofibres has minor effects on myofibre type distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Simultaneous knockout of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> in myofibre may result in accelerated early regeneration</title><p>We observed that simultaneous knockout of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> increased the CSA of regenerating myofibres compared to individual receptor knockout, while a trend was visible compared to controls. In addition, at day 0, simultaneous receptor knockout enhanced <italic>Hgf</italic> expression as well as the number of SCs per myofibre and concomitantly relative expression levels of <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>Myod,</italic> indicating that SCs were activated prior to CTX injection. Muscle regeneration is dependent on activation of Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs and sequential expression of myogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charge and Rudnicki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Delaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishido and Kasuga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>).

Simultaneous overexpression of IGF-1 and FGF-2 has a synergistic effect on both myoblast proliferation as well as fusion index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Boxhorn, 1989</xref>).

However, myogenic gene expression was increased prior to <italic>Igf1</italic> (Igf1ea) and <italic>Fgf2</italic> upregulation, which indicates that although these growth factors may positively contribute to early regeneration, upregulation of <italic>Igf1</italic> (Igf1ea) and <italic>Fgf2</italic> cannot fully explain effects on early regeneration.</p><p>Simultaneous receptor knockout did not reduce mRNA expression of E3 ligases during regeneration, indicating that the increase in myofibre CSA is not caused by reduced protein breakdown.

The observation that at all time points the number of proliferating SCs (i.e. Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells) was not different between control and <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals indicates that in the <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals muscle damage had initiated activation and proliferation in the injured region between days 2 and 4. Alternatively, SCs had migrated from adjacent myofibres to the site of injury or from intact regions along the myofibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishido and Kasuga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schultz et al., 1985</xref>). The accelerated myoblast proliferation and differentiation likely contributed to the enhanced protein synthesis and hypertrophy of newly formed myofibres.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we did not observe later stages of muscle regeneration.

In absence of injury, compared with control, 20-fold higher number of macrophages was found the in low oxidative area of TA in <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals, indicating increased immune cell residence at baseline before CTX injury. Two days post injury a large infiltration of mononucleated cells was observed in all groups, as well as a peak in relative expression levels of <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic>, <italic>Il1b,</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>.</p><p>Macrophages play an important role in the regulation of muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Macrophages are classified in M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>). Early after injury, gene expression of pan-macrophages marker <italic>Cd68</italic> and M2 macrophage marker <italic>Cd163</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the number of macrophages was increased in both control and <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals. Expression levels of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic>, which are typical cytokines expressed by M1 macrophages, were not higher than in control animals, while <italic>Igf1 (Igf1ea</italic>) expression, also known to be expressed by M1 macrophages, was increased in <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals which was likely advantageous to expand the SC pool and to induce hypertrophy of newly formed myofibres. Moreover, TGF-β1 expression was increased in muscle with simultaneous knockout of <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO. At a later stage after injury, M2 macrophages are known to promote myogenic differentiation and stimulate ECM deposition by releasing TGF-β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Novak et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that muscle-specific lack of both receptors promotes an inflammatory response by enhanced infiltration of macrophages which is associated with accelerated muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Lack of both <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> enhances gene expression of ECM components in both intact and injured TA muscle</title><p>In both uninjured TA muscle tissue, as well as after CTX injury simultaneous knockout of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1b</italic> in skeletal myofibre increased <italic>Ccn2</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic> mRNA expression. These increases in gene expression were conceivably caused by TGF-β signalling in other cell types present within the muscle tissue, that is fibroblasts. This hypothesis is supported by the infiltration of fibroblasts in TA muscle of <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals in the absence of injury, as well as increased gene expression levels of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>. Furthermore, after injury in <italic>Acvr1b:Tgfbr1</italic> CKO animals <italic>Tgfbr1, Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> levels were increased compared to those in other groups, which indicated increased infiltration of non-muscle cells upon injury. Together these results support the hypothesis that TGF-β and myostatin act on fibroblasts and possibly other cell types within the muscle tissue to induce expression of collagens. We previously showed that inhibition of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> in C2C12 myoblasts reduced <italic>Ccn2</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hillege et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, systemic administration of anti-TGF-β or soluble ACVR2B in murine X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice reduced muscular fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andreetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bo Li et al., 2012</xref>). In conclusion, to reduce expression of ECM components within skeletal muscle inhibition of TGF-β signalling in other cell types such as fibroblasts and satellite cells is required.</p><p>Chronic excessive ECM deposition leads to increased muscle stiffness and loss of function. However, transiently enhanced ECM deposition is essential to early muscle regeneration and results in scar free muscle repair in various types of acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahdy et al., 2015</xref>). In this study after CTX injury <italic>Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic> expression increased in all groups. Transient enhanced ECM deposition is required to maintain muscle structural integrity and provides a scaffold for regenerating myofibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kääriäinen et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, interaction between fibroblasts and SCs appears to be essential for proper muscle regeneration, since fibroblasts prevent early differentiation of SCs, while in turn SCs control the number of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murphy et al., 2011b</xref>). Thus the observed enhanced expression of ECM components in TA that lacks both receptors may contribute to the increased number of SCs at day 0 and acceleration of early muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Implications for ACVR1B and TGFBR1 inhibition as potential therapeutic strategy</title><p>An important limitation of our study is that we investigated effects of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> knockout on early regeneration after an acute injury.

Immediately after Eosin staining, slides were rinsed 2 × in 100% alcohol for 10 s and 2 × in xylene for 10 min. Stained sections were mounted in Entellan (Merck, 107960, Darmstadt, Germany), covered with coverslip and dried overnight before analysis.</p><p>For Sirius Red staining, sections were air dried for 10 min at RT, then they were fixed in acetone at –20 °C for 10 min and subsequently fixed in saturated Bouin for 30 min at RT. Samples were stained by Sirius Red for 30 min and washed in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid. Then, sections were rapidly dehydrated in 100% ethanol and xylene twice. Stained sections were mounted in Entellan, covered with coverslip and dried overnight before analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bruin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss BV, Breda The Netherlands) with Basler camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) using Manual WSI scanner software (Microvisioneer) for collecting whole scan images. Regeneration area percentage at day 0 was referred to as the area of myofibres with central nuclei divided by total the area of a whole muscle cross-section. Morphometry was performed using ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Microscope slides with muscle sections were air dried for 10 min. For Pax7 staining, sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at RT for 10 min and washed in PBS-T (0.05% Tween 20). Sections were blocked at RT with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50,062Z, Waltham, MA, USA) (60 min for myosin heavy chain (MyHC), eMyHC, F4/80 and Myogenin staining, or 30 min for Pax7 staining) or 5% NGS with 0.3% Triton-X100 for 60 min for Ki67/Pax7 staining. Sections for Pax7 staining were subsequently blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies (Key Resources Table) in 10% NGS (for MyHC, eMyHC or Myogenin) or in 0.1% BSA (Pax7, F4/80 or Ki67/Pax7) at RT for 60 min or overnight. Then sections were incubated in secondary antibodies (Key Resources Table) in 10% NGS for MyHC and eMyHC staining, or in 0.1% BSA for Pax7 or F4/80 staining at RT in the dark for 60 min. After this, sections were incubated in 1:50 diluted wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Fisher Scientific, 11590816, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in PBS at RT for 20 min. Finally, slides were carefully dried and mounted with Vectashield hardset mounting medium with 4‘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Brunschwig, H1500, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Slides were dried overnight at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy and analysis</title><p>Images of all immunofluorescence assays were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 M, Hyland Scientific, Stanwood, WA, USA) with a PCO SensiCam camera (PCO, Kelheim, Germany) using the program Slidebook 5.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Göttingen, Germany). The images were analysed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Individual images were taken across the entire cross-section and assembled into a composite panoramic image. For TA, the inner part of the muscle tissue was referred to as high oxidative region and the outer part was referred to as low oxidative region. For myofibre type analysis, 250 myofibres within each part were characterised in TA. Hybrid myofibre fluorescence was assessed by myofibres stained by double colours and pure myofibres were determined by single colour staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloemberg and Quadrilatero, 2012</xref>). To determine CSA per myofibre type, CSA was measured of 30 myofibres per type, or as many as were present within the tissue per TA. For EDL, myofibre type and CSA of all myofibres within the muscle were determined by SMASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith and Barton, 2014</xref>). Within images stained for Pax7, the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> nuclei and the number of myofibres were determined in the low oxidative region of TA from about 200 myofibres (5 fields per specimen). SCs were defined as Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells that were located between plasma and basal lamina of myofibre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lindstrom and Thornell, 2009</xref>). Within muscle sections images stained for F4/80, the density of macrophages in TA at day 0 was determined in 10 randomly selected locations and in at least 3 locations within the injured region at day 2 and 4 after injury. Macrophages were defined as F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells that were located in the interstitial region of the myofibres at day 0. To measure the number of myonuclei per type IIB myofibre, 100 type IIB myofibres in the low oxidative region were taken into account and nuclei were considered as myonuclei when they were located within the cytoplasm below the basal lamina. To determine myonuclear length, images were taken at ×10 magnification using a fluorescent microscope. Mean myonuclear length was determined as the average value of 30 nuclei. For regeneration analysis, myofibre CSA measurement was performed by outlining 50 eMyHC<sup>+</sup> myofibres from three randomly chosen fields within the regenerating area in muscle cross-sections of day 4. RI was defined as the number of nuclei within eMyHC<sup>+</sup> myofibres divided by the number of eMyHC<sup>+</sup> myofibres, all eMyHC<sup>+</sup> myofibres in three randomly chosen fields (1.38 mm<sup>2</sup> per field) within the regenerating area were included in the analysis. The densities of Ki67<sup>+</sup>, Pax7<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> and Myogenin<sup>+</sup> cells in TA were determined by counting the number of cells per mm<sup>2</sup> of muscle CSA. Ten images in low oxidative region of TA on days 0, 2, and 4 were randomly selected. All analyses were performed at ×20 magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>SDH assay</title><p>Succinate dehydrogenase activity was quantified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van der Laarse et al., 1989</xref>. Breiefly, freshly muscle cross-sections (10 µm thick) were air dried for 15 min at RT. Sections were incubated in prewarmed SDH medium (37.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, 37.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, added acid to pH 7.6, 75 mM sodium succinate, 5 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 g/L tetranitroblue tetrazolium (TNBT)) for 10 min at 37 °C. Sections were rinsed 3 seconds in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid. Then sections were rinsed for 1 min twice in ultrapure water. Finally, sections were mounted in glycerine gelatin (Merck, 48723, Darmstadt, Germany) with coverslips and dried overnight before analysis. Images were captured by a Leica DMRB microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) with calibrated grey filters and a CCD camera (Sony XC77CE, Towada, Japan) connected to a LG-3 frame grabber (Scion, Frederick, MD, United States). The absorbances of the SDH-reaction product in the myofibre cross-sections were determined at 660 nm using a calibrated microdensitometer and ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). SDH activity (ΔA<sub>660</sub>∙µm<sup>–1</sup>∙s<sup>–1</sup>) was quantified at 5 locations in low oxidative region at ×10 magnification by measuring the rate of absorbance per section thickness per second (ΔA<sub>660</sub>/(10 µm∙600 s)) after subtracting background activity. The integrated SDH activity (ΔA<sub>660</sub>∙µm∙s<sup>–1</sup>) was defined as SDH activity ×myofibre CSA. Absorbance was measured in a total of 50 myofibres per TA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphs were made in Prism version 8 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA). All data were presented as mean + standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS version 26 (IBM, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sample size was determined a priori, based on previously published in vivo research on TGF-β and myostatin. Statistical significance for multiple comparisons was determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), three-way ANOVA or independent t-test. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Data normality was tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test (p &lt; 0.05). Homogeneity of variance was tested with a Levene’s test (p &lt; 0.01). If necessary, data were square or log transformed. Post hoc Bonferroni or Games-Howell corrections were performed. If normality was violated a Kruskall Wallis test was performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed according to the national guidelines approved by the Central Committee for Animal Experiments (CCD) (AVD112002017862) and the Institute of Animal Welfare (IvD) of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-77610-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files have been provided for Figures 1 to 5.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hillege</surname><given-names>MMG</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Galli</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bertolino</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoogaars</surname><given-names>WMH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaspers</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Data from: Lack of Tgfbr1 and Acvr1b synergistically stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and accelerates muscle regeneration</data-title> <source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.jh9w0vtd5</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Philippe Bertolino (Cancer Research Center of Lyon, French Institute of Health and Medical Research) and Peter ten Dijke (Leiden University Medical Center) for providing the <italic>Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mouse lines.

This paper focusses on their modification in skeletal myocytes and their atrophic actions and fibrotic change. Such Tgf downregulatory effects have potential translational importance in muscle wasting disease of wide clinical importance. The paper fulfils its defined objectives. The experiments lead to a straightforward emergence of its conclusion bearing on muscle atrophy and recovery from injury.</p><p>Its strengths include clearcut demonstration leading to a clear narrative from experimental platform to scientific outcomes of (a) a straightforward downregulation of the target receptors in the knockout experimental platform. (b) a clearcut demonstration of a consequent IIB cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype correlated with a succinate dehydrogenase downregulation compared to fl- attributed to (c) reciprocal positive and negative effects of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and Murf-1 e signalling. (d) The findings were substantiated in an in vivo injury system further implicating extracellular matrix deposition. Thus, combined knockout of these TFGbr1 and Acvr1b receptors increases the number of satellite cells and improves regeneration post cardiotoxin-induced injury by stimulation of myogenic gene expression resulting in improved myogenesis.</p><p>Its weaknesses should prompt future physiological studies of a recovery of muscle function in terms of its triggering and tension generation capacity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77610.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Quantification of myofiber size will have to be more accurately measured (reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that quantification of all myofibres in a cross-section of a muscle is most reliable to measure myofibre cross-section area (CSA). However, it is difficult for the large tibialis anterior muscle to measure the size for all myofibres per myofibre type as there are also hybrid myofibers that express two or more myosin heavy chain isoforms. For TA muscle, we determined for each myofibre type the mean CSA based on the average CSA of 30 randomly selected myofibres. This was done as we had shown previously by measuring the size of all myofibres within EDL muscle (please see below) that an average value of 30 muscle fibres would give a sufficient accuracy [1]. The reviewers suggested we verify whether the effects of TGF-β type I receptors knockout apply exclusively to the TA muscle. To test this, we now have made cryo-sections for the EDL muscles and stained these for myosin heavy chain and quantified myofibre CSA for each myosin type based on all EDL myofibres within a cross-section (the myofibre numbers varied from 500-900 between individual muscles). The effects of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> and/or Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> were fairly similar and in the same order of magnitude as those observed for the TA muscle.</p><p>To confirm that the average values of TA myofibre CSA based on 30 myofibers was sufficient to obtain a valid and reliable estimate, we calculated for EDL muscles how the mean myofibre CSA would change when a lower number of myofibres was analysed rather than the total number within a cross-section. Comparison of the mean myofibre CSA from 30 myofibres yielded a mean myofibre CSA for the groups being less than 2% different from the mean value based on the total number of myofibers. These data confirmed our previous observation that the estimate for CSA based on 30 myofibres is reliable.</p><p>The data of the EDL muscle are now added to the manuscript and described in the methods and Results sections:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“In contrast to observations in TA, CSA of type IIA and type IIX myofibres in EDL muscle of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were increased by 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold compared to those of control mice, respectively. However, similar to TA muscle, CSA of type IIB myofibres of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice was increased most substantially compared to that of control mice (1.7-fold) (Figure 1F).”</p><p>Methods section:</p><p>“For EDL, myofibre type and CSA of all myofibres within the muscle were determined by SMASH [2].”</p><p>Figures: Figure 1 F is added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to prior literature in the field, specifically the effect of TGF-β pathways on myofiber size, the state of Phospho-Smad2/3 in vivo must be evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> were knocked out individually or in combination within myofibers. We showed that the expression levels of both genes were decreased. We have now quantified the phosphorylated Smad2/3 levels by western blotting in both TA muscles and EDL muscles.</p><p>Although p-Smad2/Smad2/3 and p-Smad3/Smad2/3 levels were not significantly different in TA muscles of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals and controls, p-Smad2/Smad2/3 levels were reduced in EDL of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to control animals. In TA of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, p-Smad2/smad2/3 and p-Smad3/Smad2/3 relative intensity levels were 90 and 60% lower than those in controls, and in EDL this was 30 and 10% lower, respectively. The large variances in western blot band intensities made it difficult to conclude the effects of simultaneous TGF-β receptors knockout on Smad2/3 phosphorylation.</p><p>Note, however, that in the current study, <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> genes were knocked out specifically within skeletal myofibres. Skeletal muscle contains more cell types than only myofibres, such as immune cells, fibroblasts and satellite cells, in which signalling via Smad2/3 is expected to be unaffected in our model. Based on H&amp;E and IF staining, the number of mononucleated cells appeared to be substantially higher in TA of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals (Figure 1 D, 2 C). This issue will be further addressed in the next paragraph. It is conceivable that Smad2/3 phosphorylation within other cells in the muscle will have masked in part the effect of simultaneous knockout of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> within the myofibre.</p><p>Effects of single knockout of either <italic>Acvr1b</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> were more ambiguous, as in some cases Smad2/3 phosphorylation was higher than that in control. It may be due to the functional redundancy of these two receptors such that when only one receptor type was knocked out, ligands may signal via the other receptor to activate Smad2/3 signalling. Unchanged Smad2/3 phosphorylation is in line with the lack of phenotypical changes in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to control animals.</p><p>Western blot results of p-Smad2/3 in TA and EDL are now presented.</p><p>We have added the following text:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“Phosphorylation of TGF-β type I receptor is known to activate canonical Smad2/3 signalling. Therefore, we examined the effects of TGF-β type I receptor knockout on Smad2/3 phosphorylation in both TA and EDL muscle (Figure 3B). Single knockout did not affect phosphorylated / total protein ratios for Smad2 and Smad3 in muscles of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> or Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, which was in line with the lack of effect on muscle size and phenotype and suggested that at least the presence of one of the two receptors was sufficient to maintain the Smad signalling. With regard to Smad2/3 phosphorylation in TA and EDL of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl:</sup>Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, a 31% reduction was shown for phosphorylation of Smad2 in EDL while phosphorylated levels of Smads2 and 3 tended to be reduced in TA.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“In addition, reduced Smad2/3 phosphorylation within myofibres likely contributes to the increase in Akt signalling and reduction in E3 ligase expression. In TA and EDL of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, Smad2/3 phosphorylation was or tended to be reduced, respectively. Note that TGF-β type I receptors were specifically knocked out in myofibres and that Smad2/3 in various other cell types can still be phosphorylated by TGF-β1, myostatin and activin A, masking the changes in myofibres.”</p><p>“In muscles that lack either <italic>Acvr1b</italic> or <italic>Tgfbr1,</italic> we observed no changes in Smad2/3 signalling, which is in accordance with the observation there is no or modest effect on muscle hypertrophy.”</p><p>Methods section:</p><p>“GM tissue and whole EDL muscles were lysed (Potter S 8533024, B.

Below we explain how we have added new data for the three different cell types as below.</p><p>1) Identification of proliferating and differentiating MuSCs:</p><p>To assess the total number of satellite cells and the number of proliferating MusCs and their state of activation, we performed staining for Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup>/DAPI cells or Myogenin<sup>+</sup>/DAPI cells in TA muscle at day 0, 2 and 4 and quantified their numbers. In the original manuscript, we showed that at day 0 the number of satellite cells in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was already 3 times more than that of control muscles. The additional analyses now showed that at each time point the density of Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in the injured region was not different between control and Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, indicating that the number of proliferating satellite cells was not affected by the knockout of the receptors. However, at day 4 post injury, we found more than 2-fold higher number of both Pax7<sup>+</sup> and Myogenin<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that the combined knockout of both receptors enhanced myogenic differentiation of SCs in the Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl.</sup> Together these data suggest that in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals regeneration in TA of is likely associated with an increased number of SCs already present within the muscle before the cardiotoxin-induced injury and that proliferation as well as SC differentiation were promoted before and upon cardiotoxin induced injury.</p><p>Data of dual staining for Ki67/Pax7/DAPI and Myogenin/DAPI cells are presented in the Results section and discussed. The following text and figures have been added:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“On day 0, the number of proliferating cells (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) in low oxidative region of TA of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was about 7.6-fold higher than that in control animals (Figure 5E). Two days after injury, a 6-fold increase of proliferating cells was found in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to that on day 0. Moreover, at day 4 after injury, the number of proliferating cells in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was 1.7-fold higher than that in control animals. To determine whether the increased CSA of regenerating myofibres in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was due to an increased SCs number and advanced differentiation of myoblasts, we tested SCs proliferation and activation status. Although at day 0 and 4, the number of SCs (Pax7<sup>+</sup>) cells was more in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to that in control animals (Figure 5F), the number of proliferating SCs (Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup>) did not differ from that in control (Figure 5G, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Nevertheless, an accelerated rate of increase in Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells was shown. Note that, at day 4 after injury the number of myogenin<sup>+</sup> cells was more than 2.2-fold higher in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals (Figure 5H, Figure 5—figure supplement 3). These findings indicate that muscle regeneration upon acute injury was improved in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, which was attributed to an accelerated myogenic process.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Moreover, for Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals the numbers of SCs and differentiating myoblasts within the injured regions 4 days post injury were more than doubled compared to those in control animals. The observation that at all time points the number of proliferating SCs (i.e. Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells) was not different between control and Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals indicates that in the Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals muscle damage had initiated activation and proliferation in the injured region between day 2 and 4. Alternatively, SCs had migrated from adjacent myofibres to the site of injury or from intact regions along the myofibres [3, 4]. The accelerated myoblast proliferation and differentiation likely contributed to the enhanced protein synthesis and hypertrophy of newly formed myofibres.”</p><p>Methods section:</p><p>“The densities of Ki67<sup>+</sup>, Pax7<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> and Myogenin<sup>+</sup> cells in TA were determined by counting the number of cells per mm<sup>2</sup> muscle CSA. Ten images in low oxidative region of TA on day 0, 2 or 4 were randomly selected. All analyses were performed at 20× magnification.”</p><p>Figures: Figures 5 E, F, G and H and figure 5—figure supplement 1, 2, 3 have been added.</p><p>2) Identification of immune cells:</p><p>In the original manuscript, we had shown that at day 0 in TA muscles of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, <italic>Tgf-β</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic> and <italic>Cd163</italic> mRNA expression levels were enhanced compared to those of control animals (Figure 4 D). In order to characterise the mononucleated cells that infiltrated the muscles of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals at day 0, we now have performed immunofluorescent stainings to identify F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages. These results are now presented in figure 2C. In line with the gene expression levels of macrophage markers, we now also show that prior to cardiotoxin-induced injury, the macrophage number in TA muscle of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was already 14-fold higher than that in control muscles.</p><p>To determine the effect of in Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 knockout on the number of macrophages during regeneration after muscle injury, we now present macrophage numbers within the injured region in figure 5C and figure 5—figure supplement 1. At day 4, more F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were found in the injured than that of control muscles. Macrophages play an important role in muscle regeneration as anti-inflammatory macrophages have been reported to stimulate myogenic cell differentiation while depletion of F4/80 macrophages attenuates the radial growth of myotubes and myofibers within the injured region [5]. Moreover, M2 macrophages have been shown to be pivotal for myofibre regeneration and maintaining myofibre size [6]. The observed increased macrophage gene expressions and higher macrophage cell number at day 0 and day 4 in the current study indicate an enhanced immune response by simultaneous knockout of Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 which likely have facilitated muscle regeneration.</p><p>Data of staining for F4/80 at day 0, 2 and 4 are now presented in the Results section and discussed. The following text and figures have been added:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We next characterised cells surrounding the spontaneously regenerating regions in TA as being macrophages or fibroblasts. F4/80 staining showed that the number of macrophages per mm<sup>2</sup> muscle CSA in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was increased by 14-fold (23.7 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to that in control (1.7 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals (1.7 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), while in Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals (4.5 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) the number of macrophages per mm<sup>2</sup> did not differ compared to that in the other three groups (Figure 2C).”</p><p>“Next, we hypothesized an increased immune response was involved in the accelerated muscle regeneration process after cardiotoxin induced muscle injury in the absence of Acvr1b and Tgfbr1. Macrophages were identified by F4/80 IF staining (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The number of macrophages in TA of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals at day 4 post injury was significantly increased compared to that in control muscle (Figure 5C).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Macrophages play an important role in regulation of muscle regeneration [7]. Macrophages are classified in M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages [8]. Early after injury, gene expression of pan-macrophages marker <italic>Cd68</italic> and M2 macrophage marker <italic>Cd163</italic> [9], as well as the number of macrophages were increased in both control and Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals. Expression levels of <italic>Il-6</italic> and <italic>Il-1β</italic>, which are typical cytokines expressed by M1 macrophages, were not higher than in control animals, while <italic>Igf-1ea</italic> expression, also known to be expressed by M1 macrophages, was increased in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals which was likely advantageous to expand the SC pool and to induce hypertrophy of newly formed myofibres. Moreover, TGF-β1 expression was increased in muscle with simultaneous knockout of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup>. At a later stage after injury, M2 macrophages are known to promote myogenic differentiation and stimulate ECM deposition by releasing TGF-β1 [5, 10]. Taken together, we conclude that muscle-specific lack of both receptors promotes an inflammatory response by enhanced infiltration of macrophages which is associated with accelerated muscle regeneration.”</p><p>Methods section:</p><p>“Within muscle sections stained for F4/80, the density of macrophages in TA at day 0 was determined in 10 randomly selected locations and at in least 3 locations within the injured region at day 2 and 4 after injury.”</p><p>Figures: Figure 2C, 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 have been added.</p><p>3) Identification of fibroblasts</p><p>To explain why ECM gene expression was enhanced in muscles of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, we assessed whether there was an increase in the number of fibroblasts (using <italic>Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, as markers for fibroblasts/mesenchymal cells). We performed immunofluorescent stainings for TCF4 and PDGFRa. However, these stainings were unreliable due to the non-specific binding of antibodies. As an alternative solution to estimate fibroblast presence, we analysed <italic>Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mRNA expression levels using qPCR. The results were added to figure 6 C. At day 0, expression of <italic>Tcf4</italic> was solely enhanced in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to control animals. At day 4 after induction of injury, <italic>Tcf4</italic> mRNA levels in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals were enhanced compared to those in the other groups. <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mRNA expression levels at both day 0 and day 4 were significantly higher in TA of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals than those in controls. These findings indicate that combined knockout of Acvr1b and Tgfbr1 in skeletal muscle increases infiltration of fibroblasts acutely after injury.</p><p>Based on our results it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion whether the number of fibroblasts within the muscle tissue of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals was increased or not, although we consider this plausible. Nevertheless, regardless of the number of fibroblasts within the muscle tissue of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, the increased <italic>Tgf-β1</italic> expression levels expressed by the increased number of macrophages, was likely the stimulus for the enhanced activation of available fibroblasts, myoblasts, myotubes and to stimulate <italic>Ctgf, Col1a1</italic> and <italic>Col3a1</italic> mRNA expressions [11, 12]. We believe these data provide a plausible explanation for the enhanced ECM gene expression observed at day 0. In addition, upon injury, ECM gene expression levels were increased in all groups, which is in line with the observations by other studies showing that collagen expression is transiently increased during regeneration.</p><p>Gene expression levels of <italic>Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrα</italic> at day 0, 2 and 4 have now been presented in the Results section and are discussed. The following text and figures have been added:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“To determine whether the number of fibroblasts was increased in TA muscles by knockout of <italic>Acvr1b</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>, we assessed relative mRNA expression levels of the fibroblast markers, transcription factor 4 (<italic>Tcf4</italic>) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (<italic>Pdgfra</italic>) [13]. At day 0, <italic>Tcf4</italic> expression levels of TA in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were increased compared to those in control animals, but was not different from those in Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> or Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals. In Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, relative <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression levels were increased compared to those of control and Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals. Noteworthy, four days post injury, both <italic>Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mRNA levels were increased in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animal compared to those in control mice (Figure 6C).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“This hypothesis is supported by the infiltration of fibroblasts in TA muscle of Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals in the absence of injury, as well as by increased gene expression levels of <italic>Pdgfrα,</italic> which is expressed in most fibroblasts subtypes [14]. Furthermore, after injury in Acvr1b<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, <italic>Tgfbr1, Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrα</italic> mRNA levels were increased, which indicates increased infiltration of fibroblasts upon injury.”</p><p>Figure: Figure 6 C</p><p>References:</p><p>1. van Dijk, M., et al., Reduced dietary intake of micronutrients with antioxidant properties negatively impacts muscle health in aged mice.
