hold information in memory over a delay period of seconds, is a fundamental constituent of cognition. Delay-period activity in sensory cortices has been observed in WM tasks, but whether and when the activity plays a functional role for memory maintenance remains unclear. Here, we investigated the causal role of auditory cortex (AC) for memory maintenance in mice performing an auditory WM task. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that AC neurons were active not only during the presentation of the auditory stimulus but also early in the delay period. Furthermore, optogenetic suppression of neural activity in AC during the stimulus epoch and early delay period impaired WM performance, whereas suppression later in the delay period did not. Thus, AC is essential for information encoding and maintenance in auditory WM task, especially during the early delay period.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Working memory is the ability to hold information in your head for a few seconds while making decisions, planning or applying logical reasoning to problem solving. It is a fundamental component of cognition, and yet it remains unclear where working memory is stored in the brain.</p><p>The prefrontal cortex – the front lobe of the brain – is likely the main hub of working memory, since it is responsible for executive functions, such as decision making and planning. This idea is supported by experiments showing sustained brain activity in the prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks. Lesions in that part of the brain also lead to profound deficits in working memory. However, there is increasing evidence that other parts of the brain which process sensory information also participate in retaining working memory. The auditory cortex, which processes sound, is one such candidate.</p><p>To find out whether the auditory cortex has a role to play in working memory, Yu, Hu, Shi et al. trained mice to lick a water spout after hearing the same sound twice in a row, 1.5 seconds apart, and then measured the activities of the mice’s neurons. This showed that neurons in the auditory cortex were active not only when the mice were presented with sound cues, but also for a short time during the delay period between sounds. Yu, Hu, Shi et al. then manipulated this neurons to inactivate them for a fraction of a second after the first sound, which resulted in the animals’ working memory was impaired. However, suppressing the activity of the auditory cortex cells in the later stages of the sound delay period had no effect on working memory.</p><p>These results indicate that although the auditory cortex may not be involved in storing information for the entire working memory process, it is crucial for encoding of auditory information. In summary, this work uncovers how neurons in the auditory cortex underlie working memory. Further research focusing on these neurons could explain how working memory deteriorates with age, or why it is impaired in people with learning difficulties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20ZR1417800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jinghong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19ZR1416500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jinghong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Auditory cortex is essential for information encoding and maintenance in auditory working memory, especially during the early delay period.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Working memory (WM) refers to the ability to actively hold information in memory over a time scale of seconds. It is a fundamental component of various cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley, 1992</xref>). Previous studies have found that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for WM because sustained neural activity was observed in PFC during the delay period of WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meyers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Romo et al., 1999</xref>) and lesions to PFC produced profound WM deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrides, 2000</xref>). Besides, there is increasing evidence suggesting that sensory cortices are important components of the circuitry that underlies WM when the task requires short-term retention of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scimeca et al., 2018</xref>). For example, human fMRI studies had been successful in decoding WM information from the activity of sensory cortices, both visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison and Tong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serences et al., 2009</xref>) and auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linke and Cusack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke et al., 2011</xref>). Electrophysiological recordings in monkeys had observed memory-related activity during the delay period in sensory cortices in visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Supèr et al., 2001</xref>), auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gottlieb et al., 1989</xref>), and somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou and Fuster, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou and Fuster, 2000</xref>) modalities. However, whether and when sensory cortices play a functional role in sensory memory maintenance in WM task remains unclear.</p><p>The auditory cortex (AC) is known to be a major site for auditory information processing. Some recent studies have reported that AC neurons also play a role in a number of auditory behavior tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Middlebrooks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, correlates of auditory WM have been reported in AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigelow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scott et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we delineate the functional role of AC in auditory WM.</p><p>Traditional methods for perturbing neural activity such as surgical lesion, pharmacological inactivation, and tissue cooling techniques do not provide the temporal resolution required for delineating the functional role of AC in memory maintenance in WM task because they disrupt both the encoding of the sensory stimuli and their retention in WM. Furthermore, the activity could not be silenced rapidly enough to test when AC contributes to memory maintenance during the delay period.</p><p>In the present study, we used a combination of optogenetics and electrophysiology methods to examine the functional role of AC in auditory WM. Because we were particularly interested to know when AC contributes to auditory memory maintenance, we applied optogenetic silencing at different time points across the delay period. We found that AC neurons exhibited elevated activity not only during the presentation of the auditory stimulus but also during the early delay period. Furthermore, optogenetic suppression of AC activity during the stimulus epoch and early delay period caused a reduction in WM performance, whereas suppression later in the delay period did not. These findings reveal a causal role of AC in encoding and maintaining the auditory information in the auditory WM task, especially early in the delay period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral performance in auditory WM task</title><p>We trained head-fixed mice to perform an auditory delayed match to sample (DMS) task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

To quantify the ability to discriminate between the two stimuli, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean ROC values for the population of AC neurons increased rapidly after the onset of the auditory stimulus and retained above the value of 0.5 during the early delay (&lt;800 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). The permutation test also showed that about 50% of neurons showed significant sample selectivity during the stimulus and early delay (500 ms after stimulus offset) (p&lt;0.05). The proportion decreased to 20–30% during the subsequent period of 500–800 ms and dropped to about 10% after 800 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). These results indicated that AC neurons carried the auditory information during the early delay period in WM task.</p><p>To determine whether this delay-period activity was related to the task or only reflected the continuation of the auditory response, we recorded 836 neurons during the passive presentation of the stimulus. 255 neurons responded to at least one auditory sample stimulus (compared with baseline activity, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.05). In the passive presentation condition, AC neurons exhibited robust responses and showed stimulus selectivity during the sample. They showed selectivity for a much shorter interval in the delay period, in contrast to results obtained during WM task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicated that the continuation of neural activity into the delay period in WM task was not a passive process but was related to the animals’ behavior.</p><p>We observed that after the offset of the 200 ms sample stimulus, the neuron continued to exhibit activity for 800 ms into the delay period, 1000 ms from the stimulus onset in total. To test whether the temporal dynamics of delay-period activity is relative to the stimulus onset or offset, we increased the stimulus duration to 300 ms and 400 ms and test whether the sustained activity would shift with later stimulus offset. The AC activity was recorded from a subgroup of mice (n = 4) while performing the auditory WM task with the stimulus duration of 300 ms or 400 ms. The averaged population firing rates showed that the neurons exhibited phasic responses during the auditory sample stimulus presentation. After the offset of the sample stimulus, the neurons continued to exhibit elevated activity for 700 ms into the delay period in the 300 ms stimulus duration task and exhibit elevated activity for 600 ms into the delay period in the 400 ms stimulus duration task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together with the result from the 200 ms sample stimulus duration task, which showed that the neurons continued to exhibit elevated activity for 800 ms into the delay period, all of these results showed that AC neurons exhibited elevated activity for 1000 ms from the stimulus onset, regardless of the duration of the sample stimulus. These results suggested that the temporal dynamics of the delay-period activity in AC might be relative to the stimulus onset rather than the offset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Early delay activity of AC is required for memory maintenance in auditory WM task</title><p>To directly test whether and when AC contributes to auditory WM, we suppressed the activity of AC pyramidal neurons transiently during the delay period with optogenetic methods. It was achieved through expressing the inhibitory halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in pyramidal neurons by injecting AAV-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP into AC. The expression and functionality of NpHR were verified by immunostaining and optetrode recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>). We applied optogenetic suppression during the delay period by randomly interleaving ‘laser ON’ and ‘laser OFF’ trials in the same behavioral session. Suppressing the activity of AC pyramidal neurons during the delay period caused a strong impairment in task performance (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=1.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, laser ON: 64.84 ± 1.59%; laser OFF: 77.98 ± 1.17%, n = 8), with a substantial increase in false alarm rate (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=2.63 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, laser ON: 50.96 ± 2.65%; laser OFF: 31.66 ± 1.71%, n = 8) and a small decrease in hit rate (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.018, laser ON: 80.52 ± 1.74%; laser OFF: 87.69 ± 2.04%, n = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>).

Again, optogenetic suppression of AC during the delay period resulted in substantial impairment in task performance (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.025, laser ON: 63.69 ± 2.58%; laser OFF: 73.48 ± 2.84%, n = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>Electrophysiology results showed that AC neurons continued to exhibit activity for 800 ms into the delay period, and these activities did not persist any further. We speculated that AC neurons might carry auditory information only during this early delay period. Therefore, optogenetic suppression of AC would be expected to affect WM only when applied during this early delay period. To test this idea, we divided the delay into two epochs, 300–800 ms and 800–1300 ms, and applied optogenetic suppression briefly within each epoch individually. Notably, optogenetic suppression during the epoch of 300–800 ms caused a strong reduction in behavioral performance (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.01, laser ON: 70.36 ± 2.5%; laser OFF: 80.51 ± 1.58%, n = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

To test this ability in mice, we added a noise distractor (20–20,000 Hz, 200 ms, 60 dB) during the early (300–500 ms) delay period of the WM task. Mice were first trained to perform the WM task, and then the noise distractor was added. Mice could quickly adapt to the WM task with noise distractor, despite the initial drop in performance. After 2 days of training, the performance on the third day of the WM task with noise distractor was no worse than that in the simple WM task (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.247, WM task with noise distractor: 79.55 ± 1.77%; simple WM task: 82.4 ± 1.58%, n = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

First, we trained another group of mice to perform a delayed go/no-go auditory discrimination task. The stimuli were the same as the DMS task, except that mice made a decision depending on the first stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). This task required auditory perception, the memory of the task-relevant information, but not auditory frequency information retention during the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goard et al., 2016</xref>; Kamigaki T and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>). Laser illumination was applied after the sample stimulus and before the go signal, simulating the delay period in the DMS task. We found that laser illumination had no effect on the behavior (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.335, laser ON: 76.81 ± 2.01%, laser OFF: 79.9 ± 2.34%, n = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Therefore, AC delay-period activity appeared to be more important in memory of the auditory cue but not the action plan. Second, mice were trained to perform a go/no-go auditory discrimination task. The stimuli were the same as the DMS task, except that mice made a decision based on the second stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This task retained the general processes such as attention or expectation of the forthcoming second stimulus but did not require auditory WM during the delay period. Laser illumination was applied after the starting cue and before the sample stimulus, simulating the delay period in the DMS task. The result showed that laser illumination produced a smaller effect that was not significantly different from the laser-off condition (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.536, laser ON: 81.55 ± 3.1%, laser OFF: 84.71 ± 2.2%, n = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).

Experiments showed that AC neurons were active not only during the presentation of the auditory stimulus but also during the early delay period when no stimulus was presented. Further experiments showed that optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in AC during the stimulus epoch and early delay period caused a substantial reduction in WM performance, whereas suppressing later in the delay period did not. These results indicated that although AC may not be involved in WM storage during the whole delay period, it is crucial for WM tasks in the initial encoding of auditory information, maintaining the memory trace for a limited time, and then transferring this information for further WM storage elsewhere.</p><p>The role of sensory cortices in WM is debate. There is evidence supporting the idea that the same system involved in sensory processing also participates in retaining sensory information in WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scimeca et al., 2018</xref>). It is based on fMRI decoding and monkey neurophysiology studies showing that during the memory period neuronal activity in sensory cortices can be maintained and reflected the identity of the remembered stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuster and Jervey, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison and Tong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mendoza-Halliday et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, perturbation of neural activity in sensory cortices can impair WM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colombo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are also studies showing that when the distractor is applied during the delay period, the sustained neural activity and WM decoding were no longer present in sensory cortices. Meanwhile, the presence of distractor had no impact on behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettencourt and Xu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 1996</xref>). This suggests that sensory cortices may not be essential for memory maintenance in WM task and WM-related activities observed in sensory cortices may largely reflect feedback signals indicative of the storage of WM content elsewhere in the brain, probably in the posterior parietal cortex and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leavitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Active WM maintenance requires resistance to distractors presented during the delay period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddeley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettencourt and Xu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 1996</xref>). If the delay-period activity of a sensory cortex is essential for WM, the neural activity should be able to maintain information even following the distractor. With regard to the present study, if suppressing the delay-period activity of AC following the distractor impairs the performance, it will implicate AC in active information maintenance in WM task. As we expected, our result showed that suppressing the early delay-period activity of AC after the distractor resulted in performance impairment. Therefore, AC is essential for active WM maintenance even in the face of the distractor. The early delay-period activity observed in AC reflected the active memory maintenance, not the residual auditory trace. Thus, our present results support the idea that sensory cortices participate in sensory information maintenance in WM task.</p><p>In the present study, we observed a temporal-specific effect of AC suppression during the delay period of WM task. Only optogenetic suppression of AC activity during the stimulus epoch and early delay period (300–800 ms) caused a substantial reduction in WM performance. These results were consistent with the electrophysiology results showing that AC neurons exhibited elevated activity during stimulus presentation and the first 800 ms of the delay period. These findings agree with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies in humans showing that disruption of primary somatosensory cortex functioning early in the delay period (at 300 ms or 600 ms) interfered with tactile WM performance. In contrast, TMS later in the delay did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the WM performance impairment induced by delay-period optogenetic suppression of AC cannot be attributed to direct disruption of auditory perception. Because AC suppression during the delay period of a delayed go/no-go auditory discrimination task that also required auditory sample stimulus perception had no effect on the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). It is also unlikely that the optogenetic suppression during the delay period impaired perception of the test stimulus. Because laser illumination during the delay period of 800–1300 ms, before the test stimulus, did not affect WM behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the result of the DMS task, we found that suppression of AC activity during the delay period of a delayed go/no-go task did not affect behavior. There is an essential difference in the memory requirement for the two tasks. While the DMS task requires short-term memory of the sensory cue, the delayed go/no-go task is likely to require maintenance of the action plan. This result suggests that the sensory cortex is essential in memory of the sensory cue but not the action plan. This result was also in accord with a recent study finding that the activity of the visual cortex was necessary for the encoding of the stimulus but not for maintenance of the action plan in the memory-guided visual discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Much of the information about the neural substrates for sensory WM comes from studies of the visual system in nonhuman primates. Relatively fewer studies deal with the storage of information in the auditory modality, perhaps in part due to the difficulties associated with training nonhuman primates to perform auditory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigelow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fritz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munoz-Lopez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we have taken advantage of the relative ease and speed with which rodents can be trained on auditory DMS task to invest the causal role of AC in auditory WM. Future studies are needed to clarify the similarities and differences in neural circuitry and functional principle of auditory and visual WM.</p><p>WM-related activities during the delay period of WM task have been observed in distributed cortical and subcortical structures, including the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman-Rakic, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Romo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ungerleider et al., 1998</xref>), parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>), and superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kopec et al., 2015</xref>). The relative importance of these different regions in auditory WM remains to be investigated. Furthermore, these regions are anatomically connected to the AC. Such inter-areal interactions are likely to be essential for memory maintenance in the WM task. An important future direction would be to examine the neural circuits underlying WM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td><td valign="top">Slac Laboratory <break/>Animal</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Formvar-Insulated <break/>Nichrome Wire</td><td valign="top">A-M Systems</td><td valign="top">761000</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Head-stage amplifier</td><td valign="top">Intan Technology</td><td valign="top">RHD2132</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">SCR-001622</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male C57BL/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks at the start of the experiment, were used for this study.

(2) Only match trials were applied, and water was delivered only during the response window in all the trials. In the initial 2–3 days of this stage, water was delivered manually during the response window. The goal of this stage was simply to teach the mice to link the water reward with the serial of stimulus and encourage the mice to lick the spout during the response window. In the late part of this stage (3–4 days), water was delivered only when the licking events were detected during the response window. The goal of this stage was to check whether mice could lick the spout in the response window spontaneously. (3) Once mice could lick water in the response window in 90% of the trials, the two match (3 kHz–3 kHz, 12 kHz–12 kHz) and two nonmatch trials (3 kHz–12 kHz, 12 kHz–3 kHz) were presented randomly. Mice were only rewarded for licks during the response window in the match trials. The level of behavioral performance reached &gt;80% correct after 15–24 days (on average 20 days) of training in this stage.</p><p>Totally, it took an average of 29 (25-35) days of training to reach the level of behavioral performance &gt;80% correct. The performances of all mice during learning are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>. In total, we trained 58 mice to perform the auditory WM task and removed 17 mice from the study before data collection because they failed to show apparent progress like others in stage 3 of training during which the two match and two nonmatch trials were presented randomly. Finally, the majority (71%, 41/58) of mice could learn the task.</p><p>All data described in this study were collected from well-trained mice. After behavioral performance reached &gt;80% for more than three consecutive days, we started the main experiments, including electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments.</p><p>In the increasing delay duration experiments, mice were first trained with the delay period of 1.5 s. After the mice were well trained, they were tested with the delay period of different durations in 1 day. An inter-trial interval twice as long as the delay duration was used to separate successive trials.</p><p>In the 3 s and 7 s delay duration optogenetic inactivation experiments, mice were first trained to perform the DMS task with 1.5 s delay to the well-trained criterion. Then the delay duration was increased to 3 s or 7 s. After mice were well trained with the 3 s or 7 s delay task, we started the optogenetic inactivation experiments.</p><p>In the four tones optogenetic inactivation experiments, 3 kHz, 6 kHz, 12 kHz, and 24 kHz pure tones were used for match or nonmatch tone pairs. Mice were firstly well trained with the two tones DMS task (3 kHz and 12 kHz) and then trained with the four tones DMS task. After the mice were well trained with the four tones task, we started the optogenetic inactivation experiments.</p><p>For the optogenetic experiments with the blind design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>), JH Xu labeled containers for the virus with ‘A’ and ‘B’. She did not participate in behavioral and optogenetic experiments or data analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Delayed go/no-go auditory discrimination task</title><p>A separate group of mice were trained to perform a delayed go/no-go auditory discrimination task. Each trial consisted of a sample tone, delay, and response cue. During the sample tone period (200 ms), a target (3 kHz) or nontarget (12 kHz) tone stimulus was presented (the corresponding trial was referred to as a ‘go’ trial or ‘no-go’ trial, respectively), followed by a 1.5 s delay period. After the response cue was presented, licking in ‘go’ trials within the 1 s response window was rewarded (hit). No licking in response to a target or nontarget tone in the response window was regarded as miss or correct rejection (CR), respectively. Licking to a nontarget tone in the response window was regarded as false alarm (FA). The intertrial interval was 10 s. The performance, hit, and false alarm rates were calculated as described in the DMS task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Go/no-go auditory discrimination task</title><p>In the go/no-go auditory discrimination experiments, each trial consisted of a starting cue, delay, and sample tone. Trials began with the presentation of the starting cue, followed by a 1.5 s delay period. A sample tone stimulus was subsequently presented. The sample tone was either a target tone (3 kHz, ‘go’) or a nontarget tone (12 kHz, ‘no-go’). Licking in response to a target tone in the response window (1 s) was rewarded (hit). No licking in response to a target or nontarget tone in the response window was regarded as miss or correct rejection (CR), respectively. Licking to a nontarget tone in the response window was regarded as false alarm (FA). The intertrial interval was 10 s.

Once the mice were well trained, they readily performed the task with little licking during the delay period, and these lickings were not punished.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Assembly of tetrodes and optetrodes</title><p>Tetrodes were fabricated by twisting four Formvar-Insulated Nichrome Wire (bare diameter: 17.78 μm, A-M Systems, WA, USA) together. To construct a tetrode, a 20-cm-long wire was folded in half for twice over a horizontal bar. The end was clamped together with a clip and manually twisted clockwise. Finally, insulation coats of wires were gently heated to fuse with a heat gun, and the tetrode tips were cut. To reinforce each tetrode longitudinally, each tetrode was then inserted into a polymide tubing (inner diameter: 114.3 μm; wall: 12.7 μm; A-M Systems) and fixed in place by cyanoacrylate glue. An array of 2 × 4 tetrodes was then inserted and glued on the wall of the stainless steel guide tube. Insulation coats of wire tips were gently removed. Then individual wire tip was soldered to the corresponding pin on a connector. The reference (Nichrome Wire, bare diameter: 50.8 μm, A-M Systems) and ground (copper wire, diameter: 0.1 mm) were also soldered to the corresponding pins. The connector pin was then coated with silica gel. The tetrode was trimmed to an appropriate length immediately before implantation. The impedance of the trimmed tetrode was 0.7–0.8 MΩ at 1 kHz.</p><p>For assembly of optetrodes, an extra polymide tubing (inner diameter: 254 μm; wall: 25.4 μm; A-M Systems) was added for optical fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Surgical implantation of tetrode</title><p>All surgeries were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 1.5–2% maintenance). Body temperature was kept stable throughout the surgery using a heating pad. Aseptic procedures were applied during surgery. Once anesthetized, mice were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. The scalp was shaved and cleaned with betadine and ethanol, and then a midline incision was made with a scalpel. A spatula was used to clean the skull of all overlying tissue. A craniotomy was made above the AC, and mice were unilaterally implanted in the AC with the tetrodes aimed at the following coordinates: 2.46 mm posterior of bregma, 4 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.65 mm below the cortical surface. A thin layer of tissue gel (3M Vetbond Tissue adhesive, MN, USA) was used to prevent contact of dental acrylic to brain tissue. A stainless steel head plate was then affixed to the skull using screws and dental acrylic, and cement. Finally, dental acrylic and cement were mixed and applied to connect the skull, screws, head plate, and tetrode array. Antibiotic drug (Baytril, 5 mg/kg b.w., Bayer, Whippany, NJ, US) was used for three consecutive days after surgery. After 7–10 days of recovery following surgery, mice were started with a water restriction and behavioral training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Recording</title><p>The recording began after the mice were well trained. Experiments were conducted in a double-walled, sound-attenuating, and electrically shielded room.</p><p>Wideband signals (300–6000 Hz) were recorded using a head-stage amplifier (RHD2132, Intan Technology, CA, USA). Amplified (×20) and digitized (at 20 kHz) neural signals were sent to a USB interface board (RHD2000 Intan Technology) and then sent to the computer for online observation and data storage. Task events such as stimulus presentations and behavioral responses were also sent to the USB interface board (RHD2000 Intan Technology) and recorded concurrently with the neural data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Neural data analysis</title><p>Spike sorting was performed using Spike 2 software (version 8, CED, Cambridge, UK). Raw neural signals were band-pass filtered in 300–6000 Hz to remove field potentials. Typically, signals larger than four times the standard deviation of the background noise were considered to be spike events. The detected spike waveforms were then clustered by principal component analysis and a template-matching algorithm. Waveforms with inter-spike intervals of &lt;2 ms were excluded. Only single units with a firing rate higher than 2 Hz were included for further analysis.</p><p>Relative spike timing data for a single unit were then obtained for different trials of different conditions and used to construct both raster plots and PSTHs using custom MATLAB scripts. To render PSTHs, all spike trains were first binned at 10 ms and convolved with a smoothing Gaussian kernel (δ = 100 ms) to minimize the impact of random spike-time jitter at the borders between bins. The baseline period was defined as 0.5 s before the onset of the stimulus. PSTHs in populations were constructed, averaging responses of multiple neurons. As generally observed, behavioral and neuronal results were similar across all relevant animals for a particular testing paradigm. Thus, the data were combined to study population effects.</p><p>To quantify the ability to discriminate between the two stimuli, ROC-based analysis was performed. We performed this analysis on consecutive 100 ms epochs. For each epoch, we set 12 threshold levels of activity covering the range of firing rates that followed the two-tone stimuli. For each threshold level, the proportion of trials for the preferred and nonpreferred stimulus showed activity greater than the threshold was calculated. These data were plotted to create a ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve represents the probability that an ideal observer can discriminate between the two stimuli based on the activity. Therefore, a ROC value of 0.5 indicates no difference in the distribution of response in that epoch following the two tones. A value of 1 indicates that the activity following the preferred tone stimulus was always higher than the highest activity following the nonpreferred tone stimulus. A value of 0 indicates that the activity following the preferred tone stimulus was always lower than the lowest activity following the nonpreferred tone stimulus.</p><p>To test the significance of each ROC value, we ran a permutation test. This was accomplished by randomly distributing all trials from a neuron into two groups, independent of the actual cues. These groups were nominally called the preferred group and nonpreferred group. The ROC value was calculated from the redistributed data, and the procedure was repeated 5000 times, thereby creating a distribution of ROC values. We then determined wherein the distribution of the actual ROC value lay. Actual value in the top or bottom 5% was defined as significant (i.e., p&lt;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic experiments</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Virus injection and optical fiber implantation</title><p>The virus injection and optical fiber implantation surgery were similar to that for the implant of tetrodes. For optogenetic inactivation experiments, craniotomies (1 mm in diameter) were made bilaterally above the AC. The injecting pipette was pulled from a glass tube (Borosilicate glass capillaries, World Precision Instruments) and back-filled with mineral oil. About 0.5 μl AAV-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP (Neuron Biotech, Shanghai, China, 7 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) or AAV-CaMKIIα-eYFP (Neuron Biotech, 2 × 10<sup>13</sup> particles/ml) was injected into each hemisphere of AC at the following coordinates: 2.46 mm posterior of bregma, 4 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.65 mm below the cortical surface. Two optic fibers (200 μm in diameter, 0.37 NA) with ceramic ferrule were implanted. Tips of optical fibers were 300 μm over the virus injection sites in AC for each hemisphere, with the coordinates of AP 2.46 mm, ML 4 mm, DV 0.35 mm. Experiments were performed after 0.5–2 months of expression time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Optogenetic manipulation during task performance</title><p>Experiments were conducted in a double-walled, sound-attenuating room. For optogenetic suppression of the AC during the behavioral task, a green laser (532 nm, 10 mW) was delivered to the AC of both hemispheres through the optic fibers. A splitting optical patch cable was used to connect the two chronically implanted optical fibers (through a ceramic sleeve) to the laser source (R-LG532-200-A5, RWD, Shenzhen, China). Laser power was controlled by analog inputs sent from the behavior computer through an analog-digital multifunction card (DAQ NI 6363, National Instruments). Laser power at the end of an external fiber was measured with a laser power meter (VLP-2000, RWD).</p><p>To verify the effectiveness of the optogenetic method, optetrodes were implanted in AC for simultaneous AC photo-inactivation and recording. The assembly of optetrode was described above. The tip of the tetrode array was extended ~300 μm from the tip of the optical fiber. Light power at the tip of the optical fiber was 10 mW.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Once all experiments were completed, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and then perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.

cortex is necessary for encoding and transient maintenance of sound information in an auditory working memory task. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings during the task show that auditory cortex activity is modulated by the working memory context, further corroborating the idea that its activity is important, at least transiently, for working memory. These results complement current theories that involve mainly prefrontal cortex in working memory, by suggesting that a larger part of the cortical network, including the relevant sensory areas, are actually involved in short-term sensory information storage.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The causal role of auditory cortex in auditory working memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Brice Bathellier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yves Boubenec (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors examined whether and how auditory cortex (AC) is important for memory maintenance in an auditory Working Memory (WM) task, using a delayed non-match to sample design and go/no-go response as behavioral readout. Electrophysiological recordings in AC showed WM-encoding activity early in the delay period, but not in the late delay period. Optogenetic suppression of neural activity in AC during the early, but not late, delay period impaired WM performance. Optogenetic suppression of AC activity in a delayed response task did not modulate performance. The causal evidence for the involvement of AC in the early delay period is clear, while the irrelevance of AC in the later delay period is also clearly demonstrating the limitation of AC involvement in WM. The results are interesting to the WM field and beyond because they suggest a transient storage of WM in a primary sensory cortical area. However, a few more experiments, more careful interpretation and further discussion are required to reinforce and refine this important claim.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The task used will be very useful for the community and therefore the authors should provide much more detail about the protocol and the indicators of task performance. They should show population learning curves, fraction of mice learning the task, mean duration to reach 80% correct, and, for all tasks, the mean lick PSTH for all delay durations. This is important because mice tend to produce impulsive licking to sounds, and one must be able to evaluate in the context of this task whether this aspect is under experimental control. The authors should also mention in the protocol if (and how) impulsive licking before the test sound is punished.</p><p>2. A major concern is the interpretation of early involvement of AC in the task. If AC is only important for the early delay period, then one can argue that AC is only reflecting the residual auditory trace, or immediate memory, which is profoundly different from active memory maintenance to guide behavior performance. The authors should tone down their claim about the importance of AC in the working memory process and more carefully discuss it. In particular, the authors should address the counter-argument about the irrelevance of sensory regions in WM, for example Xu (2018) Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2018 (doi: 10.1016/j.tics.2017.12.008).</p><p>3. Active WM maintenance requires resistance to distractors presented during delay period. In line with the previous point, the authors should examine whether AC is important if a distractor is applied during the early delay period to mask residual sensory activity. Optogenetic suppression data obtained in this distractor condition should clearly show whether AC is important for maintenance of WM or only reflecting residual sensory information.</p><p>4. Surprisingly, the authors have not tested whether sound responses in AC are necessary to perform the task as no inactivation was performed before sound onset. It is important to determine how important AC is during sound presentation to evaluate whether what is assumed to reflect working memory corresponds to transmission of auditory information occurring just before in AC or something else.</p><p>5. The lack of delayed response during passive listening shows that this sustained activity cannot be due to a pure acoustic response. In addition, the inactivation experiments suggest a causal role for this activity in working memory. However, it is not clear whether this delayed activity is locked to the stimulus offset, or instead whether its temporal dynamics are independent from the stimulus offset, and instead relative to the stimulus onset. In other words, working-memory processes could be triggered by the end of the sound, or could instead be a process whose dynamics unfold over several hundreds of milliseconds and which would emerge only later on (coincidentally after stimulus offset). The short duration of the first sound token does not allow one to disentangle these two possibilities. A way to test for these hypothesis would be to repeat the experiment with variable sound duration, in order to see whether the sustained activity would shift with later stimulus offset.</p><p>6. The authors should more carefully review literature about sensory cortices in WM. For example, Colombo et al., Science, 1990 (doi: 10.1126/science.2296723) and Zhang et al., <italic>eLife</italic> , 2019 (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.43191) should be cited, which showed causal evidence of sensory cortices in WM tasks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64457.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We reviewed the behavioral data during training and found that it took an average of 29 (25-35) days of training to reach the level of behavioral performance &gt;80% correct. The performances of all mice while learning the WM task were shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1a. In total, we trained 58 mice to perform the task and removed 17 mice from the study before data collection because they failed to show apparent progress like others in stage 3 of training, during which the two match and two non-match trials were presented randomly. Finally, the majority (71%, 41/58) of mice could learn the task.</p><p>The mean lick PSTHs of well-trained mice while performing the WM task, delayed go/no-go task, and go/no-go task were shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1b, c, d, e, and f.

Only optogenetic suppression of AC activity during the stimulus epoch and early delay period caused a substantial reduction in WM performance. This result was consistent with the electrophysiology result showing that AC neurons exhibited elevated activity during stimulus presentation and early delay period. These results indicated that although AC may not be involved in WM storage during the whole delay period, it is nevertheless crucial for WM tasks in the initial encoding of auditory information, maintaining the memory trace for a limited time, and then transferring this information for further WM storage elsewhere, probably in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC).</p><p>There is an ongoing debate concerning the necessity of the delay-period activity of sensory cortices in WM. The essential theories which argue for the importance of sensory cortex are based on recording and imaging experiments showing that during the memory period, neuronal activity in sensory cortices can be maintained and reflect the identity of the remembered stimulus (Fuster and Jervey, 1981; Gayet et al., 2018; Harrison and Tong, 2009; Mendoza-Halliday et al., 2014; Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005; Scimeca et al., 2018). Furthermore, perturbation of neural activity in sensory cortices can impair WM performance (Colombo et al., 1990; Harris et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2019). The unessential theories are based on observations that when distractors were applied during the delay period, the sustained neural activity and WM decoding were no longer present in sensory cortices. Meanwhile, the presence of the distractor had no impact on behavioral performance (Bettencourt and Xu, 2016; Miller et al., 1996). This suggests that sensory cortices may not be essential for memory maintenance, and the WM-related activities observed in sensory cortices may largely reflect feedback signals indicative of the storage of WM content elsewhere in the brain, probably in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Leavitt et al., 2017; Xu, 2017; Xu, 2018).</p><p>The reviewer raised the critical question about whether the early delay-period activity of AC reflected the active memory maintenance or only the residual auditory trace. To further study the role of AC early delay-period activity in WM, we introduced a noise distractor (20-20,000Hz, 200ms, 60dB) during the early delay period (300-500ms) and test whether AC was involved in memory maintenance even following the distractor. If the early delay-period activity of AC is essential for WM, the neural activity should be able to maintain information following the distractor. Our result showed that suppressing the early delay-period activity of AC after the distractor resulted in performance impairment (Figure 6b). Therefore, AC is essential for active WM maintenance during the early delay period. The early delay-period activity observed in AC reflected the active memory maintenance not the residual auditory trace. Generally, our present data support the idea that sensory cortices participate in sensory information maintenance in WM task. We have added this information in the <italic>Results section (see page 10, last paragraph).</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Once again, we appreciate the suggestions and have explained this in the Discussion</italic> part of the manuscript (see page 13, the first and second paragraph).</p><p>3.

Optogenetic suppression data obtained in this distractor condition should clearly show whether AC is important for maintenance of WM or only reflecting residual sensory information.</p></disp-quote><p>A hallmark of active WM maintenance is the resistance against distractors during the delay period (Baddeley, 2012; Bettencourt and Xu, 2016; Miller et al., 1996). As stated above (please see the response to Q2), we did a new experiment where a noise distractor was added into the delay period (300-500ms). We found that mice could quickly adapt to the WM task with noise distractor despite the initial drop in performance (Figure 6a). The behavioral performance in the presence of noise distractor appears no worse than that in the simple WM task. We then optogenetically suppressed the AC activity in a specific delay period (500-800ms, just following the noise distractor, see Figure 6b). The result showed that optogenetic suppression resulted in impairment in task performance (Figure 6b). This new evidence further indicates that AC activity is critical for active early maintenance of the auditory information in WM task.</p><p>Now we added this result as an additional figure to the manuscript (Figure 6) and also added this information in the <italic>Results</italic> part of the manuscript (See Page 10, last paragraph).

To answer this question, we optogenetically suppressed the AC activity during the stimulus epoch. We found that optogenetic suppression resulted in dramatic behavioral performance decline. This result suggests that the auditory information encoded by AC during the stimulus epoch is crucial for WM task. The WM information maintained in AC during the early delay period may reflect the prolonging of the representations formed during sensory processing.</p><p>We added this as an additional supplementary figure to the manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and added this information in the <italic>Results</italic> part of the manuscript (See Page 8, the second paragraph).

However, it is not clear whether the temporal dynamics of delay-period activity is relative to the stimulus onset or offset. The reviewer makes a good suggestion of increasing the stimulus duration to test the two possibilities. Thus, we increased the stimulus duration from 200ms to 300ms and 400ms and then tested whether the sustained activity would shift with later stimulus offset. The AC activity was recorded from a subgroup of mice (n=4) while performing the auditory WM task with the stimulus duration of 300ms or 400ms. The averaged population firing rates showed that the neurons exhibited phasic responses during the auditory sample stimulus presentation. After the offset of the sample stimulus, the neurons continued to exhibit elevated activity for 700ms into the delay period in the 300ms stimulus duration task, and exhibit elevated activity for 600ms into the delay period in the 400ms stimulus duration task. Together with the result from the 200ms sample stimulus duration task, which showed that the neurons continued to exhibit elevated activity for 800ms into the delay period, all of these results showed that AC neurons exhibited elevated activity for 1000ms from the stimulus onset, regardless of the duration of the sample stimulus. These results suggested that the temporal dynamics of the delay-period activity in AC might be relative to the stimulus onset rather than the offset.</p><p>We added this as an additional figure to the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and added this information in the <italic>Results</italic> (See Page 7, the second paragraph).
