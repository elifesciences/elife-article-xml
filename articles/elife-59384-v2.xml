chronically infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tissue cysts, including an estimated one-third of the global human population. The cellular processes that permit long-term persistence within the cyst are largely unknown for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and related coccidian parasites that impact human and animal health. Herein, we show that genetic ablation of <italic>TgATG9</italic> substantially reduces canonical autophagy and compromises bradyzoite viability. Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous structural abnormalities occurring in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites. Intriguingly, abnormal mitochondrial networks were observed in TgATG9-deficient bradyzoites, some of which contained numerous different cytoplasmic components and organelles. ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoite fitness was drastically compromised in vitro and in mice, with very few brain cysts identified in mice 5 weeks post-infection. Taken together, our data suggests that TgATG9, and by extension autophagy, is critical for cellular homeostasis in bradyzoites and is necessary for long-term persistence within the cyst of this coccidian parasite.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>chronic infection</kwd><kwd>ATG9</kwd><kwd>apicomplexa</kwd><kwd>protozoan</kwd><kwd>parasite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI120627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carruthers</surname><given-names>Vern B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI060767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coppens</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE15-0023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besteiro</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM EQ20170336725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besteiro</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM086262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mercado Soto</surname><given-names>Nayanna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ATG9-dependent autophagy is an essential pathway for long-term survival within the cyst in the parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and could be exploited in future studies seeking interventions against persistent Toxoplasma infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The subclass Coccidiasina (hereafter coccidia) includes several notable parasites that are important to public and animal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith, 1981</xref>). A unifying feature of coccidia is their ability to form persistent cysts. All coccidian parasites generate environmentally resilient oocysts that persist in soil or water for fecal-oral transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frenkel and Smith, 2003</xref>). Also, some coccidia (those of the family Sarcocystidae, meaning ‘flesh cyst’) including <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> form long-lived tissue cysts that confer transmission via carnivorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frenkel and Smith, 2003</xref>). Coccidia are further classified within the phylum Apicomplexa along with haemosporidians including Plasmodium spp. and Babesia spp., the agents of malaria and babesiosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathur et al., 2019</xref>). Because <italic>T. gondii</italic> is genetically tractable, can be grown continuously in culture, and can be injected into mice for a reliable model of the disease, this parasite has become an attractive model system for other related parasites. <italic>T. gondii</italic> is also recognized as an important public health pathogen, acquired through the ingestion of tissue cysts in contaminated meat, or water and food contaminated with oocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ortega, 2019</xref>). Infection with this parasite can have serious negative health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). If acquired early during pregnancy, the parasite can traverse the placenta and infect the developing fetus, which can result in miscarriage and neurological pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresciani and da Costa, 2018</xref>). Infection can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals, for example, AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients, or patients undergoing chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). There have also been reports of emerging <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains causing complications and death in otherwise healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresciani and da Costa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carme et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Within an intermediate host, sarcocystidian parasites exist in both an acute stage (tachyzoite) and a chronic stage tissue cyst (bradyzoite). During the tachyzoite phase, <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites replicate rapidly within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Throughout the acute stage of infection, nutrients are trafficked from the host cytosol across the PV membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGovern et al., 2018</xref>). The removal of amino acids from culture media in vitro triggers tachyzoite to bradyzoite differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira da Silva et al., 2008</xref>). In an in vivo setting within an immunocompetent intermediate host, an effective host response involves CD8+ T cell recognition of host cells infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> and production of interferon gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). In turn, this results in the restriction of amino acids, including arginine and tryptophan, in cells harboring the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfefferkorn et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lüder and Rahman, 2017</xref>). As parasites continue to draw such resources, the infected host cell might become an increasingly nutrient-limited environment. Accordingly, it has been suggested that constrained access to essential nutrients is a major factor driving tachyzoite to bradyzoite differentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lüder and Rahman, 2017</xref>). However, this also raises the question as to how <italic>T. gondii</italic> tissue cysts containing bradyzoites are able to persist within the host with potentially limited access to host material for sustenance. Although recent work reported that <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites can ingest and digest protein from the cytosol of infected cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kannan et al., 2021</xref>), the extent to which this process helps to sustain bradyzoites remains unknown.</p><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy, for ‘self-eating’) is an intracellular catabolic process that facilitates the encapsulation, trafficking, and degradation of endogenous proteins and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). This process begins with the activation of an initiation complex comprised of several proteins including the protein kinase ATG1. ATG1 activity catalyzes several downstream events including the assembly of a complex comprising the lipid transfer protein ATG2, the PROPPIN family protein ATG18, and the only integral membrane protein in the pathway ATG9. The ATG2/18/9 complex facilitates the development of a double-membraned phagophore that elongates while capturing cytoplasmic material. Recent studies have reported that ATG2 is a lipid transfer protein and ATG9 functions as a scramblase that flips phospholipids from the outer to inner leaflet of the developing phagophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orii et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matoba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matoba and Noda, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Valverde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Osawa et al., 2019</xref>). During the process of elongation, the small ubiquitin-like protein ATG8 accumulates on the developing phagophore via lipid conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine. The phagophore closes to generate a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome. Fusion of the autophagosome with a lytic compartment such as the lysosome (vertebrates) or the vacuole (yeast and apicomplexan parasites) creates an autolysosome within which cytoplasmic material is degraded by cathepsin proteases and other hydrolytic enzymes. The entire process of development, closure, and fusion occurs quite rapidly, often within 3–10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mesquita et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The turnover of autophagic material via the digestive organelle can serve a number of purposes that all contribute toward cellular homeostasis and promote cell survival. These include recycling nutrients as part of a starvation response, removal of damaged material from the cytoplasm, turnover of proteins and organelles during developmental changes, and the removal of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). The autophagy machinery is widely conserved among eukaryotes. However, whether or not all Apicomplexa are able to perform canonical autophagy is still a matter of debate, even if there are clues <italic>T. gondii</italic> has a functional pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, several Plasmodium and Toxoplasma autophagy-related proteins are also involved in a non-canonical function related to the segregation of the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2017</xref>), a non-photosynthetic plastid shared by most members of the phylum.</p><p>It has previously been shown that while <italic>T. gondii</italic> cathepsin L (TgCPL) is dispensable in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2020</xref>), inhibition or genetic ablation of this protease in bradyzoites results in parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). TgCPL is a cysteine protease that resides within a plant-like vacuole/vacuolar compartment (hereafter VAC) in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, wherein it is a major enzyme required for the degradation of proteinaceous material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGovern et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we previously demonstrated the accumulation of autophagic material and organellar remnants within the VAC in parasites lacking active TgCPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggested the accumulation of undigested autophagic material within the VAC in bradyzoites was somehow contributing to parasite death, although precisely why parasites were dying remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we set out to explain why TgCPL-deficient bradyzoites fail to survive and to determine the extent to which autophagy itself directly contributes to chronic persistence of <italic>T. gondii</italic> as a model sarcocystidian and coccidian parasite.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conservation of canonical autophagic proteins in coccidian parasites</title><p>Previous analyses of the autophagy machinery in <italic>T. gondii</italic> have shown a reasonably high degree of evolutionary conservation compared with other apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lévêque and Besteiro, 2016</xref>). Here, we sought to determine the relative conservation of <italic>T. gondii</italic> autophagy genes among related apicomplexans, particularly cyst-forming parasites, as well as related but non-parasitic aveolates. Expectedly, we found that autophagy-related genes in the closely related sarcocystidian parasites <italic>Hammondia hammondi</italic> and <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> are most conserved with those of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, while some genes associated with canonical autophagy (e.g., ATG2 and ATG9) are also conserved in several coccidian parasites, they were not identified in the non-coccidian apicomplexan parasites <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum, Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, and Babesia spp. Furthermore, autophagy-related genes tended to be more conserved between <italic>T. gondii</italic> and the non-parasitic aveolates <italic>Chromera velia</italic> and <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> (the closest known autotrophic organisms to the Apicomplexa) than between <italic>T. gondii</italic> and other non-coccidian Apicomplexa. However, matches to the autophagy-related <italic>T. gondii</italic> genes that are not only involved in canonical autophagy but also in maintenance of the apicoplast (which is found in all apicomplexans except Cryptosporidium spp.), namely ATG3, ATG7, ATG8, Prop2, VPS15, and VPS34, were found across all the protists considered in this analysis (except in Babesia spp., which only had ATG7, ATG8, and VPS34). Taken together, this information indicates a potential role for canonical autophagy in sarcocystidia and possibly some other coccidia versus a more universal non-canonical function for autophagy-related proteins in maintenance of the apicoplast.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic conservation and adaptation of autophagy-related proteins in alveolates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reciprocal BLAST hits to <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> autophagy-related proteins detected in different alveolates.

Autophagy-related proteins that have a role in canonical autophagy and have not been adapted for apicoplast maintenance tend to have neutral or positive phenotype scores, indicating canonical autophagy is a non-essential cellular pathway in acute stage parasites.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59384-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To gain a sense of which components of the autophagy pathway in <italic>T. gondii</italic> play critical roles for the parasite, we mapped such constituents to a working model of autophagy and color-coded them according to their phenotype scores from a recent genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The phenotype score reflects the relative fitness cost associated with loss of each gene during in vitro replication of tachyzoites. A strongly negative phenotype score suggests a gene is likely to be broadly indispensable, whereas a neutral or positive phenotype score suggests dispensability, at least during acute stage replication in culture. Interestingly, proteins that have been implicated in segregation of the apicoplast, including TgATG8 and its lipid conjugation machinery (e.g., TgATG3, TgATG5, TgATG7, and TgATG12), together with most proteins in the VPS34/PI3P kinase complex, have strongly negative phenotype scores. Conversely, proteins that are theoretically (TgATG1 and TgATG2) or empirically (TgProp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>] and TgATG9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>]) linked exclusively to canonical autophagy have neutral or positive phenotype scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is consistent with canonical autophagy playing a non-essential role in cultured tachyzoites. Nevertheless, that proteins involved exclusively in canonical autophagy have been retained in cyst-forming parasites suggests that their biological significance could manifest in a different stage of the infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TgATG8 is required for autophagy and viability of <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites</title><p>We previously demonstrated that autophagic material and lipidated TgATG8 accumulate in TgCPL-deficient bradyzoites due to lower protein turnover in the VAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). Although this suggested that bradyzoites undergo autophagy, the evidence was indirect. As an initial strategy to directly test for autophagy in bradyzoites, we targeted TgATG8, which is necessary for apicoplast segregation in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>) and presumably also required for canonical autophagy, as in other systems. To achieve selective loss of expression in bradyzoites, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a tachyzoite stage-specific SAG1 promoter upstream of the endogenous <italic>TgATG8</italic> gene in the Prugniaud (Pru) strain, thus generating S/ATG8 transgenic parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). At the same time, we also added an N-terminal GFP tag to TgATG8. S/ATG8 tachyzoites showed GFP-TgATG8 associated with the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which appeared to segregate normally, consistent with GFP-TgATG8 expression being sufficient to support its critical role in maintaining this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>). Upon in vitro differentiation, expression of GFP-TgATG8 decreased to below the limits of detection by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). To assess the role of TgATG8 in bradyzoite autophagy, we converted S/ATG8 to bradyzoites for 7 days and looked for accumulation of dark puncta and CytoID-positive structures following treatment with the cathepsin L inhibitor LHVS. CytoID is a fluorescent dye that accumulates in autolysosomes and stains autophagic material in the VAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). LHVS irreversibly blocks the activity of TgCPL resulting in the accumulation of autophagic material in the VAC, which is visible as dark puncta by phase contrast microscopy. Whereas 24 hr of LHVS treatment resulted in the expected accumulation of dark puncta and CytoID-positive structures in Pru bradyzoites, such structures were lacking in S/ATG8 bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), hinting autophagy is indeed affected in this mutant. Dark puncta and CytoID-positive structures were even more pronounced in Pru bradyzoites following 7 days of continual LHVS treatment. Some small puncta and CytoID signal were present in S/ATG8 bradyzoites after 7 days of LHVS treatment, suggesting a measure of residual autophagy in the nominal absence of TgATG8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). No viable S/ATG8 parasites were recovered from differentiated cultures upon isolating bradyzoites and applying them to fresh monolayers for plaque formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although these experiments do not distinguish whether loss of viability is due to TgATG8’s role in canonical autophagy or apicoplast segregation, the findings provide an initial indication of an active autophagy pathway in bradyzoites.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TgATG8 is required for efficient autophagosome production in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> bradyzoites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stage-specific expression and fluorescent tagging of TgATG8 was achieved by insertion of the tachyzoite-specific <italic>TgSAG1</italic> promoter and a GFP-coding sequence immediately upstream of the <italic>TgATG8</italic> gene.

However, TgATG9-deficient parasites showed reduced protein turnover as extracellular tachyzoites, implying a role for TgATG9 in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we knocked out TgATG9 in a Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic> background strain to generate a cystogenic ∆<italic>atg9</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Conversely, relative BAG1 to SAG1 signal was found to increase more rapidly with the ∆<italic>atg9</italic> parasite cell line, indicating it differentiates faster than the parental strain. We also performed plaque assays on Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic>, ∆<italic>atg9</italic>, and ∆<italic>atg9ATG9</italic> tachyzoites and found each strain formed plaques equally well, with no significant differences in the number of plaques formed between each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that TgATG9 is non-essential in tachyzoites. It also suggests that host cell invasion is not measurably impacted in parasites lacking TgATG9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and that the lower plaque number recorded in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites is due to reduced parasite viability within the cyst, as opposed to impaired host cell invasion as parasites were placed onto a new monolayer for plaquing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Autophagy is required for bradyzoite viability and the persistence of tissue cysts.</title><p>Quantification of bradyzoite viability by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)/plaque assay after differentiation media for 1 week followed by treatment with DMSO (vehicle control, blue) or LHVS (red) for a further 1 week (<bold>A</bold>) or 2 weeks (<bold>B</bold>).

Often regarded as a starvation response to recycle amino acids for the production of new proteins, this process can also serve to remove misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, ‘reshape’ the cell during development, and, for mammalian cells, to remove pathogens (xenophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). In apicomplexan parasites, many autophagy-related proteins have been repurposed to have an additional role in maintaining the apicoplast, a remnant organelle derived from phagocytosis of an algal ancestor that is essential for parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lévêque and Besteiro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lévêque et al., 2016</xref>). Many of the autophagy-related proteins essential in this process, such as TgATG8, typically function ‘downstream’ in the autophagy pathway (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While a number of proteins involved in apicoplast maintenance have been studied and shown to be essential in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and Plasmodium spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besteiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lévêque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lévêque and Besteiro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lévêque et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jayabalasingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besteiro et al., 2011</xref>), little is known about the role of proteins that function earlier in the pathway.</p><p>Until recently, the precise mechanism of the autophagy-related protein ATG9 and the expansion of the phagophore lipid bilayer remained unknown. However, recent seminal papers on this topic have revealed that human and yeast ATG9 are scramblases embedded within the lipid bilayer of autophagosomes that translocates different phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orii et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matoba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matoba and Noda, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guardia et al., 2020</xref>). Structural analysis revealed ATG9 forms a homotrimer containing three lateral pores that lead into a vertical pore and mutations in either of these channels precluded phospholipid translocation and prevented the formation of complete autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matoba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guardia et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, following recruitment to the phagophore assembly site by the ATG1 complex, ATG9-embedded vesicles have been described as an anchoring point for autophagosome nucleation and the recruitment of other autophagy-related proteins to the developing membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao et al., 2016</xref>). ATG9 is therefore an integral protein in the formation of autophagosomes in canonical autophagy and deletion of <italic>ATG9</italic> prevents the formation of autophagosomes. Whether TgATG9 also functions as a scramblase in <italic>T. gondii</italic> remains to be determined and will be the focus of future work.</p><p>A cathepsin L enzyme in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, TgCPL, has been shown to be a major protease required for the turnover of exogenous and endogenous proteinaceous material in the lysosome-like organelle, termed the VAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to TgATG9, disruption of TgCPL has been found to be non-essential for tachyzoite growth and replication within the PV in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ortega, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfefferkorn et al., 1986</xref>). This is likely due to parasites having sufficient access to nutrients (e.g., amino acids) from the host cell cytoplasm to support their rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dou et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, ablation of TgCPL function is catastrophic in chronic-stage bradyzoites, with TgCPL-deficient bradyzoites failing to survive in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). Accumulation of autophagic material in the VAC of TgCPL-deficient bradyzoites coincided with loss of viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>). This presented the possibility that although canonical autophagy had been found to be dispensable in intracellular tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), it could be an important pathway in chronic-stage bradyzoites. Here, we demonstrated that removal of the <italic>TgATG9</italic> gene substantially reduces the accumulation of autophagic material in bradyzoites treated with LHVS to inhibit the enzymatic activity of TgCPL. Importantly, we also demonstrated that genetic ablation of <italic>TgATG9</italic> resulted in bradyzoite death in vitro, in both TgCPL-proficient and LHVS-treated (effectively TgCPL-deficient) parasites. When autophagic material was previously reported to accumulate in ∆<italic>cpl T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>), it was possible that autophagy was triggered in response to starvation, resulting from a general block in TgCPL-dependent protein turnover in the VAC. However, we found that the survival of vehicle control DMSO-treated (TgCPL-proficient) ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites was severely compromised in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that autophagy is a primary pathway in chronic-stage <italic>T. gondii</italic> which is essential for survival within the cyst. This is supported by in vivo experiments performed in mice in which ∆<italic>atg9</italic> brain cysts were severely reduced at 5 weeks post-infection. Having detected ∆<italic>atg9</italic> parasites in the brains of mice 1 week post-infection, we stipulate that autophagy is a survival mechanism in <italic>T. gondii</italic> that facilitates parasite persistence within the cyst. Furthermore, we found no defect in the ability of ∆<italic>atg9</italic> parasites to differentiate from tachyzoites to bradyzoites, indicating that reduced in vitro and in vivo bradyzoite survival was due to an inability to persist, as opposed to an inability to differentiate to the bradyzoite life stage and form cysts.</p><p>Upon closer inspection of in vitro bradyzoites by TEM, we noticed that treatment with LHVS led to numerous ultrastructural abnormalities in the VAC in both Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic> and ∆<italic>atg9</italic>. For example, enlarged ‘empty’ VACs were observed following LHVS treatment, which were also detected in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites treated with DMSO. Taken together, this suggests that TgATG9 and possibly autophagic flux play an important role in VAC homeostasis. As mentioned above, inhibition of TgCPL with LHVS predominantly results in enlargement of dark puncta, which correspond to accumulation of electron-dense and autophagic material in the VAC, shown here and previously documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>. We observed a less pronounced enlargement of dark puncta in LHVS-treated ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites compared with LHVS-treated Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic> or ∆<italic>atg9ATG9</italic>. This, coupled with our observation that 90% of LHVS-treated <italic>∆atg9</italic> bradyzoites have an electron-dense VAC, suggests that some trafficking of proteinaceous material to the VAC still occurs in such parasites. However, since we did not see an increase in the number of CytoID-positive puncta in LHVS-treated ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites compared with DMSO-treated ∆<italic>atg9</italic>, this proteinaceous material does not seem to be derived from canonical autophagosomes. We propose two possibilities, that bradyzoites uptake host proteins that are trafficked to the VAC for degradation via the endolysosomal system or that, in the absence of TgATG9, bradyzoites have an alternative mechanism of autophagy. The first hypothesis is supported by our recent work, which demonstrated that bradyzoites can ingest and degrade host-derived cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kannan et al., 2021</xref>). In the second possibility, as discussed further below, we observed the formation of vesicles with two or more membranes in <italic>∆atg9</italic> bradyzoites by TEM and while we are currently unable to determine the nature of these vesicles, it remains possible that they represent alternative autophagosome-like structures that do not stain well with the cationic amphiphilic dye CytoID. In either case, the inability of ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites to survive and persist suggests that neither of these alternative pathways can rescue the function of canonical autophagy in <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites.</p><p>TEM imaging also identified numerous structural anomalies that were present in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites but absent in the parental strain. Structural abnormalities included bradyzoites with a division defect, manifested by, for example, the observation of four nuclei within a single bradyzoite. Although endopolygeny has previously been reported in <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzierszinski et al., 2004</xref>), we found it to occur in less than 1% of Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic> parasites. However, a sharp increase in the number of mother cells containing multiple daughter nuclei was observed in the <italic>TgATG9</italic> knockout strain, with ~30% of bradyzoites showing this phenotype. This finding implicates TgATG9 in bradyzoite replication and development, although whether the protein has a direct role or if this observation was an indirect consequence from a lack of canonical autophagy, is unclear. This is notably in contrast to what has previously been observed in TgATG9-deficient <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, in which the parasite lytic cycle (acute stage invasion, replication, and egress) was found to be unaffected by the gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Other structural abnormalities observed in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites included a disorganization of the inner membrane complex and the occurrence of vesicular objects that had multiple membranes. In some cases, these structures had two double membranes and could represent autophagosome-like vesicles produced in a TgATG9-independent manner. Although ATG9 is required for efficient autophagy, alternative vesicle and puncta formation has been found to occur in other eukaryotic organisms in which <italic>ATG9</italic> has been knocked out or silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacquin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Runwal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the double-membrane vesicles described above, we also observed structures with at least four membranes that appeared to be derived from the mitochondria, with cristae clearly visible. A primary role of ATG9 in autophagy is to initiate the formation of the lipid bilayer for the developing phagophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin and Klionsky, 2014</xref>). Although ATG9 has been shown to shuttle between the surface of mitochondria to the phagophore assembly site in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reggiori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He and Klionsky, 2007</xref>), the Golgi apparatus has been shown to be the major source of ATG9 pools, particularly in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young et al., 2006</xref>). In a previous study, TgATG9 was not found to co-localize with mitochondria in tachyzoites, but did co-localize with the Golgi and other organelles including the VAC, suggesting these as potential sources of TgATG9 in this parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Ablation of TgATG9 was not found to have an extensive impact on mitochondrial morphology in tachyzoites, but it was not assessed at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Here, our TEM findings of TgATG9-deficient bradyzoites frequently showed multiple fragmented and elongated mitochondria within a single parasite. Furthermore, we also found that morphological differences in mitochondria structure were only detectable in <italic>∆atg9</italic> parasites by immunofluorescence microscopy after 6 days of differentiation, when parasites are predominantly residing within a cyst and express bradyzoite markers. By contrast, no distinguishable differences in mitochondria structure were detected within the first 3 days of differentiation, indicating that the onset of this phenotype in <italic>∆atg9</italic> parasites is in fully differentiated bradyzoites soon after conversion, rather than during the process of differentiation. An increase in mitochondrial elongation and fragmentation was shown to occur in Drosophila deficient in the ATG2/ATG18/ATG9 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Most intriguingly the mitochondrial elongations we observed in TgATG9-deficient <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoites seemed to form mitochondrial vacuoles strikingly similar to ‘m-vacuoles’ previously reported in the protist, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuyama and Maeda, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tasaka and Maeda, 1983</xref>), whereby the mitochondria has been shown to elongate with bulbous ends and adopts a horseshoe conformation that encapsulates the cytoplasm within differentiating prespore cells. Spherical mitochondrial structures have also been observed in mammalian cells treated with CCCP (carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenyl hydrazone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyazono et al., 2018</xref>), which collapses the mitochondrial membrane potential. These spherical structures were reported to encapsulate a variety of cytoplasmic structures and organelles, which is similar to the apparent sequestration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory organelles, lipid droplets, and even parts of the mitochondrion itself in ∆<italic>atg9</italic> bradyzoites. It is worth noting that previous reports have implicated ATG8 in organelle clearance in Plasmodium spp., which is essential to parasite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jayabalasingham et al., 2010</xref>). We speculate that the encapsulation of organelles by multimembrane vesicles (including apparent m-vacuoles) observed here could represent an attempt at organelle clearance in the absence of ATG9-dependent canonical autophagy in the related apicomplexan <italic>T. gondii</italic>. However, the extent to which the abnormal mitochondria are a consequence of or a response to deficient autophagy remains to be determined.</p><p>Expectedly, most conservation of <italic>T. gondii</italic> autophagy-related proteins was found in the closely related Sarcocystidia <italic>H. hammondi</italic>, <italic>N. caninum</italic>, and <italic>Sarcocystis neurona.</italic> While we identified matches across apicomplexans to many of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> autophagy-related proteins that are involved in maintenance of the apicoplast, little to no conservation was identified in parasites outside of the coccidia for apicoplast-independent canonical autophagy proteins (e.g., ATG1, ATG2, ATG9, and Prop1). The potential conservation of canonical autophagy in coccidia supports the hypothesis that this pathway promotes survival within the cysts that persist either in tissues or in the environment. Although we did not identify canonical autophagy genes in Cryptosporidia, which also use environmentally resilient oocysts for fecal-oral transmission, such parasites are known to have a severely reduced genome and thus might have evolved other strategies for long-term survival. Not only did we identify matches to <italic>T. gondii</italic> ATG1, ATG9, and TgProp1 in <italic>C. velia</italic> and <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic>, but we also found that many of the apicoplast-related autophagy proteins had better matches to proteins in these non-parasitic, photosynthetic protists than they did to other apicomplexan parasites. <italic>C. velia</italic> and <italic>V. brassicaformis</italic> were originally identified as endosymbionts of Scleractinia (stony corals) and represent some of the closest known non-parasitic relatives of the Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oborník and Lukeš, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cumbo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oborník et al., 2012</xref>). Although it is not clear what role autophagy plays in their life cycle, matches for canonical autophagy proteins between these endosymbiotic relatives and certain apicomplexans indicate that canonical autophagy was conserved in a number of cyst-forming apicomplexans from a common ancestor and was lost in several apicomplexans that do not form tissue cysts (e.g., Cryptosporidium spp., Plasmodiumspp., and Babesia spp.).</p><p>Although our findings suggest a critical role for TgATG9 in canonical autophagy and persistence, virtually nothing is known about the initiation and biogenesis of autophagic structures in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Gaining such insight will require the identification and interrogation of other autophagy-related proteins that function early in the pathway including the TgATG1 and TgATG2 homologs.

This cassette was then inserted into the HindIII-BamHI-digested pTub5/CAT‐TgAtg9 plasmid, which was previously generated for creating a TgATG9 knockout in an RH strain and thus already contained 5’ and 3’ TgATG9 homology regions for gene replacement (Nguyen et al., Cell Microbiol. 2016). The resulting HXGPRT-TgATG9 plasmid was then linearized with KpnI/NotI.

The linearized HXGPRT-TgATG9 plasmid, serving as a donor sequence, and the TgATG9-targeting Cas9-expressing plasmid were co-transfected in ΔHXGPRT Pru tachyzoites.

Twenty-four hours post-invasion, intracellular tachyzoites were differentiated to bradyzoites over the course of 7 days (as described above) and subsequently treated with 1 µM LHVS or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) for 24 hr. For direct immunofluorescence of bradyzoite cyst walls, <italic>D. biflorus</italic> agglutinin conjugated with fluorescein or rhodamine (Vector Laboratories, cat. #s FL-1031 and RL-1032–2, respectively) was diluted 1:400 and incubated with infected monolayers that had been fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and made permeable with Triton X-100. The fluorescent signal derived from DBA staining allows automatic detection of the bradyzoite-containing cyst area using ImageJ software. Cyst images were captured at 100× or 63× oil objective (three biological replicates at each objective) as described above. Automatic bradyzoite cyst identification and puncta quantification were performed in ImageJ, using the following parameters described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Cristina et al., 2017</xref>. Maximum entropy thresholding on the GFP channel was used to identify cysts. This was followed by the identification of objects with areas between 130 and 1900 μm<sup>2</sup>. Particles (puncta) under the GFP mask (therefore within a cyst) were analyzed by automatic local thresholding on the phase image using the Phansalkar method, with the following parameters: radius = 5.00 μm; k value = 0.5; r value = 0.5. Puncta were measured from the resulting binary mask by particle analysis according to the following: size = 0.3–5.00 μm; circularity = 0.50–1.00.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bradyzoite differentiation assay</title><p>HFF monolayers were grown on cover slips in six-well tissue culture plates and subsequently infected with tachyzoites for 24 hr.

Alkaline media was changed daily over the course of 7 days, replacing with fresh alkaline media and plates were incubated at 37°C with 0% CO<sub>2</sub>. TEM preparation of samples was carried out by washing the infected monolayers with cold PBS three times, followed by fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (EMS, cat. # 16210) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hr at RT.

Briefly, HFF cell monolayers were infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites in six-well plates. Following host cell invasion, tachyzoites underwent differentiation to bradyzoites as described above, resulting in the generation of in vitro tissue cysts. Differentiation was carried out over the course of 7 days, replacing the alkaline media daily. Following differentiation, parasites were treated with 1 µM LHVS or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) in differentiation media. Treatment was replaced daily for 7 and 14 days, respectively. Following the treatment period, the culture media in each well was replaced with 2 ml Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and cysts were liberated from the infected HFF monolayers by mechanical extrusion, by lifting cells with a cell scraper and syringing several times through 25G needles. Then, 2 ml of pre-warmed 2 × pepsin solution (0.026% pepsin in 170 mM NaCl and 60 mM HCl, final concentration) was added to each sample and samples left to incubate at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 94 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, removing the supernatant after centrifugation at 1500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at RT, and resuspending pepsin-treated parasites in 1 ml of DMEM without serum. Parasites were enumerated and 1500 parasites per well were added to six-well plates containing confluent monolayers of HFFs in D10 media, in triplicate. To allow for the formation of bradyzoite-derived plaques, parasites were left to grow undisturbed for 12 days. After this period, the number of plaques in each well was determined by counting plaques with the use of a light microscope. Five hundred μl of the initial 1 ml of pepsin-treated parasites was used for genomic DNA purification, performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was eluted in a final volume of 200 µl. To determine the number of parasite genomes per microliter, 10 µl of each gDNA sample was analyzed by qPCR, in duplicate, using the tubulin primers TUB2.RT.F and TUB2.RT.R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kannan et al., 2019</xref>). qPCR was performed using Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent) and a Stratagene Mx3000PQ-PCR machine. The number of plaques that formed was then normalized to the calculated number of genomes present in the inoculating sample. Despite this normalization, these experiments can have considerable inter-experiment variation, which in this case necessitated secondary normalization to Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic>-DMSO within each biological replicate. Because secondary normalization to Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic>-DMSO precluded statistical comparison of this group to the others, we repeated the experiment and assessed viability after 14 days of differentiation without treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mouse infection experiments</title><p>Seven-week-old female CBA/J mice (Jackson) were randomly assigned to groups and infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 150 tachyzoites of Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic>, ∆<italic>atg9</italic>, or ∆<italic>atg9ATG9</italic> strains. Group sizes in each experiment are as follows: In the first experiment, 10 mice were infected with one of the three strains, five mice per strain were humanely euthanized 1 week post-infection to assess brain tachyzoite burden, five mice per strain were humanely euthanized 5 weeks post-infection to assess brain cyst burden. The second experiment was set up the same as the first experiment, however an additional 10 mice were also infected with Pru∆<italic>hxg</italic> and their survival assessed. Assessing the statistical differences in parasite burden between mice infected with each strain was complicated by the absence of data from the mice that did not survive infection. Because mice that die from the infection often have higher burden and become moribund and must be euthanized before the 5-week time point when cysts are counted, enumeration of cysts from those that survive probably underestimates differences. Data were pooled from the two independent experiments. The mouse brains were placed in a set volume of sterile PBS that provided a concentration of 500 mg of mouse brain per ml. Mouse brains were individually minced with scissors, vortexed and homogenized by three or four passages through a 21G syringe needle. Three 10 µl samples (30 µl total) of brain homogenates per infected mouse were analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy to enumerate cysts and the number of cysts per brain determined (scaled appropriately to the total volume of brain homogenate for that mouse). Samples for which no cysts were observed in the 30 µl of homogenate were given a value (17 cysts/brain) that is half the limit of detection (&lt;33 cysts/brain). Mouse sample sizes were chosen based on previous studies. Mice were randomly assigned to groups and samples were blinded for enumeration of cysts.

While previous studies had implicated certain autophagy-related genes as necessary for the correct segregation of the apicoplast, the role of other canonical autophagy pathways has remained largely uncharacterized. Previous indirect evidence from parasites lacking one of the major proteases (TgCPL) in their endolysosomal compartment (VAC) suggested the occurrence of autophagy during the chronic stages (bradyzoites) of their asexual cycle. Such chronic stages are refractory to currently available drugs and clearance by the immune system, making potentially essential pathways of broad clinical interest. The authors show here that expression of ATG8 under the control of an acute-stage promoter leads to the accumulation of autophagic material in the bradyzoite VAC and fewer viable bradyzoites following in vitro differentiation. They also created and phenotypically characterized a parasite line lacking TgATG9, which they argue is exclusively involved in canonical autophagy-in contrast to TgATG8, which also plays a role in apicoplast segregation. Through these and other in vitro and in vivo studies, the authors conclude that (i) canonical autophagy mediated by ATG9 occurs in bradyzoites, and (ii) that this pathway is required for long-term persistence in tissue cysts. The evidence for the first claim is conclusive; however, the second claim needs to be supported by evidence that distinguishes between defects in bradyzoite differentiation and the titular claim of bradyzoite persistence. Although addressing this major point would be sufficient for publication, examining the mechanistic basis for the requirement for canonical autophagy in bradyzoites (e.g. amino acid recycling, organelle quality control, other cellular processes) would increase the overall impact of the study and clarify the role of autophagy in bradyzoite persistence.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Experimentally distinguish between defects in differentiation and persistence in the ATG9 KO. This could be accomplished by quantitatively demonstrating that differentiation proceeds normally (with similar rates and kinetics) in vitro. Alternatively, showing that brain cysts form at similar rates, but are lost over time in the ATG9 KO, would similarly address the concern.</p><p>2. As suggested above, mechanistically understanding why bradyzoites require autophagy, while tachyzoites do not, could provide a mechanistic link between autophagy and persistence (as distinct from differentiation). What are the cellular contents that must be recycled by autophagy to support bradyzoite development and viability? Experiments aimed at differentiating amino acid usage, mitochondria and/or ER recycling by autophagy to tease out these different requirements have not been performed and/or discussed. Along similar lines, the temporal relationship between the onset of differentiation and the various phenotypes (mitochondrial fragmentation, cellular defects) could be better established, and the authors could use available markers to determine whether the residual CytoID staining in the ATG9 KO parasites colocalizes with ATG8 or the VAC, and how that pattern compares to the wild-type or complemented parasites.</p><p>3. Statistics. Please consider whether the statistics are appropriate when comparing cells vs. independent experiments. Does the distribution of values in each dataset conform with these requirements of the nonparametric tests used?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59384.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Each strain was evaluated for expression of SAG1 (tachyzoite specific) and BAG1 (bradyzoite specific) by IFA 1-4 days after the start of differentiation. Images were taken of multiple PVs/cysts (at least 134 per sample type across 3 biological replicates) and the SAG1 and BAG1 intensity was measured using CellProfiler. We reported a ratio of SAG1:BAG1 as our readout for parasite differentiation. The ratiometric data was subject to a log<sub>2</sub> transformation and subsequently plotted. Higher positive values indicate more SAG1 relative to BAG1 signal and conversely, higher negative values indicate more BAG1 relative to SAG1 signal. This data is presented in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Overall, we found that ∆<italic>atg9</italic> parasites do not have a defect in differentiation. This suggests that ATG9-dependent autophagy is not necessary for differentiation, but rather is needed for parasite viability after stage conversion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Since such proteins are not evolutionarily conserved and it will likely take years to identify them, we feel this is well beyond the scope of the current study. Similarly, although measurements of amino acids or other metabolites are becoming more feasible (albeit still technically challenging), such analysis is complicated by the non-synchronous defects seen in ∆atg9 bradyzoites, thus complicating the interpretation of the analysis. We anticipate the need to generate conditional knockouts (e.g., AID) that will allow rapid and synchronous depletion of ATG9 to permit distinguishing direct from indirect consequences of acutely impairing autophagy. The work herein focused on measuring the extent to which Atg9, and by extension autophagy, is required for bradyzoite persistence in vitro and in vivo and reports various structural defects associated with bradyzoite autophagy deficiency. With the inclusion of the differentiation assays that demonstrate Atg9 deficiency does not affect tachyzoite to bradyzoite differentiation, we have demonstrated that this process is particularly important for the persistence of bradyzoites rather than differentiation to this life stage. We feel this is an important conceptual advance, since it suggests that the parasite is susceptible to disruption of a homeostatic processes during persistence.</p><p>In response to the suggestion to investigate onset of the observed phenotypes, we were able to successfully interrogate this for mitochondria morphology. We developed an algorithm for use in CellProfiler that measured various imaging parameters of mitochondria (labelled with anti-F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>ATPase) in parasites 1, 3, 6 and 8 days after exposure to conditions that stimulate tachyzoite to bradyzoite differentiation in vitro. The dimensionality of the different mitochondria measurements was reduced by principle component analysis and is now presented in Figure 6F,G. Here, we found that the abnormal mitochondria morphology was detectable after 6- and 8-days post-differentiation, but not after 1 or 3 days. Given that parasites become fully differentiated after ~5 days culture under differentiation culture conditions, this suggests that the onset of abnormal mitochondria morphology occurs in fully differentiated parasites and not in differentiating parasites. Together with our new data that shows Atg9-deficient parasites differentiate to bradyzoites at a normal rate, this indicates that Atg9 is important for bradyzoite fitness at a more chronic phase, as opposed to early in the differentiation process. This justifies and necessitates forthcoming studies that will probe mechanisms of autophagy in bradyzoites in greater detail. We made several attempts to quantify the temporal onset of the parasite cell division phenotype using widefield and confocal microscopy. However, because bradyzoites are so tightly packed together within cysts in 3 dimensions, the imaging software is incapable of accurately segmenting individual parasites. As such it was not possible to agnostically quantify the cell division defect. Nevertheless, the additional experiments confirmed that such a defect is readily apparent, particular after 6 days of differentiation.</p><p>We also made several attempts to determine the extent to which residual CytoID staining in ∆atg9 bradyzoites corresponded to CPL in the VAC or ATG8-positive autophagosomes. Unfortunately, the residual staining is so weak that we were unable to reliably determine its spatial relationship with markers for the VAC or autophagosomes. In the absence of having a mutant that has been validated to have no autophagy, it is not possible to determine if the residual staining is specific for autophagosomes or autolysosomes. We regret that this is a limitation of the currently available means of assessing autophagy in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Statistics. Please consider whether the statistics are appropriate when comparing cells vs. independent experiments. Does the distribution of values in each dataset conform with these requirements of the nonparametric tests used?</p></disp-quote><p>To help ensure that the statistical analyses were performed correctly, we consulted a PhD statistician at the Center for Statistics, Computing, and Analytics Research (CSCAR) at the University of Michigan. The consultation reaffirmed that appropriate statistical tests were applied to assess potential differences in measurements made throughout the study. As described in the methods section on statistical analyses, we applied non-parametric tests when the distributions of data did not conform to a normal distribution or had unequal variance. We believe that taking a conservative approach to the statistical analysis helps to ensure confidence in the conclusions that were rendered in the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
