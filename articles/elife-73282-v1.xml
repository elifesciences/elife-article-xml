The balance of signals initiated upon engagement of activating and inhibitory NK receptors with cognate ligands determines killing or tolerance. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms regulating rapid NK cell discrimination between healthy and malignant cells in a heterogeneous tissue environment are incompletely understood. The SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase is the central negative NK cell regulator that dephosphorylates key activating signaling proteins. Though the mechanism by which SHP-1 mediates NK cell inhibition has been partially elucidated, the pathways by which SHP-1 is itself regulated remain unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylation of SHP-1 in NK cells on the S591 residue by PKC-θ promotes the inhibited SHP-1 ‘folded’ state. Silencing PKC-θ maintains SHP-1 in the active conformation, reduces NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, and promotes tumor progression in vivo. This study reveals a molecular pathway that sustains the NK cell activation threshold through suppression of SHP-1 activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PKC</kwd><kwd>natural killer</kwd><kwd>SHP-1</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002744</institution-id><institution>Bar-Ilan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>United States–Israel Binational Science Foundation (2019211)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barda-Saad</surname><given-names>Mira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of the phosphatase SHP-1 by PKC-θ in natural killer (NK) cells induces SHP-1 inhibition, revealing a novel molecular pathway that sustains NK cell activation threshold.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are a class of lymphocytes that comprise a central component of the innate immune system. They patrol the body and kill virally transformed and cancerous cells. NK cell effector functions are carried out by the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and Granzyme B, which induce target cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pipkin and Lieberman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Topham and Hewitt, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, NK cells produce cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-γ, which activate the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malhotra and Shanker, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Activation or inhibition of NK function was shown to depend on the balance between signals derived from activating and inhibitory receptors on the NK cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanier, 2005</xref>). Various motifs on the cytoplasmic tails of these receptors were shown to induce distinct downstream signaling cascades. These include immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) found on cytoplasmic tails of the transmembrane adaptor proteins CD3ζ, FcɛRIγ, and DAP12, or the YINM motif on the DAP10 adaptor, which associates with the NKG2D receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">André et al., 2004</xref>). Another group of motifs includes the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) on the CD244 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vyas et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lanier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2005</xref>). Though NK cell receptors are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms downstream to receptor ligation, and how these are integrated to achieve the appropriate activation state, are incompletely understood.</p><p>Inhibitory NK cell receptors express a separate target sequence for signal suppression, consisting of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) expressed on the cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long, 2008</xref>). The key receptors facilitating NK inhibition recognize major histocompatibility class 1 (MHC-I) molecules expressed on the majority of cells in the body. These receptors include the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family in humans and primates, the Ly49 family in mice, and NKG2A/CD94 receptors expressed in both primates and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Orr and Lanier, 2010</xref>). NGK2A/CD94 were shown to have specificity for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) isoform E (HLA-E), whereas the KIR family of inhibitory receptors was shown to associate with HLA-C and HLA-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moretta et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagtmann et al., 1995</xref>). Engagement of these receptors with their cognate ligands and phosphorylation of their ITIM motifs recruits the Src-homology 2-domain (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), SHP-1. SHP-1 consequently dephosphorylates key proteins involved in the activating signaling pathway, thereby downregulating NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stebbins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matalon et al., 2016</xref>). SHP-1 comprises a catalytic phosphatase domain near its C′ terminus, two phospho-tyrosine binding SH2 domains toward its N′ terminus, and sites of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation at the end of its C′-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lorenz, 2009</xref>). In its autoinhibited closed state, the SHP-1 N′ SH2 domain associates with the catalytic domain, blocking access to its substrates.</p><p>Binding of SHP-1 SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the ITIM of the inhibitory receptors induces a conformational alteration in SHP-1. This releases it from the inhibited state and enables its catalytic activity, that is, dephosphorylation of key signaling molecules and inhibition of NK cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). SHP-1 substrates in NK cells include the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), VAV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stebbins et al., 2003</xref>), phospholipase C gamma 1/2 (PLCγ1/2), and linker for activation of T cells (LAT), recently identified by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matalon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Though SHP-1 function is critical for correct NK cell immune responses, the manner by which its catalytic activity is regulated remains unclear. Elucidating this mechanism is especially important since NK cells engage target cells expressing both activating and inhibitory receptors, and SHP-1 recruitment to ITIMs decreases the activity of NK cells toward potential targets, despite expression of activating ligands. Therefore, upregulation of ligands for inhibitory NK receptors that express ITIMs by cancer cells, such as HLA-E and PD-L1, may repress NK cell activity through SHP-1 recruitment and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carretero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chemnitz et al., 2004</xref>). Identifying the factors that regulate SHP-1 activity may lead to a better understanding of how NK cell activity is accurately and rapidly tuned in tissues containing both healthy and transformed cells. We recently revealed that actin retrograde flow (ARF) induces a physical conformational change in the SHP-1 molecule to facilitate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matalon et al., 2018</xref>). However, key questions remain unresolved. SHP-1 was shown to localize to the lytic NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vyas et al., 2002a</xref>), yet the mechanism by which its activity at the lytic synapse is regulated was not determined. Furthermore, it is not clear how termination of SHP-1 activity occurs after NK cells are successfully inhibited, thereby enabling NK cells to function in subsequent interactions with activating target cells.</p><p>Thus, since SHP-1 is a critical checkpoint molecule in NK cells and regulates the NK cell activation threshold, it is of great interest to understand the underlying mechanisms that control its catalytic activity during the NK cell response.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that in NK cells SHP-1 is heavily phosphorylated on the serine 591 residue (S591) via Protein kinase c theta (PKC-θ) (and hence dormant) during activating but not inhibitory responses, within the first 5 min of NK cell activation. This phosphorylation is dynamic and increases along the progression of the inhibitory NKIS, while slightly decreasing during progression of the activating NKIS. SHP-1 phosphorylation dynamics were also closely correlated with changes in SHP-1 catalytic conformations. Blocking PKC-θ-mediated phosphorylation of SHP-1 restored SHP-1 activity and inhibited NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cells bearing a phosphor-mimetic point mutation that suppresses SHP-1 activity 1 at the serine 591 residue were highly activated. Finally, knockout of SHP-1 in NK cells rescued PKC-θ silencing and promoted tumor clearance in vivo. The PKC-θ-mediated regulation of SHP-1 potentially serves to maintain and prime NK cells in a complex cellular environment consisting of both healthy and malignant cells, requiring finely tuned localized NK cell activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation in NK cells is a dynamic process, differentially regulated during inhibitory and activating interactions</title><p>It remains unclear how SHP-1 activity is regulated throughout the duration of the NK cell response and how this regulation is maintained in different states, that is, during NK cell activation and inhibition. Furthermore, SHP-1 is recruited to both cytolytic and non-cytolytic NK synapses, demonstrating that different modes of regulation are needed to ensure proper NK cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vyas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vyas et al., 2002a</xref>). Phosphorylation of SHP-1 was previously shown in different cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). The outcome of these molecular processes, however, demonstrated contradictory results, and the molecular regulation of SHP-1 in NK cells has not been fully addressed. We recently employed a mutant YTS-2DL1 knock-in line expressing the SHP-1 phosphor-mimetic serine to aspartic acid residue substitution (SHP-1 S591D), which exhibits increased antitumor NK function relative to WT SHP-1-expressing YTS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Shmuel et al., 2021</xref>). To dissect the possible effect of SHP-1 phosphorylation on NK cell function, physiological activating and inhibiting interactions were induced with 721.221 target cells, and S591 phosphorylation patterns were examined in YTS-2DL1 cells and isolated primary NK cells expressing KIR2DL1<sup>+</sup> (referred to as pNK-2DL1) from healthy human donors. We conducted functional assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matalon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matalon et al., 2018</xref>) by incubating YTS-2DL1 or pNK-2DL1 with 721.221 target cells either expressing the KIR2DL1 cognate ligand, HLA Cw4 (721-Cw4, which inhibits NK activity), or an irrelevant HLA Cw7 ligand (721-Cw7 or 721-HLA-negative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Münz et al., 1997</xref>], which promote NK cell activation). Cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-pSHP-1 S591 antibody. Our data revealed different SHP-1 phosphorylation profiles during NK cell inhibition and activation after 5 min of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). High S591 phosphorylation levels could be seen during activating interactions (3.06 ± 0.31<italic>,</italic> p=0.0104), whereas lower SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation was observed during induced inhibitory interactions. The same pattern was observed during incubation of pNK-2DL1 cells with activating 721-HLA-negative cells or with inhibiting 721-Cw4 targets cells (2.51 ± 0.19<italic>,</italic> p=0.006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The formation of the immunological synapse (IS) is highly dynamic, involving movement, activation, and termination of signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burroughs and Wülfing, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we wished to analyze the change in SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation over time. YTS-2DL1 or pNK-2DL1 cells were incubated with activating or inhibiting 721.221 targets for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. Strikingly, we found that pS591 on SHP-1 was dramatically altered during formation of the inhibitory NKIS, showing almost no initial phosphorylation after 5 min of incubation, and displaying high phosphorylation by 20 min. Activating NK cell interactions, however, displayed higher SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation during the first 5 min of activation, remaining relatively stable, with a slight (nonsignificant) reduction after 20 min of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation may play a role during NK cell activation and during late inhibitory interactions. This mechanism may attenuate SHP-1 functionality in order to enable NK cell activation within these time frames.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation kinetics of SHP-1 S591 during activating and inhibitory NK cell interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) YTS-2DL1 NK cells were incubated with either inhibitory 721-Cw4 HLA or activating 721-Cw7 HLA target cells at 37°C for 5 min, and then lysed.

The FRET sensor was constructed with SHP-1 tagged on the N′ and C′ termini with YFP and CFP, respectively (YFP-SHP-1-CFP). It is known that SHP-1 activation status is correlated with its conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poole and Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In the closed conformation, the N′ SH2 domain masks the catalytic domain rendering the enzyme inactive, whereas when the catalytic domain is free of the N′ SH2 domain, the protein remains in an open active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, an inactive SHP-1 protein provides high FRET efficiency due to YFP and CFP proximity, and an active SHP-1 protein demonstrates low FRET efficiency as SHP-1 is in an open conformation, distancing the two reporter proteins.

YTS-2DL1 cells were transfected with the YFP-SHP-1-CFP FRET sensor construct and incubated with inhibiting 721-Cw4 or activating 721-Cw7 cells stably expressing mCherry in order to distinguish NK and target cells. FRET efficiency was measured using high-resolution microscopy, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barda-Saad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pauker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2014</xref>). In this set of experiments, we chose to focus on very early (5 min) and late (20 min) stages of NK cell: target cell interactions, as they showed the largest change in SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). FRET measurements demonstrated patterns similar to SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation profiles; during initial inhibitory NK:721-Cw4 interactions (5 min), SHP-1 in NK cells displayed low synaptic FRET efficiency, indicating an open and active state (8.62% ± 1.8%), shifting to high FRET efficiency after 20 min of synapse maturation (15.13% ± 1.9%, p=0.0300; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, top two panels), indicating a closed and inhibited state. During activating interactions, however, SHP-1 in NK cells displayed highest synaptic FRET efficiency after 5 min (18.45% ± 1.9%, p=0.0003 comparing 5 min of activation to inhibition), indicating a closed and inhibited state, while after 20 min of activation, a decrease was observed in SHP-1 FRET efficiency to similar levels as NK:721-Cw4 interactions after 5 min (8.15% ± 1.9%, p=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, bottom two panels), indicating an open and active SHP-1 conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matalon et al., 2018</xref>). These data demonstrate that SHP-1 conformation, and accordingly, its activation status, changes differentially during activating and inhibiting interactions as the NKIS matures, correlating with S591 phosphorylation patterns. Our results suggest that SHP-1 conformation and catalytic activation are regulated in a temporal manner at both the activating and inhibitory NKIS, and suggest a possible role for SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation on SHP-1 activity in NK cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SHP-1 conformational dynamics reflect S591 phosphorylation during activating and inhibitory NK cell interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) YTS-2DL1 YFP-SHP-1-CFP cells were incubated over slides pre-seeded with 721-Cw4 (top panels) or Cw7 (bottom panels) target cells expressing mCherry.

It was shown that TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion is defective in PKC-θ<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Page et al., 2008</xref>), and this can contribute to defective recruitment of effector cells to the site of tumor development. In a different study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tassi et al., 2008</xref>), no effect of PKC-θ deficiency was observed on IFN-γ secretion induced by IL-12, IL-18, or a combination of both cytokines. Therefore, it is not clear how PKC-θ is involved in the regulation of NK cell signaling cascades, and if its activity impacts human NK cell function.</p><p>Early reports by Vyas et al. showed that PKC-θ localizes to the cytolytic NK synapse during early activation, that is, following 5 and 10 min of activating target cell conjugation, and relatively low PKC-θ polarization is observed following 10 min of non-cytolytic NK: target cell conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vyas et al., 2002a</xref>). This PKC-θ localization was similar to the localization of SHP-1 at the NKIS. Thus, we next studied PKC-θ dynamics in NK cell inhibitory synapses and how these compare to PKC-θ localization during NK cell activation. Moreover, since PKC-θ plays a role in activation of different hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baier et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi and Altman, 2007</xref>) and induces SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), we tested its possible interplay with SHP-1 in NK cells.

PKC-θ localization appeared dispersed at the early inhibitory NKIS and accumulated at the synapse after 20 min (p=0.0036). These dynamics were similar to SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation patterns.

In cells expressing this mutant, PKC-θ silencing would not be expected to impact SHP-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egelhoff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Erikson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Léger et al., 1997</xref>). Hence, we expected that the S591D mutant would demonstrate high accumulation of pVAV1 in the synapse, irrespective of PKC-θ silencing. WT YTS-2DL1 or YTS-2DL1 SHP-1 S591D NK cells were treated with either NS or PKC-θ siRNA, and incubated with mCherry-expressing target cells to assess pVAV1 Y160 synaptic accumulation. As expected, pVAV1 Y160 accumulation was observed during activating but not inhibitory NK cell interactions (p&lt;0.0001), and in accordance with our results, PKC-θ siRNA-treated NK cells had a 2 ± 0.2-fold reduction in pVAV1 recruitment to the activating NKIS (p&lt;0.0001), indicating increased SHP-1 activity in the absence of PKC-θ under activating interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). No significant decrease in pVAV1 recruitment was observed, however, in YTS-2DL1 SHP-1 S591D cells treated with either NS or PKC-θ siRNA under either activating or inhibitory interactions (p=0.9109 and p=0.9999, respectively). Furthermore, YTS-2DL1 SHP-1 KO cells were reconstituted with either YFP-SHP-1 WT or with YFP-SHP-1 mutant constructs, including the constitutively phosphorylated SHP-1 mimetic (YFP-SHP-1 S591D, constitutively inactive) or an SHP-1 phospho-abolishing mutant (YFP-SHP-1 S591A, constitutively active). YTS-2DL1 SHP-1 KO cells transfected with the YFP-SHP-1 constructs were incubated with Cw4-721 targets expressing mCherry and stained for pPLCγ1 (Y783) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We previously showed that pPLCγ1 (Y783) accumulation at the NKIS is favored during activating rather than inhibitory NK cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matalon et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, cells expressing SHP-1 S591D showed high levels of pPLCγ1 (Y783) accumulation at the NKIS, even though the NKIS was inhibitory. These levels were approximately three-fold higher compared to YTS-2DL1 cells expressing SHP-1 WT or SHP-1 S591A (p&lt;0.0001). Collectively, these results demonstrate that PKC-θ negatively regulates SHP-1 activity by phosphorylating S591, as demonstrated through higher VAV1 and PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and accumulation at the NK synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PKC-θ-mediated regulation of SHP-1 augments NK cell activation</title><p>SHP-1 tunes NK cell activation, and, as we demonstrated here, PKC-θ-mediated phosphorylation of SHP-1 impacts its enzymatic activity.

Importantly, activation of SHP-1 and its homolog SHP-2 (an additional critical inhibitory NK cell regulatory enzyme) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Purdy and Campbell, 2009</xref>) are the major mechanisms operating downstream to immune checkpoint receptors, such as PD-1, CTLA-4, BTLA, and LAG-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheppard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore of great interest to understand how this important regulator is kept in check during NK cell activation and inhibition as this regulatory mechanism may have critical consequences for additional immune cells, immune checkpoint pathways, and immunotherapies.</p><p>NK cell activity is regulated by a balance between stimulatory or inhibitory signals, yet how these signals are integrated and how intracellular NK cell activation is maintained and controlled through these multiple receptors remain incompletely understood. Moreover, the presence of SHP-1 at the activating NKIS and rapid dispersal from the inhibitory NKIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vyas et al., 2002a</xref>) suggest as yet unknown roles and regulatory mechanisms. Here, we elucidate some of these unresolved mechanisms by showing that the NK cell activation threshold is maintained through downregulation of SHP-1 phosphatase activity regulated by PKC-θ.</p><p>Studies published on outcomes of SHP-1 C′ terminal serine phosphorylation in non-NK cell systems demonstrated contradicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poole and Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of SHP-1 by PKC-θ during NK cell activation on serine 591 maintains heightened NK cell effector function by retaining the SHP-1 closed and inactive conformation. This mechanism preserves SHP-1 substrate phosphorylation and consequently sustains calcium flux and cytotoxicity. Thus, the PKC-θ:SHP-1 axis may play an important role in NK immune surveillance and tumor clearance, a topic that has recently gained much attention in the immunotherapy field, especially in the context of adoptive cell transfer and genetically engineered NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morandi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern and Brennan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jochems et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siegler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our findings may answer an important question regarding how SHP-1 activity is downmodulated after dissociation of the inhibitory NKIS, and how its signaling is downregulated during cytolytic NK responses. Phosphorylation of SHP-1 during termination of the inhibitory NKIS may retain the activity of NK cells to subsequent targets, whereas its immediate phosphorylation at the activating NKIS maintains the NK cell lytic capacity. This is consistent with the SHP-1 conformation patterns shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) within the activating and inhibitory NKIS.</p><p>Interestingly, mathematical modeling analysis in NK cells suggests that weak ligands for activating receptors (bearing partially phosphorylated ITAMs) can recruit SHP-1 and thereby increase the NK activation threshold, while under certain conditions (such as low concentration of SHP-1 and weak activating ligands) inhibitory receptors can aid in NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das, 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that one mechanism facilitating target cell escape from NK cell lysis is selection for cells expressing weak activating ligands that induce SHP-1 recruitment. It is clear that the transition of SHP-1 between inhibiting and activating receptors must be tightly regulated to ensure proper NK cell responses.</p><p>PKC-θ is the only PKC isoform that was shown to accumulate at T cell and NKISs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monks et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merino et al., 2012</xref>). In T cells, it is clear that PKC-θ plays an important role in T cell activation and survival by activating several downstream pathways, including NF-kB and AP-1 as major targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Merino et al. previously showed that clustering of PKC-θ at the NKIS amplifies murine NK cell activation and effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merino et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanism by which it exerts this function and specifically in human cells remained mostly unknown. Several studies suggest the involvement of PKC-θ in signal transduction, antitumoral activity, and NK cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anel et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that in human NK cells PKC-θ phosphorylates SHP-1 on S591 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suppresses SHP-1 activity, and thereby increases NK cell activity. PKC-θ appears to regulate SHP-1 activity during the late inhibitory synapse and through the full duration of activating NK:target cell interactions. Indeed, gene silencing of PKC-θ resulted in the closed SHP-1 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), implying that SHP-1 favors an open and active conformation in the absence of PKC-θ. This conformational change in SHP-1 also impacts its catalytic activity. These findings were strengthened through in vivo experiments, which demonstrated that absence of SHP-1 increased NK cell activity and decreased tumor progression, irrespective of PKC-θ expression, implying that PKC-θ indeed maintains NK cell activation through its regulation of SHP-1. PKC-θ also plays a role in NF-κB activation as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2000</xref>. Thus, PKC-θ knockout could possibly affect NF-κB transcriptional activity, resulting in a reduced antitumor immune response. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D and E</xref>, YTS-2DL1 cells gene-silenced for PKC-θ show reduced degranulation, resulting in increased tumor growth rates, whereas YTS-2DL1 SHP-1 KO cells treated with PKC-θ siRNA (DKO) show increased degranulation and reduced tumor growth rate relative to YTS-2DL1 cells gene-silenced for PKC-θ, suggesting that SHP-1 knockout rescues the antitumor response. This result confirms the role of PKC-θ in regulating SHP-1 activity. It seems that a dynamic and coordinated balance between activating and inhibitory signaling cascades governs NK cell activation programs. Das et al. proposed that NK cell tolerance or activation is modulated by signal strength of the target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das, 2010</xref>), which is in line with the suggestion that NK cell regulation occurs through a balance of activating and inhibitory signals transmitted by membrane receptors recognizing potential ligands on the target cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lanier, 2001</xref>). Here, we elucidate the potential circuitry between kinase and phosphatase activities playing a pivotal role in balancing activating and inhibitory NK signaling. Several studies show that deficiency or inhibition of PKC-θ could potentially decrease the severity of autoimmunity, allergy, and chronic inflammation. For example, in animal models of intestinal inflammatory disease (chronic colitis), PKC- θ KO mice showed decreased T cell proliferation and cytokines production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curnock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolle et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that PKC-θ inhibitors could be useful as a therapeutic approach for inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curnock et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Though pSHP-1 levels were substantially reduced after PKC-θ gene silencing, basal levels were still evident. It is possible that other serine/threonine kinases or isoforms such as PKC-θ may also be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2004</xref>). Another possible mechanism may involve PKC-θ cross talk with the NK cytoskeleton. We recently demonstrated that SHP-1 conformation and activity is dependent on the association to the cytoskeletal machinery and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matalon et al., 2018</xref>). One possibility is that cross-talk between PKC-θ and SHP-1 mediates actin:SHP-1 binding or disassociation, thereby regulating SHP-1 catalytic activity and conformation. Furthermore, PKC-θ phosphorylates the Wiskott-Interacting Protein (WIP) in NK cells upon activation, and this facilitates recruitment of actin and myosin IIA to WIP and WASp for the formation of the multiprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krzewski et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>After SHP-1 mediates its function and prevents NK cell activity during an inhibitory interaction, its activity should be downregulated to enable subsequent NK cell interactions with activating susceptible targets. This can be seen by late phosphorylation (after 20 min) of SHP-1 S591 during inhibitory NKISs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and may serve as a mechanism of kinetic priming, ensuring that NK cell activity remains stable for future contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Mitchison, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it was shown that as NK cells are constantly situated in an environment that requires simultaneous killing of target cells and sparing of others, accurate and specific convergence of lytic granules aids in killing only relevant targets, while sparing healthy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a study by Netter et al. demonstrated how initiation and termination of the activating NKIS are highly regulated and enable serial NK cell killing by accelerating detachment from one target cell and simultaneous formation of new cytotoxic NKISs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Netter et al., 2017</xref>). Additional reports by Srpan et al. describe NK cell serial killing via shedding of surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Srpan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, sequential and highly regulated signaling is needed for NK cell maneuverability in a complex immune environment. PKC-θ: SHP1 regulation may enable an NK cell to rapidly survey its surroundings and maintain its effector functions in a complex immune environment that requires simultaneous sparing of normal cells and killing of malignant targets. This mechanism would also ensure that NK cell effector functions are maintained in the presence of an activating NKIS. Cancer cells can express MHC-I and other inhibitory NK cell ligands; thus, recruitment and activation of PKC-θ at the activating NKIS may limit SHP-1 association to ITIMs that could prevent tumor cell killing. It would be interesting to assess the effect of S591 phosphorylation on SHP-1:KIR ITIM association as this phosphorylation may not only affect the NK cell activation threshold, but also NK cell education, as SHP-1 was shown to be vital for regulating NK cell responsiveness to tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Due to the fact that NK cells are also implicated in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morandi et al., 2008</xref>), rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern and Brennan, 2011</xref>), and type I diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dotta et al., 2007</xref>), deregulation of SHP-1 activity may be a factor affecting normal NK cell functions against healthy cells. SHP-1 was also shown to serve as an important regulator that impacts cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chong and Maiese, 2007</xref>). Some studies examined its role in tumor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). It would be interesting to examine whether mutations or regulation of SHP-1 S591 or other known or as yet unidentified residues may impact its function. Understanding regulatory protein circuits in NK cells will be an important step for further elucidating complex pathways such as NK signaling cascades and NK cell education, and potentially open doors to innovative immunotherapies shaping NK cell behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Briefly, three sets of filters were used: one optimized for donor fluorescence (excitation, 458 nm; emission, 465–510 nm), a second for acceptor fluorescence (excitation, 514 nm; emission, 530–600 nm), and a third for FRET (excitation, 458 nm; emission, 530–600 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>FRET correction</title><p>FRET correction was performed as described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barda-Saad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pauker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2014</xref>). The non-FRET components were calculated and removed using calibration curves derived from images of single-labeled CFP- or YFP-expressing cells. Sets of reference images were obtained using the same acquisition parameters as those used for the experimental FRET images. To correct for CFP ‘bleed through,’ the intensity of each pixel in the CFP image from CFP-expressing cells was compared to the equivalent pixel in the FRET image of the same cells. A calibration curve was derived to define the level of CFP fluorescence seen in the FRET image as a function of the fluorescence in the CFP image. A similar calibration curve was obtained defining the amount of YFP fluorescence appearing in the FRET image as a function of the intensity in the YFP image using images of cells expressing only YFP. Separate calibration curves were derived for each set of acquisition parameters used in the FRET experiments. Then, using the appropriate calibration curves, together with the CFP and YFP images, the amount of CFP bleed through and YFP cross-excitation was calculated for each pixel in the experimental FRET images. These non-FRET components were subtracted from the raw FRET images, yielding corrected FRET images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>FRET efficiency calculation</title><p>The FRET efficiency (FRETeff) was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the following equation: FRETeff = FRETcorr/(FRETcorr+ CFP) × 100%, where FRETcorr is the pixel intensity in the corrected FRET image, and CFP is the intensity of the corresponding pixel in the CFP channel image.</p><p>To increase the reliability of the calculations and prevent low-level noise from distorting the calculated ratio, we excluded pixels below 50 intensity units and saturated pixels from the calculations and set their intensities to zero. These pixels are shown in black in the ‘pseudocolored’ FRET efficiency images.</p><p>To estimate the significance of the FRET efficiency values obtained and exclude the possibility of false-positive FRET results, we prepared cells expressing free CFP and free YFP as negative controls. The FRET efficiency in the negative control system was measured and calculated in the same way as in the main experiment. FRET efficiency values obtained from the negative control samples were subtracted from the values obtained in the main experiments. Image processing and measurements were performed using IPLab software version 3.9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>PTP assay</title><p>SHP-1 catalytic activity was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of the exogenous substrate <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) by SHP-1, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matalon et al., 2018</xref>). NK cells (2–5 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated with target cells at a ratio of 1:1 at 37°C for 5 min before lysis.

Cell lysates were subjected to IP (immunoprecipitated) with anti-SHP-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold passive washing buffer (0.1% Brij, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 3.75 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), and three times with phosphatase buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mM DDT). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 200 µL 25 mM pNPP in phosphatase buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.

Target cells were labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]Met (0.2 mCi/mL) for 12–16 hr and washed two times, and then 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells were mixed with NK cells at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1. Cells were then incubated for 5 hr at 37°C in complete medium. The cells were centrifuged at 200 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, the supernatant was mixed with scintillation liquid, and radioactive signal was measured with a β counter (Packard). Spontaneous release of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met from an equal number of target cells was determined by adding 100 mL of complete medium to target cells that were incubated without NK cells. Maximal release was determined by adding 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to an equal number of target cells in the absence of NK cells. Finally, the percentage of cell lysis caused by the NK cells was calculated using the following equation: % specific lysis = [(sample signal – spontaneous release)/(maximal release – spontaneous release)] × 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>DNA constructs and mutagenesis</title><p>Human SHP-1 wt cDNA was obtained from Addgene.

Inhibition of NK cells results from the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, which dephosphorylates vital signaling molecules and thus reverses NK cell activation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Emilie Narni-Mancinelli (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I am pleased to inform you that the reviewers concluded that your paper provides novel insights into the natural killer (NK) cells signaling following activation and inhibition. By demonstrating how PKC downregulates SHP-1 activity at the early stages of activating NK synapse, and at the later stages of the inhibitory NK cell synapse, your study ilustrates mechanism that enables rapid and secure NK cell surveillance in the tumor microenvironment. The reviewers also agreed that your findings will be of interest to scientists in the field of NK cell immunology and that the major claims in the manuscript are well supported by the data. Thus your paper is important and generally suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, although enthusiastic with the bulk results, the reviewers pointed to one specific aspect that need to be clarified and extended. In the experiment aimed to explore in vivo whether NK cells silenced for PKC−θ have a lower anti-tumor cytotoxicity due to enhanced SHP-1 activity, targets cells that do not exhibit activating signals and thus for which PKC−θ-mediated SHP-I phosphorylation may not be critical, were used. In other words, the reviewers are requesting that you analyse the in vivo growth control of 721-cw7 tumor cell killing by PKC−θ-silenced NK cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the study by Ben-Shmuel et al., the mechanism by which SHP-1 is regulated in NK cells is described. By using YTS-2DL1 cell line and primary NK cells from human donors, they show that phosphorylation of the S591 residue of SHP-1 in NK cells by PKC-θ promotes the inhibited SHP-1 state. They show that the phosphorylation of SHP-1 increases along with the progression of the inhibitory NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS) while slightly decreasing during the progression of the activating NKIS. By silencing PKC-θ the authors show that SHP-1 stays in active conformation, and this causes reduced NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. NK cells treated with PKC-θ siRNA show diminished tumor control, confirming that regulation of SHP-1 through PKC-θ impacts NK cell cytotoxicity and their capacity for in vivo tumor surveillance. The study is going to have an important impact in the field. Altogether, the authors provide evidence of a molecular pathway that sustains the NK cell activation threshold through suppression of SHP-1 activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Ben-Shmuel and colleagues investigates the role of SHP-1 phosphorylation at Serine 591 in NK cell responses. Building on a solid track record of investigating NK cell signaling events, the group of Mira Barda-Saad nicely shows that the S591 phosphorylation of SHP-1 is dynamic and correlates with NK cell activation and inhibition and with the activity of SHP-1 as demonstrated by a FRET probe and a phosphatase assay. They convincingly demonstrate that PKC-θ is the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation. Knock-down of PKC-θ thereby increases SHP-1 activity, promotes the dephosphorylation of SHP-1 targets such as Vav-1 and PLCg1 and more importantly reduces the killing of MHC-1 negative or mismatch targets. These data demonstrate that SHP-1 also plays an important role during NK cell activation and that keeping SHP-1 in an inactive conformation by PKC-θ-mediated phosphorylation is essential for NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. The authors use the NK cell line YTS, but also primary human NK cells sorted for KIR2DL1 expression. Overall, their claims are supported by their data. In addition to a few technical remarks, I would suggest focussing more on the role of PKC-θ-mediated SHP-1 phosphorylation during activating NK cell interactions in figures 7 and 8 by using 721-Cw7 targets for the different YTS mutants and transfectants. This would strengthen the novel point that SHP-1 plays an important role during NK cell activation.</p><p>1. In figure 7D the authors should also use the 721-Cw7 as targets for the SHP-1 ko and PKC-θ-knock-down YTS cells to demonstrate that the reduction of killing in the absence of PKC-θ is dependent of the presence of SHP-1.</p><p>2. The same applies to figure 8, where it would be more informative to see that PKC-θ-knock-down inhibits NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses against 721-Cw7 cells and that this may be rescued by SHP-1 deletion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Ben-Shmuel and colleagues investigated the mechanisms by which the catalytic activity of SHP-I, a tyrosine phosphatase that is a critical negative NK cell regulator, is regulated during NK cell activation and inhibition. They found that activating NK cell interactions promote a rapid SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation that remains stable overtime, whereas minimal SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation was observed during induced inhibitory interactions. It is only at late time points that inhibitory signals induce high SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation. Such phosphorylation is required to inhibit SHP-1 and NK cell activity, as NK cells expressing a SHP-1 phosphor-mimetic serine to aspartic acid residue substitution (SHP-1 S591D) exhibit increased anti-tumor NK function relative to WT SHP-1-expressing cells (Ben-Shmuel et al., 2020). The authors showed by confocal microscopy an accumulation of phosphorylated SHP-1 S591 at the immunological synapse upon interaction with activating NK cell target cells. SHP-I activity is associated to conformational changes (Wang et al., 2011). The authors further used a SHP-1 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) bio- sensor that they have previously developed (Matalon et al., 2018), for which FRET activity is observed when the N and C terminus of the protein are closed, masking the catalytic site. FRET experiments showed that SHP-I is in a conformational inactive state at the immunological synapse as soon as the first 5 minutes of activating NK cell interactions and only after long lasting inhibitory interactions. Ben-Shmuel and coworkers further address by which mechanism SHP-I phosphorylation was achieved. Because the serine kinase PKC−θ was suggested to participate in murine NK cell activity and because PKC−θ localizes to the cytolytic NK synapse during early activation, the authors assessed its possible interplay with SHP-1 in NK cells. They showed that PKC−θ is localized at the immunological synapse early after activating NK cell contact and at late point upon inhibitory contacts. The silencing of PKC−θ limits SHP-1 S591 phosphorylation, SHP-I conformational status and enzymatic activity at the immunological synapse. Finally, they showed that PKC−θ-mediated phosphorylation of SHP-I tunes NK cell activation in vitro. in vivo, PKC−θ silencing of NK cells does not affect their anti-tumor immunity against tumor cells that engage inhibitory NK cell receptors.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but one aspect need to be clarified and extended.

It is of most interest to evaluate the in vivo growth control of cw7 tumor cell killing by PKC−θ-silenced NK cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Ben-Shmuel and colleagues investigates the role of SHP-1 phosphorylation at Serine 591 in NK cell responses.

As expected YTS-2DL1 cells silenced for PKCθ showed reduced degranulation compared to WT YTS-2DL1 cells following incubation with activating 721-Cw7 target cells (Figure 7E). This strengthens our results showing that PKCθ induces SHP-1 inactivation, and that upon its &lt;milestone-start /&gt; &lt;milestone-end /&gt; gene silencing, activated SHP-1 inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity. Indeed, NK cell cytotoxicity was compared between mice that were engrafted with NK SHP-1<sup>-/-</sup> cells gene silenced for PKCθ versus SHP-1 S591D knock-in expressing cells.
