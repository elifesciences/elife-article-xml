How motivation facilitates learning is not well understood. We designed a behavioral task in which mice self-initiate trials to learn cue-reward contingencies and found that the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex (ACC) contains motivation-related signals to maximize rewards. In particular, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach reward-associated cues. Notably, this neural signal persisted over consecutive unrewarded cues until reward-associated cues were reached, and was required for learning. To determine how ACC inherits this motivational signal we performed projection-specific photometry recordings from several inputs to ACC during learning. In doing so, we identified a ramp in bulk neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-ACC projections as mice received unrewarded cues, which continued ramping across consecutive unrewarded cues, and finally peaked upon reaching a reward-associated cue, thus maintaining an extended motivational state. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC confirmed these neural correlates of motivation, and further delineated separate ensembles of neurons that sequentially tiled the ramp. Together, these results identify a mechanism by which OFC maps out task structure to convey an extended motivational state to ACC to facilitate goal-directed learning.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Achieving goals takes motivation.

Imagine being hungry in the middle of a busy metropolis with no cellphone battery and no way of searching for the nearest restaurant. The feeling of hunger provides motivation to search for restaurant signs, scan menus, and contemplate what type of food to eat. If it is dinnertime and many restaurants are full, this motivational state (hunger) may persist for hours until a restaurant is selected. Thus, an animal’s ability to carry out novel actions based on its desired goals is commonly referred to as goal-directed learning. This learning is of a more deliberate, informed nature than habitual learning, as it is sensitive to the current value of outcomes and can lead to a novel sequence of actions for a desired outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tolman, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pezzulo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Goal-directed learning often requires the ability to maintain an extended motivational state even in the midst of distracting and competing external variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>). This function has been long proposed to be carried out by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as patients with PFC lesions struggle to perform tasks that require maintaining a motivational and goal-directed state, in the midst of competing sensory information, such as the Stroop task or the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroop, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan and Raz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milner, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pardo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shallice and Burgess, 1991</xref>). In particular, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated in action selection over long timescales that are influenced by a variety of motivational factors, such as the value and effort required for each outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hauber and Sommer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hillman and Bilkey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wallis and Kennerley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shenhav et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, when animals are given two choice options: one in which high effort leads to high rewards, and one in which low effort leads to low rewards, animals learn to exploit the high-effort, high-reward option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schweimer et al., 2005</xref>). Impairments to the ACC results in animals failing to accurately allocate motivation toward strategies that maximize reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>). Single-unit recordings from ACC have shown that neurons encode for choices that require effort with a higher payoff, giving support for the hypothesis that this region is important for action-outcome associations and allocating resources for learning and for the maximization of reward over long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hillman and Bilkey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monosov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holroyd and Yeung, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hillman and Bilkey, 2012</xref>). While the precise functions of ACC are still debated, its role in goal-directed learning is widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holroyd and Yeung, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botvinick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To provide deeper mechanistic insight into how ACC encodes an extended motivational state to facilitate goal-directed learning, we sought to track how animals learn to adjust their behavior over days-long timescales to maximize reward when cue-reward contingencies change. We designed a task in which mice self-initiate trials and learn to associate cues with reward. Through neural activity recordings during behavior, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach a rewarded cue. Subsequently, by recording neural activity from inputs to ACC we identified a ramp in bulk activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-ACC projections as mice continuously existed unrewarded cues, peaking when they finally reached a rewarded cue, thus tracking an extended motivational state. Finally, cellular resolution imaging of OFC-to-ACC neurons identified populations of neurons that sequentially tile the observed bulk neural activity ramp across unrewarded cue presentations. In particular, neurons that preferentially encoded reward cues, before learning, began to code for unrewarded, cues after learning, including the motivation to exit these rooms to reach more reward-associated cues. Taken together, we identified a mechanism by which OFC neural activity ramps map out task structure and conveys an extended motivational state to ACC to enable goal-directed learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACC contains neural correlates of motivation during learning</title><p>We began by designing a learning task in which mice self-initiate trials and, upon brief cue exposure (an olfactory and auditory cue), learn to stop to collect a water reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Materials and methods).

To test this hypothesis, we injected AAV1-CaMKII-GCaMP6f into the ACC and implanted fiber-optic cannulas to record bulk neural activity in ACC during behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We observed strong neural responses in ACC that were tuned to reward delivery and trial initiations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Notably, the ACC neural signal precedes speed onset in both cases, suggesting that ACC is not tracking speed but rather the motivation to initiate trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We sought to determine how prolonged inhibition of ACC would impact motivation and whether this was required for learning and reward maximization. We injected AAV9-CaMKII-hM4D(Gi) into ACC and performed chemogenetic inhibition during a session of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) injection (ACC inhibition session) versus a session of saline injection (control session) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). We found that ACC inhibition caused mice to have a significant increase in time to initiate trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), which also resulted in a decreased number of rewards received per minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Furthermore, we found a small, but significant, decrease in speed during trial initiation (but not overall session speed), suggesting that ACC inhibition might also impair vigor of movements during trial initiations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, we developed a self-paced behavioral task where mice learned cue-reward contingencies, and identified motivation-related signals in ACC that were required for learning to maximize rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ACC contains neural correlates of extended motivation during learning</title><p>We next sought to increase the motivational demand during learning. We thus extended our task by training mice to learn two sets of cue-outcome relationships, where one cue-set (olfactory+auditory) is associated with a sucrose water reward (hereafter referred to as ‘R’ cues), whereas the other cue-set is associated with no-reward (‘N’ cues). Since mice have been shaped to stop during cue presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it is now effortful for them to learn to continue running through the N cues so that they can reach more R cues, and thus maximize their total rewards in a session. Thus, motivation is assessed not only by ‘time to initiate trials after R cues’, as before, but now also the more effortful measure of ‘time to initiate trials after N cues’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see Materials and methods). We measured overall learning through differences in their lick rates and speed during presentations, expecting progressive suppression of licking and increases in speed in the N cues compared to the R cues across days. Interestingly, we found that mice learned to suppress licking in the N cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; red arrows on day 2) much earlier than learning to increase speed in N cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; red arrows on day 4; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Across the cohort, on average, this increase in speed during N cues began as early as day 3, after they had learned to suppress their licking (day 2), as determined by speed and stop discrimination index (stop DI: % of stops in N – R/all trials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods). Finally, there was also a significant correlation between stop DI and rewards obtained per minute, confirming that the development of this behavioral strategy is tied to reward maximization within a given training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neural activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) scales to match an increased motivational state during learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Schematic of training where mice learn to associate stopping to one set of cues with no water reward (‘N’) or with water reward (‘R’).

As before (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in this two cue-outcome relationship task, we again found that ACC continued to be active during reward delivery and during trial initiations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Additionally, however, in this task we found that ACC began to significantly increase its activity, specifically during N cues, as early as T3, as mice exhibited a learned motivation to leave N cues to reach more R cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). As a further confirmation of this result, we investigated ACC’s activity during extended motivation across two consecutive N cues and found that ACC activity continued to remain high from the initial N cue presentation until an R cue was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These neural responses, and in particular the dF/F difference in N vs R cues, positively correlated with the amount of reward obtained per minute, linking motivation-related ACC activity to overall learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, in all cases, on a trial-by-trial basis, the neural signal preceded the behavioral ramp in speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and was present even if we restricted our analyses to cue presentations in which mice stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting a motivational rather than motor response. To further confirm this dissociation, we passively presented both sets of cues to the mice at the end of each training session. As expected, mice did not develop the motivation to run out of N cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and accordingly, the ACC neural activity was no longer different between N and R cues. These results together suggest that ACC encodes a motivation signal to initiate trials, and in particular corresponds to the behavioral measure of running during N cues to reach more R cues, thus facilitating goal-directed learning.</p><p>We proceeded to test whether these motivation-related signals in ACC are required for learning. To restrict our inhibition to cue presentation portions of our task, and combat any potential off-target effects of CNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manvich et al., 2018</xref>) from repeated administration across several days of training, we used optogenetic inhibition. We injected AAV1-CaMKII-stGtACR2 bilaterally in ACC to express the inhibitory opsin and delivered light selectively when the mouse received R or N cues, for the first 6 days (‘early’) or last 4 days (‘late’) of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We found that early ACC inhibition prevented mice from learning to run out of N cues, even though they still learned to suppress their lick rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Late ACC inhibition had no effect on speed or lick rate behavior, as mice continued to run out during N cues while inhibition occurred, suggesting ACC activity does not broadly suppress speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). All together, we identified an extended motivation signal in ACC that is required for learning and reward maximization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural activity in orbitofrontal projections ramps until rewards are reached</title><p>The ACC receives projections from disparate regions across the brain that could facilitate the integration of value, internal state, and multisensory information, so we sought to identify how afferent projections may convey motivational signals to ACC during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fillinger et al., 2017</xref>).

To do so, we aligned neural responses to trial initiations after N cues, as mice learned to leave N cues to reach more R cues. We found that both OFC<sub>ACC</sub> and AM<sub>ACC</sub> had higher baseline activity during trial initiations after no-rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). To further understand this higher activity after no-rewards we analyzed sequences of ‘RNR’ trials which contained reward, no-reward, and reward cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed a rise in OFC<sub>ACC</sub> activity prior to the N cue presentation that continued to rise until an R cue was reached (black dotted arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We quantified this motivational signal as a difference in pre-cue activity between N and R cues in RNR trial sequences across days and found that this difference emerged at the time of learning (~T3) and closely tracked performance of the learned behavior (T3-T6) for OFC<sub>ACC</sub> and AM<sub>ACC</sub>, but not BLA<sub>ACC</sub> or LC<sub>ACC</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further build confidence in these results, we asked whether this continuous rise in OFC<sub>ACC</sub> activity in RNR sequences would be further extended in RNNR sequences. Indeed, OFC<sub>ACC</sub> activity continued ramping across two consecutive N trials, exhibiting higher pre-cue activity upon entering an R cue after two versus one N (black dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>To more directly determine whether this motivational ramp signal in OFC<sub>ACC</sub> is tied to learning, we separated our mice into two groups, one that learned the task (‘Learners’, stop DI&gt;0.5 for at least 3 consecutive days) and one that did not learn (‘Non-Learners’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The Learners reached a high DI by T6, which persisted throughout the rest of training, whereas the ‘Non-Learners’ only reached a significantly higher DI by T10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Both subsets of mice still learned to discriminate with licking at comparable rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When we compared OFC<sub>ACC</sub> activity in an RNNR sequence of trials, we found that only Learners exhibited a significant ramp in neural activity from the first N cue to the final R cue presentation, which emerged coincidental with behavioral learning and persisted for the remaining days of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, we identify projection activity in OFC that ramps across N cues until an R cue is reached that is specifically tied to the development of a learned goal-directed behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Orbitofrontal projection neurons tile unrewarded trials until rewards are reached</title><p>Given that we identified a ramp in OFC<sub>ACC</sub> bulk neural activity during NNR sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we sought to determine whether a single persistently active population or a sequence of tiled neurons underlies this ramp.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that ensembles of neurons progressively tile the OFC motivational ramp, and that the initial reward responsive neurons become progressively linked to unrewarded cues after learning, thus effectively linking actions to outcomes to maximize rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we developed a self-paced cue-outcome learning task to determine how mice extend their motivational state to maximize reward over long timescales. We identify the ACC as broadly critical to maximizing reward in our task, especially as mice learn to run out of unrewarded cues. We found that upstream inputs to ACC from OFC sustain a ramp-like increase in activity through consecutive unrewarded cues until mice reach rewarded cues. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC projection neurons revealed ensembles of neurons that tile the motivational ramp, and a progressive shift in ensemble tuning during learning such that neurons initially encoding for reward become progressively linked to motivated actions, i.e., trial initiations to reach more rewards. We therefore present a model where OFC contains neurons that increasingly link reward to motivated behaviors, conveying a motivational ramp to ACC, to facilitate learning and reward maximization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>The OFC has been implicated in guiding adaptive, flexible behavior by signaling information about future outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montague and Berns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mainen and Kepecs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017</xref>). One view sees OFC’s function as encoding for the value of the outcomes of events, with various neural correlates having been found for value-guided behavior. Another view sees OFC’s function more as building a model of the causal relationships between events, which may or may not entail value assessments, into a cognitive map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, OFC neurons have been found to encode sensory-sensory associations even prior to any kind of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>). A way to link both perspectives into a single account has been to view value and a cognitive map as occurring along a spectrum, where inferring value onto outcomes hinges upon a map that is created. We have found that mice learn to run out during N cues to more quickly reach R cues, thereby acquiring more rewards over a training session. This behavior can be viewed as both value-guided, as the mouse suppresses their lick rate during N cues, and also requiring a mental model of the environment, as running occurs with the expectation of reaching R cues in the future. Indeed, the pseudorandom trial structure ensures that N cues will be presented no more than two times in a row, such that after two N cues an R cue is guaranteed (see Materials and methods). We thus parsimoniously position OFC as functioning in model-based behaviors, and in the accurate planning of actions based on the learned transition structure of a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drummond and Niv, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We linked the ramp-like increase in neural activity in OFC to motivation, but several questions still remain about how motivation is computed and why it would be represented as a ramp. Motivation could be computed as a combination of several variables such as time since last reward, value of reward, and effort to reach future rewards. Future theory-driven analyses could determine how motivation is computed, and whether individual variables of time, value, and effort are encoded as clusters of similar tuned neurons, or mixed and collectively represented at the population level. In either case, it is likely that a combined map of task space and value information carried by OFC are being used to inform downstream regions, such as ACC, for adjusting behavior.</p><p>The ACC has been shown to carry information necessary for switching or staying with current behaviors during decision-making and learning in order to maximize rewards and minimize threats or punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monosov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>). We posit that ACC reads information from OFC about task structure and value to perform computations relevant to allocating behavioral control. We have seen this through our findings that ACC is important for learned behaviors associated with maximizing rewards in our self-paced learning task. We compare the decision to run during N cues to a foraging decision to leave a patch to find alternative options, and ACC’s importance in the development of this behavior is reminiscent to signals previously described at the time a foraging decision is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanchard and Hayden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>). We found inhibition of ACC activity affected the development of running during N cues, effectively diminishing an animals’ ability to strategy switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarafyazd and Jazayeri, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>). While we did not perform single-cell imaging of ACC in our task, we hypothesize that individual ACC neurons could encode the distribution of actions/opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein-Flügge et al., 2022</xref>) (i.e. stop, run, lick, suppress lick) taken during R or N cues. ACC neurons could compute the relative value of the action taken such that more ACC neurons become recruited once mice learn to run out of N cues. The sustained increase in bulk ACC activity across N cue trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) could come from a stable sequence of individual neurons that encode the timescale of the actions taken. In this way, OFC projections would encode current motivation across N cues before learning, which then triggers ACC to compute the value-based actions. Motivational signals in OFC would thus represent state since past rewards/goals, while in ACC these signals represent actions taken to pursue rewards/goals in the future.</p><p>Here, we studied learning as a systems-level process guided by top-down signals that maintain a motivational state. Our work showed the recruitment of multiple frontal cortical areas in this process, which is to be expected as animals are required to build, maintain, and use representations of task structure and value to drive learned, motivated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein-Flügge et al., 2022</xref>). Future work can build upon the task we developed here to determine how the frontal cortex maintains motivational states across many more cue-outcome associations, and how these associations may dynamically change across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Izquierdo et al., 2017</xref>). Lastly, a more synaptic-level approach into how ACC integrates information from upstream regions during learning could reveal important micro-circuit computations, molecular or structural changes during motivational states and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thornquist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peters et al., 2017</xref>), and potential mechanisms underlying seconds-long behavioral timescale learning rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-CaMKIIa-GCaMP6f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Upenn Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_100834">Addgene#100834</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Douglas Kim</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_100835">Addgene#100835</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-CKIIa-stGtACR2-FusionRed</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ofer Yizhar</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_105669">Addgene#105669</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-CaMKIIa-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bryan Roth</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_50477">Addgene#50477</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-CaMKIIa- mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bryan Roth</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_114469">Addgene#114469</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">rgAAV-hSyn-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">James Wilson</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_105553">Addgene#105553</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ofer Yizhar</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_105677">Addgene#105677</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bryan Roth</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:addgene_50459">Addgene#50459</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All procedures were done in accordance with guidelines derived from and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (protocol #22,087-H) at The Rockefeller University.

In brief, a 200-mm-diameter styrofoam ball was axially fixed with a 6-mm-diameter assembly rod (Thorlabs) passing through the center of the ball and resting on 90° post holders (Thorlabs) at each end, allowing free forward and backward rotation of the ball. Mice were head-fixed in place above the center of the ball using a headplate mount. Virtual environments were designed in the virtual reality MATLAB engine ViRMEn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronov and Tank, 2014</xref>). The virtual environment was displayed by back-projection onto white fabric stretched over a clear acrylic hemisphere with a 14-inch diameter placed ∼20 cm in front of the center of the mouse. The screen encompasses ∼220° of the mouse’s field of view and the virtual environment was back-projected onto this screen using a Vamvo Ultra Mini Portable projector. The rotation of the styrofoam ball was recorded by an optical computer mouse (Logitech) that interfaced with ViRMEn to transport the mouse through the virtual reality environment. A National Instruments Data Acquisition (NIDAQ) device was used to send out TTL pulses to trigger the CMOS camera, laser for optogenetics, and the various Arduinos controlling tones, odors, airpuff, lick ports.

Once mice could run on the ball for 2 s, we introduced a condition to stop during cue onset to trigger water delivery. Over the course of a session, and in subsequent days, the duration needed to stop increased. If a mouse took longer than 10 min to receive their 1 mL of water on a given day, the duration needed to run and/or stop to get water was repeated on the following day until they could reliably walk on the ball for water under 10 min.

At the beginning of the linear track, mice self-initiated trials by running (speed &gt;10 cm/s) down a virtual linear track for 1 s. Olfactory and auditory cues would then be presented for 3 s. The auditory cues consisted of 5 kHz or 9 kHz tones outputted by a thin plastic speaker (Adafruit) and olfactory cues consisting of ɑ-pinene or octanol were diluted with mineral oil to 10% and released by a custom-built olfactometer. Both auditory and olfactory cues were outputted by Arduino code under the control of ViRMEN code. The cues for reward were a 5 kHz tone and ɑ-pinene while the cues for no-reward were 9 kHz tone and octanol. Outcome onset would happen under the condition that a mouse dropped their speed below 10 cm/s for at least 1 s before the end of the cues. If the mouse failed to stop for at least 1 s, they would be immediately placed at the start of the linear track and would need to run for 1 s to trigger the next trial start. The outcomes consisted of free access to 10% sucrose water presented by a lickometer (reward) or no water (no-reward), alongside another presentation of contextual cues, for 3 s. Sucrose water output were controlled by Arduino code under the control of ViRMEN code. After the outcome zone mice were transported to the beginning of the linear track to start the next trial.

Prior to training, mice were given a ‘preexposure’ session where they were exposed to each set of cues, with tap water given upon outcome trigger in both. They were then given 10 days of training (referred to as T1-T10).

This is coupled to another dichroic mirror holder with a 495 nm long pass dichroic (Semrock FF495-Di02-25x36) which redirects the excitation light on to a custom branching fiber-optic patchcord of five bundled 400 mm diameter 0.22 NA fibers (BFP(5)_400/430/1100-0.48_3 m_SMA-5xMF1.25, Doric Lenses) using a 10×/0.5 NA Objective lens (Nikon CFI SFluor 10×, Product No. MRF00100). GCaMP6f fluorescence from neurons below the fiber tip in the brain was transmitted via this same cable back to the mini-cube, where it was passed through a GFP emission filter (Semrock FF01-520/35-25), amplified, and focused onto a high sensitivity sCMOS camera (Prime 95b, Photometrics). The multiple branch ends of a branching fiber-optic patch cord were used to collect emission fluorescence from 1.25 mm diameter light weight ferrules (MFC_400/430-0.48_ZF1.25, Doric Lenses) using a mating sleeve (Doric SLEEVE_ZR_1.25). The excitation was alternated between 405 nm and 470 nm by a custom-made JK flip flop which takes the trigger input from the sCMOS and triggers the two excitation LEDs alternatively. Bulk activity signals were collected using Photometrics data acquisition software, Programmable Virtual Camera Access Method (PVCAM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Photometry recordings</title><p>While mice performed the self-paced contextual learning VR task we recorded bulk calcium signals from five regions: ACC, OFC, AM, BLA, and LC simultaneously. Mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> with ACC recordings also contained OFC, AM, BLA, and LC recordings, which we compile and show all together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We recorded at 18 Hz with excitation wavelengths alternating between 470 nm and 405 nm, capturing calcium dependent and independent signals respectively, resulting in an effective frame rate of 10 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Data processing</title><p>For analysis, the images captured by the CMOS camera were post-processed using custom MATLAB scripts. Regions of interest were manually drawn for each fiber to extract fluorescence values throughout the experiment. The 405 nm reference trace was scaled to best fit the 470 nm signal using least-squares regression. The normalized change in fluorescence (dF/F) was calculated by subtracting the scaled 405 nm reference trace from the 470 nm signal and dividing that value by the scaled 405 nm reference trace. The true baseline of each dF/F trace was determined and corrected by using the MATLAB function <italic>msbackadj</italic>, estimating the baseline over a 200-frame sliding window, regressing varying baseline values to the window’s data points using a spline approximation, then adjusting the baseline in the peak range of the dF/F signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Bulk neural responses</title><p>The adjusted calcium signals from photometry were aligned to task events (e.g. cue onset, reward, trial initiation, etc.) in ViRMEn by time-stamping behavioral frames captured through the NIDAQ. Photometry signals from all animals from a given region were z-scored across the entire session. The mean regional responses to task variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) is the mean of these aligned z-scored signals across all animals, with s.e.m. calculated across all recorded trials. We then sought to quantify the difference in mean average activity patterns observed in response to each cue presentation. To calculate the differential response to reward and trial initiation portions of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we calculated the time it took for dF/F activity to rise above 1 std and speed to rise above 1 cm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or dF/F activity to rise above 0.5 std and speed to rise above 2 cm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

To calculate the differential response to cue onset we calculated the mean z-scored signal from 0 s to 3 s after cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also quantified the difference in pre-cue activity along sequences of trials with one or two no-reward cues to identify ramps in neural activity between reward cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We zeroed the pre-cue activity of all trials within a given sequence to the activity at the time of the first reward cue and calculated the mean z-scored signal between 2 s before to 0 s before cue onset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In vivo cellular resolution calcium imaging</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Imaging setup</title><p>For imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, mice were imaged throughout training in 15 min sessions per day. Volumetric imaging was performed using a resonant galvanometer two-photon imaging system (Bruker), with a laser (Insight DS+, Spectra Physics) tuned to 920 nm to excite the calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, through a 16×/0.8 water immersion objective (Nikon) interfacing with an GRIN lens through a few drops of distilled water. Prior to each session, mice were head-fixed and each GRIN lens was carefully cleaned with 70% ethanol. Fluorescence was detected through GaAs photomultiplier tubes using the Prairie View 5.4 acquisition software. Black dental cement was used to build a well around the implant to minimize light entry into the objective from the projector. High-speed z-stacks were collected in the green channel (using a 520/44 bandpass filter, Semrock) at 512 × 512 pixels covering each x–y plane of 800 × 800 mm over a depth of ~150 μm (30  μm apart) by coupling the 30 Hz rapid resonant scanning (x–y) to a z-piezo to achieve ~3.1 Hz per volume. Average beam power measured at the objective during imaging sessions was between 20 mW and 40 mW. An incoming TTL pulse from ViRMEn at the start of behavior enabled time-locking of behavioral epochs to imaging frames with millisecond precision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Source extraction</title><p>Calcium imaging data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was acquired by Prairie View 5.4 acquisition software and subsequently processed using the Suite2p toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). Motion correction, ROI detection, and neuropil correction were performed as described. Cell identification was verified by manually validating every extracted source. Cell registration across sessions for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was performed with a combination of custom scripts and existing packages (Cell Reg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Calculation of single-cell dF/F and transient identification</title><p>For each cell detected via automated source extraction, a normalized ΔF/F was calculated and individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were identified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, ΔF/F was defined as: (F – F<sub>baseline</sub>)/F<sub>baseline</sub>, where F is the raw output (‘F’) from the suite2p algorithm, and where F<sub>baseline</sub> is the baseline fluorescence, calculated as the mean of the fluorescence values for a given cell, continuously acquired over a 20 s sliding window to account for slow timescale changes observed in the fluorescence across the recording session. For all analysis, this dF/F was then normalized by z-scoring the entire time series across a session. To identify statistically significant transients, we first calculated an estimate of the noise for each cell using a custom MATLAB script, with a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toader et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yadav et al., 2022</xref>). In essence, we identified the limiting noise cutoff level for a given cell using time periods that are unlikely to contain neural events, and then defined a transient as significant if it reached above at least 3σ of this estimated noise level. A custom MATLAB script using the function ‘findpeaks’ was used to identify any remaining obvious transients not identified by this method (typically when multiple transients occurred in rapid succession). Additional specifications required transients to persist above this noise level for at least 300 ms (roughly twice the duration of the half-life decay time of GCaMP6f). The transient duration was defined as the first and last frames where the dF/F reached 3σ. The value of dF/F was set to zero outside the duration of every identified transient to minimize effects of residual background fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Single-cell cue tuning</title><p>To calculate the tuning of an individual cell in anticipation to or during reward or no-reward cues, we z-scored the trial averaged the activity on a given neuron across all the cue presentations for a given reward or no-reward trial. A cell was considered tuned if the magnitude of its trial averaged z-scored activity was at least 0.75 between 3 s before or after cue onset. To find tuning for cues based on previous trial history, we preselected cues that were preceded by specific combinations of trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Transient time analysis</title><p>To calculate the transient times of an individual cell tracked before and after learning, we first preselected cells that are tuned to a particular trial sequence (such as NNR). We then identified the frame when the dF/F value first rises above the noise threshold (see Calculation of single-cell dF/F and transient identification) 7 s before or after cue onset (such as for the R cue in an NNR tuned cell). We took all the transients for any given cell across all the trials in a session, in case a single cell fired more than one transient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample sizes were selected based on expected variance and effect sizes from the existing literature, and no statistical methods were used to determine sample size a priori.

They designed a self-initiated learning task and identified bulk neural responses tuned specifically to reward delivery as well as trial initiation. Interestingly, in both cases, neural activity precedes behavioural onset, indicating the encoding of a motivational signal. To investigate the neural encoding of motivational signals during unrewarded, distracting stimuli presentation, they created a discrimination task by introducing 'no reward' cues, during which animals need to learn not to reduce running speed and not engage in licking. Interestingly, with mice learning to increase running speed and reduce licking rates after 'no reward' cues, the preceding ACC activity also gradually increased. Importantly, only the increase in running speed after 'no reward' cues was impaired upon optogenetic inhibition of ACC activity during early training, linking the extended motivational signal in ACC and learning to maximise rewards by actively avoiding distracting and unrewarded stimuli. Such motivational signals could also be observed in OFC-ACC projecting neurons. Especially the continuous ramping of activity upon repeated 'non-reward' cues, which could be exclusively observed in the 'fast learner' subgroup, provides an interesting concept of how an extended motivational signal necessary for learning avoidance of unrewarded stimuli could be implemented in ACC. The shift in the temporal activity of initially reward-responsive neurons towards the preceding 'no reward' cue, provides a potential mechanism linking extended motivation to reward maximisation. This mechanism seems to be particularly important in periods of persistent 'non-reward' cues, as demonstrated in the impairment of running speed increase after two consecutive 'non-reward' cues.</p><p>Appraisal:</p><p>The authors provide convincing experimental evidence to support their claims of an extended motivational signal encoded in the ACC that is implemented by OFC-ACC signalling and critically involved in learning avoidance of unrewarded stimuli. The newly designed task seems appropriate to identify correlates of relevant cognitive and behavioural variables (e.g. sustained motivation). The combination of recording Ca2+ transients (bulk as well as longitudinal single neuron recordings) to identify potential neural responses and subsequent evaluation of their causal role in establishing and maintaining this persistent motivational state using opto- and pharmacogenetic manipulations is generally accepted.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The findings will be valuable for further research on the impact of motivational states on behaviour and cognition.

We have made the relevant changes to the manuscript to improve the writing and figures. We provide responses below to each of the reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) An important conclusion (Figure 4) is that when mice are trained to run through no reward (N) cues in order to reach reward (R) cues, the OFC neurons projecting to ACC each respond to different specific events in a manner that ensures that collectively they tile the extended behavioural sequence. What I was less sure of was whether the ACC neurons do the same or not. Figure 3 suggests that on average ACC neurons maintain activity across N cues in order to get to R cues but I was not sure whether this was because all individual neurons did this or whether some had activity patterns like the OFC neurons projecting to ACC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it remains uncertain what individual ACC neurons do during the extended behavioral sequence. We now include a few sentences in the discussion about what we hypothesize, as we did not perform the cellular resolution imaging to determine this:</p><p>“While we did not perform single-cell imaging of ACC in our task, we hypothesize that individual ACC neurons could encode the distribution of actions/opportunities47 (i.e. stop, run, lick, suppress lick) taken during R or N cues. ACC neurons could compute the relative value of the action taken such that more ACC neurons become recruited once mice learn to run out of N cues. The sustained increase in bulk ACC activity across N cue trials (Figure 2) could come from a stable sequence of individual neurons that encode the timescale of the actions taken. In this way, OFC projections would encode current motivation across N cues before learning, which then triggers ACC to compute the valuebased actions. Motivational signals in OFC would thus represent state since past rewards/goals, while in ACC these signals represent actions taken to pursue rewards/goals in the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 versus Figure 2: There does not seem to be a particular motivation for whether chemogenetic inactivation or optogenetic inhibition were used in different experiments. I think that this is not problematic but, if I am wrong and there were specific reasons for performing each experiment in a certain way, then further clarification as to why these decisions were made would be useful. If there is no particular reason, then simply explaining that this is the case might stop readers from seeking explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment and we agree that clarification on this is important. We performed chemogenetic inhibition of ACC in Figure 1 to take a broad survey of behavioral effects throughout a 40-min long behavioral session, and performed optogenetic inhibition in Figure 2 because we wanted to restrict our inhibition to the few seconds of cue presentation during a behavioral session and across days. Furthermore, we wanted to combat any potential off-target effects that would come from repeated administration of CNO over the several days of training (Manvich et al 2018). We have included a couple sentences on page 4 to clarify this:</p><p>“We proceeded to test whether these motivation related signals in ACC are required for learning. To restrict our inhibition to cue presentation portions of our task, and combat any potential off-target effects of CNO31 from repeated administration across several days of training, we used optogenetic inhibition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) P5, paragraph 2. The authors argue that OFC and anteriomedial (AM) thalamic inputs into ACC are especially important for mediating motivation through N cues in order to reach R cues. Is this based on a statistical comparison between the activity in OFC or AM inputs as opposed to the other inputs?</p></disp-quote><p>We determined that OFC and AM thalamic inputs to ACC are particularly important by comparing the pre-cue activity in a reward-no reward-reward trial sequence (RNR; Figure 3B). Specifically, we performed paired t-tests comparing pre-cue activity between N and R cues, and found a statistically significant increase for R cues but only for the OFC and AM inputs, not for the BLA or LC inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) P3, paragraph 2. Some papers by Khalighinejad and colleagues (eg Neuron 2020, Current Biology, 2022) might be helpful here in as much as they assess ACC roles in determining action frequency, initiation, and speed and mediating the relationship between reward availability and action frequency and speed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these relevant papers to our attention. We have included these papers in our citations in this paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Paragraph 1 &quot;This learning is of a more deliberate, informed nature than habitual learning, as they are sensitive to the current value of outcomes and can lead to a novel sequence of actions for a desired outcome1-3.&quot; Should &quot;they&quot; be &quot;it&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, we have edited this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Impact:</p><p>The findings will be valuable for further research on the impact of motivational states on behaviour and cognition. The authors provided a promising concept of how persistent motivational states could be maintained, as well as established a novel, reproducible task assay. While experimental methods used are currently state-of-the-art, theoretical analysis seems to be incomplete/not extensive.We thank the reviewer for these comments. In our paper, we performed single-cell calcium imaging of OFC projection neurons to ACC to build a mechanistic understanding for the bulk ramp-like response we identified in these neurons with photometry. We identified ensembles of neurons that tile sequences of trials that match the bulk response, in particular a subset of neurons that are active at the time a reward (R) cue is reached after 2 no-reward (N) cues. We included a paragraph in the discussion to address future theory-driven analyses to address how computation is achieved by OFC projection neurons:</p></disp-quote><p>“We linked the ramp-like increase in neural activity in OFC to motivation, but several questions still remain about how motivation is computed and why it would be represented as a ramp. Motivation could be computed as a combination of several variables such as time since last reward, value of reward, and effort to reach future rewards. Future theorydriven analyses could determine how motivation is computed, and whether individual variables of time, value, and effort, are encoded as clusters of similar tuned neurons, or mixed and collectively represented at the population level. In either case, it is likely that a combined map of task space and value-information carried by OFC are being used to inform downstream regions, such as ACC, for adjusting behavior. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the layout of the figures seems a little bit chaotic and makes it hard to understand the boundaries between panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the figure layout could be improved upon to aid the reader in moving from panel to panel.

We believe that prefrontal areas would be recruited as tasks to study motivational states become more complex and require animals to keep track of task structure and perform value-guided actions. We have included a couple sentences in the final paragraph of the discussion about this:</p><p>“Our work showed the recruitment of multiple frontal cortical areas in this process, which is to be expected as animals are required to build, maintain, and use representations of task structure and value to drive learned, motivated behaviors47. Future work can build upon the task we developed here to determine how the frontal cortex maintains motivational states across many more cue-outcome associations, and how these associations may dynamically change across time48”.</p><p>Additionally, we included a short discussion on how in motivational signals differ between OFC and ACC in our work. We suggest OFC encodes current motivation before and after learning, which then leads ACC to represent learned actions taken and thus have a longer timescale motivational response (see response to Reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor: Page 4, Line 1: &quot;increase&quot; instead of &quot;increases&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, we have edited this in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
