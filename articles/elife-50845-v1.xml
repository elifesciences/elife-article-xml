chemical transformation in the gut microbial metabolism of plant- and host-derived small molecules. However, the molecular basis for this transformation and its distribution among gut microorganisms are poorly understood. Here, we characterize a molybdenum-dependent enzyme from the human gut bacterium <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> that dehydroxylates catecholamine neurotransmitters. Our findings suggest that this activity enables <italic>E. lenta</italic> to use dopamine as an electron acceptor. We also identify candidate dehydroxylases that metabolize additional host- and plant-derived catechols. These dehydroxylases belong to a distinct group of largely uncharacterized molybdenum-dependent enzymes that likely mediate primary and secondary metabolism in multiple environments. Finally, we observe catechol dehydroxylation in the gut microbiotas of diverse mammals, confirming the presence of this chemistry in habitats beyond the human gut. These results suggest that the chemical strategies that mediate metabolism and interactions in the human gut are relevant to a broad range of species and habitats.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the human gut there are trillions of bacteria. These microbes are critical for breaking down and modifying molecules that the body consumes (such as nutrients and drugs) and produces (such as hormones). Although metabolizing these molecules is known to impact health and disease, little is known about the specific components, such as the genes and enzymes, involved in these reactions.</p><p>A prominent microbial reaction in the gut metabolizes molecules by removing a hydroxyl group from an aromatic ring and replacing it with a hydrogen atom. This chemical reaction influences the fate of dietary compounds, clinically used drugs and chemicals which transmit signals between nerves (neurotransmitters). But even though this reaction was discovered over 50 years ago, it remained unknown which microbial enzymes are directly responsible for this metabolism.</p><p>In 2019, researchers discovered the human gut bacteria <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> produces an enzyme named Dadh that can remove a hydroxyl group from the neurotransmitter dopamine. Now, Maini Rekdal et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – have used a range of different experiments to further characterize this enzyme and see if it can break down molecules other than dopamine. This revealed that Dadh specifically degrades dopamine, and this process promotes <italic>E. lenta</italic> growth.</p><p>Next, Maini Rekdal et al. uncovered a group of enzymes that had similar characteristics to Dadh and could metabolize molecules other than dopamine, including molecules derived from plants and nutrients in food. These Dadh-like enzymes were found not only in the guts of humans, but in other organisms and environments, including the soil, ocean and plants.</p><p>Plant-derived molecules are associated with human health, and the discovery of the enzymes that break down these products could provide new insights into the health effects of plant-based foods. In addition, the finding that gut bacteria harbor a dopamine metabolizing enzyme has implications for the interaction between the gut microbiome and the nervous system, which has been linked to human health and disease. These newly discovered enzymes are also involved in metabolic reactions outside the human body. Future work investigating the mechanisms and outputs of these reactions could improve current strategies for degrading pollutants and producing medically useful molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human gastrointestinal tract is one of the densest microbial habitats on Earth. Possessing 150-fold more genes than the human genome, the trillions of organisms that make up this community (the human gut microbiota) harbor metabolic capabilities that expand the range of chemistry taking place in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koppel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sender et al., 2016</xref>). Microbial metabolism affects host nutrition and health by breaking down otherwise inaccessible carbohydrates, biosynthesizing essential vitamins, and transforming endogenous and exogenous small molecules into bioactive metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koppel and Balskus, 2016</xref>). Gut microbial activities can also vary significantly between individuals, affecting the toxicity and efficacy of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zimmermann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koppel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wallace et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haiser et al., 2013</xref>), susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devlin and Fischbach, 2015</xref>), and host metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Romano et al., 2017</xref>). To decipher the biological roles of gut microbial metabolism, it is critical that we uncover the enzymes responsible for prominent transformations. This will not only increase the information gained from microbiome sequencing data but may also illuminate strategies for manipulating and studying microbial functions. Yet, the vast majority of gut microbial metabolic reactions have not yet been linked to specific enzymes.</p><p>A prominent but poorly understood gut microbial activity is the dehydroxylation of catechols (1,2-dihydroxylated aromatic rings), a structural motif commonly found in a diverse range of compounds that includes dietary phytochemicals, host neurotransmitters, clinically used drugs, and microbial siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ozdal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Discovered over six decades ago, catechol dehydroxylation is a uniquely microbial reaction that selectively replaces the <italic>para</italic> hydroxyl group of the catechol with a hydrogen atom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheline et al., 1960</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This reaction is particularly challenging due to the stability of the aromatic ring system. Prominent substrates for microbial dehydroxylation include the drug fostamatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sweeny et al., 2010</xref>), the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smith et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sandler et al., 1971</xref>), the phytochemicals ellagic acid (found in nuts and berries), caffeic acid (a universal lignin precursor in plants), and catechin (present in chocolate and tea) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peppercorn and Goldman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerdá et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takagaki and Nanjo, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Dehydroxylation alters the bioactivity of the catechol compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryu et al., 2016</xref>) and produces metabolites that act both locally in the gut and systemically to influence human health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sweeny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pietinen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mabrok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). However, the gut microbial enzymes responsible for catechol dehydroxylation have remained largely unknown.</p><p>We recently reported the discovery of a catechol dehydroxylating enzyme from the prevalent human gut Actinobacterium <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic>. This enzyme participates in an interspecies gut microbial pathway that degrades the Parkinson’s disease medication L-dopa by catalyzing the regioselective <italic>p</italic>-dehydroxylation of dopamine to <italic>m</italic>-tyramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>). To identify the enzyme, we grew <italic>E. lenta</italic> strain A2 with and without dopamine and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to find genes induced by dopamine. Only 15 genes were significantly upregulated in the presence of dopamine, including a putative molybdenum-dependent enzyme that was induced &gt;2500 fold. Hypothesizing this gene encoded the dopamine dehydroxylase, we purified the enzyme from <italic>E. lenta</italic> and confirmed its activity in vitro. Dopamine dehydroxylase (Dadh) is predicted to bind bis-molybdopterin guanine nucleotide (bis-MGD), a complex metallocofactor that contains a catalytically essential molybdenum atom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hille et al., 2014</xref>). Our previous work illuminated a role for Dadh in dopamine metabolism by pure strains and complex communities. Here, we sought to explore the substrate scope of Dadh and its broader role in catechol dehydroxylation by the gut microbiota.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A molybdenum-dependent enzyme from <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> specifically metabolizes catecholamines that are available in the gut</title><p>Because the human gut microbiota metabolizes a range of catecholic compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we first investigated whether the recently discovered Dadh possessed promiscuous dehydroxylase activity. We evaluated the reactivity of natively purified <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2 Dadh towards a panel of established or potential host- and diet-derived catechol substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This enzyme displayed a narrow substrate scope, metabolizing only dopamine and the structurally related neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which differ only by the presence of a benzylic hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To identify the elements necessary for substrate recognition by Dadh, we profiled its activity towards synthetic and commercially available dopamine analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). We found that Dadh tolerated only minor modifications to the dopamine scaffold, including a single <italic>N</italic>-methylation and the presence of additional hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The catechol moiety was absolutely necessary for activity, and dehydroxylation required that at least one hydroxyl group be in the <italic>para</italic> position relative to the aminoethyl substituent.

We grew <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2 to early exponential phase and then added each catechol substrate, harvesting the cells after ~1.5 hr of induction. Hydrocaffeic acid and (+)-catechin each upregulated a number of genes (21 and 43, respectively), including two predicted molybdenum-dependent enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2a and 2b</xref>). While one of these predicted molybdenum-dependent enzymes was among the highest upregulated genes in response to each substrate (450-fold upregulated in response to catechin, &gt;2000 fold with hydrocaffeic acid), the expression of the other enzyme was only increased 3-fold relative to the vehicle. Thus, we propose that the most highly upregulated molybdenum-dependent enzyme in each dataset is the most reasonable candidate dehydroxylase. The candidate hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase (Elenta-A2_02815, named <italic>hcdh</italic>) shares 35.3% amino acid identity with Dadh, while the candidate (+)-catechin dehydroxylase (E. lenta-A2_00577, named <italic>cadh</italic>) shares 50.9% amino acid identity with Dadh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2a-2c</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the involvement of a molybdenum enzyme in each dehydroxylation reaction, we cultured the genetically intractable <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2 in the presence of tungstate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rothery et al., 2008</xref>). As with dopamine dehydroxylation, tungstate inhibited dehydroxylation of (+)-catechin and hydrocaffeic acid by <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2 without inhibiting growth in the rich BHI medium, suggesting these activities are indeed molybdenum dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Tungstate did not inhibit benzyl ether reduction of (+)-catechin, indicating this step is likely performed by a distinct enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we found that the overall distribution of the genes encoding these the putative hydrocaffeic acid and (+)-catechin dehydroxylating enzymes across closely related <italic>Eggerthella</italic> strains correlated with metabolism of each substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, all <italic>Eggerthella</italic> strains except AN5LG harbored the putative hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase and could dehydroxylate this substrate.

Our studies of Dadh revealed a high specificity for catecholamines, supporting the hypothesis that the physiological role of this enzyme is to enable neurotransmitter metabolism by <italic>E. lenta</italic>. This idea is also consistent with recent observations of gut bacteria using specific neurotransmitters for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strandwitz et al., 2019</xref>). To our knowledge, Dadh is the first catecholamine-metabolizing enzyme from a human gut commensal. However, interactions between catecholamines and intestinal pathogens are well-characterized and have long been known as key players in virulence and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freestone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lyte and Ernst, 1992</xref>). Whereas pathogenic organisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> require the intact catechol group of dopamine and norepinephrine to sequester iron and boost growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freestone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lyte and Ernst, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rooks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dichtl et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that <italic>E. lenta</italic> uses these molecules as electron acceptors. Thus, Dadh might represent a novel strategy by which gut bacteria take advantage of catecholamines present in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisenhofer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenhofer et al., 1996</xref>). Understanding the interplay between pathogenic and commensal interactions with catecholamines is an intriguing avenue for further research.</p><p>In addition to characterizing Dadh, we discovered candidate dehydroxylases that metabolize (+)-catechin, hydrocaffeic acid, and DOPAC. We also partially purified the hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase to confirm its involvement in this reaction. Further biochemical studies are important for validating the activities of the remaining enzymes, but our preliminary data support a working model in which catechol dehydroxylation is performed by distinct enzymes that are specialized for individual substrates. We identified large numbers of uncharacterized dehydroxylases encoded within individual <italic>Eggerthella</italic> and <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), hinting at an expansion of this group of enzymes among human gut Actinobacteria. While it remains to be seen whether these uncharacterized enzymes are also specific for distinct substrates, this type of diversification of closely related enzymes indicates a potentially important role for catechol dehydroxylation in the human gut microbiota. Expansion of enzyme families within specific clades of gut microbes is well-characterized in the context of polysaccharide metabolism. For example, individual human gut Bacteroides strains isolates harbor hundreds of polysaccharide utilization loci but upregulate only a subset of genes in response to distinct substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rogowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ndeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larsbrink et al., 2014</xref>). This transcriptional regulation and biochemical specificity enables utilization of various host- or plant-derived carbon sources depending on their availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hehemann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sonnenburg et al., 2010</xref>). The diversity of catechol dehydroxylases might have evolved in a similar manner, providing a biochemical arsenal that enables Actinobacteria to use a range of different electron acceptors whose availability depends on the diet and/or physiology of the host. Identifying the substrates of uncharacterized catechol dehydroxylases could shed light on the adaptation of gut organisms to small molecules produced and ingested by the host.</p><p>In addition to uncovering the diversity of catechol dehydroxylases, our study illustrates that the chemical strategies used to enable microbial survival and interactions in the human gut may be relevant to a broad range of species and habitats. While mammalian gut microbiomes have previously been compared in terms of gene content and species composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reese et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coelho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Youngblut et al., 2019</xref>), our study provides functional evidence for conservation of specific gut microbial metabolic pathways across distinct hosts. While this hints at potentially important roles for catechol dehydroxylation across mammalian gut communities, the distribution of putative dehydroxylases among environmental microbes suggests this chemistry is present in many additional microbial habitats. This reinforces findings from studies of additional gut microbial enzymes. For example, gut microbial carbohydrate-degrading enzymes and glycyl radical enzymes, which play important roles in degrading diet-derived polysaccharides, amino acids, and osmolytes in the human gut, are also found in environmental isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ndeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peck et al., 2019</xref>). Enzyme discovery in the human gut microbiota not only has implications for improving human health and disease, but also for discovering novel catalytic functions and metabolic pathways broadly relevant to microbial life. Our study now sets the stage for further investigations of the chemical mechanisms and biological consequences of catechol dehydroxylation in the human body and beyond.</p><p>More broadly, our study underscores how enzyme discovery can help to dissect the metabolic diversity of gut microbial strains and communities. Although previous studies had linked certain dehydroxylation reactions to individual gut Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takagaki and Nanjo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Selma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bess et al., 2020</xref>), we have found that specific catechol dehydroxylases are variably distributed among closely related strains and human gut metagenomes. These findings reinforce the idea that gut microbial phylogeny is often not predictive of functional capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koppel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martínez-del Campo et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, we noticed that the prevalence of the different dehydroxylation reactions among human and animal gut microbiota samples reflected their distribution among individual Actinobacterial strains, with hydrocaffeic acid metabolism being the most prevalent across all strains and species, and DOPAC dehydroxylation being the least prevalent. This may suggest that the strain-level variability in dehydroxylases is important for metabolism both within humans and other mammalian species. While the evolutionary forces shaping the distribution of specific dehydroxylases within gut bacterial strains and complex gut communities remain unknown, our data provide a starting point for further understanding the effects of catechol dehydroxylation on both gut microbiota and host.</p><p>Finally, our findings provide a framework for linking metabolic transformations performed by complex gut microbial communities to individual strains, genes, and enzymes. Our broad exploration of a class of metabolic transformations contrasts with the more common focus on metabolism of individual drugs or dietary compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koppel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martínez-del Campo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). This functional group-focused approach may greatly increase the efficiency with which we can link metabolic activities to microbial genes and enzymes. We envision that related experimental workflows could find broad utility in the discovery of gut microbial enzymes catalyzing other widespread, biologically significant reactions, including reductive metabolism of additional functional groups that are prevalent in diverse molecules encountered by the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koppel et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec

First, <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2 starter cultures were inoculated from single colonies into liquid BHI medium and were grown for 30 hr. Starter cultures were diluted 1:100 into 5 L of BHI medium containing 1% arginine and 10 mM formate and grown anaerobically at 37°C for 16 hr. Dopamine was added as a solid to a final concentration of 0.5 mM in the cultures. Cells were pelleted in 5 separate 1 L bottles by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 15 mins), and each pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of 20 mM Tris pH 8 containing 4 mg/mL SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail. Resuspended cells were then lysed using two rounds of sonication in an anaerobic chamber (Branson Sonifier 450, 2 min total, 10 s on, 40 s off, 25% amplitude). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (10800 rpm, 15 mins), and the soluble fractions were subjected to two rounds of ammonium sulfate precipitation. During the precipitation, three different tubes each containing 40 mL total clarified lysate were precipitated in parallel. Solid ammonium sulfate was first dissolved in these clarified lysates to a final concentration of 30% (w/v), and lysates were left for 1 hr and 20 min followed by centrifugation to pellet the precipitates (4000 rpm, 15 mins). The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was mixed with additional solid ammonium sulfate to achieve a final concentration of 40% (w/v) and left for 1 hr and 20 min. Following centrifugation (4000 rpm, 15 mins) and removal of supernatant, each pellet containing the precipitated proteins was re-dissolved in 20 mL 20 mM Tris pH 8 containing 0.5 M ammonium sulfate. The re-dissolved pellets were combined and centrifuged to remove particulates (10800 rpm, 15 mins). The resulting 60 mL solution was injected onto an FPLC (Bio-Rad BioLogic DuoFlow System equipped with GE Life Sciences DynaLoop90) for hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using 5 × 1 mL HiTrap Phenyl HP columns (GE Life Sciences, catalog# 17135101). Fractions were eluted with a gradient of 0.5 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate (in 20 mM Tris pH 8) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and were tested for activity using the assay described below. The majority of the dopamine dehydroxylase activity eluted around 0.05 M-0.1 M ammonium sulfate. Active fractions displaying &gt;50% conversion of dopamine were combined and injected onto the FPLC system described above for anion exchange chromatography using a UNO Q1 column (Bio-Rad, catalog# 720–0001) at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min.

Illumina cDNA libraries were generated using a modified version of the RNAtag-Seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shishkin et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was fragmented, depleted of genomic DNA, and dephosphorylated prior to its ligation to DNA adapters carrying 5’-AN8-3’ barcodes with a 5’ phosphate and a 3’ blocking group. Barcoded RNAs were pooled and depleted of rRNA using the RiboZero rRNA depletion kit (Epicentre). These pools of barcoded RNAs were converted to Illumina cDNA libraries in three main steps: (i) reverse transcription of the RNA using a primer designed to the constant region of the barcoded adaptor; (ii) addition of a second adapter on the 3’ end of the cDNA during reverse transcription using SmartScribe RT (Clonetech) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shishkin et al., 2015</xref>); (iii) PCR amplification using primers that target the constant regions of the 3’ and 5’ ligated adaptors and contain the full sequence of the Illumina sequencing adaptors. cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500.

The 96-well plates used in this experiment were purchased from VWR (catalog# 10861–562).

Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating wells, in triplicate, with Actinobacterial strains that were cultured on BHI++ agar plates. Additional wells served as sterile controls. Plates were sealed with tape and incubated at 37°C for 12 to 18 hr to afford dense cultures. Next, 99 μL of BHI++ medium containing 500 μM of compound were aliquoted into the wells of a 96-well plate. To these wells, 1 μL of dense seed culture (or sterile control) was added.

Electrospray ionization was enabled through applying a voltage of 1.8 kV using a home-made electrode junction at the end of the microcapillary column and sprayed from fused silica pico tips (New Objective, MA). The LTQ Orbitrap Elite was operated in data-dependent mode for the mass spectrometry methods. The mass spectrometry survey scan was performed in the Orbitrap in the range of 395–1,800 m/z at a resolution of 6 × 10<sup>4</sup>, followed by the selection of the twenty most intense ions (TOP20) for CID-MS2 fragmentation in the Ion trap using a precursor isolation width window of 2 m/z, AGC setting of 10,000, and a maximum ion accumulation of 200 ms. Singly charged ion species were not subjected to CID fragmentation. Normalized collision energy was set to 35 V and an activation time of 10 ms.

Sequest HT searches were performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance and requiring each peptide’s N-/C-termini to adhere with trypsin protease specificity, while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethyl (+57.021) was set as a static modification while methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as a variable modification. A MS2 spectra assignment false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% on protein level was achieved by applying the target-decoy database search. Filtering was performed using a Percolator (64bit version). For quantification, a 0.02 m/z window centered on the theoretical m/z value of each the six reporter ions and the intensity of the signal closest to the theoretical m/z value was recorded.

In particular, we performed a pBLAST search in Uniprot using perchlorate reductase (Uniprot ID# PCRA_DECAR), ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (Uniprot ID# Q5NZV2_AROAE), acetylene hydratase (Uniprot ID# AHY_PELAE), and pyrogallol transhydroxylase (Uniprot ID# PGTL_PELAC) as the queries, and collected sequences with 85–90% amino acid ID.

Nodes represented sequences with 75% amino acid identity. The SSN was imported into Cytoscope v 3.2.1 and visualized with the ‘Organic layout’ setting.

First, the <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> A2 dopamine dehydroxylase (Dadh) protein sequence was used as the query sequence for a tBLASTn search of 26 previously sequenced Actinobacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisanz et al., 2018</xref>) (April 23, 2019). The genomes were loaded in Geneious (version 11) and hits with an amino acid ID of &gt;30% and e-value of e-34 were considered potential dehydroxylase hits and were saved. This cutoff was chosen because sequences captured within this window more closely resembled the acetylene hydratase and Dadh than to any other biochemically characterized moco enzyme, as assessed by percent amino acid identity. In addition, we used the representative <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> enzyme Cldh as a separate query to identify the more distantly related, smaller enzymes from <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> that were not detected when using the large, multi-subunit Dadh as the query. Specifically, we used tBLASTn to search the 26 Actinobacterial genomes for the <italic>Gordonibacter pamelaeae</italic> 3C Cldh protein sequence. Hits from <italic>Paraeggerthella hongongensis, Gordonibacter pamelaeae</italic> 3C and <italic>Gordonibacter sp.</italic> 28C, the only organisms containing these smaller Cldh-like enzymes in our collection, were saved. Again, amino acid ID of &gt;30% and e-value of e-34 were considered potential hits because sequences captured within this window more closely resembled the acetylene hydratase and Dadh than to any other biochemically characterized moco enzyme, as assessed by percent amino acid identity. The hits from our searches with Cldh and Dadh were combined into a preliminary database in Geneious. To expand the sequence diversity within this database, we used Cldh and Dadh as queries for two separate tBLASTn searches in NCBI (nucleotide collection). To ensure that we captured diversity beyond human gut microbes, we excluded <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> and <italic>Eggerthella</italic> as organisms in the tBLASTn searches for Cldh and Dadh queries, respectively. For the two searches, sequences of &gt;29% amino acid ID and e-value of e-55 were considered potential dehydroxylase hits. This was a more conservative cutoff than we used with human Actinobacteria and was selected based on the observation that the pBLAST alignment of Dadh and Cldh has an e value of e-45% and 29% amino acid ID. The sequences retrieved from NCBI were added to the database already containing the hits from searches of the 26 Actinobacterial genomes. In addition, we added the biochemically characterized <italic>E. coli</italic> bis-MGD enzyme DMSO reductase (DmsA, Uniprot ID#P18775) to this database as the outgroup. This sequence was also used as the root of the tree. For phylogenetic analysis of these sequences, we first aligned sequences in Geneious using MUSCLE and removed sequences that were 95% identical to each other (considered duplicates).

The catalytic subunit of the putative DOPAC dehydroxylase (<italic>dodh</italic>), as well as its predicted 4Fe-4S partner, are highlighted in red. Data are from n = 3 cultures for each condition. The experiment was performed once. Supplementary file 2f. Proteomics identification of proteins in the band of interest during the activity-based native purification of the hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase from <italic>E. lenta</italic> A2. The band highlighted with a red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> was cut out and subjected to proteomics. This band was confirmed to contain the catalytic subunit of the hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase (highlighted in red). The predicted size of 133.9 kDa (a) is for the full peptide containing the Twin Arginine Translocation (TAT) signal sequence. The predicted size of 130.5 kDa (b) is for the processed, mature peptide where the TAT signal sequence has been removed, as is suggested from the coverage map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-50845-supp2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Tables containing accession numbers for protein sequences used in bioinformatics analyses of catechol dehydroxylase enzymes.</title><p>Supplementary file 3a. Accession numbers (Uniprot and Genbank) of putative Eggerthella and Gordonibacter dehydroxylases identified in this study.

For example, given the isolate data, from generally low abundance Actinobacteria, how prevalent do you think these functions actually are in human guts? Your human gut data (Figure 2E) suggest that individuals can have log order differences in Dadh copy number and that some ex vivo communities are responsive to dopamine, while others are not. Why might this be? Are there other enzymes, such as those in the SSN, that might perform this function? In Figure 2—figure supplement 7, <italic>E. lenta</italic> counts do not increase in response to dopamine in all ex vivo samples – what might be behind this observation? The observed functional and metabolic diversity across human individuals is obviously fascinating and more could be done to discuss it in the context of the rest of the paper.</p><p>Notwithstanding these comments, there was general agreement that this is a fine example of the integrated use of different approaches to elucidate a previously mysterious metabolic activity of the gut microbiome (catechol dehydroxylation), both by discovering the family of enzymes responsible for it and demonstrating its apparent benefit for the encoding bacteria.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were all very positive, but also agreed that the work would be enhanced by more definitive data showing directly that at least one of the newly identified enzymes is responsible for the observed chemical transformations.

Therefore, we feel that chemical genetics (tungstate-dependent inhibition of catechol dehydroxylation) and comparative genomics are the best proxies for traditional knock-out/knock-in experiments.</p><p>Heterologous expression is similarly challenging due to the complex assembly of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, which require active chaperones for insertion of the co-factors and, for membrane-anchored proteins such as those identified in <italic>Eggerthella</italic>, requires translocation of the folded protein across the cell membrane by means of the Twin Arginine Translocation (TAT) system (Iobbi-Nivol and Leimkuhler, 2013). In our previous study on the discovery of the dopamine dehydroxylase (<italic>dadh</italic>) (Rekdal et al., 2019), we reported attempting heterologous expression of <italic>dadh</italic>, trying &gt;20 constructs and multiple heterologous hosts. All of these efforts failed to provide active, soluble protein. During the submission and revision of this manuscript, we attempted heterologous expression of <italic>hcdh, dodh,</italic> and <italic>cldh</italic>, again exploring multiple constructs and phylogenetic hosts (<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shewanella</italic> sp. ANA-3), without successfully obtaining soluble, active protein. These negative results likely reflect the complexity of assembling these multi-subunit metalloenzymes, which likely requires system-specific chaperones and maturation factors that are present in the native organisms but may not be present in the heterologous host.</p><p>To link one of the additional candidate dehydroxylases identified in this study to its proposed biochemical activity, we turned to native purification, the strategy we used to confirm the identity of the dopamine dehydroxylase. We focused on the hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase (Hcdh) from <italic>E. lent</italic>a A2, using an anaerobic activity-based purification strategy to identify the protein responsible for hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylation. Following ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography, we isolated a combined set of fractions that contained five major bands as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4—figure supplement 4) and quantitatively dehydroxylated hydrocaffeic acid into <italic>m</italic>-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (<italic>m</italic>-HPPA) under anaerobic conditions (Figure 4D). As in our cell suspension assays, oxygen inhibited the enzymatic activity (Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We cut out the band with the apparent correct size (130.5 kDa) (Figure 4—figure supplement 4) and confirmed using proteomics that this band harbored the molybdenum-dependent enzyme that we had assigned as the hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylase (Hcdh, Elenta-A2_02815) (Figure 4—figure supplement 5 and Supplementary file 2F) based on our RNA-sequencing, tungstate inhibition, and comparative genomics data. The protein band also contained three other proteins, suggesting that these proteins elute close to each other on the SDS-page gel. The Hcdh proteomics data suggested that we recovered peptides with &gt;60% coverage of the Hcdh peptide sequence, and notably the coverage starts at the very end of the predicted TAT signal sequence cleavage site, which strongly suggests the immature Hcdh protein (134 kDa) undergoes TAT signal sequence cleavage as part of maturation into its final form (130.5 kDa) (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Having established the presence of Hcdh, we diluted the fractions 1:5 in buffer and performed an additional set of independent enzyme reactions to evaluate the preliminary substrate scope of Hcdh. Consistent with our lysate data (Figure 4A), the enzyme only dehydroxylated only hydrocaffeic acid and did not accept dopamine, (+)-catechin, or DOPAC (Figure 4E).</p><p>As the original anaerobic native purification protocol for the dopamine dehydroxylase took more than five months to develop, we believe that further optimization is necessary to increase the yield and purity of the Hcdh protein. However, we are confident that this preliminary experiment provides initial biochemical evidence that links the <italic>hcdh</italic> gene to hydrocaffeic acid dehydroxylation, further supporting the proposal that distinct enzymes dehydroxylate distinct substrates.</p><p>We have updated the main text (subsection “Gut Actinobacteria dehydroxylate individual catechols using distinct enzymes”, sixth paragraph, and Figure 4D, E) and Figure 4—figure supplements 4 and 5, Supplementary file 2F) to reflect these new findings.</p><p>Finally, during the revision, we performed additional follow-up experiments screening all members of the gut Actinobacterial library for metabolism of DOPAC, (+)-catechin, and hydrocaffeic acid using LC-MS analysis. Our repetition experiment corroborated our previous findings, except in the case of (+)-catechin metabolism by <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> AB12#2. We had previously found that this strain lacked metabolism, but we now found it displayed low metabolism (&lt;10%) towards this substrate. This strain does not encode the putative catechin dehydroxylase, suggesting that in this strain another enzyme might be responsible for the observed metabolism. As we have now confirmed the assignment of the Hcdh enzyme and the molybdenum-dependence of this reaction in <italic>E. lenta</italic>, we do not feel that this discrepancy alters the major conclusions of our study. We have therefore updated the main text (subsection “Gut Actinobacteria dehydroxylate individual catechols using distinct enzymes, third paragraph, Figure 4C, and Figure 4—source data 1 to reflect these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more general suggestion is that the disparate nature of the data make for a somewhat disconnected presentation. We would strongly encourage you to think of ways to connect the different data sources more strongly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and agree that a more integrated discussion and highlight of the different experiments could make for a more compelling presentation. We have taken your suggestions into account in an effort to connect data sources across experiments as described in the responses to the specific individual comments provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, given the isolate data, from generally low abundance Actinobacteria, how prevalent do you think these functions actually are in human guts?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the Actinobacteria in which we identity the candidate catechol dehydroxylases are generally found at low abundances in human samples. However, the distribution of catechol dehydroxylation in the human gut microbiota remained an unanswered question that was not addressed in our original submission.</p><p>To address this question, we have conducted two additional experiments.</p><p>First, we explored the distribution and abundance of <italic>dadh, hcdh, cadh, dodh,</italic> and the recently identified catechol lignan dehydroxylase <italic>cldh</italic> (Bess et al., 2019)among &gt;1800 publicly available human gut metagenomes (Nayfach, Fischbach and Pollard, 2015). Although these catechol dehydroxylases are found at generally low abundances in these metagenomes, they differ in their distribution. <italic>Dadh</italic> and <italic>hcdh</italic> are the most prevalent (in &gt;70% and &gt;90% of individuals, respectively), followed by <italic>cadh</italic> (30%), and <italic>dodh</italic> (20%) and <italic>cldh</italic> (25%) (Figure 5A). Notably, the variable prevalence of catechol dehydroxylase-encoding genes in these metagenomes was consistent with their distribution among individual human gut Actinobacterial isolates (Figure 4C). This analysis ties together our experiments with individual human gut Actionbacteria and our work with complex communities, suggesting that gene prevalence among individual isolates is relevant to the broader prevalence in gut metagenomes.</p><p>Second, we incubated complex gut microbiota communities from unrelated humans (n=12) ex vivo with hydrocaffeic acid, (+)-catechin, and stable-isotope deuterium-labeled dopamine and DOPAC and analyzed dehydroxylation by LC-MS/MS. In this experiment, we observed dehydroxylation of dopamine, hydrocaffeic acid, and DOPAC across the majority of subjects (n=10, n=11, n=12, respectively), indicating that the metabolic activities of low-abundance gut Actinobacteria are observed in complex gut communities (Figure 5B-D). However, catechol metabolism varied between compounds and also between subjects, with some individuals metabolizing all compounds, and some metabolizing none (Figure 5B-D). We found that (+)-catechin was depleted without production of the corresponding dehydroxylated metabolites, consistent with this compound undergoing a wide range of metabolic reactions in complex communities (Figure 5—source data 1) (Takagaki and Nanjo, 2013); van't Slot and Humpf, 2009; Aura et al., 2008). To investigate whether the metabolism correlated with the presence of specific dehydroxylase enzymes, we further investigated DOPAC dehydroxylation. We separated the 12 samples into a group of 9 metabolizers and 3 non-metabolizers (in which no biological replicate displayed dehydroxylation activity). qPCR enumeration in these cultures revealed that the abundance of the candidate DOPAC dehydroxylase gene <italic>dodh</italic> discriminated metabolizing and nonmetabolizing subjects (p&lt;0.001, unpaired t-test) (Figure 4E), and correlated significantly with dehydroxylation activity within the 9 metabolizers (Pearson’s correlation, r=0.73, R<sup>2</sup>=0.53, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 4F). This gene-activity correlation is consistent with our previous observations that <italic>dadh</italic> SNP status correlates with dopamine metabolism in human subjects ex vivo(Rekdal et al., 2019).</p><p>Altogether, these data establish the metabolic functions identified in low-abundance gut Actinobacteria are prevalent but variably distributed among human gut microbiotas, testifying to a genetic and metabolic diversity among individuals. These data also strengthen the case for our assignment of <italic>dodh</italic> as a candidate DOPAC dehydroxylase by demonstrating a link between this gene and DOPAC dehydroxylation by complex human gut microbial communities.</p><p>We have updated the main text (subsection “Catechol dehydroxylases are variably distributed in metagenomes and correlate with metabolism by complex gut microbiota samples ex vivo”; Figure 5) to include these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Your human gut data (Figure 2E) suggest that individuals can have log order differences in Dadh copy number and that some ex vivo communities are responsive to dopamine, while others are not. Why might this be? Are there other enzymes, such as those in the SSN, that might perform this function? In Figure 2—figure supplement 7, E. lenta counts do not increase in response to dopamine in all ex vivo samples – what might be behind this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these questions and agree that this is an interesting question. We want to clarify that the overarching goal of this experiment was not to investigate the variable abundance of <italic>dadh</italic> and <italic>E. lenta</italic> across human samples, but rather to investigate the response of these human gut communities to dopamine in an electron acceptor-limited growth medium. Together with our experiments with defined communities, our qPCR and <italic>dadh</italic> SNP data are consistent with the proposal that dopamine increases the fitness of dopamine-dehydroxylating <italic>E. lenta</italic> strains in microbial communities by serving as an alternative electron acceptor.</p><p>Regarding the comment regarding the variability in <italic>dadh</italic> copy number abundance, we believe that baseline variability in copy number abundance across human individuals likely reflects differing abundance of <italic>E. lenta</italic>, which is supported by our metagenomic results. Further analysis and experimentation beyond the scope of this study would be required to identify the factors shaping this distribution.</p><p>Multiple factors could account for the small number of samples that do not display an increase in <italic>E. lenta</italic> or <italic>dadh</italic> abundance in response to dopamine. These include: 1) the complex gut microbial community supported <italic>E. lenta</italic> growth sufficiently such that dopamine does not add any additional advantage, as is seen in BHI medium where <italic>E. lenta</italic> obtains no growth benefit from dopamine (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) 2) enzymes or organisms not targeted by our qPCR primers were responsible for metabolism in these communities 3) Dopamine could be metabolized through other pathways, which our experimental setup did not account for as we used the colorimetric assay for catechol detection to screen for metabolism.</p><p>We have updated the main text to discuss this observation (subsection “Dopamine promotes gut bacterial growth by serving as an alternative electron acceptor”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observed functional and metabolic diversity across human individuals is obviously fascinating and more could be done to discuss it in the context of the rest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The functional and metabolic diversity in catechol dehydroxylation is a notable observation from our study, and we thank the reviewers for pointing out its significance. In addition to conducting the metagenomic analysis and ex vivo experiments described above, we have now added a paragraph to our Discussion section that describes the potential implications of the genetic and metabolic diversity seen across individual gut bacterial strains, human gut communities, and mammalian microbiota samples (subsection “Catechol dehydroxylase reactivity is present across the gut microbiotas of mammals representing distinct diets and phylogenetic origins”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notwithstanding these comments, there was general agreement that this is a fine example of the integrated use of different approaches to elucidate a previously mysterious metabolic activity of the gut microbiome (catechol dehydroxylation), both by discovering the family of enzymes responsible for it and demonstrating its apparent benefit for the encoding bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing the significance of our work and agree that our study is strong example for the integration of diverse approaches to elucidate the molecular basis of an elusive but prominent metabolic function of the gut microbiota.</p></body></sub-article></article>
