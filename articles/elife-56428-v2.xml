believed to form a protective structure at telomeres, preventing their extension by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. Contrary to this belief, we have previously demonstrated that parallel-stranded conformations of telomeric G4 can be extended by human and ciliate telomerase. However, a mechanistic understanding of the interaction of telomerase with structured DNA remained elusive. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) microscopy and bulk-phase enzymology to propose a mechanism for the resolution and extension of parallel G4 by telomerase. Binding is initiated by the RNA template of telomerase interacting with the G-quadruplex; nucleotide addition then proceeds to the end of the RNA template. It is only through the large conformational change of translocation following synthesis that the G-quadruplex structure is completely unfolded to a linear product. Surprisingly, parallel G4 stabilization with either small molecule ligands or by chemical modification does not always inhibit G4 unfolding and extension by telomerase. These data reveal that telomerase is a parallel G-quadruplex resolvase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>G-quadruplex</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001102</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 11-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moye</surname><given-names>Aaron Lavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL140100027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Oijen</surname><given-names>Antoine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ernest and Piroska Major Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Scott B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damha</surname><given-names>Masad J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre of Excellence for Innovation in Chemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PERCH-CIC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samosorn</surname><given-names>Siritron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Unit of Natural Products and Organic Synthesis for Drug Discovery</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NPOS 405/2560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samosorn</surname><given-names>Siritron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001102</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 16-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human telomerase unfolds and extends parallel G-quadruplexes using a unique mechanism involving its RNA template.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human chromosomes contain many guanine (G)-rich elements capable of forming four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bochman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maizels and Gray, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>). A planar G-quartet is formed when four Gs form hydrogen bonds in a cyclical manner via their Hoogsteen faces; such G-quartets stack on top of each other and form G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sen and Gilbert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sundquist and Klug, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williamson et al., 1989</xref>). G-rich sequences are primarily located in promoter regions, intron and exon boundaries, origins of replication and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bochman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maizels and Gray, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>). Vertebrate telomeres consist of many tandem repeats of the sequence TTAGGG, comprising a double-stranded region and a 3' G-rich overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn, 1991</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy studies have shown the existence of G4 structures at the telomeric regions of fixed human cells using G4-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biffi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In vitro, telomeric DNA can adopt many different conformations of G4, including inter- or intramolecular forms, arranged in parallel or anti-parallel orientation depending upon the directionality of the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burge et al., 2006</xref>). Conditions that may mimic those in the nucleus, including high DNA concentration and water depletion, favour parallel conformations of human telomeric G4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heddi and Phan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Renciuk et al., 2009</xref>). However, the in vivo conformation(s) and biological significance of telomeric G4 in human cells remain elusive and undetermined.</p><p>Telomere shortening occurs with every cell division in normal human somatic cells, since conventional DNA polymerases cannot completely synthesize the telomeric end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Olovnikov, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson, 1972</xref>). Telomerase, a telomere-specific ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex, extends telomeric DNA in cancer cells, stem cells and cells of the germline, using a unique mechanism of processive rounds of reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greider and Blackburn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hiyama and Hiyama, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</xref>). Human telomerase minimally consists of the highly conserved telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (hTERT) and an RNA component containing an 11 nucleotide (nt) template sequence (hTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wyatt et al., 2010</xref>). Telomerase extends its telomeric substrate by first binding to telomeric DNA, followed by hybridization of the RNA template with the DNA. Second, telomerase extends the substrate DNA by using its RNA as a template for nucleotide addition to the DNA 3' end. Once the template 5' boundary has been reached, telomerase translocates downstream, resulting in re-alignment of the RNA template with the new 3' end of the product DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greider and Blackburn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>One function of telomeric G4 may be to act as a ‘cap’, protecting the telomere from DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). It has been widely believed that G4 formation within the 3' telomeric overhang blocks telomere extension by telomerase, since early in vitro studies had shown that G4 structures inhibit telomerase extension of a telomeric DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zahler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaug et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, stabilization of G4 with small-molecule ligands has been shown to more effectively inhibit telomerase activity, suggesting that chemical stabilization of G4 structures may be a viable anti-cancer therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Cian et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 1997</xref>). However, the above-mentioned studies did not distinguish between G4 conformations, and used oligonucleotides that likely folded into anti-parallel or ‘hybrid’ G4 forms as a telomerase substrate. A variety of helicases, such as RECQ5, WRN, BLM, FANC-J and RHAU, recognize and resolve G4 in a conformation-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budhathoki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">London et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tippana et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we have demonstrated that telomerase can bind and extend specific conformations of telomeric G4 - those that are parallel-stranded and intermolecular - and that this property of telomerase is well conserved from ciliates to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oganesian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oganesian et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that if telomeric G-quadruplexes were to adopt a parallel conformation in vivo, they may indeed be extended by telomerase, contrary to what had been previously hypothesized.</p><p>Telomerase extension reactions in the presence of individual nucleotides demonstrated that the 3' end of a G4 substrate aligns correctly with the RNA template of telomerase, suggesting that at least partial resolution of G4 structure is required for telomerase extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). However, the evidence for partial disruption of the G4 was indirect, and a mechanistic understanding of telomerase resolution of G4 DNA, in the absence of a known helicase function of hTERT, remained elusive. Furthermore, since all previously-tested substrates were both parallel-stranded and intermolecular, it was unknown which of these properties form the basis of telomerase recognition. To directly study the mechanistic details of parallel G4 unfolding and extension by human telomerase, here we combined ensemble telomerase enzymatic assays and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) measurements in vitro, using both intramolecular and intermolecular parallel G4 as FRET sensors. We provide direct evidence that wild-type human telomerase can unfold both intra- and intermolecular parallel G4 completely in the presence of dNTPs, using a 3-step mechanism. First, telomerase binds the G4, partially changing its conformation in a process that involves binding of the hTR template sequence. Second, telomerase adds individual nucleotides to the 3' end of the partially unfolded parallel G4. Lastly, the translocation of telomerase results in complete disruption of the G4 structure. Unexpectedly, stabilization of parallel intermolecular G4 using different G4 ligands did not inhibit telomerase unfolding and extension of this substrate. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation of conformation-specific telomerase extension of telomeric G4 at single-molecule resolution and demonstrate that small molecule-mediated inhibition of telomerase extension of telomeric G4 is topology-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human telomerase binds, unfolds and extends intramolecular parallel G-quadruplexes</title><p>Parallel, intermolecular G4 are substrates for telomerase, whereas intramolecular antiparallel or hybrid conformations are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oganesian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zahler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaug et al., 2005</xref>). Determining whether it is the parallel or intermolecular nature of G4 structures that allows their recognition by telomerase has been difficult, since a 4-repeat human telomeric oligonucleotide does not readily fold into stable parallel intramolecular G4 at the concentrations used in in vitro assays, and instead exists as a mixture of topologies under most conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Long and Stone, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palacký et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petraccone et al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, we made use of the modified nucleotide 2'-fluoro-arabinoguanosine (2'F-araG), which induces parallel propeller-type G4 conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peng and Damha, 2007</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that substitution of six guanosines in the telomeric sequence AGGG(TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub> with 2'F-araG leads to a 15°C increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the resulting intramolecular G4, and a shift from the usual antiparallel or hybrid topology of this sequence in potassium solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Renciuk et al., 2009</xref>) to a parallel conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou Assi et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that G4 formed from the unmodified sequence (22G0) in KCl is a poor telomerase substrate, leading to the previously-observed stuttering pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaug et al., 2005</xref>) in a direct telomerase extension assay involving incorporation of radiolabeled α<sup>32</sup>P-dGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 3).

We carried out smFRET experiments using the modified F-22G3 construct in KCl by tethering it on pegylated coverslips via a biotin-streptavidin-biotin linkage. Surface-immobilized G4s were excited using a 532 nm laser and signals emitted from both the donor and acceptor fluorophores were collected and their intensities measured over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top panel); both dyes provided a constant fluorescence signal over several minutes. The apparent FRET values between these two fluorophores were calculated by dividing the acceptor intensity by the sum of the donor and acceptor intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom panel). Individual F-22G3 molecules all displayed a constant FRET ratio of ~0.5 over time, indicating that they did not undergo any detectable conformational changes in the experimental time window. Given a Förster radius between AF555 and AF647 of 51 Å, the calculated FRET efficiency for this distance is 0.44, which is close to our experimental FRET value of 0.5. To confirm that this FRET value represents a G4 structure, we substituted the KCl-containing buffer for a LiCl solution, since Li<sup>+</sup> does not support G4 formation; in a majority of molecules, the FRET signal decreased from ~0.5 to~0.14 and remained at the low FRET state during the entire observation window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To this end, we imaged F-22G3 in the presence of catalytically active telomerase, but in the absence of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). Approximately 65% of F-22G3 molecules showed an abrupt drop in FRET value, from 0.53 ± 0.05 to 0.3 ± 0.1, during the 160 s after telomerase was injected into the microscopic channel containing immobilized F-22G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The remaining 35% of molecules did not show any change in FRET signal over the observed time; it is possible that the binding reaction had not proceeded to completion within this time period, or that a subpopulation of enzyme or DNA molecules are incompetent for binding. We collected 125 molecules showing a step-wise change in FRET value and plotted the data in a FRET heat map and a histogram plot as a function of time; both plots showed a drop in mean FRET value from ~0.53 to~0.3 FRET over this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We interpret this to represent telomerase binding to F-22G3 and partially opening the structure, which then remained stable in its new conformation.</p><p>We confirmed this conclusion by quantitatively analyzing the FRET changes during the transitions. For all molecules that showed a change in FRET signal over time, the frequency with which molecules transitioned between states was determined using state finding algorithm vbFRET (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbfret/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/vbfret/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronson et al., 2013</xref>). Then, the transition frequencies were plotted as a function of initial and final FRET states to obtain transition density plots (TDP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In the presence of telomerase, the TDP showed a single cluster of transitions at initial FRET ~ 0.5 and final FRET ~ 0.3, consistent with the shift in mean FRET in the heat map.</p><p>To examine changes in F-22G3 structure during its extension by telomerase, we performed smFRET experiments in the presence of both telomerase and dNTPs. Under these conditions,~65% of molecules showed a two-step drop in FRET values, from 0.53 ± 0.05 to 0.3 ± 0.1, and then to 0.15 ± 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G–I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The FRET decrease from high to low FRET states in these events was irreversible, supported by the presence of two off-diagonal clusters in the TDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting a continuous irreversible unfolding of G4 structure. As a control, we performed smFRET experiments in the presence of dNTPs alone and observed no change in FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggest that telomerase disrupts F-22G3 structure completely in the presence of dNTPs.</p><p>The rate of F-22G3 unfolding upon telomerase binding in the presence of dNTPs was measured by measuring the dwell time distribution at the 0.3 FRET state (τ<sub>unfolding</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and fitting the distribution to a gamma distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). F-22G3 molecules exhibited telomerase-mediated unfolding with a rate constant of <italic>k</italic><sub>unfolding</sub> = 0.120 ± 0.013 s<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± SEM). This unfolding rate is comparable with the rate of unfolding of parallel G4 by Pif1 helicase (0.11 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrd and Raney, 2015</xref>). Gamma distributions also provide information about the number of rate-limiting steps within a complex kinetic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floyd et al., 2010</xref>); in this case, the number of steps (<italic>N</italic>) is 2.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that unfolding is a complex process involving at least 2–3 kinetic steps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that a tetrameric, parallel G4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavathiotis and Searle, 2003</xref>) formed from four copies of the 7-mer telomeric sequence TTAGGGT in K<sup>+</sup> is highly stable but can be extended by human telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). This sequence provides the advantage that the conformation of its G4 topology is unambiguous; the sequence is too short to form intramolecular G4 structures, and can only exist as a parallel tetramer. To examine whether this tetramer is extended by telomerase using the same mechanism as an intramolecular G4, we prepared a version of this quadruplex labeled with a pair of FRET dyes and a biotin with which to immobilize the DNA. Four different strands, each consisting of the sequence TTAGGGT (here called 7GGT) and a hexa-ethylene glycol spacer, were annealed in an equimolar mixture in KCl solution. Three of these strands were 5' modified with either AlexaFluor 555 (donor dye), AlexaFluor 647 (acceptor dye) or biotin, and the remaining strand was unmodified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We assembled an equimolar mixture of each of these modified oligonucleotides to produce G4s with different combinations of modifications. The resulting mixture of G4s were all parallel-stranded, as confirmed using CD spectroscopy, and had an average melting temperature similar to that of the unmodified G4 ([7GGT]<sub>4</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Direct telomerase activity assays demonstrated that human telomerase can extend the FRET-modified G4 construct (which we refer to as F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub>) as efficiently as the unmodified [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In single-molecule microscopy analyses, we analyzed only G4 structures containing a single copy of each of the four strands, through selection during post-image processing and data analysis (see Methods for details). Note that there are two possible orientations of the positions of the two dyes (on adjacent strands or on diagonally opposite strands, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but it is unlikely that the distance between the dyes in these two conformations is sufficiently different to resolve by FRET. We note that reliable distance estimates obtained from FRET are extremely challenging, with the FRET efficiency depending upon several factors beyond distance: 1) The length of linkers that are used to attach each fluorescent dye (in our case a C6 carbon linker) will affect dye mobility and increase the distance between dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sindbert et al., 2011</xref>), 2) the quenching of emission due to the presence of Gs in the dye’s vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sindbert et al., 2011</xref>), and 3) solvent polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishikawa-Ankerhold et al., 2012</xref>). smFRET experiments showed that most F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> molecules exhibit a steady FRET signal at a ratio of ~0.6, and the FRET signal did not change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating formation of a stable parallel intermolecular G4. Substitution of the K<sup>+</sup>-containing buffer for one containing Li<sup>+</sup> resulted in a drop to a stable FRET value of ~0.2, followed by complete loss of the signal from both dyes, likely representing G4 unwinding followed by loss of the non-biotinylated dye-bearing strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Telomerase alone was sufficient for partial unwinding of parallel F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub>, as demonstrated by a drop in FRET state from ~0.6 to~0.4 with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). About 60% of molecules showed this one-step drop in FRET signal upon injection of telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Note that the distribution of initial FRET values of those molecules that show a change in FRET value is not as broad as the FRET distribution of the whole population of molecules (compare the spread at 0 time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), supporting the interpretation that those G-quadruplexes that do not bind to telomerase have folded improperly or are folding intermediates, and thus show a high level of dynamic behaviour that is too fast to resolve and results in a broadening of the FRET peak. In the case of the 60% of molecules that do show a drop in FRET signal, we interpret this to demonstrate that telomerase results in a partial separation of the FRET dyes upon binding to one strand of the tetrameric G4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Telomerase extends a tetrameric parallel G-quadruplex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> used in smFRET studies.

The two FRET transition clusters observed by TDP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) suggest that telomerase unfolds parallel intermolecular G4 irreversibly. The low FRET state of ~0.2 is consistent with the low FRET state observed during Li<sup>+</sup>-mediated G4 unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>); surprisingly, however, we did not observe complete loss of FRET signal (i.e. disappearance of both dyes simultaneously), as we had seen in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup>. Instead, the majority of molecules exhibited a stable FRET signal of ~0.2, followed by acceptor dye photobleaching then later photobleaching of the donor dye. This suggests that while telomerase extension results in G4 disruption, the presence of the enzyme keeps the four strands in proximity of each other, rather than allowing them to completely diffuse apart.</p><p>The rate of unfolding of F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> by telomerase in the presence of dNTPs was measured by plotting the dwell times of the intermediate transition states (FRET value of 0.4) and fitting them to a gamma distribution that yielded <italic>k</italic><sub>unfolding</sub> = 0.073 ± 0.013 s<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), with <italic>N</italic> = 2.3 ± 0.1. Thus, the rate of unfolding of [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> by telomerase in the presence of dNTPs is comparable to that of F-22G3. The gamma distribution also suggested that 2–3 rate-limiting steps contribute to this rate. Since the transitions between FRET states were very abrupt for both G4s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), it was possible that further rate-limiting steps occur during these transitions, which are too fast to resolve. To explore this, we carried out smFRET analyses of [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> in the presence of a 100-fold lower concentration of dGTP; this resulted in ~40% of traces that showed a plateau at FRET ~ 0.4 followed by a gradual transition to ~0.2 (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Approximation of the times taken for the gradual transition to FRET 0.2 (that we refer to as τ<sub>unfolding-2</sub>) yielded a rate of 0.44 ± 0.14 s<sup>−1</sup>, with 3–4 rate-limiting steps revealed by the gamma distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

We have previously demonstrated that [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> is extended by the nucleotides that would be predicted from canonical base-pairing with the RNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the RNA template binds to the G4, facilitating the opening of the structure. To test this, we performed smFRET experiments in the presence of a 10-nt RNA oligonucleotide mimicking the human telomerase template sequence, RNA.10C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At a high concentration of RNA.10C (500 μM), a majority of F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> molecules executed a single-step drop in FRET from 0.57 to 0.36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G and J</xref>); thus, a short oligonucleotide resembling the telomerase template induces G4 unfolding in a similar manner to the whole telomerase enzyme. The fraction of the G4 population that showed a drop in FRET signal was dependent on the concentration of RNA.10C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), and at both concentrations ~ 20% of the molecules showed dynamic behaviour during the observation window, transiently returning to the high FRET state (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>), which was not observed in experiments with the whole telomerase enzyme. This indicates that the affinity of the RNA oligonucleotide for the G4 is lower than that of telomerase, which is not unexpected given the multiple protein-DNA contacts that can occur in the presence of hTERT. Nevertheless, the effect of an oligonucleotide on G4 structure was very specific to RNA; the presence of 500 µM of a 10-nt DNA oligonucleotide of identical sequence (DNA.10C) did not stimulate any change in the FRET signal of F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>).

To probe the mechanism for this, we incubated telomerase with F-22G3 in the presence of subsets of dNTPs. The first three nucleotides that are incorporated by telomerase at the 3' end of F-22G3 are dTTP, dATP and dGTP, as dictated by the telomerase RNA template sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,E and I</xref>). We first carried out extension reactions in the presence of only ddTTP, a chain terminator that inhibits further elongation of the 3' end after its incorporation, and no other nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Under these conditions, F-22G3 exhibited a FRET drop from ~0.5 to~0.3 and remained in the ~0.3 FRET state over the remainder of the observation time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

CD spectroscopy confirmed that none of the ligands substantially changed the overall parallel G4 conformation of F-22G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), and melting assays showed dramatic thermal stabilization of this G4 upon binding by all three ligands (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of &gt;25°C (NMM), +11°C (SST16) and &gt;25°C (PhenDC3), under the conditions detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). SST16 caused a decrease in signal of the peak at 260 nm that may be attributable to the association between the ligand and the G-quartets, resulting in slight changes in stacking interactions without a change in overall topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2008</xref>). The ligands did not change the steady smFRET signal of F-22G3 in the absence of telomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the presence of telomerase, dNTPs and each of the three ligands, the number of molecules experiencing a two-step FRET decrease was reduced by about 2-fold, and the number of molecules with no FRET changes doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–J</xref>). This suggests that the ligands reduce binding of telomerase to this G4, preventing induction of the first step of FRET decrease. Nevertheless, 25–30% of molecules showed the same FRET decrease from ~0.5 to~0.3 and then to ~0.15 as in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–J</xref>).

At least in the case of NMM, the reduced rate of G4 unfolding provides evidence that most or all of these molecules were bound by ligands, but that ligand presence slowed the rate of their unfolding by telomerase. The very dramatic thermal stabilization of the G4 in the presence of PhenDC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F</xref>) also suggests that a majority of molecules were bound by this compound.

When F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> was incubated with both telomerase and dNTPs in the presence of each ligand, most molecules showed a unidirectional two-step decrease in FRET value, from 0.57 to 0.36, and then to 0.19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–J</xref>). We assessed the F-[7GGT]<sub>4</sub> unfolding rate in the presence of the ligands by measuring the dwell time of each molecule in the transient intermediate state (0.36 FRET) and fitting time distributions with a gamma distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To address this, we performed molecular modeling of binding of the tetrameric G4 [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> to human telomerase.</p><p>We had previously generated a homology model of the hTERT reverse transcriptase domain using the published crystal structure of <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomlinson et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, the structure of the <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> enzyme has been solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>), and there is also a medium-resolution cryo-EM structure of human telomerase available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore used these to generate a model of the whole hTERT protein (see Methods). We then took the NMR structure of [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavathiotis and Searle, 2003</xref>), and introduced torsion between the T and A positions, to model one strand flipping out in order to hybridize with a 10 nt RNA molecule with the sequence of the human telomerase template. The position of a DNA-RNA hybrid in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cryo-EM structure was used to position this G4-RNA into the telomerase active site, with the 3' end of the flipped strand at the trio of catalytic aspartates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). As expected, the G4-RNA clashed with part of the hTERT protein, the C-terminal extension (CTE). However, others have reported that the CTE may pivot around a region called the ‘beta linker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang and Lee, 2015</xref>); thus, it seemed reasonable that this linker may lengthen to accommodate the quadruplex. This is also consistent with our finding that the affinity of telomerase for nucleotides is decreased in the presence of a G4 substrate relative to a linear substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oganesian et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that the conformation of the active site is perturbed when bound to the bulkier G4. The torsions of the beta linker amino acids (Arg938 and Thr939) were therefore altered to enable an extended conformation, which was compatible with binding of the G4-RNA in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for binding and extension of parallel G-quadruplexes by telomerase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of an extended conformation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT; grey) with a 10 nt RNA template (magenta) and the [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> G-quadruplex (orange and dark red) docked into the active site. The extended CTE is highlighted in dark grey; the catalytic aspartate residues (Asp 712, 868, 869) are shown as yellow spheres. A single strand of the G4 (dark red) is flipped out of the structure in order for it to interact with the RNA at the catalytic center of the reverse transcriptase.

While this represents an in silico simulation rather than direct structural observation, it suggests that binding of this G4 to telomerase may result in an increase in distance between the dyes, consistent with the observed partial reduction in FRET.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previously, we have shown that highly purified human telomerase can disrupt parallel intermolecular G4 structures and then extend them in a processive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we provide the first mechanistic details of telomerase resolution of parallel G4 structures. Our data demonstrate that G4 unfolding occurs in three major steps: i) the telomerase template RNA invades the G-quartets in order to hybridize with the G-rich DNA, causing partial opening of the G4 structure; ii) telomerase extends the 3' end of this partially unwound structure, adding single nucleotides according to the RNA template, and iii) translocation of telomerase once nucleotide addition has reached the template boundary is likely to trigger complete unfolding of the G4 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). It has previously been difficult to distinguish whether it is the parallel or intermolecular nature of G4 structures that allows their recognition by telomerase. Here, we overcome this difficulty by exploiting the stabilization of intramolecular parallel G4 conferred by the modified nucleotide 2'F-araG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou Assi et al., 2017</xref>), enabling the demonstration that inter- and intramolecular parallel G4 are extended by telomerase using the same 3-step mechanism. These data reveal human telomerase to be a parallel G4 resolvase.</p><p>Several other proteins have been shown to assist telomerase extension of telomeric DNA by resolving antiparallel G4 in the substrate, including telomeric protein POT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zaug et al., 2005</xref>), a splice variant of hnRNP A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and the ciliate protein StyRecQL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paeschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Postberg et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we have verified that highly purified telomerase, free of contaminating helicases or other proteins, is able to extend [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that telomerase itself has the ability to unwind parallel G4, without the assistance of interacting helicases.</p><p>Telomerase partially unfolds parallel G4, independently of telomerase catalytic activity, as indicated by the drop in FRET signal upon telomerase association with G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). The resulting stable intermediate FRET value is consistent with a partial separation of the FRET dyes in the absence of complete strand dissociation. We interpret these data to indicate that binding of telomerase RNA to the nucleotides at the 3' end of one DNA strand allows RNA-DNA hybridization to occur while resulting in a conformational perturbation of the 5' end of the G4, but the dyes are still sufficiently close together to give a non-zero FRET signal; molecular modeling supported this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>). To investigate whether the template RNA of telomerase plays a critical role in this initial G4 unfolding, we carried out experiments in the presence of a short RNA oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the telomere repeat, mimicking the template region of hTR. This RNA molecule was able to partially unfold the structure in a similar manner to the whole enzyme, albeit with lower affinity. This observation suggests that it is the RNA component of telomerase, rather than the hTERT protein, that promotes the initial unwinding of parallel G4, followed by hybridization to the 3' end. A DNA oligonucleotide of identical sequence did not promote any G4 unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>); if oligonucleotide binding was due to passive trapping of a spontaneously-unfolding G4, this would also have been observed in the presence of a DNA C-strand. Previous studies with relatively unstable antiparallel telomeric G4s in Na<sup>+</sup> have observed passive trapping of the unfolded G4 by a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide; the unfolding was zero order with respect to the PNA molecule, suggesting that the initial step is a rate-determining internal rearrangement of the quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, both parallel G4s used in our experiments were highly stable; neither demonstrated any spontaneous unwinding during the observation time of the smFRET experiments, and in our previous work we have shown that the parallel tetrameric G4 did not show any unwinding over the time scale of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>).Telomeric protein POT1 unwinds a G4 through a conformational selection mechanism in which G4 unwinding occurs prior to POT1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaires et al., 2020</xref>); each of the OB folds of two POT1 molecules then binds to one telomeric repeat of the 4-repeat G4 in a stepwise manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>). For telomerase, we favour a model in which the enzyme binds the G4 while it is still structured, followed by invasion by the RNA template; confirmation of this model will require further kinetic analyses. A similar template-mimicking RNA was unable to form a DNA-RNA hybrid with an antiparallel G4 of similar stability to the parallel G4 used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birrento et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating that this is a specific interaction between this RNA and parallel G4 structures. Single-molecule FRET studies have illuminated the mechanisms used by other G4-unwinding proteins; for example, the helicase RHAU/DHX36 was shown to stack on the top of the G4 plane and bind to the exposed 3' single stranded DNA tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the replication protein RPA has been proposed to bind to G4 structures via their exposed loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ray et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, our data demonstrate that telomerase possesses a unique mechanism of G4 resolution, mediated by its integral RNA subunit.</p><p>Telomerase extends the 3' end of parallel G4 while the G4 remains partially structured, as demonstrated by the intermediate FRET state remaining unchanged until the hTR template boundary was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although these experiments involved incorporation of a chain terminating ddGTP, it has been demonstrated by smFRET that ddGTP incorporation is compatible with subsequent DNA realignment and rehybridization with the upstream region of the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parks and Stone, 2014</xref>); it is therefore likely that conformational changes involved in the translocation process result in complete G4 unfolding, represented by a second step-wise drop in FRET signal. One possible explanation for this observation is that the G4 structure needs to pass through the telomerase DNA-binding cleft during the conformation changes required for telomerase translocation, and the resulting steric hindrance results in complete dissociation of the parallel telomeric G4. Our molecular modeling supports an alternative scenario, in which an hTERT protein conformational change during translocation results in opening of the active site, allowing the strands of the G4 to move away from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). This would be consistent with a ‘pivoting’ of the CTE away from the catalytic center that has been proposed to allow room for DNA-RNA dissociation and movement during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang and Lee, 2015</xref>). In the case of a G4 substrate, it is possible that slight pivoting of the CTE is needed to allow the structure to bind in the enzyme active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, middle panels). After nucleotide addition, when the end of the template is reached, this may act as a trigger for full pivoting of the CTE to allow translocation to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, right panel; the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> also shows the fully-extended structure). This may allow full dissociation of the strands of the G4, resulting in a drop in FRET to its lowest level.</p><p>Quantitation of the rates of the transition from the first FRET drop to the second support the notion that telomerase-mediated G4 unfolding is a complex multistep process, consisting of at least five kinetic steps. This is consistent with the requirement for extension of the DNA to the template boundary and translocation, processes which involve many kinetic substeps: nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomlinson et al., 2015</xref>), polymerization at each template position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomlinson et al., 2015</xref>), DNA primer realignment with the upstream region of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parks and Stone, 2014</xref>), and conformational rearrangements to reposition the DNA-RNA hybrid into the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parks and Stone, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We used the G4-stabilizing ligands NMM, SST16 and PhenDC3, all of which bind to parallel G4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacroix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoludis et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Samosorn et al., 2009</xref>), to understand whether telomerase extension of these structures can be modulated. Despite substantial thermal stabilization of the G4, these ligands did not inhibit telomerase extension of intermolecular parallel telomeric G4, with one of them instead slightly accelerating G4 unfolding. The ligands did reduce the number of intramolecular parallel G4 molecules unwound by telomerase; nevertheless, some molecules were unwound by telomerase despite ligand binding, using the same two-step mechanism as in the absence of ligands. The fact that telomerase was able to extend parallel G4 even after substantial thermal stabilization of the structure using either small molecule ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) or chemical modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) provides evidence that thermal stabilization does not provide a barrier to telomerase-mediated unwinding.</p><p>NMM has been demonstrated to bind to parallel telomeric G4 by stacking on the outermost G-quartets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicoludis et al., 2012b</xref>), which would be predicted to interfere with telomerase extension. This observation suggests that, like other proteins such as RHAU helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gueddouda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tippana et al., 2016</xref>), telomerase is able to dislodge ligands from the tetramolecular G4 structure while unfolding it. This displacement activity is structure dependent, since telomerase is less able to dislodge ligands from a parallel intramolecular G4, possibly due to the presence of DNA loops. Such a displacement mechanism would have implications for interpreting the biological effects of G4-stabilizing ligands in cell-based studies, since any effects on telomerase action and telomere length will depend on the conformational specificity of the ligand.</p><p>There is growing evidence for G4 formation at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biffi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murat and Balasubramanian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paeschke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schaffitzel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In human cells, it is not known if they form at the 3' end of the telomeric overhang, internally, or a combination of both, or which conformation of G4 occurs at these locations in vivo. While in-cell NMR studies of transfected telomeric oligonucleotides detected hybrid and antiparallel structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2019</xref>), a study using parallel-specific antibodies reported detection of parallel telomeric G-quadruplexes in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and a parallel-specific ligand induces G4 formation at human telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moye et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that different conformations exist at different telomeric overhangs within the same cell. Intermolecular parallel G4 may also form between telomeric overhangs; it has been suggested that tetrameric parallel G-quadruplexes could be responsible for the correct alignment of four chromatids during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sen and Gilbert, 1988</xref>). Regardless of this uncertainty, our data unequivocally demonstrate that human telomerase interacts directly with parallel G4 structures and resolves them. The conserved ability of human and ciliate telomerase enzymes to unwind these structures suggests that parallel G-quadruplexes form at telomeric overhangs in vivo, and do not form a barrier to telomerase extension.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T (embryonic kidney, immortalized with adenovirus)</td><td valign="top">American Type Tissue Collection</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ATCC CRL-3216</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-hTERT (sheep polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abbexa Ltd.</td><td valign="top">Cat#: abx120550</td><td valign="top">IP (40 µg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pApex-CMV-hTERT (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158869">26158869</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr Tracy Bryan, Dr Scott Cohen</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pApex-CMV-dyskerin-U3-hTR (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158869">26158869</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr Tracy Bryan, Dr Scott Cohen</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">hTERT amino acids 276–294 (peptide)</td><td valign="top">Abbexa Ltd.</td><td valign="top">Cat#: abx069990</td><td valign="top">Sequence: ARPAEEATSLEGALSGTRH</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin</td><td valign="top">Thermo-Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 11206D</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">NeutrAvidin Protein</td><td valign="top">Thermo-Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 31050</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Unylinker CPG solid support</td><td valign="top">ChemGenes</td><td valign="top">Cat#: N-4000–05</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Gel-Pak 2.5 Desalting Column</td><td valign="top">Glen Research</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 61-5025-25</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">AlexaFluor 555 NHS Ester</td><td valign="top">Thermo-Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A20009</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">(3-Aminopropyl)triethoxy silane</td><td valign="top">Alfa Aesar</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A10668</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Biotin-PEG-SVA and mPEG-SVA</td><td valign="top">Laysan Bio</td><td valign="top">Cat#: BIO-PEG-SVA-5K-100MG and MPEG-SVA-5K-1g</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">N-Methyl Mesoporphyrin IX (NMM)</td><td valign="top">Frontier Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: NMM580</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PhenDC3</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17260991">17260991</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr Marie-Paule Teulade-Fichou</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SST16</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19419877">19419877</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr Siritron Samosorn</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligonucleotides and G-quadruplex preparation</title><p>Most DNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and RNA oligonucleotides from Dharmacon, with purification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Approximate FRET value is measured as the ratio of acceptor intensity to the sum of the donor and acceptor intensities after correcting cross talk between donor and acceptor channels for both inter- and intramolecular G4s. Briefly, FRET pairs were identified through aligning the red (acceptor) and green (donor) channels by using highly fluorescent beads and subsequent co-localization of the donor/acceptor fluorescence spots using IDL software. Then, raw intensity data were analyzed using MATLAB script. Those molecules were selected that displayed donor and/or acceptor photobleaching, or showed clear dynamics with anti-correlated donor-acceptor fluorescence for further analysis. The number of photobleaching steps was then used to determine how many donor and/or acceptor dyes were present, with only molecules containing one donor and one acceptor used for further analysis. Intramolecular G4 was designed in such a way that it contains one donor and one acceptor, therefore pre-selection of molecules was not required. In contrast, an intermolecular G4 has many possible combinations of donor and acceptor molecules because of its design, so pre-selection of molecules that contain one donor and one acceptor was necessary. Typically, in a field of view we observed ~29% molecules containing one donor and one acceptor fluorophore showing ~0.6 FRET,~6% molecules showing above 0.75 FRET and the rest of the molecules either had one donor (~50%) or two donor molecules and no acceptors (~15%).

Swiss-model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) was used to create a homology model using all possible templates. The highest quality model (based upon a combination of the best Q-Mean (−7.33) and Mol Probability (2.08) scores, and the amino acid properties (&gt;82% Ramachandran favoured)) was chosen. This model utilized the cryo-EM structure of <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> TERT as a template, which has 19.03% sequence identity to human TERT (PDB code: 6D6V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using the NMR structure of parallel G4 formed from 5'-TTAGGGT-3' (PDB code: 1np9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavathiotis and Searle, 2003</xref>), the torsion between the T and A nucleotides was altered in a single strand of the G4 in order to flip the bases out, allowing them to interact with RNA. The position of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>) was then used to position RNA-10C and the flipped G4 in the active site, allowing the DNA 3' end to be located at the catalytic aspartates. In this orientation, the remaining three strands of the G4 overlapped where the CTE is positioned in the cryo-EM structure. The torsions of the beta linker amino acids (Arg938 and Thr939) were altered to enable an extended conformation, removing the DNA-protein clashes. The whole complex was then minimized for 10 ns and 100 ns using Desmond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>). Figures were created using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.2 Schrodinger, LLC).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Omesha Perera for plasmid construction, George Lovrecz and Tram Phan for production of telomerase-expressing cells, Timothy Adams for providing pAPEX vectors and for consultation on overexpression of telomerase, and Corinne Getta for preparation of PhenDC3.

telomerase at single-molecule resolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Telomerase is the enzyme tasked with maintaining telomeres at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomere DNA sequence is repetitive and guanine rich in most organisms, and the tandem arrays of guanine bases can form multiple planar G-quartet motifs that are stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. In turn, several G-quartets can stack upon each other to form G-quadruplex (GQ) DNA folds, characterized by their very polymorphic structural properties and high melting temperatures. This manuscript by the van Oijen and Bryan groups builds on previous work by the Bryan lab where they showed that purified human telomerase disrupts and processively extends parallel intermolecular G4 structures. In this current manuscript, the authors present a new smFRET-based approach to observe the dynamics and intermediates during telomerase-mediated resolution of parallel G4 structures. Combined with bulk biochemistry, these measurements establish a three-step mechanism for the unfolding and resolution of parallel intermolecular G4 structures.</p><p>This manuscript provides significant new mechanistic insight into the function of human telomerase, and the single-molecule data and analyses are overall of excellent quality. A subset of the conclusions seems to be overstated; here the manuscript would benefit from a toned-down interpretation of the data presented (see revisions). Please note that in response to the current COVID-19 situation, only textual changes are required, however already existing data addressing the points raised below should be included, if available.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The FRET values in the study are interpreted quite loosely. For example, there is no control experiment presented that demonstrates the low FRET state observed in their experiments is in fact a completely resolved GQ. While the interpretation for this experiment is certainly reasonable based upon previous smFRET studies of GQ structures, the authors should ideally substantiate this assignment with mutant DNA substrates or perhaps using Li+ in their buffers. If such new data cannot currently be acquired, the authors should better substantiate their claim that the low FRET state is unfolded by more explicitly referring to other published work. The assignment of all FRET states in this paper would additionally benefit from some structural modeling to estimate expected distances.</p><p>2) Related to the first point, it is surprising that both the intra- and intermolecular GQ FRET experiments give essentially the same signal? The interpretation of the two-step drop seems plausible for the intramolecular GQ, but for the intermolecular structure it is unclear why initial docking on one of the four 3' ends would impact the positioning of the FRET dyes located on the 5' ends of the DNA substrate (as drawn in Figure 2A)? Also, is ~0.55 FRET a reasonable value for the schematic drawings shown in Figure 2A, in other words what is the known distance between dyes on neighboring strands of an intermolecular GQ? One would expect this to be quite close (~2-3 nm) and therefore give rise to a much higher initial FRET state. It is also unclear why telomerase binding and remodeling of this tetrameric structure would not cause the structure to fall apart, and therefore give rise to a zero FRET state or loss of signal altogether. Is it possible this is happening and just not being detected in these experiments? The authors should address this in the text.</p><p>3) Given the results from Hwang, Myong et al., 2012 (not cited) on the binding and resolution of GQ structure by POT1-TPP1 protein, which occurs in three steps, is it unexpected that two steps is what is observed in the present work? The authors should discuss their results in light of this earlier work.</p><p>4) The authors' use of active versus passive unwinding mechanisms for telomerase-mediated GQ unfolding is somewhat unclear. The argument for 'active' unwinding is based upon experiments performed with a short RNA oligo presented in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3, in which this short RNA is meant to mimic the RNA template within the assembled telomerase RNP. The authors state that given the concentration dependence of the RNA-induced FRET drop, the mechanism must therefore be 'active' – but why is this necessarily true? The authors do not show any kinetic data for this experiment, therefore it is difficult to ascertain whether the process displays zero or first-order kinetics with respect to oligo-induced disruption of the GQ structure. Moreover, since there is no energy cofactor (i.e., dNTP) in this experiment, is not the mechanism, by definition, passive? The authors should articulate specifically how they are using the word 'active' in this section of the study? In addition, the authors seem to think the experiments in this figure rule out the possibility of transient intrinsic GQ dynamics being 'captured' by the RNA oligo (or telomerase RNP). However, previous work including that by Green et al., 2003 (not cited) describes a similar experiment with PNA oligos and comes to the opposite conclusion. Also, it seems unlikely that a 10 nt RNA oligo fully captures the properties of the RNA template within the telomerase RNP context – so a more convincing experiment to support the conclusion that it is just the RNA template that is required for the first FRET drop would be to use either a mutant template RNA and/or mutant DNA substrate. At the very least, the authors should discuss the limitations of using a 10 nt RNA oligo to mimic the properties of the telomerase RNA template within the assembled complex.</p><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors present very interesting smFRET data for the system being 'walked' through the telomere DNA synthesis reaction through the use of ddNTP terminators. This experiment, and indeed aspects of the study more generally are similar to work from Parks and Stone, 2014 (not cited), in which DNA primer dynamics are directly observed by smFRET in human telomerase as the primer length approaches the template boundary. Ultimately, the authors claim that the experiment in Figure 4I argues that telomerase translocation is required to fully disrupt the GQ structure, evidenced by the second FRET drop upon incorporation of a ddGTP. The conclusion that translocation leads to GQ unfolding is too strong given the data, since in this experiment there is no evidence of translocation having occurred. Typically, translocation would be thought of as being complete once the necessary rearrangements required to allow re-priming for subsequent rounds of telomere DNA synthesis have occurred – but it is not evident this is happening in the experiments described since there is a chain terminator. Therefore, the authors should revise their use of the term translocation so as to avoid an over-interpretation of their very interesting data.</p><p>6) In Figures 5 and 6 the effects of GQ binding ligands are studied and the conclusion is that these compounds do not completely inhibit telomerase in the smFRET assay. Why are the results of the gel-based assay for the F-22G3 and the smFRET experiments not more similar? It appears in Figure 5L that NMM and PhenDC3 almost completely inhibit the telomerase activity, whereas SST16 does not have as strong of an effect (the authors should quantify the relative activities in this experiment and include them as part of the figure). In contrast, all three compounds yield similar results in the smFRET assay as shown in the bar plots in Figure 5J. The authors should explain this apparent discrepancy, as this might seem to imply that the two-step FRET drop is not correlating with catalytic activity in this experiment. The authors also comment on the impact of PhenDC3 causing a change in the product profile after four repeats 'most likely resulting from G-quadruplex stabilization within the product DNA'. This result is in close accord with the recent study by Jansson et al., 2019 (not cited) wherein the possibility of GQ folding within the product of human telomerase during catalysis is described. In addition, in the Discussion, the authors relate the thermal stabilization of the structure by these compounds as evidence for 'telomerase not simply exploiting inherent instability in the G4 structure…' However, smFRET experiments by Jena, Ha et al. JACS 2009 (not cited) – showed that compounds that increase the thermal stability of the GQ fold do not necessarily restrict the conformational dynamics of the structure.</p><p>7) While the two-step FRET signal observed throughout the study is very interesting, the model put forth in Figure 7 is not very satisfying. Throughout the paper (including in the title) the authors describe how these data lead them to a mechanism for how telomerase acts as a GQ resolvase. However, the authors do not make an effort to discuss their data within a structural context based upon the medium-resolution cryo-EM structure of human telomerase (Nguyen et al., 2018, not cited) or the higher-resolution cryo-EM structure of Tetrahymena telomerase (Jiang et al., 2018, not cited). Why is there no attempt to explain how the proposed GQ unfolding might occur? For example, specifically how steric hindrance by the enzyme would cause unfolding during catalysis, but still allow binding to occur at the start of catalysis? Moreover, in the case of the tetrameric GQ, why would activity cause the structure to disassemble as would be suggested by the cartoon in Figure 7 (see comment above)? The authors should clarify this in the text.</p><p>8) The dwell time distribution shown in Figure 1N does not seem to be described particularly well by a single exponential decay. Nonetheless the authors argue that the distribution indicates only one rate-limiting step. Given that the observed reaction is a multi-step process, a more complex kinetic model might be required. If the authors have data recorded at various different dNTP concentrations, they should be included and discussed.</p><p>Related to this point, the second FRET decrease observed with different G4 structures, appears to occur abruptly/instantaneously. Can intermediates during the transition be visualized (at higher frame rates or limiting dNTP concentrations)? If the transition times can be quantified, what is the underlying distribution?</p><p>9) Have EMSAs or similar experiments been performed to clarify that the RNA is actually binding / invading the G4, whereas nothing happens with DNA? Similarly, it would be informative to see binding data (Kd) for telomerase to the G4 structures used here. Also, is the initial FRET change from 0.5 to 0.3 correlated in time with telomerase binding? In other words, does the time lag from injection to FRET shift match the telomerase on-rate, or does the FRET change require more time (indicating a more complex process)?</p><p>10) Is the FRET change observed by telomerase / RNA binding reversible, e.g. if telomerase dissociates? Similarly, given that very high concentrations of RNA were required to observe the effect seen in Figure 3F, RNA is most likely only loosely bound. It would be interesting to see if the G4 reverts when the RNA dissociates.</p><p>11) The authors find that G4-stabilizing ligands double the number of G4 that are not opened. This is not really discussed. Could it be that the G4s that are actually unwound are not really bound by the ligands? Does this effect depend on the ligand concentration?</p><p>There is also an apparent discrepancy between the amount of G4s that are stabilized, the change in unfolding rate (Figure 5K), and the extension rate (Figure 5L). For example, PhenDC3 results in a minor slowing down of G4 unfolding in Figure 5K but seems to completely inhibit extension (Figure 5L). These discrepancies should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56428.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The FRET values in the study are interpreted quite loosely. For example, there is no control experiment presented that demonstrates the low FRET state observed in their experiments is in fact a completely resolved GQ. While the interpretation for this experiment is certainly reasonable based upon previous smFRET studies of GQ structures, the authors should ideally substantiate this assignment with mutant DNA substrates or perhaps using Li+ in their buffers. If such new data cannot currently be acquired, the authors should better substantiate their claim that the low FRET state is unfolded by more explicitly referring to other published work. The assignment of all FRET states in this paper would additionally benefit from some structural modeling to estimate expected distances.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that controls showing the FRET from a denatured or resolved G4 are important. Since we were able to carry out a small amount of experimental work despite coronavirus restrictions, we performed the suggested experiments. After placing each of the two G4 constructs on the surface in potassium-based buffer, we replaced the potassium buffer with Li<sup>+</sup>- buffer and monitored the FRET signal. The data show that both G4s exhibited a drop in FRET signal to a value similar to that observed in the presence of telomerase and dNTPs (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2), supporting the proposition that this FRET value is indicative of an unfolded G4.</p><p>The intramolecular G4 (F-22G3) FRET decreased from ∼0.5 to ∼0.14 (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1; subsection “Human telomerase binds, unfolds and extends intramolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”) and a majority of molecules remained at that lowest FRET state during the entire observation window. A minor proportion (35 ± 8%) of molecules showed dynamic transitioning between FRET states but favored the lowest FRET state.</p><p>Intermolecular G4 (F-7GGT) also displayed a FRET decrease from ∼0.6 to ∼0.2 after swapping K<sup>+</sup> for Li<sup>+</sup> (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2; subsection “Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”), followed by a loss of FRET altogether, suggesting the G4 structure dissociates from the surface. This behaviour is readily explained by the fact that the biotinylated strand does not bear any fluorophores and that loss of the other strands causes the FRET signal to disappear. The presence of a stable FRET signal at ~0.2 in a majority of molecules prior to disappearance of the FRET signal suggests that the 0.2 FRET state represents an unwound G4, prior to complete diffusion of the non-biotinylated strands. As predicted by one of the reviewers, this behaviour does differ from that in the presence of telomerase + dNTPs (discussed further below), suggesting that the presence of telomerase prevents full dispersion of the unwound strands, and we have addressed this in the aforementioned subsection.</p><p>Overall, these results are consistent with our original interpretation whereby G4 extension by telomerase in the presence of dNTPs causes a decrease in FRET due to disruption of the G4 structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the first point, it is surprising that both the intra- and intermolecular GQ FRET experiments give essentially the same signal?</p></disp-quote><p>The similar FRET values between the constructs is probably nothing more than a coincidence. The intra-molecular G4 exhibits FRET centred around 0.5, while inter-molecular has a FRET value centred around 0.6. To better understand the relationship between the expected FRET and the dye positions within the G4, we have now used previously published crystal (intramolecular G4) and NMR structures (intermolecular G4) to estimate the distance between dyes, respectively.</p><p>Importantly, we should note that reliable distance estimates obtained from FRET are extremely challenging, with the FRET efficiency depending upon several factors: 1) The length of linkers that are used to attach each fluorescent dye (in our case a C6 linker) will affect dye mobility and increase the distance between dyes, both processes affecting FRET. 2) The quenching of emission due to the presence of Gs in the dye’s vicinity. 3) Solvent polarity affecting FRET transfer (see AO Crockett and CT Wittwer, Anal Biochem [2001] vol 290: 89; S Sindbert et al., 2011; Ishikawa-Ankerhold, Ankerhold and Drummen, 2012).</p><p>The above factors notwithstanding, we calculated the FRET efficiency based on an available crystal structure for a version of F-22G3 without the 2'F-araG substitutions (parallel intramolecular GQ, PDB 1kf1). The estimated distance between the two dyes, which are located on the two strands as shown in Author response image 1, is approximately 53 Å including the length of the linkers. Given a Förster radius between AF555 and AF647 of 51 Å, the calculated FRET efficiency for this distance is 0.44, which is close to our experimental FRET value of 0.5. This similarity suggests there is not a significant change in dye emission in this construct due to quenching, with the acceptor dye being located away from the quenching Gs (see Author response image 1).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Intramolecular (F-22G3) forming sequence (top) and hybridisation sequence (bottom).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56428-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For the intermolecular GQ (F-7GGT), however, a high FRET efficiency is expected as the dyes are attached at the proximal 5’ ends, as pointed out by the reviewers. The estimated distance between dyes is approximately 25 – 35 Å, based on an NMR solution structure of this tetrameric G4 (PDB 1PN9; there is no crystal structure available), together with C-6 carbon linkers for fluorophore attachment. This would yield a theoretical FRET efficiency of ≥ 0.9; however, most of the molecules exhibited FRET efficiency distributed around 0.5 to 0.7 in our experiments. The discrepancy in measured experimental FRET compared to expected FRET suggests that fluorophore quenching occurs in this construct as both members of the FRET pair are close to the G-tetrad plane. Nevertheless, we are confident that the observed ~0.6 FRET state represents a parallel tetrameric G4, since i) there is no other G4 conformation that can form from this short oligonucleotide, and ii) the Li<sup>+</sup> control above demonstrates a reduction in this signal upon G4 unwinding.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no smFRET studies carried out using intermolecular or intramolecular parallel telomeric G4 constructs to directly compare with our FRET design.</p><p>With the caveat that relating FRET values to distances is challenging, we have briefly discussed these points in the revised manuscript (subsections “Human telomerase binds, unfolds and extends intramolecular parallel G-quadruplexes” and “Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interpretation of the two-step drop seems plausible for the intramolecular GQ, but for the intermolecular structure it is unclear why initial docking on one of the four 3' ends would impact the positioning of the FRET dyes located on the 5' ends of the DNA substrate (as drawn in Figure 2A)?</p></disp-quote><p>We postulate that upon telomerase binding to intermolecular G4, since the template RNA of telomerase needs to hybridise with the 3’ end of one of the four strands of the G4, this will trigger a change in conformation (maybe flipping of the strand) in such a way that two fluorophores move further apart, resulting in a decrease in FRET. We have now performed molecular dynamic simulations of this hybridisation and potential strand flipping, in the context of a homology model of human telomerase (discussed further in response to point 7 below), and we do indeed observe the 5’ ends of the G4 move further apart between 10 ns and 100 ns of the simulation (see Figure 10B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is ~0.55 FRET a reasonable value for the schematic drawings shown in Figure 2A, in other words what is the known distance between dyes on neighboring strands of an intermolecular GQ?

Surprisingly, in our telomerase extension experiments, all molecules remained at a low FRET state before they photobleached. In contrast, when experiments were conducted in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup>- buffer, a complete loss of FRET signal was observed, suggesting complete dissociation of the non-tethered strands from the surface of attachment. This suggests that the presence of telomerase holds the strands of the G4 near each other for a longer period of time, whereas in the absence of telomerase the unwound strands are free to diffuse away. This has been discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible this is happening and just not being detected in these experiments?

The authors should discuss their results in light of this earlier work.</p></disp-quote><p>Hwang et al., 2012, showed that POT1 unfolds a 24 nt G4 in four steps, whereas the POT1-TPP1 complex caused a 2-step FRET decrease followed by dynamic folding and unfolding. The mechanism of GQ unfolding by POT1 and the POT1-TPP1 complex is very different to that of telomerase; our data suggest that telomerase can directly hybridize to G4 via its RNA template, whereas POT1 unfolds G4 by a conformational selection mechanism in which G4 unfolding occurs prior to POT1 binding (Chaires et al., 2020). The four different steps of FRET reduction in the case of POT1 are attributable to the two OB folds of each of two POT1 molecules binding to the four “arms” of a G-quadruplex sequentially as it unfolds (Hwang et al., 2012). In our case, our model is that the first step of FRET reduction arises due to a conformational change upon RNA hybridization to the 3’ end of the G4, and the second step is due to complete unwinding upon telomerase extension. We have added mention of the POT1 results in Hwang et al., 2012 to the paragraph in the Discussion comparing the unique mechanism of telomerase G4 unwinding with that of other proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors' use of active versus passive unwinding mechanisms for telomerase-mediated GQ unfolding is somewhat unclear. The argument for 'active' unwinding is based upon experiments performed with a short RNA oligo presented in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3, in which this short RNA is meant to mimic the RNA template within the assembled telomerase RNP. The authors state that given the concentration dependence of the RNA-induced FRET drop, the mechanism must therefore be 'active' – but why is this necessarily true? The authors do not show any kinetic data for this experiment, therefore it is difficult to ascertain whether the process displays zero or first-order kinetics with respect to oligo-induced disruption of the GQ structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the term “passive” to mean a mechanism in which the enzyme traps an unfolded G4 in an equilibrium population, i.e. binding of the enzyme to the DNA is preceded by spontaneous G-quadruplex unwinding (as in the case of POT1; Chaires et al., 2020). “Active” referred to any mechanism that is NOT passive trapping, involving direct binding of telomerase to the G-quadruplex. However, the reviewer is correct that we did not measure the kinetics of RNA oligo-induced G4 unwinding. Unfortunately, because of the nonlinear nature of flow in the microfluidic flow cells, it is not possible to accurately measure the time between sample injection and the FRET drop. First, the starting times are measured from the time the RNA is injected. This is followed by a significant delay time (probably most of the delay time we see) before it physically enters the flow cell. Because of fluid dynamics, the RNA will not arrive in a coherent manner at the slide surface, but rather will show up as a gradually increasing concentration, making it impossible to measure binding time in an unambiguous manner. Furthermore, the microfluidic device varies from day to day in ways that affect flow rate. Therefore, it is not practical to measure meaningful initial binding kinetics. We are therefore unable to determine whether the concentration dependence of RNA-induced unwinding is first-order with respect to the RNA, so we have removed the sentence “the concentration-dependent unfolding by the RNA oligonucleotide (Supplementary Figure 3B, C) also supports an active invasion mechanism”.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that the fact that no FRET drop is observed in the presence of the same concentration of a DNA oligo is still strong evidence that RNA-mediated unfolding is NOT due to passive trapping of an unfolded G4, since this would also occur with a DNA oligo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, since there is no energy cofactor (i.e., dNTP) in this experiment, is not the mechanism, by definition, passive? The authors should articulate specifically how they are using the word 'active' in this section of the study?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we were using “passive” to indicate a mechanism involving passive trapping of a spontaneously-unwound G4, rather than a mechanism that does not need the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis. There are other examples of G4-unwinding proteins whose mechanism involves neither passive trapping nor ATP hydrolysis. For example, the ability of RPA to unwind G4 is independent of the stability of the G4, and does not need ATP; the mechanism is thought to involve RPA binding to ssDNA loops in the G4 structure (Qureshi et al. J Phys Chem 2012; Ray et al., 2013). Nevertheless, to avoid ambiguity we have more extensively defined what we mean by a “passive” mechanism in the text (Discussion), and we have removed the term “active unwinding”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors seem to think the experiments in this figure rule out the possibility of transient intrinsic GQ dynamics being 'captured' by the RNA oligo (or telomerase RNP).

They found that the unfolding was zero order with respect to the PNA oligo, suggesting that the initial step is a rate-determining internal rearrangement of the quadruplex. In contrast, the parallel G4 we used in this study were highly stable and showed NO unwinding over the time course of our smFRET experiments. Furthermore, a DNA oligo did not demonstrate ANY ability to trap the G4 structure within the time of our experiments. Conversely, RNA binding to G4 was observed within a few minutes. If there were transient intrinsic G4 dynamics, a DNA oligo would also have been able to capture the unfolded form.

Therefore, chain termination does not necessarily preclude translocation and rehybridization. There is no reason to believe that this part of the translocation process is not happening in our system also, since the G-quadruplex substrate is compatible with processive addition (new Figures 1 and 3 of our manuscript), and we have now referenced Parks and Stone, 2014, as evidence that it is likely the process of DNA realignment during translocation that triggers the FRET change we see (Discussion). However, the reviewer is correct that we don’t have direct evidence for this in our own experiments, so we have revised the language around our conclusions, now stating that the data in Figure 4 (now Figure 6) demonstrate that the FRET drop is triggered by synthesis reaching the end of the template, and is <italic>likely</italic> to result from the subsequent enzyme rearrangements during translocation (subsection “Telomerase translocation leads to complete unfolding of G-quadruplex structure”, Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5 and 6 the effects of GQ binding ligands are studied and the conclusion is that these compounds do not completely inhibit telomerase in the smFRET assay. Why are the results of the gel-based assay for the F-22G3 and the smFRET experiments not more similar? It appears in Figure 5L that NMM and PhenDC3 almost completely inhibit the telomerase activity, whereas SST16 does not have as strong of an effect (the authors should quantify the relative activities in this experiment and include them as part of the figure).

Upon looking at these numbers, we realized that the gel we used to illustrate the effect of NMM on F-22G3 in the original manuscript was not representative of the mean reduction in activity over multiple experiments, most likely due to the NMM causing artefactual retardation of product migration in that particular gel (see old Figure 5L, left panel), so we have swapped this for a more representative gel, without this artefact (new Figure 7—figure supplement 5A). So the reduction in activity with NMM is not as dramatic as it originally appeared; nevertheless, PhenDC3 does still result in a greater effect on activity than on smFRET unwinding. The reason for this is likely that the smFRET data reports only on the first cycle of telomerase-mediated addition of three nucleotides to a single substrate molecule, whereas the ensemble assay is a multiple turnover assay requiring both continued extension of a single substrate, and rebinding to new substrate molecules in solution. Indeed, PhenDC3 affects telomerase in a manner independent of G-quadruplexes, as evidenced by its inhibition of extension of an 18 nt linear telomeric substrate (Figure 7—figure supplement 5 and de Cian et al., 2007) and a completely non-telomeric substrate (de Cian et al., 2007); this effect on telomerase may include preventing it binding to a single-stranded DNA substrate (de Cian et al., 2007), which would affect total product synthesis in a multiple turnover reaction.

Nevertheless, we take the point that thermal stability does not always equal an absence of dynamics, so since we were unable to directly demonstrate a <italic>reduction</italic> in unfolding dynamics in the presence of ligand (because there was no dynamic unfolding detectable in the time span of our assays in the first place), we have modified that sentence to replace the phrase “provides further evidence that telomerase is not simply exploiting inherent instability in the G4 structure to passively extend spontaneously unwound DNA, but is instead actively involved in G4 unwinding” with “provides evidence that thermal stabilization does not provide a barrier to telomerase-mediated unwinding”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While the two-step FRET signal observed throughout the study is very interesting, the model put forth in Figure 7 is not very satisfying. Throughout the paper (including in the title) the authors describe how these data lead them to a mechanism for how telomerase acts as a GQ resolvase. However, the authors do not make an effort to discuss their data within a structural context based upon the medium-resolution cryo-EM structure of human telomerase (Nguyen et al., 2018, not cited) or the higher-resolution cryo-EM structure of Tetrahymena telomerase (Jiang et al., 2018, not cited). Why is there no attempt to explain how the proposed GQ unfolding might occur? For example, specifically how steric hindrance by the enzyme would cause unfolding during catalysis, but still allow binding to occur at the start of catalysis? Moreover, in the case of the tetrameric GQ, why would activity cause the structure to disassemble as would be suggested by the cartoon in Figure 7 (see comment above)? The authors should clarify this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. In response, we have now enlisted the help of a collaborator with expertise in molecular modelling, Dr Jessica Holien from RMIT University in Australia, to help us determine the feasibility of our proposed model in a structural sense.</p><p>Dr Holien had previously constructed an hTERT homology model based on the <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> TERT crystal structure (Tomlinson et al., 2015). She has now refined this model based on the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cryo-EM structure (Jiang et al., 2018). The human cryo-EM structure (Nguyen et al., 2018) was too low a resolution to improve this homology model further, but was used to ensure the resulting model fit in the cryo-EM envelope.</p><p>Dr Holien then took the NMR structure of the [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> quadruplex (Gavathiotis and Searle, 2003), and flipped one strand out to allow it to interact with the 10 nt RNA template. She then used the position of an RNA-DNA hybrid in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cryo-EM structure to position this G4RNA into the active site, with one DNA 3’ end at the catalytic aspartates.</p><p>The affinity of telomerase for nucleotides is decreased in the presence of a G4 substrate relative to a linear substrate (Oganesian et al., 2007, Moye et al., 2015), suggesting that the conformation of the active site is perturbed when bound to the bulkier G4. So as we expected, the active site in the modelled enzyme was not large enough to accommodate the G4-RNA complex; it clashed with the C-terminal extension (CTE) of hTERT. However, others have reported that the CTE may pivot around a region called the “beta linker” (Yang and Lee, 2015, Wu, Tam and Collins, 2017; thus, it seemed reasonable that this linker may lengthen to accommodate the quadruplex. The torsions of the beta linker amino acids (Arg938 and Thr939) were therefore altered to enable an extended conformation (shown in Figure 10A with the G4-RNA complex). Note that Figure 10A represents the completely extended form of the CTE; it is likely that during initial binding and extension of the G-quadruplex, the CTE would be less extended than this, and the fully-extended conformation may be needed to allow translocation, as postulated in the papers cited above.</p><p>While we emphasize that this model is extremely speculative, we have nevertheless included it in the revised manuscript, since it may help explain our observations. As described above in response to point 2, molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the 5’ ends of the G4 may move slightly apart from each other upon binding in the active site, while the overall structure of the G4 is retained within the boundaries of the active site. Upon DNA-RNA translocation, opening of the active site through pivoting of the CTE domain would allow dissociation of the other 3 DNA strands, resulting in the second step of FRET reduction. We have amended the discussion of our model, and the schematic in Figure 7 (now Figure 10A; described in the subsection “Ligand stabilization of intermolecular parallel G4 does not inhibit telomerase activity or telomerase-mediated G4 unfolding” and in the Discussion), accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The dwell time distribution shown in Figure 1N does not seem to be described particularly well by a single exponential decay. Nonetheless the authors argue that the distribution indicates only one rate-limiting step. Given that the observed reaction is a multi-step process, a more complex kinetic model might be required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dwell time distributions did not fit well with our data and were not very conclusive. According to the reviewer’s suggestion we re-fit our data to a more realistic kinetic model using a gamma function that identifies the number of hidden steps in a complex reaction, if present. For this purpose, we constructed histograms that show distributions of dwell times of inter- and intramolecular G4 (Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 4), instead of constructing integrated decay histograms. The new curves show that the data deviate from Gaussian distributions and are more skewed towards the right.</p><p>The gamma distribution not only reports on the apparent rate of a complex reaction pathway but also gives the number of rate-limiting steps hidden in the process (Floyd, Harrison and van Oijen, 2010). Both dwell-time histograms were fit to a gamma distribution that gives a number of steps (<italic>N</italic>) greater than two, suggesting that the process consists of at least two rate-limiting steps. Curve fitting was validated by obtaining chi-square values for the fits; the associated p-values all demonstrate no significant difference between expected and observed values (Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 4). These new fits have been introduced into the manuscript, together with a discussion of their meaning.</p><p>df: degree of freedom</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors have data recorded at various different dNTP concentrations, they should be included and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we performed telomerase extension experiments at a 100-fold lower dGTP concentration (5 µM). The data reveal that the G4 unfolding rate decreased by 1.8-fold with the same number of steps (<italic>N</italic> = 2.1) in comparison to a higher dGTP (0.5 mM) concentration (new Figure 4—figure supplement 4C). This suggests that the rate of G4 unfolding decreased because the telomerase synthesis process was affected by a change in dGTP concentration. This result is discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, the second FRET decrease observed with different G4 structures, appears to occur abruptly/instantaneously. Can intermediates during the transition be visualized (at higher frame rates or limiting dNTP concentrations)? If the transition times can be quantified, what is the underlying distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the transitions seem instantaneous at higher dNTP concentrations. In the experiments at a lower dGTP concentration, we observed that 40 ± 7% molecules of the molecules that changed FRET did indeed display a plateau at 0.4 followed by a gradual drop in FRET from 0.4 to 0.2, compared to a sharp transition at a higher dGTP concentration (new Figure 4—figure supplement 4B). These transitions are gradual and therefore it is challenging to precisely define their endpoints using a change point algorithm. Therefore, we manually analysed those traces to approximate the time it takes to reach 0.2 from 0.4 (which we refer to as τ<sub>unfolding-2</sub>, to distinguish it from the dwell time at 0.4), binning those times into a histogram. The histogram was well fitted with a gamma distribution (Chi-square 4.33 and n = 28) that results in ‘<italic>N</italic>’ greater than 3 with an overall rate constant of 0.44 s<sup>-1</sup> (new Figure 4—figure supplement 4D). This result suggests that at least three hidden steps are present in the transition from 0.4 to 0.2 FRET states, in addition to the 2-3 steps involved prior to this, and that the kinetics of these steps is affected by dNTP concentration, consistent with a dependence on dNTP incorporation. These data are now added and discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection “Human telomerase also binds, unfolds and extends intermolecular parallel G-quadruplexes”). It should be noted that our data are not sufficient to allow us to assign particular kinetic processes to each of these steps, but we do briefly mention some of the steps that may be involved (e.g. nucleotide binding and incorporation, DNA-RNA repositioning, and an enzyme conformational change to reposition the template back in the active site (Parks and Stone, 2014), Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Have EMSAs or similar experiments been performed to clarify that the RNA is actually binding / invading the G4, whereas nothing happens with DNA? Similarly, it would be informative to see binding data (Kd) for telomerase to the G4 structures used here.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to observe the RNA oligo binding to the G4 by EMSA analysis, but unfortunately this was not successful; we hypothesize that the RNA is too loosely bound to the G4 for the complex to survive electrophoresis (discussed further in response to point 10 below).</p><p>The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for [7GGT]<sub>4</sub> binding to telomerase was provided in our previous paper (~500 nM; Moye et al., 2015). We have not measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for either G4, since this information is not relevant in the smFRET experiments, in which the DNA is immobilized to a slide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is the initial FRET change from 0.5 to 0.3 correlated in time with telomerase binding? In other words, does the time lag from injection to FRET shift match the telomerase on-rate, or does the FRET change require more time (indicating a more complex process)?</p></disp-quote><p>There is a significant experimental time lag between injection of telomerase and the FRET change, as discussed above. Due to the nonlinear nature of flow in the microfluidic flow cells and the inability to compare injection times from experiment to experiment, it is not possible to quantitatively interpret the initial time before the first change in FRET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Is the FRET change observed by telomerase / RNA binding reversible, e.g. if telomerase dissociates? Similarly, given that very high concentrations of RNA were required to observe the effect seen in Figure 3F, RNA is most likely only loosely bound. It would be interesting to see if the G4 reverts when the RNA dissociates.</p></disp-quote><p>No, telomerase enzyme binding to either G4 is not reversible within our experimental window (3-5 min). No association and dissociation kinetics were observed under our experimental conditions.</p><p>However, we did observe dynamic association and dissociation of RNA oligos with G4. We performed experiments at RNA oligo concentrations of 100 μm and 500 uM. In those experiments, we categorised static versus dynamic molecules based on whether a given molecule underwent multiple binding and unbinding events (dynamic) or remained at the binding state once bound (static). We observed that 26 ± 6 and 21 ± 4% molecules show dynamic behaviour in 100 µM and 500 µM RNA concentration, respectively, as shown in the FRET time trajectories (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D). As the reviewer predicted, this is indicative that the RNA affinity for G4 is much lower than that of the whole enzyme; we have added these data and discussion of this point to the manuscript (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and subsection “The RNA template sequence is involved in partial unfolding of G-quadruplex structure”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors find that G4-stabilizing ligands double the number of G4 that are not opened. This is not really discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, since this happens in the context of there being no increase in the number of molecules undergoing a single FRET drop. This suggests that the ligands may interfere with telomerase binding to F-22G3, preventing the first FRET decrease that is associated with binding. We have added discussion of this point to the manuscript (subsection “Ligand stabilization of intramolecular parallel G4 partially inhibits but does not prevent G4 unwinding by telomerase”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could it be that the G4s that are actually unwound are not really bound by the ligands? Does this effect depend on the ligand concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>This is possible, although we consider it unlikely since the degree of thermal stabilization of the population of molecules was so dramatic, particularly for PhenDC3 (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2F). We did not conduct experiments at different concentration of ligands, but we carried out ligand binding at an excess of ligand over DNA. Furthermore, at least in the case of NMM, the rate of unwinding was reduced in the presence of ligand, arguing that most molecules were bound by ligand. Nevertheless, we have added to the text the caveat that we cannot rule out that some of the molecules unwound by telomerase were not bound by the ligands (subsection “Ligand stabilization of intramolecular parallel G4 partially inhibits but does not prevent G4 unwinding by telomerase”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also an apparent discrepancy between the amount of G4s that are stabilized, the change in unfolding rate (Figure 5K), and the extension rate (Figure 5L). For example, PhenDC3 results in a minor slowing down of G4 unfolding in Figure 5K but seems to completely inhibit extension (Figure 5L). These discrepancies should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now re-fitted the dwell time distribution with a gamma distribution function according to the reviewer’s suggestion under question 8. Overall, the unfolding rates slightly decrease in the presence of ligands, though this was only statistically significant in the case of NMM (Figure K).</p><p>The difference between the effects of PhenDC3 in the smFRET analyses and the ensemble activity assays have been discussed in response to point 6 above, and this discussion has been added to the revised manuscript (subsection “Ligand stabilization of intramolecular parallel G4 partially inhibits but does not prevent G4 unwinding by telomerase”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
