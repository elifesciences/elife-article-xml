However, it remains unclear how adipose inflammation is initiated and maintained or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that <italic>microRNA-802</italic> (<italic>Mir802</italic>) expression in adipose tissue is progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity in obese mice and humans. The increasing trend of <italic>Mir802</italic> preceded the accumulation of macrophages. Adipose tissue-specific knockout of <italic>Mir802</italic> lowered macrophage infiltration and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, the specific overexpression of <italic>Mir802</italic> in adipose tissue aggravated adipose inflammation in mice fed a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, <italic>Mir802</italic> activates noncanonical and canonical NF-κB pathways by targeting its negative regulator, TRAF3. Next, NF-κB orchestrated the expression of chemokines and SREBP1, leading to strong recruitment and M1-like polarization of macrophages. Our findings indicate that <italic>Mir802</italic> endows adipose tissue with the ability to recruit and polarize macrophages, which underscores <italic>Mir802</italic> as an innovative and attractive candidate for miRNA-based immune therapy for adipose inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>adipose

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a very powerful health determinant or indicator that facilitates the development and progression of several metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling and Rönn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2022</xref>). Adipose tissue is a highly dynamic metabolic organ that plays a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and controls glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). A hallmark of obesity is low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, characterized by the accumulation of macrophages and other immune cells, and by an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pellegrinelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hägglöf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kratz et al., 2014</xref>). Persistent adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to have a pivotal role in obesity-associated insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohlgruber and Lynch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burhans et al., 2018</xref>). Resetting the immunological balance in obesity could represent an innovative approach for the management of insulin resistance and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brestoff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). However, the early triggers and signals that sustain adipose tissue inflammation in obesity remain elusive, limiting our ability to effectively intervene this growing public health issue.</p><p>Macrophages accumulate in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, where they form crown-like structures surrounding dying or dead adipocytes and are key contributors to inflammation and obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hotamisligil, 2006</xref>). The number of adipose tissue macrophages is tightly linked to the degree of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>). Ablation of pro-inflammatory adipose tissue macrophages leads to a rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, associated with marked decreases in local and systemic inflammation in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patsouris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nomiyama et al., 2007</xref>). Targeting the major inflammatory pathways is sufficient to counteract obesity-related systemic inflammation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patra et al., 2023</xref>). However, the molecular links between lipid-overloaded adipocytes and inflammatory macrophages in obese adipose tissue remain elusive.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to specific regions of target genes to prevent translation or promote mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambros, 2004</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs are key regulators in a variety of important metabolic organs and substantial contributors to the pathogenesis of complex diseases, including obesity-associated metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumortier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krützfeldt and Stoffel, 2006</xref>). In the adipose tissue, miRNAs have dramatic effects on regulating the pathways that control a range of processes including lipogenesis, inflammation, and insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arner and Kulyté, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomou et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, mice with alterations in the levels of miRNAs in adipocytes show significantly enhanced inflammation and insulin resistance after feeding with a high-fat diet (HFD), further confirming the contribution of miRNAs to obesity-induced phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbu and Carthew, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koh et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, adipose-derived miRNAs hold great promise for understanding adipose tissue dysfunction and the relationship between chronic inflammation and obesity and insulin resistance.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>microRNA-802</italic> (<italic>Mir802</italic>) promotes inter-cellular communication between lipid-overloaded adipocytes and macrophages, ultimately leading to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Adipocyte <italic>Mir802</italic> levels are positively associated with obesity in mice and humans. Adipose tissue-specific overexpression of <italic>Mir802</italic> in mice fed an HFD exhibited increased severity of systemic insulin resistance compared with wild-type (WT) mice, which was accompanied by macrophage infiltration and a marked increase in adipose tissue inflammation. Adipose tissue-specific knockout of <italic>Mir802</italic> achieved the opposite result. Co-culture and other in vitro experiments revealed a vicious cycle of interactions between macrophages and adipocytes ectopically expressing <italic>Mir802</italic>. We established that <italic>Mir802</italic> expression is an inflammatory signal in adipocytes, and this effect occurs through sensitization of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Altogether, our data raise the possibility that manipulation of this microRNA action axis has therapeutic potential for treating adipose inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mir802</italic> elevation precedes macrophage accumulation</title><p>Consistent with previous studies from our and other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornfeld et al., 2013</xref>), adipose from obese mice showed significantly higher <italic>Mir802</italic> expression than those from normal mice. To evaluate whether <italic>Mir802</italic> is involved in adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. We examined the expression profile of <italic>Mir802</italic>. We observed that <italic>Mir802</italic> progressively increased in adipose tissue from week 4 with the development of obesity in mouse models of genetic and dietary obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next compared the expression of <italic>Mir802</italic> in different adipose depots and found that it was the highest in epididymal white adipose tissue (epiWAT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further isolated mature adipose tissue and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from epiWAT to examine the expression of <italic>Mir802</italic>. We found that <italic>Mir802</italic> expression was substantially higher in mature adipocytes than in SVF in both mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD) and those fed an HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Through in vitro experiments, we found that <italic>Mir802</italic> was dramatically increased in the insulin resistance cell models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We have determined that the upregulation of islet <italic>Mir802</italic> during obesity is mediated by <italic>Forkhead box O1</italic> (<italic>FoxO1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>FoxO1</italic> is predominantly expressed in WAT and is upregulated in WAT of the obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Teaney and Cyr, 2023</xref>).

Several studies have suggested that TRAF3 negatively regulates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2007</xref>), which is consistent with the KEGG analysis based on our RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, profound accumulation of NIK was observed in all cells with overexpression of <italic>Mir802</italic>, which correlated well with decreased TRAF3. <italic>Mir802</italic> selectively ablated adipose tissues showed the opposite result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Processing of the p100 precursor to p52, the hallmark of noncanonical NF-κB activation, was also assessed by immunoblotting. Although 3T3-L1 cells exhibited the normal kinetics of p100 processing with substantial p52 accumulation by 48 hr after treatment with the empty vector, <italic>Mir802</italic>-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells and <italic>Mir802</italic> selectively overexpressed adipose tissues showed constitutive and total processing of the p100 precursor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Mice fed an HFD frequently develop chronic low-grade inflammation within adipose tissues, characterized by increased infiltration of macrophages and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we showed that the increasing trend of <italic>Mir802</italic> in adipocytes is an early event during the development of adipose tissue obesity induced by an HFD. <italic>Mir802</italic> expression in visceral fat was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity, whereas adipose-selective ablation of <italic>Mir802</italic> protected mice from exacerbation of meta-inflammation and insulin resistance caused by dietary stress. The high level of <italic>Mir802</italic> expression in visceral fat may partly explain why this adipose depot is more prone to inflammation and is closely related to insulin resistance. <italic>Mir802</italic> is required for adipose tissue inflammation and has major roles in macrophage recruitment and polarization. Thus, <italic>Mir802</italic> is crucially involved in initiating inflammatory cascades in obese adipose tissue. Moreover, the finding that <italic>Mir802</italic> inhibitor treatment ameliorated pre-established adipose inflammation in DIO mice indicates that <italic>Mir802</italic> is also essential for maintenance of the inflammatory response. Although previous studies have found that <italic>Mir802</italic> was up-regulated in the adipose tissue during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goga et al., 2021</xref>), the function of <italic>Mir802</italic> was focused on cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2021</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seok et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ni et al., 2021</xref>), small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goga et al., 2021</xref>), and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2022</xref>).

Whether <italic>Mir802</italic> can regulate adipose function is still confused, our study is the first to address that <italic>Mir802</italic> intensifies adipose tissue inflammation by affecting crosstalk between adipose and macrophage. The findings that systemic insulin resistance is ameliorated by <italic>Mir802</italic> depletion and is aggravated by adoptive transfer of <italic>Mir802</italic> mimics strongly suggest that <italic>Mir802</italic>-dependent adipose inflammation has an impact on systemic metabolism.</p><p>Like most other miRNAs, <italic>Mir802</italic> regulates the expression of multiple genes in different tissues. In the liver, <italic>Mir802</italic> is induced by obesity and impaired glucose tolerance, and it attenuates insulin sensitivity by downregulation of <italic>Hnf1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornfeld et al., 2013</xref>).

In this study, we found that <italic>Mir802</italic> promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by targeting TRAF3 in adipocytes. As a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily, TRAF3 plays vital roles in inflammatory responses via activation of both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zarnegar et al., 2008</xref> following engagement of a variety of TNFR superfamily members such as Baff receptor, lymphotoxin β receptor, and CD40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Häcker et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we found that <italic>Mir802</italic> can regulate the NF-κB pathway by directly targeting TRAF3 rather than by activating the classic receptor, which enriches the understanding of the NF-κB pathway.</p><p>Macrophage accumulation was significantly higher in adipose tissue from HFD-fed <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice than in WT mice, suggesting that overexpression of <italic>Mir802</italic> enhances the infiltration ability of macrophages. Correspondingly, we observed that <italic>Mir802-</italic>overexpressing adipocytes released more chemokines by activating NF-κB pathway, such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL2. Adipose tissue inflammation is well documented as an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumeng et al., 2007b</xref>). This was further validated by our observation of enhanced adipose tissue inflammatory responses in <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice. Moreover, HFD-fed <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice exhibited adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and NF-κB pathway activation. Genes that are crucial for meta-inflammation and insulin resistance were directly affected by the enhancement of <italic>Mir802</italic> in adipose tissue. Thus, increased adipose tissue inflammation resulting from <italic>Mir802</italic> overexpression contributed, in large part, to systemic insulin resistance in <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice.</p><p>The chronic inflammation microenvironment is one of the main features of obesity. A recent study found that adipocytes can release lipid-filled vesicles that become a source of lipids for local macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flaherty et al., 2019</xref>). Phagocytosis or excessive accumulation of lipid droplets can induce macrophage M1 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flaherty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batista-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, we observed the same phenomenon, that is, in <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice, macrophages accumulated more lipid droplets and exhibited an inflammatory phenotype. SREBP1 has been found to promote the acute inflammatory response and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Im et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fei et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we found that <italic>Mir802</italic> increased SREBP1 expression inducing lipogenesis by activating canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, then macrophage engulf lipid droplet promoting macrophage M1 polarization. This has enriched our understanding of the functionality of SREBP1 to some extent. However, <italic>Mir802</italic> only indirectly regulates SREBP1, but it still has a considerable impact on macrophages, indicating the importance of miRNA positive or indirect regulation. Though Jae-Ho Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) determined that Srebp1a provides lipids essential for maintaining association between the actin cytoskeletal network and plasma membranes, thus enhancing phagocytosis, whether <italic>Mir802</italic> promotes macrophage to engulf lipid droplets via regulation the actin cytoskeletal network and plasma membranes still need to further research.</p><p>Taken together, our results support the idea that obese adipose tissue activates <italic>Mir802</italic>, which, in turn, initiates and propagates inflammatory cascades, including the recruitment of macrophages into obese adipose tissues and their subsequent induction of the inflammatory phenotype.

In our study, we have found that a high-fat diet (nutrition factor) and genetic factors can induce an increase in adipose <italic>Mir802</italic>.

Your article has been now reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Bard of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and I have drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) According to the Reviewers, a deeper investigation of the relationship between fat accumulation and inflammation is missing. In other words, how do changes in fat accumulation drive changes in inflammation and metabolic function? This should be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript with additional data.</p><p>2) Reviewers required more data to demonstrate what mediates the communication between adipocytes and macrophages. This is yet another key element of the manuscript which should be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>3) Reviewers raised important questions regarding the mechanism underlying macrophage inflammatory activation upon miR-802 induction in adipocytes. The authors should address these points in part by expanding the characterization of macrophages in their models.</p><p>4) Important controls are missing and should be included in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>5) In addition to addressing these major points, we would expect a point-by-point response to all Reviewers' concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In addition to the points raised in the public reviews, there are other issues that should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) Line 93: &quot;obesity mice&quot; should be &quot;obese mice&quot;.</p><p>2) Line 95: &quot;.we…&quot; should be &quot;. We…&quot; with a capital letter.</p><p>3) Line 138: &quot;KI&quot; – define abbreviations the first time they appear.</p><p>4) Lines 150-151: &quot;No change of CLSs was between two groups fed with NCD&quot; – revise sentence.</p><p>5) Line 179: &quot;miR-802 is required for the recruitment…&quot; – I would change &quot;required&quot; for &quot;sufficient&quot;.</p><p>6) Figure 2 and potentially others: watch for overlap between panels. Legends from panels D and O are cut.</p><p>7) Line 284: what do you mean by &quot;various obese mice&quot;?</p><p>8) Figure 5 and potentially others: maintain the same color code. It is confusing when color code changes across experimental groups.</p><p>9) Line 456: the word &quot;while&quot; should be deleted.</p><p>10) Supplementary Figure 3N: the picture is not very informative.</p><p>11) Supplementary Figure 3O: I believe &quot;kidney&quot; is misspelled.</p><p>12) Quantification of the blots should be presented, as well as the number of biological replicates for all blots, particularly the ones where only a representative sample is presented (e.g., Figure 5F, Figure 6 A, C, E, and G, and Figure 7B, D, H, and I).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Yang et al. investigated the effects of obesity on miR-802 expression and the role of miR-802 in obesity-related inflammation. The authors found that miR-802 levels are increased in insulin-resistant AT. Then, by using genetic approaches of gain- and loss-of-function, it was found that miR-802 manipulation effectively controls adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage infiltration. The authors went further to demonstrate this regulation of AT inflammation occurs by interaction of miR-802 with intracellular TRAF3, controlling NF-κB pathway activation. Overall, the study is well-written, and the techniques applied allow robust conclusions regarding the role of miR-802 in adipose tissue inflammation. I have a few suggestions for the authors to strengthen the quality of the study which I hope you find helpful.</p><p>1) In the co-culture experiments, what is the effect of co-culture on migration and invasion? Showing migration and invasion without any co-culture is an important control and would be informative to know what are the effects of a normal adipocyte secretion on macrophage function.</p><p>2) It is now recognized that adipocytes produce and release miRNAs to act in distant organs (PMID: 28492253; 36070680; 35387487). It is important to measure miR-802 in macrophages following co-culture experiments to rule out a direct effect of adipocyte-derived miR-802 in macrophages.</p><p>3) Could the authors provide the source and codes of the diets used in this study?</p><p>4) Palmitate 0.5mM used to induce insulin resistance can cause cell. Could the authors provide evidence of the absence of cell death in this treatment?</p><p>5) Although the regulation of Srebp1 by miR-802 was convincingly demonstrated, the relationship between lipid droplet formation and the engulfment of lipid droplets on macrophage phenotype is not clear. Could the authors include this limitation and open questions in the Discussion section, please?</p><p>6) As far as I understood, the BMI of lean participants ranged from 20 to 25 kg/m2. Could the authors reword this sentence in the methods section to make it clearer?</p><p>7) Why were lean and insulin-sensitive participants excluded from the correlation analysis in Figure 1J and 1K, respectively?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) CD86+CD206- cannot be considered as a marker of inflammatory macrophages without an intracellular cytokine profile and CD11c expression.</p><p>2) Because miR-802 deletion affected adiposity, it is difficult to differentiate if the anti-inflammatory and pro-metabolic effects of miR-802 are due to a direct action on macrophages of other unrelated mechanisms.</p><p>3) In Figure 3 there is no pre-gate on CD11b/F4/80/CD45 cells, thus, these cells can be any type of stromal vascular cell. Also, there is no gating strategy with macrophage and viability plots.</p><p>4) There are no insights on why obesity triggers the accumulation of miR-802.</p><p>5) Raw cells do not resemble primary macrophages and conclusions drawn with this cell line cannot be expanded unless also show at least in bone marrow derived macrophages.</p><p>6) Description of Figure 4 in the text should be fully revised. It is kind of confusing.</p><p>7) CCL2/MCP1 are well known chemokines for monocytes in adipose tissue, blocking assays could help determine her effect in miR-802 overexpression.</p><p>8) Why in Figure 4H are different cell numbers in the flow plots? A dye for viability should be added in all experiments.</p><p>9) Traf3 is associated protein related to TNFR, CD40, among other receptors signaling pathways, leading, for example, to NFKB activation. However, here the authors show that increased expression of Traf3 results in reduced macrophage count and adipose inflammation and improved systemic glucose homeostasis. Also, the data appears to show the opposite result. This is confusing. There are data showing that Traf3 may also attenuate NFKB signaling, this is an interesting effect that is partially investigated in the manuscript. Overall, for this topic, it is difficult to follow the data and addressing this would improve the manuscript and the potential mechanism involved.</p><p>10) The data related to LD is confusing, the transcriptomics was performed in whole tissue and confirmed in 3T3 cells and expanded to macrophages as they were the same cell types.</p><p>11) miR-802 effects on Traf3 are studies on adipocytes, but what is the role of Traf3 in macrophages, are responsive? What does the expression of miR-802 in adipocytes trigger in macrophages?</p><p>12) Figure 6B, the Teaf3 blot appears to come from a different gel, please upload the complete gels.</p><p>13) The authors mention sometimes in the text macrophage infiltration. However, as there are no circulating macs, they probably mean monocyte infiltration.</p><p>14) Figure S4E – the SSC FSC plot is gating lymphoid cells, the population located next to this is the myeloid cell population. This may account for the high proliferation observed, which is not common in macrophages.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Adipocyte microRNA-802 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by modulating macrophages in obesity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Satyajit Rath (Senior Editor) and Marcelo Mori as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>While the other reviewers were satisfied with the revised manuscript, Reviewer #2 still has a remaining concern. Additionally, the manuscript would benefit from a thorough grammatical review, as there are still some errors in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have now read the revised the work of Yang et al. with great interest. The original manuscript was of high quality and had important findings for not just the obesity field but also microRNAs and tissue-communication fields. The authors answered almost all my questions, which I greatly appreciate. However, one point that was not completely addressed was the migration/invasion assay in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 4. In Supplementary Figure 4, the authors show the control (i.e. no adipocyte) for macrophage migration/invasion, and then the co-culture of adipocytes overexpressing miR-802 and Mir802 &amp; NOX-E36.</p><p>On the other hand, Figure 4 shows migration/invasion for all co-culture but not without co-culture, which the authors infer based on the previous figure (Supplementary Figure 4) is quite low without adipocytes being co-cultured. Therefore, the direct effect of adipocyte co-culture on macrophage migration/invasion has not been shown yet. I suggest showing the migration/invasion assay, at least once, with all conditions (i.e. no adipocyte, co-culture with adipocyte with no miR-802 manipulation, and then the co-culture with miR-802 manipulation or drugs). This approach will be very informative to the reader in understanding the full context of macrophage migration/invasion behavior in the presence of adipocytes and modulation of miR-802 expression. Apart from this, I have no further suggestions other than to congratulate the authors for the nice piece of work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99162.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) According to the Reviewers, a deeper investigation of the relationship between fat accumulation and inflammation is missing.

We have addressed additional data in the revised manuscript to determine the relationship between fat accumulation and inflammation.</p><p>In our study, we have determined that overexpression <italic>Mir802</italic> activates the canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways, which can increase CCL2 secretion leading to recruit macrophage.

Accordingly, <italic>Mir802</italic> overexpression significantly increased lipid synthesis (Figure 7—figure supplement 1G-H). Moreover, we found overexpression-<italic>Mir802</italic> 3T3-L1 cells promoted RAW264.7 cells to engulf more lipid droplets through direct contact co-culture with mature 3T3-L1 and RAW264.7 cells, while the content of lipid droplets is decreased in the knockdown-<italic>Mir802</italic> 3T3-L1 cells (Figure 7K). Furthermore, we also observed that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) of the <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice could engulf more lipid droplets (Figure 7L, M).

The clodronate liposomes treatment ameliorated systematic inflammation, as displayed by the decreased levels of serum inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL2) (Figure 4K). Remarkably, the differences in these circulating factors except CCL2 between <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice and WT littermates became indistinguishable after macrophage depletion, suggesting that the macrophages are not the main source of CCL2. Furthermore, macrophage depletion also led to recover hyperinsulinemia (Figure 4L) and HOMA-IR (Supplementary Figure 4K) in <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice after the treatment. Similarly, macrophage depletion with CLOD-liposomes obviously alleviated the HFD-induced glucose intolerance in <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice, and abrogated the differences of these metabolic indicators between <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice and WT mice (Figure 4M). Taken together, these data support macrophages as an important mediator for adipose <italic>Mir802</italic>–induced systemic inflammation in obesity.

The authors found that miR-802 levels are increased in insulin-resistant AT. Then, by using genetic approaches of gain- and loss-of-function, it was found that miR-802 manipulation effectively controls adipose tissue inflammation and macrophage infiltration. The authors went further to demonstrate this regulation of AT inflammation occurs by interaction of miR-802 with intracellular TRAF3, controlling NF-κB pathway activation. Overall, the study is well-written, and the techniques applied allow robust conclusions regarding the role of miR-802 in adipose tissue inflammation. I have a few suggestions for the authors to strengthen the quality of the study which I hope you find helpful.</p><p>1) In the co-culture experiments, what is the effect of co-culture on migration and invasion?

Firstly, based on previous reports, Traf3 is an inhibitory protein of NF-κB pathway. Activation of the NF-κB pathway needs degradation of TRAF3 (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature11831">10.1038/nature11831</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M413634200">doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M413634200</ext-link>), we observed the same phenomenon in our study. We determined that <italic>Mir802</italic> activated NF-κB pathway via inhibiting <italic>Traf3</italic> expression. In the adipose activation NF-κB pathway intensifies adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance (doi.org/10.2337/db22-0284), we also found that selectively ablated <italic>Mir802</italic> in adipose tissue inhibited NF-κB pathway reducing macrophage count and adipose inflammation and improving systemic glucose homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The data related to LD is confusing, the transcriptomics was performed in whole tissue and confirmed in 3T3 cells and expanded to macrophages as they were the same cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important point. The data related to LD, we were performed both in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, transcriptomics was performed in the epiWAT of <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice and their WT littermates, the results revealed that the lipogenic gene sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 a (SREBP1a) was increased, Srebp1a is a well-established regulator of lipid synthesis. Accordingly, we determined that <italic>Mir802</italic> KI mice significantly increased the number of lipid droplets, while <italic>Mir802</italic> KO mice significantly decreased the number of lipid droplets (Figure 7—figure supplement 1G). We also observed the same phenomenon in the 3T3-L1 cells transfected with <italic>Mir802</italic> mimic or <italic>Mir802</italic> inhibitor (Figure 7—figure supplement 1H).</p><p>3T3-L1 cells derived from the mouse fibroblast line 3T3, which can synthesis triglycerides after differentiation 3T3-L1 cells are an ideal cell model for fat metabolism (doi: 10.1038/s41467-024-45899-4, doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109538.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) miR-802 effects on Traf3 are studies on adipocytes, but what is the role of Traf3 in macrophages, are responsive? What does the expression of miR-802 in adipocytes trigger in macrophages?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your meticulous review. Indeed, we have convincingly demonstrated that <italic>Mir802</italic> inhibited <italic>Traf3</italic> expression via directly targeting <italic>Traf3</italic>. In our previous study, we found <italic>Mir802</italic> was enriched in the adipocyte, and lower expressed in the SVF cells (Figure 1D). Moreover, we sorted F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> by flow cytometry, qPCR results revealed that <italic>Mir802</italic> expression was very low. Furthermore, our co-culture experiments indicated that ectopic expression of <italic>Mir802</italic> in the 3T3-L1 cells have not changed <italic>Mir802</italic> expression in the macrophage (Figure 4H). Overall, <italic>Mir802</italic> was not directly regulated macrophage function. <italic>Mir802</italic> in adipocyte regulated adipocyte secretion chemokines, which in tun to affect macrophage function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 6B, the Teaf3 blot appears to come from a different gel, please upload the complete gels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important point. All complete gels have uploaded when we submitted the manuscript. Now, we have provided the complete gels of TRAF3 of the Figure 6B. TRAF3 blots was come from the same gel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors mention sometimes in the text macrophage infiltration. However, as there are no circulating macs, they probably mean monocyte infiltration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your good advice. The term &quot;macrophage infiltration&quot; was primarily used to describe the regulation of macrophage infiltration by <italic>Mir802</italic> in mice (Figure 2, Figure 3). Manuscript has been thoroughly reviewed and we have made corrections where it was deemed inappropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure S4E – the SSC FSC plot is gating lymphoid cells, the population located next to this is the myeloid cell population. This may account for the high proliferation observed, which is not common in macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful reviewing. We are very sorry, perhaps due to our unclear writing, causing a misunderstanding for you. The results of flow cytometer of Figure 4—figure supplement 1E was KI67 results in the cell line of RAW264.7 cells. Here, <italic>Mir802</italic> mimics or <italic>Mir802</italic> inhibitor was transfected into the mature 3T3-L1 cells, <italic>Mir802</italic> ectopically expressed 3T3-L1 cells on the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 in co-culture (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Then we investigate <italic>Mir802</italic> regulated RAW264.7 proliferation via EdU and FCM. We found that the <italic>Mir802</italic> levels have no different in the RAW264.7 cells (Figure 4H), <italic>Mir802</italic>-overexpressing 3T3-L1 cells had no effect on the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F). We have rewritten it, and we hope the changes above would make you and other readers much easier to understand our manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the other reviewers were satisfied with the revised manuscript, Reviewer #2 still has a remaining concern. Additionally, the manuscript would benefit from a thorough grammatical review, as there are still some errors in the text.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have now read the revised the work of Yang et al. with great interest. The original manuscript was of high quality and had important findings for not just the obesity field but also microRNAs and tissue-communication fields. The authors answered almost all my questions, which I greatly appreciate. However, one point that was not completely addressed was the migration/invasion assay in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 4. In Supplementary Figure 4, the authors show the control (i.e. no adipocyte) for macrophage migration/invasion, and then the co-culture of adipocytes overexpressing miR-802 and Mir802 &amp; NOX-E36.</p><p>On the other hand, Figure 4 shows migration/invasion for all co-culture but not without co-culture, which the authors infer based on the previous figure (Supplementary Figure 4) is quite low without adipocytes being co-cultured. Therefore, the direct effect of adipocyte co-culture on macrophage migration/invasion has not been shown yet. I suggest showing the migration/invasion assay, at least once, with all conditions (i.e. no adipocyte, co-culture with adipocyte with no miR-802 manipulation, and then the co-culture with miR-802 manipulation or drugs). This approach will be very informative to the reader in understanding the full context of macrophage migration/invasion behavior in the presence of adipocytes and modulation of miR-802 expression. Apart from this, I have no further suggestions other than to congratulate the authors for the nice piece of work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your encouraging comments. According to your suggestion, we have performed the migration/invasion assay with no adipocyte, co-culture with adipocyte, co-culture with adipocyte transfected <italic>Mir802</italic> mimics, co-culture with adipocyte transfected <italic>Mir802</italic> mimics and added emapticap pegol (also known as NOX-E36, CCL2 inhibitor). The results showed that no adipocyte, RAW 264.7 cells almost have no ability to migration and invasion, co-culture with <italic>Mir802</italic> mimics promoted the migration and invasion of RAW 264.7 cells compared to co-culture with miR-NC, while blocking CCL2 in <italic>Mir802</italic>-overexpressed 3T3-L1 cells exhibited reduced RAW 264.7 cells recruitment ability (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). Overall, our findings provide support for the hypothesis that obese adipose tissue upregulates <italic>Mir802</italic>, which facilitate adipose cells to secrete CCL2, leading to the recruitment and activation of macrophages by <italic>Mir802</italic>-overexpressing adipocytes. We have added a schematic illustration in the Figure 4—figure supplement 2E. We hope these changes will be very informative to the reader in understanding the full context of macrophage migration/invasion behavior in the presence of adipocytes and modulation of <italic>Mir802</italic> expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
