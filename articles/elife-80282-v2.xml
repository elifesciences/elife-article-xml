However, the precise molecular nodes underlying diet-induced feeding motivation dysregulation are poorly understood. The fruit fly is a simple genetic model system yet displays significant evolutionary conservation to mammalian nutrient sensing and energy balance. Using a longitudinal high-sugar regime in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we sought to address how diet-induced changes in adipocyte lipid composition regulate feeding behavior. We observed that subjecting adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> to a prolonged high-sugar diet degrades the hunger-driven feeding response. Lipidomics analysis reveals that longitudinal exposure to high-sugar diets significantly alters whole-body phospholipid profiles. By performing a systematic genetic screen for phospholipid enzymes in adult fly adipocytes, we identify Pect as a critical regulator of hunger-driven feeding. Pect is a rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathway and the fly ortholog of human PCYT2. We show that disrupting Pect activity only in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat cells causes insulin resistance, dysregulated lipoprotein delivery to the brain, and a loss of hunger-driven feeding. Previously human studies have noted a correlation between PCYT2/Pect levels and clinical obesity. Now, our unbiased studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide causative evidence for adipocyte Pect function in metabolic homeostasis. Altogether, we have uncovered that PE phospholipid homeostasis regulates hunger response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PECT</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>apolipoproteins</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajan</surname><given-names>Akhila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000076</institution-id><institution>Directorate for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2109398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Kevin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Chromosome Metabolism and Cancer Training Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Kevin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral, lipidomic, and genetic analyses of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> on a chronic high-sugar regime identified that fat body activity of a phospholipid biosynthesis enzyme, Pect, regulates insulin sensitivity and hunger response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Improper hunger-sensing underlies a multitude of eating disorders, including obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the breakdown of the hunger-sensing system are poorly understood. In addition to lipid storage, adipocytes play a crucial endocrine role in maintaining energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuryszko et al., 2016</xref>). Factors secreted by adipocytes impinge on several organs, including the brain, to regulate systemic metabolism and feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo and Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Rajan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wurfel et al., 2022</xref>). Since lipids play a key role in signaling, adipocyte lipid composition is likely to regulate hunger perception and feeding behavior. Linking specific changes in adipocyte lipid composition to hunger perception and feeding behavior remains challenging.</p><p>While the effects of neutral fat reserves such as triglycerides on feeding behavior have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cansell et al., 2014</xref>), less is known about the effects of phospholipids. Phospholipids comprise the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and anchor integral membrane proteins, including ion channels and receptors. They are essential components of cellular organelles, lipoproteins, and secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shinoda, 2016</xref>). Changes to phospholipid composition can alter the permeability of cell membranes and disrupt intra- and intercellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shinoda, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben M’barek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sunshine and Iruela-Arispe, 2017</xref>). Numerous clinical studies suggest an association between phospholipid composition and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anjos et al., 2019</xref>). For example, insulin resistance, a hallmark of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes, is strongly associated with alterations in phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, key phospholipid biosynthesis enzymes are correlated with obesity in human genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these intriguing possibilities, a causative link between altered phospholipid composition and metabolic dysfunction is yet to be established. Furthermore, whether altered adipocyte phospholipid composition specifically leads to dysfunctional hunger-sensing is unknown.</p><p>Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the second most abundant phospholipid and is essential in membrane fission/fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vance, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moon and Jun, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emoto and Umeda, 2000</xref>). PE is synthesized through two main pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farine et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphatidylethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt/Pect) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the ER-mediated PE biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobrosotskaya et al., 2002</xref>). Global dysregulation in Pcyt/Pect activity has been shown to cause metabolic dysfunction in animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>). For example, Pyct/Pect deficiency in mice causes a reduction in PE levels, leading to obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fullerton et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, human studies have found that obese individuals with insulin resistance have decreased Pcyt/Pect expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Chronic exposure to a high-fat diet causes upregulation of Pcyt/Pect, associated with increased weight gain and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Wit et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that disruptions in Pcyt/Pect activity, and consequently PE homeostasis, are a common underlying feature of obesity and metabolic disorders. What remains largely unknown is whether Pcyt/Pect activity in the adipose tissue directly regulates insulin sensitivity and feeding behavior.</p><p>Like humans, chronic overconsumption of a high-sugar diet (HSD) results in insulin resistance, diet-induced obesity (DIO), and metabolic imbalance in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Dam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gáliková and Klepsatel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musselman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). There is deep evolutionary conservation of feeding neural circuits regulating feeding behavior between flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), and multiple studies on feeding behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have identified key neurons and receptors involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Musso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Musso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dus et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, like humans, <italic>Drosophila</italic> display altered feeding behavior in response to highly palatable foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tennessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Small, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Volkow et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, given flies’ short lifespan, feeding behavior in response to an obesogenic diet can be monitored throughout the adult fly’s lifespan, providing temporal resolution of behavioral changes under DIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pendergast et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pendergast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Post et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, using a chronic HSD feeding regime in adult flies allows for discovering specific mechanisms relevant to human biology.</p><p>In this study, we assess the effects of chronic HSD consumption on flies’ hunger-driven feeding (HDF) behavior across a 28-day time window. We note that while HSD-fed flies maintain their ability to mobilize fat stores on starvation, they lose their HDF response after 2 weeks of HSD treatment, suggesting an uncoupling of nutrient sensing and feeding behavior. We reveal that changes in phospholipid concentrations in HSD-fed flies occur during HDF loss. We further show that genetic disruption of the key PE biosynthesis enzyme Pect in the fat body, the fly’s adipose tissue, results in the loss of HDF even under normal food (NF) conditions. Significantly, Pect overexpression in the fat body is sufficient to protect flies from HSD-induced loss in HDF. Our data suggest that adipocyte PE-phospholipid homeostasis is critical to maintaining insulin sensitivity and regulating hunger response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> to HSDs for 14 days disrupts HDF</title><p>To assess how obesogenic diets alter HDF, we developed a feeding paradigm using a quantitative monitor (Fly Liquid Interaction Counter [FLIC]) to assess feeding activity over time on different diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In brief, wild-type (w1118) flies were housed in vials containing NF or HSD (30% more sucrose than NF). After exposure to NF or HSD for 5–28 days, flies were subject to a 0% sucrose/agar media (starvation – stv media) for 16 hr to induce hunger. After 16 hr of starvation, we monitored flies’ feeding behavior using the FLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ro et al., 2014</xref>) for 3 hr (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and ‘Methods’). We observed that NF-stv w1118 flies showed increased feeding compared to flies fed ad libitum (NF-fed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with an HDF response in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ellacott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGrath et al., 2019</xref>). However, HSD-fed flies, though they displayed an HDF response on days 3–10 of HSD exposure, showed a progressive loss of the HDF response to starvation starting on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, shaded in yellow, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Excluding the possibility that the loss in HDF is due to increased baseline feeding on HSD, flies on NF and HSD showed similar ad libitum feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that beyond day 14, HSD hunger-sensing is altered.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-sugar diet (HSD) causes progressive loss in hunger-driven feeding (HDF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HDF behavior in flies was tested using the schematic in (<bold>A</bold>).

Triacylglycerides (TAGs) are the largest energy reserve and are mobilized when flies are starved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>). Thus, changes in TAG levels following starvation can be used as a readout for cellular energy-sensing in <italic>Drosophila (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heier et al., 2021</xref>). We observed that HSD-fed flies displayed similar levels of starvation-induced TAG breakdown to NF-fed flies throughout the 4-week window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), suggesting that starvation-induced lipolysis remains functional in HSD-fed flies. Even though starvation-induced TAG mobilization in HSD-fed flies is intact throughout the 4-week time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), the HDF response only dampens after 14 days of HSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, this suggested that while flies maintain HDF up to 10 days of HSD exposure, starting at 14 days of HSD, there is a loss of hunger response. However, an alternative hypothesis is that fatter flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) have delayed hunger perception due to the extra levels of stored energy and, therefore, a delayed need for food and would need to be starved longer to become hungry. To test this, 14-day HSD-fed flies were starved for a range of fasting times (16–32 hr) and then assayed for HDF. We observed that at 16, 24, and 32 hr of starvation, flies do not display HDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). At 24 and 32 hr of starvation, HSD-fed flies broke down 50% of their fat stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). At 24 and 32 hr, flies do not display increased feeding in response to this significant energy deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). Notably, although 5–10-day HSD-fed flies have comparable TAG levels to 14-day HSD-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), they display a robust hunger response within 16 hr of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, at 14 days of HSD exposure, even at 32 hr of starvation, when flies break down &gt;50% of TAG stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), they do not display a robust and sustained hunger response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Hence, subjecting flies to a 14-day HSD disrupts their HDF regardless of TAG stores and fasting time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Insulin resistance and lipid morphology changes at the point of HDF loss</title><p>The loss of HDF behavior after 14 days of HSD suggests that this is a critical timepoint of metabolic disruption.

To answer this, we first measured the amount of <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide 5 (Dilp5) accumulation in the brain’s insulin-producing cells (IPCs). It has been shown that Dilp5 accumulation in the IPCs directly correlates with nutritional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>); when flies experience a nutrient-rich environment, Dilp5 levels in the IPCs drop due to increased insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pasco and Léopold, 2012</xref>). Consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pasco and Léopold, 2012</xref>), we found that 14 days of HSD feeding ad libitum resulted in decreased Dilp5 accumulation in the IPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To address this, we measured the fat body’s forkhead box O (FOXO) nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Insulin signaling is activated by insulin binding to its cell surface receptor (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böhni et al., 1999</xref>). When insulin activates IR, it triggers a phosphorylation cascade of multiple downstream targets, including the transcription factor FOXO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kramer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Teleman et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of FOXO prevents it from entering the nucleus and initiating the gluconeogenic pathway, a starvation response pathway. Thus, FOXO nuclear localization has been used as a proxy to monitor insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Dong, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gross et al., 2008</xref>). Since the fat body is a major target for insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tain et al., 2021</xref>), we wondered whether increased insulin signaling in HSD led to insulin resistance. Indeed, we found that 14 days of HSD treatment resulted in elevated nuclear FOXO levels compared to the NF treatment. Notably, this effect was not seen after acute 6-hr exposure to HSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Accumulation and enlargement of lipid droplets, the cell’s lipid storage organelles, are associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).

But a prolonged 14-day exposure significantly increased TAGs and diacylglycerides (DAGs) (Figure S4A). At the same time, free fatty acids (FFAs) were surprisingly lower in HSD-fed flies than in NF (see ‘Discussion’). Intriguingly, prolonged 14-day exposure to HSD caused a significant increase in the PE and phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also observed that two other minor phospholipid classes – lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE)— are downregulated on 14-day HSD.

Conversely, fat body-specific Pect overexpression increased ApoII levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Given that the fat body is a major source of phospholipids synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palm et al., 2012</xref>), we asked whether disrupting PE and PC synthesis would impact HDF behavior in NF and HSD feeding conditions. To answer this, we knocked down key enzymes in the fat body’s PE and PC biosynthesis pathways and assessed HDF behavior in response to starvation when flies are fed NF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Note that for the starvation experiments in these UAS/Gal4 conditions, we observed lethality on a 0% sucrose diet.

We found that knocking down the PC-biosynthesis enzyme Pyct2 did not affect HDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Pect function in the adult fly adipocytes is critical for appropriate fat-to-brain lipoprotein delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the maintenance of systemic insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In sum, we identify that adipocyte-specific loss of Pect phenocopies the metabolic dysfunctions observed in a chronic HSD regime in adult flies.

This communication is facilitated by factors that provide information on nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima and Antwi, 2008</xref>). One example of such a factor is leptin, released from the adipose tissue and acts on neuronal circuits in the brain to promote satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedman and Halaas, 1998</xref>). While leptin has long been studied as a satiety hormone, recent work in mice and flies suggests that a key function of leptin and its fly homolog upd2 regulates starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Rajan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, we have previously shown that exposing flies to HSD alters synaptic contacts between Leptin/Upd2 sensing neurons and Insulin neurons. However, it resets within 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Rajan, 2020</xref>), suggesting that yet-to-be-defined mechanisms maintain homeostasis on surplus HSDs beyond 5 days.</p><p>We analyzed feeding behavior over time to delineate how HSD alters the starvation response. We found that under normal diet conditions flies display a clear response to starvation in the form of elevated feeding that we termed ‘hunger-driven feeding (HDF),’ which was independent of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, chronic exposure to HSD led to a progressive loss of HDF that began on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It could be argued that loss of HDF is simply due to an elevation of TAG storage in HSD-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus losing the need to feed on starvation. However, several pieces of evidence support the idea that HSD affects feeding behavior independently of nutrient sensing. Under our experimental conditions, we find basal feeding to be statistically similar between NF-fed and HSD-fed conditions at all timepoints with the exception of day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Note that Dus and colleagues reported that on a 20% sucrose liquid diet for 7 days elevated food interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">May et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">May et al., 2020</xref>). However, the Dus et al. studies are not comparable with our study due to the large differences in experimental protocol. They evaluated taste preference changes and feeding interactions on 5–30% sucrose liquid diet in 24-hr window over a period of 7 days. We assess food interaction in a 3-hr window, after providing a complex lab standard diet, to monitor HDF. Future studies would be needed to assess the effect of 14-day HSD on taste perception using the experimental design in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).The HDF response of HSD-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, days 3–10) is significantly lower than that of NF-fed flies, but they sense energy deficit and mobilize fat stores accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Hence, HSD-fed flies can calibrate their HDF to compensate only for the amount of fat lost in starvation. Nonetheless, this capacity of flies to couple energy sensing and feeding motivation is lost beyond day 14, as evidenced by the loss of HDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and continuous TAG breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Strikingly, subjecting 14-day HSD-fed flies to prolonged starvation (up to 32 hr) was insufficient to induce increased HDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). While there was an uptick in feeding behavior at 20 hr of starvation, this hunger response was not sustained at 24 and 32 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), even though flies continued to mobilize TAG reserves at 24 and 32 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). Thus, prolonged exposure to HSD leads to uncoupling nutrient sensing and feeding behavior.</p><p>Notably, fly and mammalian DIO models have striking differences and similarities. Mice show linear weight gain on obesogenic diets, but flies’ rigid exoskeleton limits their capacity to store TAG beyond a certain point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hatori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, similar to mammals, prolonged exposure to HSD, strongly associated with phospholipid dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anjos et al., 2019</xref>), leads to reduced insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musselman et al., 2011</xref>). We show that the levels of Dilp5, the fly’s insulin ortholog, are reduced in the IPCs of HSD-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, we do not detect a decrease in Dilp5 or Dilp2 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); this is suggestive of increased insulin secretion on HSD, similar to previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pasco and Léopold, 2012</xref>). Consistent with the idea that 14-day HSD triggers insulin resistance, we observe elevated FOXO nuclear localization in the fat bodies of the HSD-fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), despite a likely increase in Dilp5 secretion on HSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Again, these findings align with mammalian studies showing that dysregulated FOXO signaling is implicated in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gross et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>HSD and fat-specific Pect-KD cause changes to the phospholipid profile</title><p>Changes in the lipidome are strongly correlated with insulin resistance and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mousa et al., 2019</xref>). However, less is known about how the lipidome affects feeding behavior. To this end, we analyzed the lipid profiles of NF and HSD-fed flies over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, exposure to HSD increased the overall content of neutral lipids compared to the NF flies, with TAGs and DAGs increasing the most, which is consistent with other DIO models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musselman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, we noted that 14 days of HSD treatment caused a decrease in FFAs and a rise in TAGs and DAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We speculate that this reduction in FFA may be due to their involvement in TAG biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weiss et al., 1960</xref>). We were interested to see whether the decrease in FFA correlated to a particular lipid species as PE and PC are made from DAGs with specific fatty acid chains. However, further analysis of FFAs at the species level did not reveal any distinct patterns. Most FFA chains decreased in HSD, including 12.0, 16.0, 16.1, 18.0, 18.1, and 18.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This data was more suggestive of a global decrease in FFA, likely converted to TAG and DAG rather than depleting a specific fatty acid chain.</p><p>On day 14 of HSD treatment, when HDF response begins to degrade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), PE and PC levels rise dramatically, whereas LPE significantly decreases. Interestingly, similar patterns of phospholipid changes have been associated with diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anjos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2011</xref>), yet no causative relationship has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anjos et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, we find that PC balance appears dispensable for maintaining HDF-response. But both the mitochondrial and cytosolic PE pathways seem critical for HDF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Multiple pathways synthesize PE. Studies have shown that in addition to the mitochondrial PISD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steenbergen et al., 2005</xref>) and cytosolic CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calzada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birner et al., 2001</xref>), PE can be synthesized from LPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Riekhof and Voelker, 2006</xref>). This pathway is named the exogenous lysolipid metabolism (ELM) pathway. ELM can substitute for the loss of the PISD pathway in yeast and requires the activity of the enzyme lyso-PE acyltransferase (LPEAT) that converts LPE to PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riekhof et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we noted PE levels were upregulated on HSD while LPE levels were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, fat-specific Pect-KD caused PE levels to trend downward, whereas LPE was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Though the level changes for PE and LPE are contrasting between 14-day HSD lipidome and Pect-KD, under both states, there is an imbalance of phospholipids classes PE and LPE. Hence, we propose maintaining the compositional balance of phospholipid classes PE and LPE is critical to HDF and insulin sensitivity.</p><p>The role of the minor phospholipid class LPE remains obscure. Our study observes that the LPE imbalance occurs during prolonged HSD exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and when fat body Pect activity is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that LPE balance likely plays a role in insulin sensitivity and the regulation of feeding behavior. We anticipate that this observation will stimulate interest in studying this poorly understood minor phospholipid class. In future work, it would be interesting to test how the genetic interactions between the enzyme that converts LPE to PE, called LPEAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riekhof et al., 2007</xref>), and Pect manifest in HDF. Specifically, it will be interesting to ask whether reducing or increasing LPEAT will restore PE-LPE balance to improve the HDF response in HSD-fed flies and Pect-KD. Future studies should explore how LPE-PE balance can be manipulated to affect feeding behaviors.</p><p>In addition to changes in phospholipid classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we found that HSD caused an increase in the concentration of PE and PC species with double bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Double bonds create kinks in the lipid bilayer, leading to increased lipid membrane fluidity, impacting vesicle budding, endocytosis, and molecular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben M’barek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choudhary et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, a possible mechanism by which HSD induces changes to signaling by altering the membrane biophysical properties, such as by increased fluidity; this would impact various cellular processes, including synaptic firing and inter-organization vesicle transport. Consistent with this idea, we observe a significant reduction in the trafficking of ApoII-positive lipophorin particles from adipose tissue to the brain. Targeted experiments are required to understand how lipid membrane fluidity alters hunger response fully.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pect activity in fat and its impact on fat–brain communication</title><p>To explore the idea that fat–brain communication may be perturbed under HSD and Pect knockdown, we chose to examine a fat-specific signal known to travel to the brain. ApoLpp chaperones PE-rich vehicles called lipophorins traffic lipids from fat to all peripheral tissues, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palm et al., 2012</xref>). ApoII, the Apolpp fragment harboring the lipid-binding domain, has been shown to regulate systemic insulin signaling by acting on a subset of neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brankatschk et al., 2014</xref>). We found that both HSD treatment and Pect knockdown reduced ApoII levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Given that ApoII acts as a ligand for lipophorin receptors in the brain, ApoII may be a direct regulator of feeding. Alternatively, it could ferry signaling molecules and PE/PC lipids. In the future, it would be important to explore whether lipoprotein trafficking from fat-to-brain directly impacts the hunger response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have uncovered a role for the phospholipid enzyme Pect as an important component in maintaining HDF. Future work should explore the precise mechanism of how Pect and the associated disruption in phospholipid homeostasis can impact adipose tissue signaling. In sum, this study lays the groundwork for further investigation into Pyct2/Pect as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals used and rearing conditions</title><p>The following strains were used in this article: w1118, PISD-RNAi (Bloomington #67763), Pect-RNAi (Bloomington #67765), eas-RNAi (Bloomington #38528), Pcyt2-RNAi (Bloomington #67764), Lpp-Gal4 on X (P.Leopold/S. Eaton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>]), Luciferase-RNAi (FlyBase ID: JF01355), and w;;UAS-Pect III (FlyBase ID:FBal0347227, generously donated by Clandinin lab), UAS-HA-Apolopp-myc (generously donated by S. Eaton) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brankatschk and Eaton, 2010</xref>). Flies were housed in 25°C incubators. In all experiments, only adult male flies were used. Flies were sexed upon eclosion and place on normal diet, a standard diet containing 15 g yeast, 8.6 g soy flour, 63 g corn flour, 5 g agar, 5 g malt, 74 mL corn syrup per liter, for 7 days. Anesthesia using a CO<sub>2</sub> bubbler was used for initial sexing, then never used for the remainder of the experiment. After 7 days, flies were either maintained on normal diet or moved to an HSD, composed of the same composition as normal diet but with an additional 300 g of sucrose per liter (30% increase) for the length specified in the figures (typically 7 or 14 days). For measurements of HDF, a portion of flies from each diet were placed on starvation media (0% sucrose/1% agar) for 16 hr prior to the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Immunostaining of adult brains and fat bodies was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Rajan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rajan et al., 2017</xref>). Tissues were dissected in ice-cold PBS. Brains were fixed overnight in 0.8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 4°C, and fat bodies were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Following fixation, tissues were washed five times in 0.5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (PAT). Tissues were pre-blocked in PAT + 5% NDS for 2 hr at room temperature, then incubated overnight with the primary antibody in block at 4°C. Following incubation, tissues were washed five times in PAT, re-blocked for 30 min, then incubated in secondary antibody in block for 4 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed five times in PAT, then mounted on slides in Slow fade gold antifade. Primary antibodies were as follows: chicken anti-Dilp2 (1:250; this study); rabbit anti-Dilp5 (1:500; this study); rabbit anti-ApoII (1:500; this study), rabbit anti-FOXO (1:500, gift from Leopold Pierre); and mouse-anti-lamin (1:100; ADL67.10 DSHB; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_528336">AB_528336</ext-link>).

Lipid droplets were stained with lipidtox (1:500, Thermo Fisher Cat#H34477) overnight at room temperature. Images were captured with Zeiss LSM 800 confocal system and analyzed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Quantification of the number of puncta and percentage area occupied by ApoII immunofluorescence was done using ImageJ. Maximum-intensity projections of z-stacks that spanned the entire depth of the IPCs at 0.3 um intervals were generated. A region of interest was manually drawn around the IPCs and a binary mask for the ApoII channel was created using automated Moments thresholding values, which was followed by watershed postprocessing to separate particles. The number of particles and the area fraction were measured using the ‘analyze particles’ function.</p><p>All images were acquired on the same day to minimize variability among samples. The fluorescent intensity of Dilp 5 was measured using z-stack summation projections that included the full depth of the IPCs. A region of interest around the IPCs was manually drawn and the integrated density values were acquired using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). To measure nuclear FOXO accumulation, a similar number of confocal stacks were acquired for each tissue sample. For FOXO, image analysis was performed in the MATLAB R2020b environment, and the associated scripts are available at GitHub address. FOXO accumulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult fat cells was assessed by measuring the mean voxel GFP intensity in the nucleus that is delimited by the lamin antibody signal. To generate the 3D nuclear masks, lamin stacks were first maximally projected along the z-axis, and after global thresholding, basic morphological operations, and watershed transforms, the locations of the nuclear centroids in the x-y plane were used to scan the z-stacks and reconstruct the nuclear volume. The accuracy of the segmentation was assessed by manual inspection of random cells. Once the nuclear compartment was reconstructed in 3D, it was used as a volumetric mask to extract intensity values of the FOXO reporter signal and compute the mean voxel intensity in the nucleus. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of pairwise comparisons between experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lipidomics</title><p>Whole adult male flies were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen either after 7 or 14 days on normal diet or HSD. 10 flies were used per biological sample and 10 biological replicates were used for each diet and timepoint. For Pect manipulation lipidomics, LppGal4&gt;UAS-Luc-RNAi, LppGal4&gt;UAS-Luc, LppGal4&gt;UAS-Pect-RNAi, and LppGal4&gt;UAS-Pect flies were generated and flash frozen after 7 days on NF. Frozen samples were sent to the Northwest Metabolomics Research Center for targeted quantitative lipid profiling using the Sciex 5500 Lipidyzer (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2019</xref> for detailed methods).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Feeding behavior</title><p>For HDF analysis, age-matched w1118 flies were given a normal diet or HSD for 5, 7, 14, 21, 24, and 28 days after an initial 7 days of development on a normal diet. All other experiments were performed for 7-day or 14-day durations. Then, 16 hr prior to feeding behavior assessment, half of the flies from each treatment were moved to starvation media 0%. During the 3-hr assessment window of feeding behavior, individual flies were placed in a single well of FLIC and supplied with a 5% sucrose liquid diet for all FLIC experiments. For feeding behavior involving Gal4&gt;UAS manipulation, a 1% sucrose agar diet was substituted for the 0% sucrose agar 16 hr starvation to avoid fly death. Detailed methods for how FLIC operates can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ro et al., 2014</xref>. Fly feeding was measured for the first 3 hr in the FLIC, and all FLICs were performed at 10 am local time. For each FLIC, half of the wells (n = 6/FLIC) contained the fed group, and the other half contained the starved group of flies for direct comparison. A total of 12–30 flies were measured for analysis of feeding. Any signal above 40 (a.u.) was considered a feeding event. Analysis of feeding events was performed using R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Triglyceride measurement</title><p>Whole-body TAG measurements were performed in accordance with previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rajan et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, whole flies (n = 3) were used per biological replicate with 8–9 replicates used for each timepoint and treatment. Flies were collected for TAG for all timepoints and treatments measured for feeding behavior (see above). Data was normalized to TAG levels per number of flies. Significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Survival assay</title><p>Survival curves were performed using flies harvested in a 24-hr time frame and aged for 7 days, then subjected to either normal lab food or HSD. Ten males per vial were flipped onto 1% sucrose agar starvation food. The number of dead flies was recorded each day until every fly had died. Flies were kept in a 25°C incubator with a 12 hr light–dark cycle for the entirety of the experiment. Survival analysis was performed using the Survival Curve module of GraphPad Prism. A Mantel–Cox test was used to determine statistical significance. Greater than 90 flies were used per condition per curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene expression</title><p>Thirty fly fat bodies (for Pect) or heads (for Dilps) of each genotype were dissected in RNAlater. Immediately after dissection, fat bodies were moved to tubes of 200 µL RNAlater on ice.

Your article has been reviewed by the same 3 peer reviewers that initially reviewed your work at Review Commons, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>The reviewers were very positive and reassured by the lipidomics data clarifying the relationship between Pect levels, phospholipid levels, and HSD. However, the major concern remains: the manuscript does not have sufficient support for the model that hunger signals are indeed disrupted by Pect manipulations. An alternative hypothesis is still possible, that fatter flies have delayed hunger perception due to the extra levels of stored energy and, therefore, a delayed need for food, and would need to be starved longer in order to become hungry. For this reason, we are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that at this time this work will not be considered for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. However, due to the excitement about a potential molecular mechanism of hunger response, if the major concern can be addressed, we would be happy to reconsider this decision.</p><p>Specifically, one of the experimental suggestions from one of the reviewers is &quot;to test a range of fasting times. Knowing that the authors' have affected 'hunger driven feeding' regardless of fasting time would be impressive. I would also suggest doing a simple starvation resistance experiment.&quot; If results show that indeed there is no difference in the hunger-driven response and that it's all due to differences in energy stores, we would not be as excited to reconsider the work. If, on the other hand, levels of energy stores are uncoupled from this response, we would be enthusiastic to revisit this work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fat Body Phospholipid State Dictates Hunger Driven Feeding Behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by David James (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed in the text, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The new starvation survival data is inconsistent with previous literature showing that higher sugar diets lead to fatter flies and increased starvation resistance. This could be due to differences in the experimental setup (survival on 1% sucrose/agar versus agar alone). This experiment is therefore not easy to interpret since it is not clear how much of the 1% sucrose the flies are consuming. We suggest that you remove Figure S1B and the corresponding text since the data should not be interpreted as showing that HSD flies are &quot;starvation&quot; sensitive, as they have access to 1% sucrose.</p><p>2) Note that for the hunger/feeding measurements after &quot;starvation&quot;, the Methods state that sometimes flies were starved for 16 hr on &quot;0% sucrose liquid diet&quot; (is this just water?- please clarify), and sometimes they were &quot;starved&quot; for 16 hr on &quot;1% sucrose&quot;. Please ensure these different approaches are clear when presenting the data and the data are interpreted in the right context (of full starvation (0% sucrose liquid diet) or low-calorie sugar diet (1% sucrose).</p><p>3) Please cite PMID: 31067455 and PMID: 32539934, AND discuss your data in the context of their findings on how high sugar diets affect sweet taste perception and satiation. While the manuscript is cited, we'd like to have you include in the discussion how their results (e.g. 7 days on HSD significantly increased feeding via the FLIC assay, the same technique used in this manuscript) fits with what you describe here. Specifically discuss, why you think you don't see this same increase in feeding with your chronic HSD?</p><p>4) The feeding assay used in this manuscript- FLIC assay- does not actually measure food intake. Rather, it measures how often the fly touches the food. PMID: 31067455 and PMID: 32539934 called them &quot;licks&quot; in their manuscript. Since it is well established from several labs (e.g., Dus, Neely) that chronic HSD decreases taste sensitivity to sugar. We suggest adding this caveat to the Discussion: &quot;It's not clear how food interactions (and therefore measurements using the FLIC assay) are affected by sweet taste sensitivity, which is known to be altered by chronic HSD. Future studies might…&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We are very grateful for this reviewer identifying this this methods description error and bring it to our attention. We used 0% sucrose agar for overnight starvation in this study as most labs do.

This is surprising because not only, as authors mention, is increased PC32.2 with HSD suggests lower Pect activity, but also because Pect RNAi phenocopies long-term HSD in HDF behavior, lipid morphology, FOXO accumulation in fat body. The authors speculate that the data &quot;likely shown an upregulation in an attempt to mediate the Pect dysregulation occurring at the protein level.&quot; If that were true, a western blot may be informative. Zhao and Wang (2020, PLoS Genetics) generated a Pect antibody that seems compatible with western blot applications. That being said, I don't think such data is critical for the manuscript. I mention this simply as a suggestion for the authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. page 8, line 22-23, did you mean to write &quot;Given how PC32.2 is elevated after 14 days of exposure to HSD, we assumed that Pect levels would be low for flies under HSD,&quot; not &quot;high?&quot; Otherwise the subsequent 2 sentences don't make sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the most confusing aspect of the study was that Pect mRNA levels being very high on Day 14 HSD, but nonetheless the effects of Pect-KD phenocopied HSD. To resolve this, we have now performed lipidomic analyses on whole adult flies, when Pect is knocked-down (KD) by RNAi in the fat tissue.

Hence, we propose that maintaining the compositional balance of phospholipid classes PE and LPE is critical to hunger-driven feeding and insulin sensitivity. Hence, either increase or decrease, of these key phospholipid species, may lead to abnormal hunger-driven feeding.</p><p>We agree that a western blot would be informative as well, but we were unable to obtain the reagent from Dr. Wang’s group, precluding us from performing this request.</p><p>To ensure that we appropriately discuss and clarify this issue, we have now included a section in the discussion – Page 14 Lines 26-34- under the subtitle “<italic>The implications of relationship between Pect levels and HSD</italic>”.

Hence, we speculate that an increased ‘basal’ level of Pect such as by that provided by a cDNA over-expression in fat, may be protective to the negative effects of HSD (Figure 7B) without affecting overall phospholipid levels (Figure S9), but extreme upregulation Pect on HSD affects the PE and LPE balance (Figure 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The work is potentially novel and interesting, but at this stage it's difficult to interpret what the phenotype signifies.

We hope that by reviewing our non-normalized data, they can appreciate that it is the former. Also, we hope that Reviewer #1 appreciates that we have strived to address the concerns by additional experiments, to clarify our findings and improve the impact of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This intriguing manuscript by Kelly and colleagues uses the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> melanogaster as a model to understand how diet-induced obesity alters the feeding response over time. In particular, the authors findings indicate that chronic exposure to a high-sugar diet significantly alters the starvation-induced feeding response. These behavioral studies are complemented by a lipidomics approach that reveals how a chronic high sugar affects many lipid species, including phospholipids. The authors then pursue mechanistic studies that indicate phospholipid metabolism within the fat body appears to remotely affect insulin secretion from the insulin producing cells. Moreover, the changes in phospholipid abundance are associated with changes in insulin-signaling, including increased insulin secretion from the IPCs and elevated levels of FOXO within the nucleus.</p><p>I find the study to be potentially very important – the authors combine a longitudinal study that would be difficult in any other model with the powerful genetic tools available in the fly. The conclusions are mostly convincing, but a few follow-up experiments are required:</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewers constructive, detail-oriented, and balanced feedback, and their recognition of the value of this study. Now, we have performed additional experiments to address the key concerns raised by all reviewers. We hope that on reading the revised version of our study, that the reviewer continues to feel positive about the message of this study and its potential impact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The key conclusions from the manuscript assume that manipulation of Pect expression levels alters phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels. However, the authors make no attempt to verify that the genetic experiments described herein actually affect PE levels. At a minimum, changes in PE levels should be verified for the Pect knockdown and overexpression lines. Similarly, there is no evidence that manipulation of either EAS or Pcyt2 induces the expected metabolic effects. I'm not asking that the longitudinal feeding experiments be repeated, simply that the authors measure the relevant lipid species, preferably with a targeted LC-MS approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by this reviewer, we performed targeted LC-MS on whole adult flies, on normal diet, to assess lipid levels for fat-specific Pect-KD and overexpression. We decided to focus on Pect, as its knock-down even on normal diet causes a dampened hunger-driven feeding behavior (Figure 7A) and phenocopied a 14-day HSD feeding phenotype.</p><p>We now present a new dataset in Figure 6. Two striking changes occur:</p><p>They are:</p><p>i) Pect-KD shows a significant reduction in specific class of PE 36.2 (Figure 6B). Our data regarding decrease in PE 36.2 agree with a previous lipidomic analyses of Pect mutant retina (PMID: 30737130). It is to be noted that though overall levels of all PE species trend downwards, like the Clandinin lab study on Pect (PMID: 30737130), we did not find a significant change in the overall PC and PE levels.</p><p>ii) Pect-KD shows increase in the phospholipid classes LPC and LPE (Figure 6A). In contrast, LPE is significantly downregulated on HSD Day 14 (Figure 3).</p><p>On 14-day HSD consistent with extreme upregulation of Pect mRNA fed flies (Figure S6A; Pect mRNA 200-250 fold), PE trends upwards on 14-day HSD (Figure 3) and PE 36.2 trends higher (Figure S7C). We note that on the surface of it PE and LPE <italic>per se</italic> are contrasting between 14day HSD lipidome and fat-specifc Pect-KD. But there is a significant commonality that under both states there is an imbalance of phospholipids classes PE and LPE. Hence, we propose that maintaining the compositional balance of phospholipid classes PE and LPE is critical to hunger-driven feeding and insulin sensitivity. Hence, either increase or decrease, of these key phospholipid species, may lead to abnormal hunger-driven feeding.</p><p>Finally, fat-specific Pect-OE did not cause significant changes to lipid species (Figure S9). This could either be due to the fact that in fat-specific Pect-OE flies under normal food and that we were assaying whole body lipid levels and not fat-specific lipid changes. But to counter that, even a 60% reduction in Pect mRNA levels (Figure S6A), was sufficient to produce an effect on whole body phospholipid balance (Figure 6). Hence, we speculate that by maintaining a basally higher (7-fold higher Pect mRNA level Figure S6A), might allow 14-day HSD-fed flies to buffer the negative effects of HSD and we predict that it might take longer to disrupt the phospholipid balance and HDF response.</p><p>We have now included a section in the discussion – Page 14 Lines 26-34- under the subtitle “The implications of relationship between Pect levels and HSD”. We have pasted an excerpt from that subsection below for this reviewers assessment.</p><p>“Also, we note that over-expression of Pect cDNA in the fat-body does not alter phospholipid balance (Figure S9) and indeed improves HDF on HSD (Figure 7B).

However, given that dFOXO nuclear localization rather than expression levels regulate insulin sensitivity, we feel that disrupting dFOXO levels via mutation or knockdown will produce a plethora of indirect effects including developmental abnormalities (PMID: 24778227, PMID: 16179433, PMID: 29180716, PMID: 12893776). Our data suggest that chronic HSD treatment and Pect affect insulin sensitivity in fat tissue.

We agree that the data we presented and discussed in the original version is at the moment speculative. Addressing the hypothesis that increase in unsaturated fatty acid species result in a more fluid lipid environment will require us to build tools and expertise. Hence, this hypothesis is better suited for exploration in a future study. Given this, we have moved this out of the Results section into the Discussion section titled “<italic>HSD and fat-specific PECT-KD causes changes to phospholipid profile</italic>” (See excerpt below from page 13, lines 24-35).</p><p>“In addition to changes in phospholipid classes, we found that HSD caused an increase in the concentration of PE and PC species with double bonds (Figure S4C and S4D). Double bonds create kinks in the lipid bilayer, leading to increased lipid membrane fluidity which impacts vesicle budding, endocytosis, and molecular transport<sup>14,92</sup>. Hence it is possible that a mechanism by which HSD induces changes to signaling is by altering the membrane biophysical properties, such as by increased fluidity, which would have a significant impact on numerous biological processes including synaptic firing and inter-organ vesicle transport.”</p><p>Also, as per the reviewer’s guidance, given that we are speculating here, we have also shifted this dataset from Main figure 4 to supplement S4C and S4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, lines 25-30 state that FFAs are increased after 14 days of a HSD. Figure 3A shows the exact opposite – FFAs are significantly decreased in 14 day fed animals despite being elevated in the 7 day fed animals. This is an interesting result that warrants discussion. Moreover, I would encourage to examine the lipidomic data more carefully to ensure that the text accurately portrays the lipid profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for misstating that FFAs are decreased on 14-day HSD in the lines 25-30. It was an error and we have corrected this. We agree with the reviewer that the reduction of FFA on Day 14-HSD is an intriguing and unexpected observation that needs to be emphasized and further discussed. To this end, we have added figure S4B, wherein we have provided the difference in FFA concentration (by species) after days 7 and 14.</p><p>Furthermore, we have discussed what the potential meaning of reduced FFA at Day 14 implies in page 12, lines 19-27 of the Discussion section titled “<italic>HSD and fat-specific PECT-KD causes changes to phospholipid profile</italic>”. We have stated the following-</p><p>“We speculate that this reduction in FFA maybe due to their involvement in TAG biogenesis (PMID: 13843753). We were interested to see if the decrease in FFA correlated to a particular lipid species, as PE and PC are made from DAGs with specific fatty acid chains. However, further analysis of FFAs at the species level did not reveal any distinct patterns.

The authors first demonstrate that chronic exposure (14 days) of high sugar diet (HSD) suppresses HDF response. Through lipidome analysis, the authors identify a specific class of lipids to be elevated upon chronic HSD feeding. This coincided with the changes in expression of Pect, an enzyme that regulates the biosynthesis of these lipids. Modulating the expression of Pect specifically in the fat body affected HDF response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for their rigorous and thoughtful critique and for identifying a key issue with our original study pertaining to a gap in how Pect mRNA levels on 14-day HSD are elevated but the Pect-KD phenocopies the HDF. Now by performing whole-body adult fly lipidomic on fat-specific Pect-KD we have resolved this issue and provided clarity on role of Pect in maintaining phospholipid homeostasis and thus subsequently impacts hunger-driven feeding. We hope the reviewer finds that the revised manuscript provides further clarity to the functional link between Pect’s role in fat-body and hunger-driven feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>The author claim that the HDF response in HSD is distinct between early (5d, 7d) and chronic (day 14) HSD feeding. However, the data seem to indicate that HDF response is significantly decreased at all time points in HSD. For example, at day 5 HDF response was increased only 3fold in HSD (Figure 1C) compared to around 50-fold increase in NF (Figure 1B). The scale of the Y-axis in Figure 1B and 1C is an order of magnitude different. Including the starved data (NFstv and HSDstv) in Figure S1, normalized to NF fed group, would better visualize the overall trends. Related to this, having the source data for the actual number of feeding events would be useful (e.g., to see the baseline changes in feeding in different time points in Figure 1 and the effect of genetic manipulations in Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewers request, we now have modified our graphs to show source data (Figure S1) and show the raw feeding events.</p><p>Then in the non-normalized graphs we plot, over a longitudinal time course, baseline and hunger-driven feeding events (Figure 1B-D). We also show that HSD fed flies do not display increased baseline feeding (Figure 1D) suggesting that the effect we see on HDF are no clouded by increased baseline feeding.</p><p>Yes, the reviewer makes an important point that HDF response on HSD fed flies is of a lower magnitude than NF fed flies. We think that is a biologically meaningful observation, as it suggests that flies have a remarkably fine-tuned ability to coordinate food-intake with nutrient store levels.</p><p>Now we have included a paragraph in the Discussion, Page 11 Lines 23-27, that say the following to ensure the readers appreciate this salient point raised by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is to be noted that the HDF response of HSD-fed flies (Figure 1C, Days 3-10) is of lower order of magnitude than the NF-fed flies. This suggests that in addition to sensing an energy deficit and mobilizing fat stores (Figure 1F, 1G, S1), HSD fed flies calibrate their starvation-induced feeding to compensate only for the lost amount of fat. Overall, this suggests that flies have a remarkably finetuned ability to coordinate food-intake with nutrient store levels.</p><p>The association between fat body Pect level and phospholipid levels is not clear. Day 14 of HSD feeding shows high expression of Pect in the fat body and elevated levels of PC32.0 and PC32.2. The authors assume the high expression of Pect in the fat body is due to the compensatory response, but there are no data indicating downregulation of Pect levels at the earlier time points of HSD feeding. A previous study demonstrated that Pect mutant flies have lower levels of PC32.0 but higher PC32.2 (PMID: 30737130).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that one puzzling aspect of the original version of this study was that Pect mRNA levels being very high on Day 14 HSD, but nonetheless the effects of Pect-KD phenocopied HSD. To resolve this, prompted by Reviewer #2 and #3 concerns, for this revised version we have now performed lipidomic analyses on whole adult flies, when Pect is knocked down (KD) by RNAi in the fat tissue. We now present a new dataset in Figure 6. Two striking changes occu. They are:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Pect-KD shows increase in the phospholipid classes LPC and LPE (Figure 6A). In contrast, LPE is significantly downregulated on HSD Day 14 (Figure 3).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pect-KD shows a significant reduction in specific class of PE 36.2 (Figure 6B). Our data regarding increase in PE 36.2 agree with a previous lipidomic analyses of Pect mutant retina (PMID: 30737130). In contrast, PE 36.2 trends upwards on 14 day HSD (Figure S7C) though not significantly.</p></list-item></list><p>On 14-day HSD consistent with extreme upregulation of Pect mRNA fed flies (Figure S6A; Pect mRNA 200-250 fold), PE trends upwards on 14-day HSD (Figure 3) and PE 36.2 trends higher (Figure S7C). We note that on the surface of it PE and LPE <italic>per se</italic> are contrasting between 14day HSD lipidome and fat-specifc Pect-KD. But there is a significant commonality that under both states there is an imbalance of phospholipids classes PE and LPE. Hence, we propose that maintaining the compositional balance of phospholipid classes PE and LPE is critical to hunger-driven feeding and insulin sensitivity. Hence, either increase or decrease, of these key phospholipid species, may lead to abnormal hunger-driven feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On day 14, HDF response was increased 70-fold in w1118 flies in NF (Figure 1B; w1118), but only 2.5-fold in lpp&gt;LucRNAi control flies in NF (Figure 7A). This suggests that lpp-gal4 driver lines have a significant effect on HDF response. Using a different fat-body specific Gal4 line would be necessary to validate conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Regards reduced HDF magnitude, in our experience using UAS-Gal4 reduces HDF response magnitude consistently and cannot be compared to <italic>w1118</italic> which is more robust. To account for background differences, we use Uas-Gal4 with control RNAi. It clearly shows differences in HDF response on starvation, but Pect and Pisd RNAi does not (Figure 7A). Hence, given that this experiment internally controls for any changes in HDF response for UAS-Gal4&gt;RNAi, we conclude that HDF response in disrupted in Pect and PISD KD (Figure 7).</p><p>We only presented the Lpp-driver in our study, as this driver is the only fat-specific driver that has no leaky expression in other tissues, and is specific to fat as apolpp promoter used to generate this Gal4 line is only expressed in fat tissue (Eaton and colleagues, PMID: 22844248). Other widely used fat-specific drivers, including the pumpless-Gal4 (<italic>ppl-Gal4</italic>) driver has leaky expression in gut or other tissues (See Table 2 of this detailed study by Dr. Drummond- Barbosa <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642949/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642949/</ext-link>). If the reviewer is aware of a fat-specific Gal4 line, other than Lpp-Gal4, which has a highly specific expression in the fat tissue without leaky expression in other tissues, then we are happy to take onboard the reviewer’s suggestion and try that fat-specific Gal4 that they suggest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>HSD feeding promotes Pect expression (Figure S3C) and global changes in phospholipid levels (Figure 3, 4). Therefore, shouldn't Pect overexpression (not Pect RNAi) in a normal diet mimic HSD feeding state and promote loss of HDF response? Conversely shouldn't knockdown of Pect in HSD rescue loss of HDF response?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a puzzling aspect is that Pect mRNA levels are significantly elevated in HSD Day-14, but Pect-KD showed displays the inappropriate HDF response. As we have described in our response to this reviewer on Page 19, we believe that Pect-KD and HSD disrupt PE and LPE balance overall but in different ways. Whereas Pect-OE using cDNA expression in fat body does not cause a significant change to any lipid class (Figure S9), and our results suggest that basally higher level of PECT is likely to be protective on HSD with respect to HDF (Figure 7B).</p><p>To ensure that we appropriately discuss and clarify this issue, we have now included a section in the discussion – Page 14 Lines 26-33- under the subtitle “The implications of relationship between Pect levels and HSD”. We have pasted an excerpt from that subsection below for this reviewers assessment. 5 “Also, we note that over-expression of Pect cDNA in the fat-body does not alter phospholipid balance (Figure S9) and indeed improves HDF on HSD (Figure 7B). While this may appear inconsistent, it is critical to note that over-expression of Pect cDNA using UAS/Gal4 only increases Pect mRNA expression by 7-fold (Figure S6A), whereas HSD causes its upregulation by 250-fold (Figure S6B). Hence, we speculate that an increased ‘basal’ level of Pect such as by that provided by a cDNA over-expression in fat, may be protective to the negative effects of HSD (Figure 7B) without affecting overall phospholipid levels (Figure S9), but extreme upregulation Pect on HSD affects the PE and LPE balance (Figure 3).”</p><p>We would have liked to test Pect protein expression on HSD, but since we were unable to access antibodies for Pect published in a prior study (PMID: 33064773) from Dr. Wang’s lab (see Page 10-11, of response to Reviewer #1). Hence, we were unable to test how the proteins levels of Pect correlate with the 250-fold increase mRNA expression.</p><p>In conclusion, we hope the reviewer appreciates that our results regarding Pect function are consistent with the main conclusion that achieving the right phospholipid balance between PE and LPE, is critical for an organism to display an appropriate HDF response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>All graphs should plot individual data points and showed as box and whisker plot as much as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion, we have added individual data points to the vast majority of figures in the paper.

An alternative hypothesis is still possible, that fatter flies have delayed hunger perception due to the extra levels of stored energy and, therefore, a delayed need for food, and would need to be starved longer in order to become hungry. For this reason, we are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that at this time this work will not be considered for publication by eLife.

We assayed the hungerdriven feeding of all the starvation time points against the baseline 14-day HSD-fed in the same FLIC run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). We observed that at 20 hours after starvation, flies display a short burst of feeding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). However, by 24 hours and 32 hours, they do not show increased feeding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). At 24 and 32 hours of starvation, these flies broke down 50% of their fat stores, which is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, 1C). NF-fed flies break down 50% of their fat stores by the 16hour time point, sufficient for them to display hunger-driven feeding (See Figure 1 of our manuscript). Hence, even though 14-day HSD-fed flies use up a significant portion of their energy stores at 24-32 hours, they do not display hunger-driven feeding. A linear regression analysis between feeding events and TAG levels suggests that TAG store levels and feeding events do not show any significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>).

This could be due to differences in the experimental setup (survival on 1% sucrose/agar versus agar alone). This experiment is therefore not easy to interpret since it is not clear how much of the 1% sucrose the flies are consuming. We suggest that you remove Figure S1B and the corresponding text since the data should not be interpreted as showing that HSD flies are &quot;starvation&quot; sensitive, as they have access to 1% sucrose.</p></disp-quote><p>We note your concern on the 0% vs 1% sucrose diets. 1. In standard lab conditions, flies live only a short 32-36 hours on 0% sucrose diets. In our experience, evaluating these short 0% starvation curves are unreliable. Hence, we and others have used 1% sucrose diets to analyze starvation response curves (PMID: 29017032; 23021220), since they allow flies to live for up to 15 days. Since the original email did not specify that these curves must be performed on non-standard 0% diet. we performed what is standard in the field for starvation curves i.e., 1% sucrose diet. Again, we feel that inclusion of this data is important, and is in response to a reviewer request.
