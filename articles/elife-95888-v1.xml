TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <italic>Tmc7</italic> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transmembrane channel-like proteins</kwd><kwd>acrosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>spermiogenesis</kwd><kwd>TMC proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Chunhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82301801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Junchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82303055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zixiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Fundation of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2023MC067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments on mice show that TMC7, a transmembrane channel-like protein, localizes to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi region in spermatids and that this is essential for acrosome biogenesis and male fertility.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermiogenesis is the post-meiotic phase of male germ cell development during which the haploid spermatids differentiate into mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kang et al., 2022</xref>). Mouse spermiogenesis consists of 16 steps characterized by morphological changes in acrosome formation, nuclear condensation and elongation, flagellum formation, and cytoplasm removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Acrosome biogenesis is one of the key events of spermiogenesis, and it begins with the initial stage of spermatid development. The acrosome is a specialized organelle with a cap-like structure covering the anterior part of the mature spermatozoon head and is indispensable for the fertilization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>). Although acrosome biogenesis is thought to be derived from the Golgi complex in early spermatids, growing evidence suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes are involved in acrosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khawar et al., 2019</xref>). Defects in acrosome biogenesis can result in subfertility or infertility.</p><p>Acrosome biogenesis is generally classified into four successive phases, namely the Golgi, cap, acrosome, and maturation phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). A number of ER and Golgi-associated proteins have been shown to be involved in acrosome biogenesis. Heat shock protein 90B1 (HSP90B1) is an ER molecular chaperone that has been shown to be a testis-specific protein, and HSP90B1 deficiency leads to a globozoospermia-syndrome like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audouard and Christians, 2011</xref>). GM130 (Golgi matrix protein 130) localize on the <italic>cis</italic> surface of the Golgi apparatus, and loss of GM130 causes acrosome malformations and results in male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Han et al., 2017</xref>). GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing) is a <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi-associated protein that plays a role in vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus. GOPC deficiency leads to vesicle transport failure, which in turn results in malformation of the acrosome and to infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yao et al., 2002</xref>). Other vesicle transport proteins including PICK1, ICA1l, and VPS13b are involved in proacrosomal vesicle trafficking during acrosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">He et al., 2015</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that autophagy is involved in proacrosomal vesicle fusion and transport to form the acrosome, and disruption of ATG7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2021</xref>) or ATG5 causes aberrant acrosome formation and male infertility or subfertility. Despite these findings, further studies are needed to better understand the complexity of acrosome biogenesis.</p><p>Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are highly conserved ion channel-like proteins, with eight family members (TMC1âTMC8) identified in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keresztes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kurima et al., 2002</xref>). TMC proteins are predicted to have 6â10 transmembrane domains, and all protein members contain a conserved 120 amino acid TMC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yue et al., 2019</xref>). The single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure shows that TMC1 assembles as dimers and that each monomer contains 10 transmembrane domains with four domains (S4âS7) that line the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Tmc1 and 2 are mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channels in cochlear hair cells, and mutations in <italic>Tmc1/2</italic> cause deafness in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nist-Lund et al., 2019a</xref>) by disrupting hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction, and <italic>Tmc</italic> gene therapy can restore auditory function and balance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Askew et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nist-Lund et al., 2019b</xref>). Germline mutations in <italic>Tmc6</italic> and <italic>Tmc8</italic> are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which leads to increased susceptibility to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yue et al., 2019</xref>). Among the eight TMC protein members, TMC1 and TMC2 are well studied due to their role in hearing conduction, and understanding the physiological and functional roles of other TMC family members remains a major challenge.</p><p>In this study, we found that <italic>Tmc7</italic> begins to be expressed in diplotene spermatocytes and that it is expressed at high levels in round spermatids in mouse testes. By generating <italic>Tmc7</italic> conventional knockout mice (<italic>Tmc7<sup>â/â</sup></italic>), we demonstrate that TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the acrosome, thus resulting in male infertility with an oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) phenotype. Our findings provide new insights into the physiological role of TMC family members in spermiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Tmc7</italic> expression is confined to the testis, and deletion of <italic>Tmc7</italic> leads to male infertility</title><p>To explore the roles of <italic>Tmc</italic> family members during spermatogenesis, we analyzed the expression of <italic>Tmc1âTmc8</italic> using the mouse developmental transcriptome (E-MTAB-6798) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>).

However, TMC1 and TMC2 expressed in heterologous cell lines remain in the ER and fail to localize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nist-Lund et al., 2019a</xref>). TMC4 is a voltage-dependent chloride channel that is predominantly expressed in the taste buds in the posterior region of the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kasahara et al., 2021</xref>). TMC6 and TMC8 are localized to the ER and play crucial roles in zinc transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lazarczyk et al., 2008</xref>). However, the physiological function of TMC7 has not been defined. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Tmc7</italic> was predominantly expressed in testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and by generating knockout mice lacking TMC7 we found that TMC7 deficiency resulted in complete male infertility with an OAT-like phenotype. <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>â/â</sup>mice showed various defects, such as abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids. Interestingly, we found that TMC7 colocalized with GM130, but not with TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), as illustrated by the immunofluorescence co-staining assay, indicating that TMC7 located on the <italic>cis</italic> side of the Golgi apparatus.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the critical role of TMC7 during the formation of the acrosome. The acrosome is thought to be derived from the Golgi apparatus, so we speculated that TMC7 deficiency might cause defects in acrosome formation because TMC7 localized on the Golgi apparatus. We observed fragmented and malformed acrosomes and proacrosomal vesicles were found to accumulate around the acrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, TMC1 deficiency leads to membrane blebbing and PS externalization at the apical region of hair cells. TMC1 is not only an ion channel but also a lipid scramblase, which is required to maintain homeostasis in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesteros and Swartz, 2022</xref>). TMC7 has similar amino acid sequence and predicted structure with TMC1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting TMC7 might function as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel. Further investigations are required to verify the potential functions of TMC7 as a lipid scramblase and an ion channel in spermatid.</p><p>In accordance with our findings, other proteins that localize on the Golgi apparatus have also been reported to be involved in acrosome biogenesis. GM130 deficiency results in acrosome biogenesis failure and male infertility because proacrosomal vesicles are unable to fuse to form acrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lazarczyk et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings showed that TMC7 was colocalized with GM130 and that TMC7 depletion significantly reduced the protein level of GM130. Importantly, colocalized GOPC and PNA spermatids were significantly decreased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>â/â</sup> spermatids compared to WT spermatids. Further, GOLGA3, PICK1, and several other Golgi proteins are also required for acrosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>). Our work, combined with previous studies, broadens our understanding of role the Golgi apparatus plays in the formation of acrosomes.</p><p>Our findings highlight the role of TMC7 in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Upon TMC7 depletion, the Golgi apparatus undergoes significant disorganization and is unable to correctly orient toward the acrosome. The mechanism behind this is that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations decreased while the pH value was increased in <italic>Tmc7</italic><sup>â/â</sup> germ cells compared to WT germ cells, suggesting that TMC7 is essential for maintaining the intracellular pH and ion homeostasis. Our findings further revealed that TMC7 deficiency led to increased ROS levels, Golgi and ER stress, ultimately resulting in apoptosis of spermatids. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE8 is involved in the maintenance of intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, and NHE8 deficiency leads to Golgi-derived vesicles failing to form large acrosomal granules and the acrosomal cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oberheide et al., 2017</xref>). SLC9A3 is another Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, and it is expressed in the acrosomal region of spermatids and loss of SLC9A3 causes severe acrosomal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These studies, together with our current findings, support the hypothesis that TMC7 is essential for maintaining the intracellular pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for the proper progression of acrosome biogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings show that TMC7 localizes to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi region in spermatids and that this is essential for acrosome biogenesis and for male fertility. In the absence of TMC7, intracellular pH and ion homeostasis is disrupted, and this leads to Golgi disorganization and failure to correctly orientate to the acrosome. Subsequently, Golgi-derived proacrosomal vesicles are unable to fuse with the developing acrosome and acrosome biogenesis is severely impaired, and thus TMC7-deficent male mice are completely infertile. Our study highlights the physiological role of TMC family members in spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Tmc7</italic> knockout mice</title><p><italic>Tmc7</italic> conventional knockout mice in the C57BL/6J background were obtained from Cyagen Bioscience (China).

TMC7 belongs to a family of transmembrane channel-like proteins (TMC1-8), primarily known for their role in the ear. Mutations to TMC1/2 are linked to deafness in humans and mice and were originally characterized as auditory mechanosensitive ion channels. However, the function of the other TMC family members remains poorly characterized. In this study, the authors begin to elucidate the function of TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. Through analysis of transcriptomics datasets, they elevated levels of TMC7 in round spermatids in both mouse and human testis. They then generate Tmc7-/- mice and find that male mice exhibit smaller testes and complete infertility. Examination of different developmental stages reveals spermatogenesis defects, including with reduced sperm count, elongated spermatids and large vacuoles. Additionally, abnormal acrosome morphology are observed beginning at the early-stage Golgi phase, indicating TMC7's involvement in proacrosomal vesicle trafficking and fusion. They observed localization of TMC7 in the cis-Golgi and suggest that its presence is required for maintaining Golgi integrity, with Tmc7-/- leading to reduced intracellular Ca2+, elevated pH and increased ROS levels, likely resulting in spermatid apoptosis. Overall, the work delineates a new function of TMC7 in spermatogenesis and the authors propose that its ion channel and/or scramblase activity is likely important for Golgi homeostasis. This work is of significant interest to the community and is of high quality.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The biggest strength of the paper is the phenotypic characterization of the TMC7-/- mouse model, which has clear acrosome biogenesis/spermatogenesis defects.
