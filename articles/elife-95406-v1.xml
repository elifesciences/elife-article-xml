Forebrain OLs arise from multiple embryonic origins. Previous fate-mapping study using <italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Gsh2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>) reported consecutive and competing waves of OLs derived from medial ganglionic eminence/preoptic area (MGE/POA), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE), and dorsal pallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>). The first wave of OLs generated by MGE/POA (<sub>MP</sub>OLs) was believed to be eliminated postnatally, while those from the second and third waves (<sub>LC</sub>OLs and dOLs) survive and populate the cortex and corpus callosum at comparable proportions. Several other studies provided both supporting and contradicting evidence to this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Nakahira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tsoa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Naruse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Orduz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tripathi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Winkler et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Gsh2</italic> was recently found to be expressed in dorsal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), casting doubt on the interpretation of lineage tracing data from <italic>Gsh2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>.</p><p>In this study, we generated new genetic tools and combinatorial fate-mapping strategies which allow direct visualization and comparison among OLs derived from different origins. We found that neocortical OLs are primarily composed of dOLs, rather than similar proportions of <sub>LC</sub>OLs and dOLs. In contrast, <sub>LC</sub>OLs and dOLs made comparable contributions to piriform cortex. We also found that although <sub>MP</sub>OLs only make a small contribution, they do persist in the cortex beyond adulthood with a unique spatial pattern distinct from that of the dOLs. In the two major white matter commissure tracts, dOLs are the vast majority in corpus callosum but make little contribution to anterior commissure, while <sub>LC</sub>OLs behaved the opposite. These findings significantly revised the classical view and provided a new and more comprehensive picture of cortical and white matter OL origins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To unambiguously track OLs from different embryonic origins, we first generated a knock-in driver, <italic>Opalin<sup>P2A-Flpo-T2A-tTA2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), orthogonal to Cre drivers that label dorsal or ventral progenitors (<italic>Progenitor<sup>Cre</sup></italic>). <italic>Opalin</italic> (also known as <italic>Tmem10</italic>) encodes oligodendrocytic myelin paranodal and inner loop protein that are specifically expressed in differentiated OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kippert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yoshikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Marques et al., 2016</xref>).

Flp-mediated recombination by this driver (hereinafter referred to as <italic>Opalin<sup>Flp</sup></italic> for simplicity) enables highly specific, efficient, and irreversible OL labeling, while the tTA2 component offers the flexibility for OL-specific labeling in tunable densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A new driver mouse for efficient and specific oligodendrocyte (OL) labeling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for generating the <italic>Opalin<sup>P2A-Flpo-T2A-tTA2</sup></italic> allele.

To better assess their contributions to the total OL population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we co-stained RFP with the mature OL marker aspartoacylase (ASPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Huang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>) and quantified the ratio of co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, all RFP+ cells are ASPA+, reassured the specificity of our label strategies. We observed two significant differences from the traditional model in the neocortex. The first major deviation is that, instead of comparable contributions by dOLs and <sub>LC</sub>OLs, the vast majority of neocortical OLs were dOLs but not <sub>LC</sub>OLs. The densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>) and ASPA ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) of dOLs are much higher than those of <sub>LC</sub>OLs. Considering the possibility of incomplete recombination in combinatorial reporters, and the relatively low Cre activity in the dorsal MGE of <italic>Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), the genuine contribution of <sub>LC</sub>OLs to the neocortex could be even lesser than our current observation. Therefore, the large quantity of neocortical OLs labeled by <italic>Gsh2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>) or by GFP in <italic>Opalin<sup>Flp</sup>::Gsh2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>::RC::FLTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) most likely were predominantly dOLs generated by Gsh2+ dorsal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), rather than bona fide <sub>LC</sub>OLs.</p><p>The second major deviation is that cortical <sub>MP</sub>OLs are not completely depleted postnatally. Instead, they make a small but continued contribution with a unique spatial distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>). <sub>MP</sub>OLs display a clear rostrocaudal density decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>), a higher density in somatosensory cortex (SS) than motor cortex (Mo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and a laminar preference toward layer 4 (L4) in SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). In contrast, the distribution of dOLs and <sub>LC</sub>OLs do not vary significantly across the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>) or between Mo and SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>), but exhibits increased density toward deeper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Importantly, we have observed cortical <sub>MP</sub>OLs in mice as old as 1 year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>), well beyond the age analyzed in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Orduz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a persisted contribution.</p><p>We then turned our attention to the lateral three-layer archicortex, piriform cortex (Pir). Different from the neocortex, Pir contains higher proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) of <sub>LC</sub>OLs than dOLs. <sub>MP</sub>OLs make the lowest contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) at a density similar to SS and higher than Mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>These combinatorial models also grant us the opportunity to revisit the differential contributions of dOLs, <sub>LC</sub>OLs, and <sub>MP</sub>OLs to the two commissural white matter tracts, corpus callosum (cc), and anterior commissure (ac), which contain high density of OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–M</xref>). We found that, similar to the neocortex, cc is mainly populated by dOLs and supplemented by very low proportions of <sub>LC</sub>OLs and <sub>MP</sub>OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–N</xref>). Interestingly, <sub>LC</sub>OLs and <sub>MP</sub>OLs seem to show preferential distribution in the lateral and medial regions of cc (cc-l and cc-m), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>). Different from cc, ac is mainly populated by <sub>LC</sub>OLs and <sub>MP</sub>OLs and supplemented by very low proportion of dOLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–N</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate the above results, we further breed <italic>Opalin<sup>Flp</sup>::Emx1<sup>Cre</sup>::Nkx2.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>::Ai65 to label dOLs together with <sub>MP</sub>OLs by RFP and co-stained them with ASPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). RFP−ASPA+ cells were difficult to find in Mo, SS, and cc, but were more easily observed in Pir and ac, consistent with the respective low and high <sub>LC</sub>OL contributions in these regions.</p><p>In summary, our findings significantly revised the canonical model of forebrain OL origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and provided a new and more comprehensive view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We demonstrated that neocortical OLs are mainly derived from dorsal origin with small but lasting contribution from the ventral origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Our data showed that LGE/CGE makes little contribution to neocortex and cc, but makes major contribution to piriform cortex and ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This finding is supported by another report in which in utero electroporation failed to label LGE-derived cortical OLs in both embryonic and early postnatal brains, and an exclusion strategy revealed very low percentage of LGE/CGE-derived cortical OLs in neonatal brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Li et al., 2023</xref>). The lack of adult labeling in our study together with the lack of developmental labeling in the other study suggests that the lack of <sub>LC</sub>OL in neocortex is less likely caused by competitive postnatal elimination, but more likely due to limited production and/or allocation. We further discovered that MGE/POA makes a small but persistent contribution to the neocortex with a distinct distribution pattern featured by a rostral-high to caudal-low gradient and a preference toward L4 in SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whether their enduring existence and highly biased localization has functional implications awaits future exploration. In addition, we found that the cc showed a similar OL composition as the neocortex, but the Pir and the ac each exhibited distinct OL compositions in term of their embryonic origins. <sub>LC</sub>OLs are the major contributor to both regions, while dOLs and <sub>MP</sub>OLs mainly contribute to Pir and ac, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The classical and revised model of forebrain oligodendrocyte (OL) origins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the classical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>), OLs derived from medial ganglionic eminence/preoptic area (MGE/POA) (orange) were largely eliminated postnatally (thin dashed line), while those from lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE) (blue) and dorsal origin (purple) survive at similar proportions (thick solid line). Therefore, neocortex (NCx) and corpus callosum (cc) contain comparable density of <sub>LC</sub>OLs (blue dots) and dOLs (purple dots) and are devoid of <sub>MP</sub>OLs (orange dots). (<bold>B</bold>) In the new model, NCx and cc mainly contain dOLs with very low contribution from the ventral origins. <sub>LC</sub>OLs mainly contribute to piriform cortex (Pir) and anterior commissure (ac). <sub>MP</sub>OLs makes a small but sustained contribution to NCx, with a strong laminar preference toward layer 4 in somatosensory cortex (SS). In addition, dOLs and <sub>MP</sub>OLs also make substantial contributions to Pir and ac, respectively.

ES clones that survived through negative and positive selections were first screened by genomic PCR, then confirmed by Southern blotting using appropriate DIG-dUTP-labeled probes. One positive ES cell clone was used for blastocyst injection to obtain male chimera mice carrying the modified allele following standard procedures. Chimera males were bred with C57BL/6J females to confirm germline transmission by genomic PCR. The Neo selection cassette was self-excised during spermatogenesis of F0 chimeras. Heterozygous F1 siblings were bred with one another to establish the colony. Targeting vector construction, ES cell transfections and screening, blastocyst injections, and chimera breeding were performed by Cyagen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Genomic PCR</title><p>Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tails. Tissue was lysed by incubation in tail lysis buffer (Viagen, 102-T) with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Diamond, A100706) overnight at 55°C followed by 45 min at 90°C in an air bath to inactivate proteinase K. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at maximum speed (21,130 G) for 15 min in a table-top centrifuge. Supernatant containing genomic DNA was used as the PCR template for amplifying DNA products. The following primers were used:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Opalin-F</italic>: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCCTATGTTTGATTTCCAGCACTG</named-content>-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Opalin-R</italic>: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGCACTTATGACTGCTGAGCCGTTC</named-content>-3′</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and microscopy</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5% sodium pentobarbital (0.09 mg/g body weight) and then intracardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Following post fixation at 4°C for 24 hr, brain samples were sectioned at 30 μm using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S), or transferred into 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for cryoprotection, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and sectioned using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). For CC1 immunostaining, antigen retrieval was performed prior to blocking by boiling for 3 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were blocked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Triton and 5% normal donkey serum and then incubated with the following primary antibodies in the blocking solution at 4°C overnight: RFP (goat polyclonal antibody, 1:2000, SICGEN AB0081-200; rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:2000, Rockland 600-401-379), GFP (chicken polyclonal antibody, 1:1000, Aves Labs, GFP-1020), MBP (rat polyclonal antibody, 1:500, AbD Serotec, MCA409S), CC1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:500, Oasis Biofarm, OB-PRB070, mouse polyclonal antibody, 1:300, Millipore, OP80), ASPA (rat polyclonal antibody, 1:200, Oasis Biofarm, OB-PRT005), Sox9 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:2000, Chemicon, AB5535), and NeuN (mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:500, Millipore, MAB377). Sections were then incubated with appropriate Alexa fluor dye-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or CF dye-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (1:250, Sigma) in blocking solution and mounted in Aqua-mount (Southern Biotech, 0100-01). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Sections were imaged with confocal microscopy (Olympus FV3000), fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ni; Olympus VS120; Olympus VS200), and fluorescent stereoscope (Nikon SMZ25). All quantifications were performed in 2-month-old adult mice from coronal sections between Bregma +1.94 and −2.80 mm. Anatomical regions were identified according to the <italic>Paxinos</italic> ‘<italic>The Mouse Brain</italic>’ <italic>Atlas</italic> and the <italic>Allen Reference Atlas</italic>, and their areas were measured in ImageJ for density calculations, whenever applicable. For cortical regions, every fourth section within the range of selection was analyzed. For whiter matter tracts, three consecutive sections at Bregma 0.14 were analyzed. At least three brains were analyzed for each genotype. To quantify density and co-localization, cells were identified and counted in Adobe Photoshop or ImageJ in conjugation with QuPath.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 was used for statistical calculations. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. Data collection and analysis were performed blind to the conditions of the experiments whenever possible. No animals or data points were excluded from the analysis. Normalcy was assessed using Shapiro–Wilk test. Equal variances were assessed using <italic>F</italic> test or Bartlett’s test. Statistical significance was tested using two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s or Bonferroni post hoc test, wherever appropriate. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Significance is marked as *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, and ***p &lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse studies were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University.

Specifically, they generated an OL-expressing reporter mouse line OpalinP2A-Flpo-T2A-tTA2 and bred with region-specific neural progenitor-expressing Cre lines EMX1-Cre for dOL and NKX2.1-Cre for MPOL. They used a subtractional strategy in the OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mouse line to predict the origins of OLs from lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LC). With their genetic tools, the authors concluded that neocortical OLs primarily consist of dOLs. Although the populations of OLs (dOLs or MP-OLs) from Emx1+ or Nkx2.1+ progenitors are largely consistent with previous findings, they observed that MP-OLs contribute minimally but persist into adulthood without elimination as in the previous report (PMID: 16388308).</p><p>Intriguingly, by using an indirect subtraction approach, they hypothesize that both Emx1-negative and Nkx2.1-negative cells represent the progenitors from lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LC), and conclude that neocortical OLs are not derived from the LC region. This is in contrast to the previous observation for the contribution of LC-expressing progenitors (marked by Gsx2-Cre) to neocortical OLs (PMID: 16388308). The authors claim that Gsh2 is not exclusive to progenitor cells in the LC region (PMID: 32234482). However, Gsh2 exhibits high enrichment in the LC during early embryonic development. The presence of a small population of Gsh2-positive cells in the late embryonic cortex could originate/migrate from Gsh2-positive cells in the LC at earlier stages (PMID: 32234482). Consequently, the possibility that cortical OLs derived from Gsh2+ progenitors in LC could not be conclusively ruled out. Notably, a population of OLs migrating from the ventral to the dorsal cortical region was detected after eliminating dorsal progenitor-derived OLs (PMID: 16436615).</p><p>The indirect subtraction data for LC progenitors drawn from the OpalinFlp-tdTOM reporter in Emx1-negative and Nkx2.1-negative cells in the OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mouse line present some caveats that could influence their conclusion. The extent of activity from the two Cre lines in the OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mice remains uncertain. The OpalinFlp-tdTOM expression could occur in the presence of either Emx1Cre or Nkx2.1Cre, raising questions about the contribution of the individual Cre lines. To clarify, the authors should compare the tdTOM expression from each individual Cre line, OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::RC::FLTG or OpalinFlp::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG, with the combined OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mouse line. This comparison is crucial as the results from the combined Cre lines could appear similar to only one Cre line active.</p><p>Overall, the authors provided intriguing findings regarding the origin and fate of oligodendrocytes from different progenitor cells in embryonic brain regions. However, further analysis is necessary to substantiate their conclusion about the fate of LC-derived OLs convincingly.</p><p>Comments on latest version: The overall responses by the authors are satisfactory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95406.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Yuqi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Zhirong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Mingyue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Mingfang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Miao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...] Strengths:</p><p>The authors have generated a novel transgenic mouse line to specifically label mature differentiated oligodendrocytes, which is very useful for tracing the final destiny of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes.

We agree with the reviewer that our methodology by itself cannot suggest whether the lack of LGE/CGE-derived-OLs in the neocortex is caused by competitive postnatal elimination or not. That is why we cited a parallel work by Li et al. (ref [17] in the original manuscript; ref [19] in the revised manuscript), in which in utero electroporation (IUE) failed to label LGE-derived OL lineage cells in both embryonic and early postnatal brains. Although they did not directly explore CGE using IUE, their fate mapping results using Emx1-Cre; Nkx2.1-Cre; H2B-GFP at P0 and P10 revealed very low percentage of LGE/CGE-derived OL lineage cells. The lack of adult labeling in our study together with the lack of developmental labeling in the other study prompted us to hypothesize that the lack of LGE/CGE-derived-OLs in the neocortex is less likely caused by competitive postnatal elimination, but more likely due to limited production and/or allocation. In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the discussion to explain this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...] Strengths:</p><p>The strength and novelty of the manuscript lies in the elegant tools generated and used and which have the potential to elegantly and accurately resolve the issue of the contribution of different progenitor zones to telencephalic regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer appreciates our work and are grateful for the overall positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Throughout the manuscript (with one exception, lines 76-78), the authors quantified OL densities instead of contributions to the total OL population (as a % of ASPA for example).

In the revised manuscript, we have added relevant descriptions in the “Material and Methods” section (line 199-200*) and schematics along with representative images of more anterior and more posterior cortical regions (Supplementary Figure 2A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Hence, the statement that &quot;In summary, our findings significantly revised the canonical model of forebrain OL origins (Figure 4A) and provided a new and more comprehensive view (Figure 4B).&quot; (lines 111, 112) is not really accurate as the findings are neither new nor comprehensive. Published manuscripts have already shown that (a) cortical OLs are mostly generated from the cortex [Tripathi et al 2011 (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6474-10.2011), Winker et al 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3392-17.2018) and Li et al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.01.569674)] and (b) MGE-derived OLs persist in the cortex [Orduz et al 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11904-4) and Li et al 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.01.569674)]. Extending the current study to different rostro-caudal regions of the cortex would greatly improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the response to comment (2), our original quantifications included different rostro-caudal regions of the cortex. In the revised manuscript, we have added more schematics and representative images in the Supplementary Figure 2 for better illustration to resolve the concern of comprehensiveness.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for listing and summarizing highly relevant published researches along with the parallel study by Li et al. submitted to eLife. We apologize for the omission of the first two references in our original manuscripts and have cited them in appropriate places (ref [10] and ref [11] in the revised manuscript). However, we believe these works do not compromise the novelty and significance of our work for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) Tripathi et al. 2011 (ref [10] in the revised manuscript) analyzed OL lineage cells in the corpus callosum and the spinal cord, but not in the cortex and anterior commissure. Their analysis was performed in juvenile mice (P12/13), not in adulthood. Most importantly, their analysis of ventrally derived OL lineage cells relied on lineage tracing using Gsh2Cre, which in fact also label OLs derived from Gsh2+ dorsal progenitors. In contrast, we analyzed mature OLs in the cortex, corpus callosum and anterior commissure in 2-month-old adult mice. We used intersectional and subtractive strategy to label OLs derived from dorsal, LGE/CGE and MGE/POA origins. Our strategy differentiated the two different ventral lineages (LGE/CGE vs. MGE/POA) and avoided mixed labeling of OLs from ventral and dorsal Gsh2+ progenitors.</p><p>(2) Winkler et al. 2018 (ref [11] in the revised manuscript) analyzed OLs derived from dorsal progenitors but only quantified those in the gray matter and the white matter of somatosensory cortex. Their quantification relied on co-staining with Olig2/Sox10, and thereby included both oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) and OLs. In contrast, we analyzed mature OLs from three origins and quantified not only neocortical regions (Mo and SS) but also an archicortical region (Pir). Our analysis revealed that although dorsally derived OLs dominate neocortex, ventrally derived OLs, especially the LGE/CGE-derived ones, dominate piriform cortex.</p><p>(3) Orduz et al. 2019 (ref [7] in the original manuscript and the revised manuscript) mainly focused on POA-derived OLs in the somatosensory cortex. Although they performed limited analysis on MGE/POA-derived OPCs at postnatal day 10 and 19, no quantification of MGE/POA-derived OLs was performed in terms of their density, contribution to the total OL population and spatial distribution in the cortex. In contrast, we performed systematic quantification on these aspects to demonstrate that MGE/POA-derived OLs make small but sustained contribution to cortex with a distribution pattern distinctive from those derived from the dorsal origin.</p><p>(4) Li et al. 2024 (ref [17] in the original manuscript and [19] in the revised manuscript) is a parallel study submitted to eLife. Their and our independent discoveries nicely complemented each other. Using different sets of techniques and experiments but some shared genetic mouse models, we both found that LGE/CGE made minimum contribution to neocortical OLs. Their analysis in the prenatal and early postnatal stages together with our analysis in the adult brain painted a more comprehensive picture of cortical oligodendrogenesis. The uniqueness of our work is that we performed systematic quantification of all three origins and uncovered the differential contributions to neocortex, piriform cortex, corpus callosum and anterior commissure.</p><p>In summary, our work developed novel strategies to faithfully trace OLs from the three different origins and performed systematic analysis in the adult brain. Our data uncovered their differential contributions to neocortex, piriform cortex and the two commissural white matter tracts, which significantly differ not only from the canonical view but also from other previous studies in aspects discussed above. We believe our discoveries did significantly revise the canonical model of forebrain OL origins and provided a new and more comprehensive view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...] Intriguingly, by using an indirect subtraction approach, they hypothesize that both Emx1-negative and Nkx2.1-negative cells represent the progenitors from lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LC), and conclude that neocortical OLs are not derived from the LC region.The authors claim that Gsh2 is not exclusive to progenitor cells in the LC region (PMID: 32234482). However, Gsh2 exhibits high enrichment in the LC during early embryonic development. The presence of a small population of Gsh2-positive cells in the late embryonic cortex could originate/migrate from Gsh2-positive cells in the LC at earlier stages (PMID: 32234482). Consequently, the possibility that cortical OLs derived from Gsh2+ progenitors in LC could not be conclusively ruled out. Notably, a population of OLs migrating from the ventral to the dorsal cortical region was detected after eliminating dorsal progenitor-derived OLs (PMID: 16436615).</p><p>The indirect subtraction data for LC progenitors drawn from the OpalinFlp-tdTOM reporter in Emx1-negative and Nkx2.1-negative cells in the OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mouse line present some caveats that could influence their conclusion. The extent of activity from the two Cre lines in the OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mice remains uncertain. The OpalinFlp-tdTOM expression could occur in the presence of either Emx1Cre or Nkx2.1Cre, raising questions about the contribution of the individual Cre lines. To clarify, the authors should compare the tdTOM expression from each individual Cre line, OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::RC::FLTG or OpalinFlp::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG, with the combined OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG mouse line. This comparison is crucial as the results from the combined Cre lines could appear similar to only one Cre line active.</p><p>Overall, the authors provided intriguing findings regarding the origin and fate of oligodendrocytes from different progenitor cells in embryonic brain regions. However, further analysis is necessary to substantiate their conclusion about the fate of LC-derived OLs convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. We agree with the reviewer that the presence of Gsh2-positive cells in the late embryonic cortex by itself could not rule out the possibility that they originate/migrate from Gsh2-positive cells in the LC at earlier stages. Staining dorsal-lineage intermediate progenitors with Gsh2, or performing intersectional lineage tracing using Gsh2Cre along with a dorsal-specific Flp driver, would provide more direct evidence on this issue. Nonetheless, as our lineage tracing of LGE/CGE-derive OLs did not employ Gsh2Cre, the doubt on the identity of Gsh2+ cortical progenitors should not affect the interpretation of our data.</p><p>Regarding the subtractional LCOL labeling strategy used in our study, we wonder if there was any misunderstanding by the reviewer. As stated in our manuscript (line 59-61) and reiterated by the reviewer, OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::RC::FLTG labels OLs derived from progenitors that express neither Emx1Cre nor Nkx2.1Cre. As these two progenitor pools do not overlap with each other, there is a purely additive effect of their actions. If there is any concern about efficiency and specificity, it would be non-adequate Cre-mediated recombinations that lead to mislabeling of dOLs or MPOLs as LCOLs (i.e., OLs derived from Emx1 or Nkx2.1-expressing progenitors were not successfully “subtracted” and thereby “wrongly” retained RFP expression). Therefore, the bona-fide LGE/CGE-derive OLs would only be fewer but not more than RFP+ LCOLs labeled by our subtractional strategy, even if any of the Cre lines did not work efficiently enough. In any case, this would not affect our conclusion that LGE/CGE-derive OLs make a minimal contribution to neocortex, as the “ground truth” contribution by LGE/CGE could only be less but not more than what we have observed using the current strategy.</p><p>In support of our conclusion, a parallel study by Li et al. 2024 (ref [17] in the original manuscript; ref [19] in the revised manuscript) also provided independent experimental evidence that “any contribution of oligodendrocyte precursors to the developing cortex from the lateral ganglionic eminence is minimal in scope (quoted from its eLife assessment).” In addition, in their revision, they performed Gsh2 immunostaining in P0 Emx1Cre::HG-loxP mouse and found nearly all Gsh2+ cells in the cortical SVZ were derived from the Emx1+ lineage. We are glad that this additional piece of evidence further clarified the case, but still want to emphasize that the subtractional strategy we took was designed purposefully to avoid the potential uncertainty of Gsh2Cre and to more faithfully label LGE/CGE-derived OLs. Therefore, the validity of our conclusion about the fate of LC-derived OLs should be independent from the question on the identity of Gsh2+ cortical progenitors and stands well by itself.</p><p>We hope that these explanations have adequately addressed the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In Figures 2C, 2D, 2E and 3D, the authors should provide counts of labelled cells as a % of ASPA+ cells.

These two recommendations are sort of related, and thereby we made the following changes. We replaced the density quantification in Figure 2F and 3D with % of ASPA (Figure 2J and 2N in the revised manuscript) to give an accurate picture of the contribution of the different progenitor regions to OLs, as suggested by the reviewer. We still retained the density counts in Figure 2C-E (Figure 2G-I in the revised manuscript). Together with quantifications of rotral-caudal and larminar distributions presented in Supplementary Figure 2, these data demonstrated that OLs from differential origins display distinct spatial distribution patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At what ages were the quantifications performed in all the figures?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission of this information in the original manuscript.

We have removed this panel and replaced it with quantifications of relative laminar distributions of the total (ASPA+) OLs along with those from the three different origins (Supplementary Figure 2G in the revised manuscript).

The sum of the these two data sets will be equivalent to those of OpalinFlp::Emx1Cre::Nkx2.1Cre::Ai65 shown in Supplementary Figure 3, and thereby we did not perform additional quantifications to avoid redundant efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Imaging and quantification should be extended to more posterior regions of the cortex to find out whether the contribution is different from the areas already examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion on imaging and apologize for the confusion about the range of quantification. As explained in the response to comment (2) of weakness, the quantifications were not confined to one level of the cortex but were performed in brain sections ranging from Bregma +1.94 to -2.80 mm, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2A-B in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have added relevant descriptions in the “Material and Methods” section (line 199-200) and schematics along with representative images of more anterior and more posterior cortical regions (Supplementary Figure 2A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors should provide Opalin reporter expression data across various brain regions at different developmental stages to clarify the expression pattern of the reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We chose to performed all quantifications in adult mice as Opalin is a well-established marker for differentiated OLs and the recombinase-dependent reporter expression is accumulative and irreversible. If there is any non-specific labeling in any earlier developmental stage, it would be retained and manifested at the timepoint we examined as well. In another word, the fact that we did not detect any non-specific labeling in the current dataset but only confined labeling in mature OLs ensured that no non-OL labeling was present in earlier timepoint. As shown in Figure 1D-F, reporter expression activated by the Opalin driver is presented at high OL specificity in all analyzed brain regions. This is further corroborated by results from combinatorically labeled samples (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2), in which only OLs but not any other cell types were labeled in all analyzed brain regions too. Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have added representative images of more rostral and more caudal cortical regions (Supplementary Figure 2B-D), which also showed highly specific OL labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1D, please specify the developmental stage of the mice used for staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission of this information in the original manuscript.

As shown in Figure 1D-E, reporter expression is confined to CC1+ differentiated OLs with no colocalization with Sox9 (astrocyte marker). In support with this observation, only ASPA+ differentiated OLs but no OPC or astrocyte were labeled in any of the combinatorial lineage tracing samples generated using this line combined with progenitor-Cre lines. In addition to marker staining, we also did not observe any RFP+ cells with OPC or astrocyte morphology. As the recombinase-dependent reporter expression is accumulative and irreversible, the fact no non-specific labeling was observed in adult brain retrospectively proved the specificity of Oplain-Flp in earlier developmental stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 1E, authors should address why the efficiency of the tdTomato line is notably lower compared to that of H2B-GFP and whether the stability of reporters could impact the conclusions drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in reporting efficiency is mainly caused by differences inherent to the two reporting systems. The TRE-RFP reporter is derived from Ai62, composed of a Tet response element and tdTomato inserted into the T1 TIGRE locus. The tdTomato expression is driven by tTA-TRE transcriptional activation. The HG-loxP reporter is derived from HG-Dual, composed of a CAG promoter, a frt-flanked STOP cassette, and H2B-GFP inserted into the Rosa26 locus. The H2B-GFP expression is driven by CAG promoter after Flp-mediated removal of the STOP cassette. A Flp-dependent tdTomato reporter designed in the same way as the HG-FRT reporter would have similar efficiency. In fact, the RC::FLTG reporter can be viewed as such a reporter in the absence of Cre, which did show similarly high efficiency as HG-FRT and supported efficient subtractive labeling of LGE/CGE-derived OLs. We apologize for a typo in the title of the Y-axis of the right panel in the original Figure 1F which may have caused potential misunderstanding. The “RFP+CC1+/CC1” should be “XFP+CC1/CC1”. We have corrected this mistake and revised the figure legend for clearer description of the data (Line 293-302 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2, please clarify the developmental stage of the mice used for staining.
