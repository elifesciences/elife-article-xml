modulating immunity and tissue homeostasis. Their actions depend on TCR recognition of peptide-MHC molecules; yet the degree of peptide specificity of Treg-cell function, and whether Treg ligands can be used to manipulate Treg cell biology are unknown. Here, we developed an A<sup>b</sup>-peptide library that enabled unbiased screening of peptides recognized by a bona fide murine Treg cell clone isolated from the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and identified surrogate agonist peptides, with differing affinities and signaling potencies. The VAT-Treg cells expanded in vivo by one of the surrogate agonists preserved the typical VAT-Treg transcriptional programs. Immunization with this surrogate, especially when coupled with blockade of TNFα signaling, expanded VAT-Treg cells, resulting in protection from inflammation and improved metabolic indices, including promotion of insulin sensitivity. These studies suggest that antigen-specific targeting of VAT-localized Treg cells could eventually be a strategy for improving metabolic disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>Treg cells</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>surrogate antigens</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT101609MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>Ricardo A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AI103867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

For many years, almost all Treg-cell studies focused on those circulating through or residing in lymphoid organs, so that our view of Treg-cell phenotype and function was heavily colored by the biology of this constellation of cells. More recently, some of our attention has turned to distinct populations of Treg cells that operate in non-lymphoid organs, where they not only rein in local immune responses, but also help maintain tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Panduro et al., 2016</xref>). ‘Tissue-Tregs,’ as they have been termed, have distinct transcriptomes, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, and dependencies that optimally arm them to survive and function within a particular tissue.</p><p>A paradigmatic tissue-Treg population is that found in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), in particular in the male gonadal fat depot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mathis, 2013</xref>). According to a number of assays, VAT-Treg cells control local and systemic inflammatory and metabolic indices, promoting insulin sensitivity through influences on both inflammatory and parenchymal cells, notably macrophages and adipocytes. Like other tissue-Treg populations, VAT-Treg cells have a distinct transcriptome, driven primarily by the ‘master-regulator’ of adipocyte differentiation, PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipolletta et al., 2012</xref>). They also display a distinct, clonally expanded TCR repertoire that exhibits signs of clonal selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feuerer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolodin et al., 2015</xref>). The critical importance of the TCR for the accumulation and function of VAT-Treg cells was recently established using the vTreg53 TCR-transgenic (tg) mouse line, which has a TCR repertoire highly skewed for the specificity displayed by an expanded VAT-Treg clone (vTreg53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, beyond its lack of dependence on the lipid-presenting CD1d molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolodin et al., 2015</xref>), little is known about the antigen(s) recognized by VAT-Treg cells.</p><p>More generally, the question of the antigen specificity of Treg cells remains open because very few peptide antigens that selectively activate them have been identified. How peptide-specific is Treg-cell function, and can Treg-cell ligands be used to manipulate Treg biology? The technical difficulties of identifying Treg-cell antigens are many, including the low precursor frequency of naturally occurring Treg cells, and experimental means of identifying peptide antigens in general. De novo identification of cognate peptides for TCRs of interest is still notoriously challenging and apart from a few examples for testis-cancer antigens and self-peptides recognized by neonatal thymic Treg cells, the identity of Treg TCR ligands remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stadinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). This reduced set of Treg-specific antigens largely restricts the phenotypic characterization and manipulation of activated Treg cells to broad, polyspecific, stimulation regimes. Furthermore, while polyspecific stimulation can produce Treg-mediated suppressive activity, antigen-specific activation appears to elicit stronger responses in autoimmunity or graft rejection treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DuPage and Bluestone, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamazaki et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we sought to gain insight into the antigen specificity of Treg cells in a well-characterized system of VAT-localized Treg cells with known functional metrics that can be queried using candidate surrogate ligands. We developed an A<sup>b</sup> yeast peptide library and screened for recognition by the TCR displayed by the VAT-Treg clone vTreg53, identifying a range of surrogate peptides (SPs) that robustly stimulated the original clone both in vitro and in vivo. Exploiting one of these SPs, we devised a ‘vaccination’ protocol that was able to ameliorate metabolic indices. These studies collectively reinforce the antigen-specific nature of Treg function and highlight the continued importance of ligand discovery to explore Treg function and devise antigen-specific Treg therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of the peptide-A<sup>b</sup> yeast-display library</title><p>In order to discover peptides recognized by the vTreg53 TCR, we performed an unbiased, affinity-based screening of a peptide-MHC yeast library. For this approach, we first had to engineer a large peptide-A<sup>b</sup> library in yeast cells. Based on previous work on the peptide-E<sup>k</sup> and other pMHC yeast libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brophy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shusta et al., 1999</xref>), we designed a single-chain construct composed of a 13-mer peptide, p3K, fused to the β1α1 domains and a c-Myc tag, connected by suitable Gly-Ser linkers, in-frame with the Aga2 protein for expression at the yeast surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While we were able to observe expression of this construct at the yeast surface, we could not detect binding to the cognate YAe-62.8 TCR (YAe)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the peptide-A<sup>b</sup> construct was misfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To overcome this issue, we generated a yeast library expressing a small number of randomly inserted mutations in the mini peptide-A<sup>b</sup> construct using an error-prone polymerase chain reaction strategy (PCR; up to 3 to 5 mutations per kbp), which we then selected with the YAe TCR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of a peptide-A<sup>b</sup> yeast library.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A degenerate codon with maximum diversity at TCR-facing positions (blue) and optimal residues at anchor positions (red) was used to generate a peptide-MHC yeast library containing up to 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> peptides.

Neither mutation appeared to impact the positioning of the peptide in the groove or interacted with the peptide anchor residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, based on crystal structures for TCR interactions with cognate peptide-A<sup>b</sup> molecules, the two mutant residues were found to be outside of the peptide-A<sup>b</sup>/TCR interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To test if the newly evolved A<sup>b</sup> display platform could be used to deorphanize TCRs of interest, we generated a random-peptide library by incorporating the degenerate codon NNK at all but the anchor positions of a 13-mer peptide (corresponding to p1, p4, p6 and p9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which we then selected using two TCRs of known specificity: YAe and 2W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In each round of TCR-selection, the fraction of c-Myc and TCR-tetramer (coupled to streptavidin, TCR-SA) positive cells increased, suggesting the enrichment of a particular group of peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Deep sequencing of the DNA region encoding the peptide sequence from the isolated yeast clones for each of the four consecutive rounds of selection revealed a strong enrichment for a group of closely related peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). For example, nearly all peptides contained a Lys in the central, TCR-facing, p5 position, a residue that is critical for recognition by the YAe TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>). To confirm that the observed TCR-SA binding was strictly peptide-dependent, we substituted the central Lys residue at p5 by a Leu residue. This single-point mutation eliminated TCR-SA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In other TCR-facing positions, such as p3, p7 or p8, we noticed a striking similarity to the peptides enriched from an insect peptide-A<sup>b</sup> library, namely Arg or Leu in p2 and p7, followed by Ala or Thr in p8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crawford et al., 2004</xref>). We followed a similar strategy with a second proxy TCR, 2W, and again found an increase in the fraction of TCR-tetramer positive cells in the third and fourth round of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the 2W TCR showed a positive tetramer staining of the mini-A<sup>b</sup> platform displaying the cognate, p3K, peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The dominant peptide in the 2W selection also showed positive 2W TCR-SA staining, which was lost after a single mutation of His to Leu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), confirming that binding is driven by peptide recognition. Taken together, the selection with the Yae and 2W TCR indicates that the newly generated peptide-A<sup>b</sup> library can be used to identify SPs for TCRs of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of robust agonist surrogate peptides for the vTreg53 TCR</title><p>Next, we screened the peptide-A<sup>b</sup> library with the vTreg53 TCR, which was previously identified in a population of Treg cells present in epididymal VAT tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kolodin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The fraction of c-Myc-tag positive cells increased from ~29% in the naïve library to ~57% by the 4<sup>th</sup> round of the vTreg53 TCR selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, staining with the vTreg53 TCR-SA tetramer showed a modest positive population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Despite this result, deep sequencing of the four rounds of selection revealed strong enrichment of a group of highly similar peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>).

Fat7 (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and Fat15 (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were both able to up-regulate CD69 expression following stimulation of Jurkat T cells transduced with the vTreg53 TCR in culture with peptide-pulsed K562-A<sup>b</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). For both peptide libraries, the majority of single-point mutants eliminated activation or had a negligible effect when compared with the original Fat7 or Fat15 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). However, a few single-point mutations based on Fat15, particularly those present in the p7 position, led to a marked increase in CD69 up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mutation of Val to Met or Trp at p7 induced the highest levels of CD69 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). The substitution of Pro to Leu in p4, an anchor position, also resulted in an increase in CD69 expression. Titration of Fat15 and the peptides with Met at p7 (Fat1562) and Leu at p4 and Trp at p7 (Fat2564) revealed a decrease in EC<sub>50</sub> from 40.7 µM for Fat15 to 14.3 µM for Fat1562 and 8.9 µM for Fat2564 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

It is also known that TNFα levels in VAT increase with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotamisligil et al., 1993</xref>), and that TNFα is detrimental to Treg function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nie et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether the effect of surrogate peptide injection in this context would be enhanced by combining it with contemporaneous blockade of TNFα signaling. To this end, we transferred vTreg53 TCR-tg Treg cells into CD45.1<sup>+</sup> B6 mice that had been treated with either anti-TNFα or isotype-control IgG antibodies and fed a HFD for six weeks; and then immunized the recipient mice with CFA/Fat1562 <italic>s.c.</italic>, and <italic>i.p.</italic>-boosted the response with IFA/Fat1562 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As expected, Fat1562 immunization or anti-TNFα alone moderately increased the numbers of VAT-Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), reduced the number of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> pro-inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), and slightly improved insulin sensitivity in the recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J and K</xref>). Co-administration of Fat1562 and anti-TNFα strikingly increased VAT-Treg cells, suppressed pro-inflammatory macrophages, and strongly promoted insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–K</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that Fat1562 could expand transferred vTreg53 Treg cells, dampen VAT inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity in mice fed a HFD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The small subset of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, comprising up to 2% of peripheral blood lymphocytes, plays a decisive role in maintaining immune homeostasis and reducing excessive immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>), as well as several aspects of non-immune-tissue homeostasis. Importantly, several studies demonstrated that TCR expression is essential for Treg cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>) and that the TCR repertoire of these cells can recognize self- as well as foreign peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jordan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pacholczyk et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, TCR stimulation shapes various Treg-cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zemmour et al., 2018</xref>). There is still, however, a paucity of methods to identify agonist Treg peptide ligands. Here, we took advantage of an unbiased peptide-library screen to identify potent agonists for a previously characterized, VAT-localized, Treg clone, vTreg53. Our goal was to elucidate whether the induction of an antigen-specific expansion of a particular population of VAT-Treg cells can ameliorate metabolic indices and improve insulin sensitivity in the context of a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that SPs can promote clonal Treg-cell proliferation without compromising key features of the VAT-Treg transcriptome, while suppressing HFD-induced VAT inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity.</p><p>In cancer immunotherapy, a major effort has been devoted to the identification of (neo)antigens that drive CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> anti-tumor responses. The success of this approach has been largely facilitated by deep sequencing analysis of the tumor cells’ transcriptome coupled to the development of algorithms to identify mutations in protein-coding regions and the likelihood that these neoantigens are displayed by a given MHC allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike neoantigens, which can be readily identified by DNA sequencing, any wild-type peptide with suitable anchor residues may be presented by a given MHC molecule. The identification of self-antigens poses therefore a challenge that has been difficult to overcome. Current approaches to deorphanize Treg-cell TCRs have relied on the focused screening of organ-specific cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), the isolation of thymus-derived MHCII-eluted peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stadinski et al., 2019</xref>) and lastly, on the screening of organ-specific, Aire-dependent, proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>). While these approaches have successfully revealed Treg-specific wild-type antigens, they also impose limitations regarding the tissue of origin or rely on the analysis of a relatively large number of APCs. For example, the limited number of MHCII-positive cells present in VAT currently precludes analysis of the A<sup>b</sup>-peptidome by mass spectrometry. A quick analysis of the mouse proteome reveals that more than half a million peptides, based solely on the presence of favorable anchor residues, can be presented by A<sup>b</sup>. Without a well-defined criterion to restrict the search of self-peptides to a reduced, tissue-specific protein-subset, it becomes nearly impossible to individually test the entire A<sup>b</sup>-peptidome for T cell responses.</p><p>Recent work suggests that the TCR has a rather reduced cross-reactivity and shows, instead, a poly-specific response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wucherpfennig et al., 2007</xref>). In other words, the TCR mostly recognizes a small, closely related, number of peptides. We have thus hypothesized that these newly identified SPs could guide the identification of self-peptides, similarly to what has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gee et al., 2018</xref>). However, the SPs identified using the vTreg53 TCR failed to fully align with a peptide region from the mouse proteome and, despite extensive effort, we could not deorphanize the vTreg53 TCR with an endogenous antigen. Furthermore, candidate wild-type peptides relatively similar to Fat7 or Fat15 failed to activate vTreg53 cells. There may be several reasons behind our inability to identify an endogenous ligand, for example: (a) the preferred anchor residues for A<sup>b</sup> are ill-defined; (b) the theoretical diversity of a 13-mer peptide library exceeds by almost a 1000-fold the size of the yeast peptide-MHC library; (c) the depth of the A<sup>b</sup> peptide-presenting groove suggests that the TCR may have limited access to the peptide, which may impose an even greater peptide/TCR specificity for peptides presented by A<sup>b</sup>; (d) register-shifting of the peptides presented by the engineered A<sup>b</sup> platform; (e) the affinity for self-peptides may fall below the detection limit of the yeast selection approach, particularly, when taking into account the reduced avidity of the yeast-display system; (f) lastly, several reports have documented that strong agonists can be created by post-translational modifications such as transpeptidation or deamidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vigneron et al., 2004</xref>). These and other limitations may complicate the identification of self-peptides presented by the A<sup>b</sup> MHC and potentially by class II MHCs and Treg cell TCRs, in general.</p><p>Despite the limitations described above, we were able to identify potent SP agonists. Altered peptide ligands, or SPs, have long been used to elicit more potent T cell responses, and often represent a useful approach to circumvent poor TCR recognition due to weak peptide binding to MHC, multiple peptide registers, lower avidity or poor TCR/pMHC affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, SPs have proven to be a valuable tool to explore key aspects of peptide recognition and the T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evavold and Allen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evavold et al., 1995</xref>). More recently, SPs were shown to drastically suppress autoimmune responses during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saligrama et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the case of vTreg53, we identified several structurally related peptides that appeared to elicit a wide range of signaling potencies. Analysis of the Treg cells activated by the strongest SP, Fat1562, revealed two critical features. First, peptide-induced expansion of the Treg population was restricted to those cells displaying a very small number of TCRs. Whether this restriction is a property of the peptide used or an indication of a limited, highly peptide-specific VAT-Treg TCR repertoire remains to be investigated. Second, the transcriptome of Fat1562-activated Treg cells maintained the typical VAT-Treg signature, namely an enrichment of genes involved in lipid metabolism and an increase in <italic>Pparg</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipolletta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feuerer et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, immunization with Fat1562 led to a significant expansion of adoptively transferred vTreg53 cells, accompanied by reduced VAT inflammation and improved systemic insulin sensitivity in the context of HFD. Previous studies showed that long-term HFD feeding is able to induce a VAT microenvironment that is highly toxic to VAT-Treg cells, partially due to increased level of TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cipolletta et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore reasoned that combination of anti-TNFα and Fat1562 immunization should be able to unleash the full potential of VAT-Treg cells. Indeed, co-administration of Fat1562 with anti-TNFα led to a striking increase of VAT-Treg cells and a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity in mice with severe obesity.</p><p>There has been substantial interest in harnessing the power of Treg cells to therapeutic ends, in particular for the amelioration of graft-versus-host, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). A major obstacle relates, however, to the TCR de-orphanization of Treg clones. While polyclonal stimulation of Treg cells readily induces broad clonal expansion, antigen-specific stimulation of tissue-resident Treg cells has been found to be more effective at suppressing immune responses. In murine models of type-1 diabetes, antigen stimulation of Treg cells performed better at ameliorating diabetes progression than polyclonal Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamazaki et al., 2006</xref>), and similar results were found in humanized-mouse transplant models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recent data on the phenotypic distinction of non-lymphoid-tissue Treg cells argue that they will be a more effective source then their lymphoid-organ counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Panduro et al., 2016</xref>). By analogy with the recent developments in TCR-based cancer immunotherapy, the potential to deorphanize disease-related Treg cell TCRs is likely to spur a greater focus on the discovery of disease-specific Treg populations. Surrogate peptides may offer a simpler and viable alternative to self-antigens in promoting local, tissue-specific, Treg expansion and immunosuppressive activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6(J)</td><td valign="top">Jackson lab</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CD45.1. <break/>C57BL/6</td><td valign="top">Jackson lab</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 002014</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">vTreg53 TCR-tg</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Foxp3-GFP</td><td valign="top">Gift of Vijay.

The supernatant and precipitate mixture was spun down at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C to remove precipitate. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) for &gt;3 hr at room temperature. Ni-NTA beads were collected and washed in a Buchner funnel with 20 mM imidazole in 1 x HBS pH 7.2 and eluted with 200 mM imidazole in 1x HBS pH 7.2. Protein was concentrated in a 10 kDa filter (Millipore, UFC903024) to ~1 mL. When appropriate, protein was biotinylated with BirA ligase, 100 μM biotin, 40 mM Bicine pH 8.3, 10 mM ATP, and 10 mM Magnesium Acetate at 4°C overnight. All proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using Superdex Increase S200 or S75, as appropriate (GE Healthcare). All proteins for in vivo studies were cleared of endotoxin. Final endotoxin levels were determined using a chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher) and never greater than 1 Endotoxin Unit/mg of purified protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Development and selection of peptide-A<sup>b</sup> yeast libraries</title><p>To obtain a functional A<sup>b</sup> yeast display platform, a 13mer-peptide sequence linked the β1-α1 expressed on the surface of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain EBY100 as an N-terminal fusion to Aga2 using the pYAL vector was evolved by error-prone PCR. The GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Agilent) was used to introduce between 3 to 5 mutations per one kbp. Mutation frequency and overall integrity of the A<sup>b</sup> expression gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing following ITA cloning and DNA miniprep from randomly selected single-colonies (up to 50 colonies were used). The final error-product was amplified to generate 50 μg of insert DNA using high-fidelity DNA polymerase. A<sup>b</sup> libraries were created by electroporation of chemically competent EBY100 with mutagenized insert and 10 μg of linearized pYAL vector. Peptide-A<sup>b</sup> selections were performed as described below. Functional surface expression was obtained following two single-point mutations in the β-chain: His46Tyr and Leu67Val. A<sup>b</sup>-peptide yeast display libraries were created as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, oligos allowing all 20 amino acids via NNK codons at all peptide positions except the defined anchors (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were used to generate a peptide library. The libraries allowed for limited diversity at P1, P4, P6 and P9 anchor positions to maximize the number of correctly folded pMHC clones on the surface of yeast. pMHC libraries with up to 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> transformants as determined by colony counting after serial dilution were generated by electroporation of chemically competent EBY-100 cells via homologous recombination with an insert composed by the peptide library fused to the β1(H46Y, L67V)-α1-c-myc and a linearized pYal plasmid. Three independent libraries were made, mixed, and screened by the TCRs here described as an attempt to reduce potential PCR biases.</p><p>Yeast were passaged in SDCAA and induced with SGCAA and selected with streptavidin (SA) - coated magnetic MACS beads (Miltenyi) coated with biotinylated TCR. The number of yeast used for each round of selection was ~10 x the diversity from the previous selection step. In the first round of yeast selection from the naïve library, yeast corresponding to 2-5x library diversity were incubated on a rotator at 4°C for 1 hr in 10 mL of ice cold PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin and 1 mM EDTA (PBE) with 250 μl of SA beads. Yeast-bead mixture was negatively selected using an LS Column (Miltenyi) attached to a magnetic stand (Miltenyi) and washed three times with PBE. The flow through was further incubated with 400 μl SA beads preincubated with 400 nM of TCR for 3 hr at 4°C on a rotator. The yeast were washed and pelleted at 3500 g for 2 min prior to positive selection using an LS column. The yeast eluted from the column were grown in 3 mL of SDCAA until the OD &gt;5, which usually corresponded to 36–48 hr. For rounds 2 and 3 of selection,~3×10<sup>7</sup> (corresponding to 3 ml at OD of 1) yeast were induced in SGCAA for 2 days at 20°C, at which point OD was found to be &gt;5. After confirming c-myc tag expression by flow cytometry, 10<sup>7</sup> yeast were incubated with 50 μl of SA-beads for 1 hr for the negative selection followed by 50 μl of TCR coated beads for 3 hr in 500 μl of PBE. All incubations were performed at 4°C and TCR concentration was kept at 400 nM. The fourth round of selection was similar to round 2 and 3, while substituting SA-magnetic beads for SA alone. For the negative selection step, yeast were incubated with 400 nM streptavidin-APC (SA-APC) in 500 μl for 1 hr at 4°C, followed by a 20 min incubation with 50 μl of microbeads coated with anti-647 (Miltenyi). For the subsequent positive selection step, yeast were incubated with 400 nM TCR tetramer for 3 hr at 4°C followed by 20 min with anti-alexa647 magnetic beads. Peptide-A<sup>b</sup> surface expression was monitored with anti-c-myc (Cell Signaling) antibody staining. All selections rounds and naïve libraries were kept for up to 2 months at 4°C for subsequent DNA extraction, induction and/or TCR-SA tetramer staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Deep sequencing</title><p>DNA was isolated from each round of selection using the a Zymoprep II Kit (Zymo Research) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> yeast from all rounds were lysed and DNA was extracted and eluted in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and kept at 4°C for further processing. To amplify the DNA region corresponding to the peptide sequences, a forward oligo with unique barcodes and a random 8-mer sequence was used together with a reverse oligo designed to anneal the linker connecting the peptide region to the β1 domain of A<sup>b</sup>. DNA was amplified by PCR for up to 15 cycles. PCR products were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis and later re-amplified by PCR for 15 cycles to include the standard Illumina adaptor sequences. All amplification steps were performed using Phusion DNA Polymerase (NEB). The final amplified library was purified following agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using nanodrop. Integrity of the amplified DNA product was confirmed by BioAnalyzer (Agilent Genomics). The library was deep sequenced using the Illumina Miseq sequencer and a V2 (2 × 150) or V3 kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of deep sequencing data</title><p>Paired-end reads were identified and selected for further analysis from the deep sequencing using PandaSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masella et al., 2012</xref>) after which the paired-end reads were parsed according to the barcodes using Geneious V6. Sequences with frameshifts or stop codons were removed from further analysis. Sequences were processed to quantify the number of identical peptide sequences using custom Perl scripts and shell commands.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Surface Plasmon resonance</title><p>A GE Biacore T100 was used to measure the K<sub>D</sub> by equilibrium methods. Approximately 200 resonance units (RU) of human CD45, PD-1 or mouse PD-1 was captured on a SA-chip (GE Healthcare), including a reference channel of an unrelated protein. SPR runs were performed in HBS-P+ (GE Healthcare). All measurements were made with 2-fold serial dilutions using 45–60 s association (at 30 μl/min) followed by &gt;240 s dissociation (30 μl/min) at 25°C. Regeneration was performed using HBS-P+, 2 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> or 0.1 M Glycine, pH 3.1 for 15–20 s at 50 μl/min. Measurement of titrations at equilibrium were used to determine the K<sub>D</sub> using Biacore Analysis Software (GE Healthcare). All measurements were repeated twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mice</title><p>Male mice of various ages were produced in our specific-pathogen-free facilities at Harvard Medical School, and were fed a chow diet (no. 5058, Lab Diet Picolab Mouse Diet 20), or HFD (60 kcal% Fat, Research Diets, D12492i).

and also act in non-lymphoid organs, where they control local immune responses and help maintaining tissue homeostasis. Among 'tissue-Tregs' those found in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) control local and systemic inflammatory and promote insulin sensitivity. Their actions depend on TCR recognition of peptide-MHC complexes; yet the degree of peptide specificity of Treg-cell function, and whether Treg ligands can be used to manipulate Treg cell biology are unknown. The present study uses yeast peptide display libraries to identify surrogate peptides that bind to class II MHC molecules and were able to stimulate Treg cells bearing a transgenic TCR isolated from a VAT resident Treg cell. These surrogate p-MHC complexes were capable of expanding transferred the corresponding TCR transgenic Tregs thereby protecting mice from some of the consequences of a high fat diet. Therefore, this study is important in that it suggests that antigen-specific targeting of VAT-localized Treg cells could eventually be a strategy for improving metabolic disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Discovery of surrogate agonists for visceral fat Treg cells that modulate metabolic indices in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Using yeast peptide display libraries focusing on I-Ab:peptide complexes, the authors identified surrogate peptides that did not match peptides from the mouse genome but were able to stimulate cells bearing a transgenic TCR isolated from a VAT resident Treg cell. These surrogate peptides were able to expand transferred TCR transgenic Tregs, thereby protecting mice from some of the consequences of a high fat diet. Although the study is novel and well designed , a few important issues have been raised by the 3 reviewers and need to be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. More specifically, it should be make clear in the Abstract and title that the expanded VAT-Treg cells express a transgenic TCR, and a peptide-only control condition need to be provided in the TNFa blocking experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors generated the first I-Ab:peptide yeast display library, and successfully identified agonist peptides for a TCR cloned from a VAT Treg cell.</p><p>Unfortunately, the identified antigens did not match any peptide from the mouse genome, such that the physiological antigens for VAT Tregs remain unknown.</p><p>The study nevertheless demonstrates feasibility of antigen-dependent expansion of VAT Tregs. Importantly, expanded Tregs retained a VAT transcriptomic profile and improved insulin sensitivity in a model of diet-induced insulin resistance.</p><p>Overall, the study is well designed and executed, and the manuscript is clearly written. The novelty of the approach will be of interest to the immunology community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In recent years it has become clear that Tregs have a range of phenotypes and roles in different tissue sites. However how to selectively manipulate these cells remains highly difficult since while they may have some specific properties these tissue resident Tregs tend to share markers with either other Tregs or effector cells in the same site. Using a peptide display library the authors were able to find several surrogate peptides that were able to effectively stimulate cells bearing a TCR originally isolated from VAT resident Tregs. These SP were able to expand wildtype VAT Tregs in some mice and also were highly effective at the expansion of transferred TCR transgenic Tregs with the effect that they were able to protect from some of the consequences of a high fat diet.</p><p>The ability to selectively manipulate a tissue resident subpopulation of Tregs holds great promise for the development of organ specific treatments and the paper covers a topic of current interest and is generally well written. I do however have some comments on particular experiments and some concerns about the strength of the data including anti-TNFa.</p><p>1) Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The authors show some data from tetramer experiments. Even though only 3/10 mice responded it may be worth including graphs showing the number of tetramer positive cells from the different tissues. It is notable that the proportion of tetramer positive amongst Tregs is quite high in the VAT considering that no enrichment was performed, suggesting that at least in the representative mouse this worked rather well and may require more attention.</p><p>2) Figure 5B. I think a bit more effort can be put into the analysis of the differences between the groups. Using similar analysis to 5A were there any changes to the genes in the previously defined VAT UP and DOWN signature genes? What were the top differentially expressed genes and do any of them have known function in Tregs. How do the authors interpret the increased <italic>Pparg</italic> mRNA in the Spl/LN? Is this evidence of trafficking from the VAT? The authors note but do not show that other VAT signature genes may have increased.</p><p>3) Figure 7G-M: Since the authors have already demonstrated that Fat1562 alone is effective in this system it seems hard to say if anti-TNF is making a significant addition to its efficacy since there is no Fat1562 only group for comparison. The normalized blood glucose level of the anti-TNF + Fat1562 group in Figure 7L is not noticeably better than the Fat1562 alone group in 7B. Similarly, comparison of 7I and 6G shows no support for a clear contribution of anti-TNF. Direct comparison within one experiment might be able to show a contribution of anti-TNFa to the effect of Fat1562 but this has not been done and without it I'm not sure this data is meaningful.</p><p>4) It is also worth noting that similar data in Figures 6 and 7 are not presented consistently e.g. macrophage analysis is given as %CD11chi of F4/80 in 6H but #CD11chi/gram of fat in 7J. Raw numbers in 6E, x103 in 7I etc. These differences should be either justified or removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors screen for peptides with the capacity to activate the vTreg53 TCR transgenic. The authors find several peptides that activate this TCR transgenic, and are capable of expanding up the TCR transgenic cells. This particular TCR transgenic originates from VAT Tregs, and the expanded T cells are able to improve insulin sensitivity (as shown for the vTreg53 TCR transgenic strain in the original paper by Liu et al., 2018).</p><p>The work is technically well performed, and no major experimental concerns are identified. However the title and Abstract rather over-sell the data available. &quot;Discovery of surrogate agonists for visceral fat Treg cells&quot; implies that the agonists are broadly capable of activating visceral fat Treg cells, while they are only expanding up the vTreg53 TCR transgenic cells. Even when injected into highly inbred mice with the same MHC, most (7/10) mice showed no response (3/10 mice showed an expansion of tetramer-reactive cells, one of which is shown in the manuscript, and no metabolic tests were performed). The selective expansion of vTregs was only in mice that were given the TCR transgenic cells to begin with, i.e. synthetic antigen expands up TCR transgenic cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58463.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Figure 4—figure supplement 1.

We plotted top transcripts that either have known functions in Tregs, such as <italic>Lag3, Il10, Tigit</italic>, or those fall into the major pathways identified in GSEA, including <italic>Isg15, Isg20</italic> for interferon responses, <italic>Nfil3 and Srebf2</italic> for cholesterol metabolism, <italic>E2f2, E2f7, E2f8</italic>, and <italic>Ccnb2</italic> for E2F targets and G2M checkpoint. We have previously identified that the spleen hosts a small population of PPARγ<sup>lo</sup> Tregs that are precursor cells for VAT Tregs (Li, et al., 2018), which is TCR-dependent. The RNA-seq data here fits with a model in which cognate antigen (TCR) stimulation upregulates <italic>Pparg</italic> expression and/or promotes the induction of VAT-Treg precursor cells in the spleen,. However, other interpretations are possible as well, e.g. a stimulus, like IL-4, that up-regulates <italic>Pparg</italic> expression. These different possibilities are under further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7G-M: Since the authors have already demonstrated that Fat1562 alone is effective in this system it seems hard to say if anti-TNF is making a significant addition to its efficacy since there is no Fat1562 only group for comparison.

We have now performed this experiment and include the results in the revised manuscript. In the new Figure 7H-K, we now show that in mice fed with long-term HFD, a-TNFα or Fat1562 alone had a modest effect on expanding VAT Tregs and improving insulin sensitivity, but the combination of a-TNFα and Fat1562 significantly increased the numbers of VAT Tregs, reduced the numbers of proinflammatory macrophages, and substantially improved insulin sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is also worth noting that similar data in Figures 6 and 7 are not presented consistently e.g. macrophage analysis is given as %CD11chi of F4/80 in 6H but #CD11chi/gram of fat in 7J.

Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). As the reviewer notices, expansion of the Fat1562/A<sup>b</sup> tetramer+ population was detected in 30% of wild-type mice. While this number may appear low, it is important to notice that TCRαβ sequences are generated randomly and are likely very different between mice. The 30% response rate in wild-type animals suggests that the v53Treg TCR clone is relatively common, which was unexpected. Furthermore, the single-cell clones that were isolated for TCR-sequencing showed that while one of the TCRs had a nearly identical CDR3α and CDR3β sequence to the vTeg53 TCR, other clones were different and lacked obvious similarities among them. Despite this, these TCRs were still able to recognize the Fat1562/A<sup>b</sup> tetramer, suggesting that the VAT-Treg expansion is not necessarily limited to the vTreg53 clone.</p><p>As for the title, we understand that is it not perfect for reasons of length limitations, but readers will understand exactly what we have done from reading the Abstract and manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
