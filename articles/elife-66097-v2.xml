L-glutamate-gated ion channels that regulate synaptic transmission and modulate neuronal circuits. KARs have strict assembly rules and primarily function as heteromeric receptors in the brain. A longstanding question is how KAR heteromer subunits organize and coordinate together to fulfill their signature physiological roles. Here we report structures of the GluK2/GluK5 heteromer in apo, antagonist-bound, and desensitized states. The receptor assembles with two copies of each subunit, ligand binding domains arranged as two heterodimers and GluK5 subunits proximal to the channel. Strikingly, during desensitization, GluK2, but not GluK5, subunits undergo major structural rearrangements to facilitate channel closure. We show how the large conformational differences between antagonist-bound and desensitized states are mediated by the linkers connecting the pore helices to the ligand binding domains. This work presents the first KAR heteromer structure, reveals how its subunits are organized, and resolves how the heteromer can accommodate functionally distinct closed channel structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HEK cells</kwd><kwd>Sf9 cells</kwd><kwd>baculovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027</institution-id><institution>Leon Levy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyerson</surname><given-names>Joel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Patricia MGE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>136832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowie</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>162317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowie</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perozzo</surname><given-names>Amanda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027</institution-id><institution>Leon Levy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyerson</surname><given-names>Joel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structures of the GluK2/K5 kainate receptor reveal the heteromer architecture and how the receptor organizes in apo, antagonist-bound, and desensitized states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) respond to the neurotransmitter L-glutamate (L-Glu) to mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>). This central role has implicated iGluRs in major pathological brain conditions including depression, schizophrenia, stroke, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowie, 2008</xref>). The iGluR family has three subtypes termed kainate receptors (KARs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Each subtype possesses unique functional properties and fulfills distinct physiological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). KARs are expressed throughout the central nervous system and act post-synaptically in depolarization and modulation of membrane excitability, and pre-synaptically to regulate excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Contractor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Their role in pain perception, epilepsy, and mood disorders has also made KARs important targets of small-molecule antagonist and modulator development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Contractor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Møllerud et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>KARs are tetramers that assemble with four identical subunits (homomers) or mixtures of different subunits (heteromers). Each subunit has a modular three-layer design with an amino terminal domain (ATD), ligand binding domain (LBD), and transmembrane domain (TMD) which forms part of a common pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). The tetramers have variable symmetry among their three domain layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>), a feature that is also found in AMPARs and NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu and Gouaux, 2017</xref>). KAR tetramers are generated from a pool of five subunits. GluK1, GluK2, and GluK3 subunits can form functional homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui and Mayer, 1999</xref>). GluK4 and GluK5 cannot form functional channels on their own and are obliged to co-assemble with GluK1, GluK2, or GluK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Werner et al., 1991</xref>). GluK4-5 also have higher L-Glu affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>) and thus a lower activation threshold than GluK1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher and Mott, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mott et al., 2010</xref>). Heteromers containing GluK5 subunits show enhanced permeation to polyamine pore blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), distinct pharmacological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swanson et al., 2002</xref>), and are endowed with slower deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>) which is proposed as central to their role in integrating synaptic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frerking and Ohliger-Frerking, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lerma and Marques, 2013</xref>). Consequently homomers and heteromers occupy different functional niches in the brain, with heteromers thought to be the major KAR class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petralia et al., 1994</xref>). Receptors containing either GluK4 or GluK5 are also specifically linked to diseases such as depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catches et al., 2012</xref>), epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2012</xref>), autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aller et al., 2015</xref>), and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their significance, no KAR heteromer structure has been reported, which presents a major knowledge gap made more salient by recently reported structures of NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karakas and Furukawa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lü et al., 2017</xref>) and AMPAR heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herguedas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>KARs are ligand-gated cation channels which respond to L-Glu released into the synapse. L-Glu binding triggers the receptor to enter an active state with an open channel which allows cations to cross the membrane. The channel closes again if L-Glu is rapidly removed (deactivation) or if L-Glu exposure is sustained (desensitization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>). Recent structures have shown how GluK2 and GluK3 homomers are organized in the absence of L-Glu while bound to competitive antagonists and after the receptors have desensitized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meyerson et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schauder et al., 2013</xref>). The desensitized structures revealed that KAR homomers feature a ‘desensitization ring’ motif which is proposed to facilitate channel closure and account for their slow recovery from desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>). To date this motif has not been observed in AMPAR or NMDAR structures, raising the question of whether it is unique to KAR homomers or if KAR heteromers employ a similar desensitized structure.</p><p>Here, we report structures of the GluK2/GluK5 heteromer (GluK2/K5), proposed to be the major KAR in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petralia et al., 1994</xref>), in resting (apo), antagonist-bound (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [CNQX]), and agonist-bound (L-Glu) desensitized states. The apo and antagonist-bound structures allow us to address questions of KAR heteromer architecture, symmetry, and the organization of its three structural ‘layers’. With the L-Glu-bound structure, we reveal the significant structural changes which accompany heteromer desensitization and compare the structure to the desensitized GluK2 homomer. We conclude with structural analysis to answer how antagonist-bound and desensitized GluK2/K5 states can both maintain a closed cation channel despite such different LBD arrangements. Critically, this work provides an expanded foundation for understanding differences and similarities among KAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meyerson et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>), AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herguedas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karakas and Furukawa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lü et al., 2017</xref>), and recently characterized ionotropic orphan delta (GluD) receptor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burada et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burada et al., 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Receptor isolation, functional testing, and structure determination</title><p>In order to obtain a structure of GluK2/K5, it was necessary to generate receptor protein of sufficient quality and quantity for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging. However, the GluK2/K5 receptor has low expression levels in recombinant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nasu-Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reiner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2003</xref>). To surmount this problem, we developed optimized protein co-expression constructs for GluK2 and GluK5. In both subunits we mutated select cysteines in the TMD, and for GluK5 we also removed the flexible C-terminus which contains multiple endoplasmic reticulum retention signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nasu-Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2003</xref>) (see 'Materials and methods' for details). We refer to these constructs as GluK2<sub>em</sub> and GluK5<sub>em</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the functional properties of wild-type and cryo-EM constructs in order to validate that GluK2<sub>em</sub> and GluK5<sub>em</sub> form functional receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For these experiments, we used outside-out patch clamp electrophysiology to measure channel current decays in response to a prolonged (250 ms) exposure to L-Glu (i.e. desensitization) or to a brief (1 ms) pulse of L-Glu (i.e. deactivation). Recordings of cells transfected with wild-type GluK2 or co-transfected with wild-type GluK2 and GluK5 show rapid desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the two conditions show divergent responses to short L-Glu exposure with GluK2 deactivating quickly and the combination of GluK2 and GluK5 deactivating slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). The slow channel closure in the heteromer occurs because GluK5 subunits have high affinity for L-Glu, and occupancy of their LBDs is sufficient to sustain channel activation after L-Glu application is halted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of GluK2 and GluK5 subunits gives a mixture of GluK2 homomers and GluK2/K5 heteromers (as noted, GluK5 alone does not form functional homomers), and measuring deactivation provides a way to isolate a characteristic heteromer signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>). We tested GluK2<sub>em</sub> alone and found it shows the expected rapid desensitization from prolonged L-Glu treatment and rapid deactivation after a short L-Glu pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This confirmed GluK2<sub>em</sub> can form functional homomers with similar kinetic properties to wild-type GluK2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We next co-expressed GluK2<sub>em</sub> and GluK5<sub>em</sub> and observed rapid desensitization from a mixture of GluK2<sub>em</sub> homomers and GluK2<sub>em</sub>/GluK5<sub>em</sub> heteromers (referred to as GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> heteromers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). In turn, the deactivation current decays slowly, indicating the inclusion of the GluK5<sub>em</sub> subunits and formation of functional GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> heteromers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Recent work on the GluK4 LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kristensen et al., 2016</xref>) and molecular dynamics simulations on GluK2/K5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paramo et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that GluK4 and GluK5 LBDs function as heterodimers with the other three KAR subunits. Based on these results we hypothesized that in the full-length receptor, GluK2 and GluK5 LBDs co-assemble as two pairs of heterodimers rather than as two pairs of homodimers. Analysis of the GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX structure validates this hypothesis and shows that GluK2/K5 LBD heterodimers form with GluK5 in pore-proximal (A/C) positions and GluK2 in pore-distal (B/D) positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). We next compared the LBD layer of GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX to LBD layers of an antagonist-bound KAR homomer (GluK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>), AMPAR (GluA1/A2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herguedas et al., 2019</xref>), and NMDAR heteromers (GluN1b/N2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The profile of the GluK2/K5 LBD layer is most similar to GluK2 and the AMPAR when viewed from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This observation is reinforced when considering subunit orientation by using helices B and G as references across the three LBD layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). We then considered the positioning of each LBD by calculating distances between their centers of mass in UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>). Measurements between LBDs <italic>within</italic> a dimer were similar for all the structures and ranged between 26.7 and 30.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When comparing <italic>between</italic> LBD dimers, it is clear that GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> and GluN1b/N2B form an overall more compact arrangement with dimer-dimer distances of 49.9 and 47.9 Å, respectively. This contrasts with distances of 54.9 and 55.1 Å for GluK2 and GluA1/A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). From these measurements we conclude that the GluK2/K5 LBD layer is more compact than the GluK2 homomer or GluA1/A2 LBD layer, and in this respect is more akin to the GluN1b/N2B receptor.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the GluK2/K5 ligand binding domain (LBD) layer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extracellular view of LBD layers for (left to right) GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>, GluK2, GluN1b/N2B, and GluA1/A2.

The antagonist-bound structure is expected to feature a closed ion channel; so to understand how GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> restricts cation flow, we visualized the pore profile using HOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smart et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). This analysis revealed three constrictions on the M3 helices at T652/T636, A656/A640, and T660/T644 (GluK2<sub>em</sub>/GluK5<sub>em</sub> subunits). The positions of these constrictions match those seen for the GluK2 homomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>) which reflects the strong sequence conservation for M3 helices within the KAR family. The availability of closed-channel structures for other iGluRs enabled a cross-family comparison of pore structure. We compared the pore profiles of GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX with closed-channel structures of a KAR homomer (GluK2, PDB: 5KUF), a di-heteromeric AMPAR (GluA1/A2, PDB: 6QKC), and a di-heteromeric NMDAR (GluN1b/N2B, PDB: 6WHU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These measurements highlight a similarity in pore structure for GluK2 and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> and also show the KAR heteromer pore is more similar to the AMPAR than the NMDAR. Finally, given the mixed composition of the GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> TMD, we asked how closely it adopts fourfold symmetry, given its mixed subunit composition. For this analysis we considered the correspondence between the pair of GluK2<sub>em</sub> and the pair of GluK5<sub>em</sub> subunits in the GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub> TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and measured an RMSD of 1.5 Å.

Although the LBD layer gives the impression of fourfold symmetry, close inspection shows that the G helices of all four LBDs come together in a staggered arrangement to render the layer twofold symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Critically, this arrangement is reminiscent of the ‘desensitization ring’ observed in the desensitized GluK2 homomer structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>).

Furthermore, close inspection shows GluK5<sub>em</sub> G helices reside ~3 Å closer to each other across the twofold symmetry plane of the LBD layer, compared to analogous GluK2 subunits in the homomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,H</xref>).

This raises the question of how the receptor can accommodate such radically different LBD conformations in two closed-channel structures.</p><p>To address this question we compared antagonist-bound and desensitized structures, and on both structures analyzed the region spanning the M3 helices (the major pore-forming helices in the TMD), the M3-S2 linkers (which join the M3 helices and LBD), and the E helices (the lower lobe of the LBD which couples to M3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These values were plotted as a function of residue number for all four subunits in both CNQX-bound and L-Glu-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This vertical analysis revealed that GluK5<sub>em</sub> (A/C) linker elevation does not differ significantly between antagonist-bound and desensitized conformations. This is consistent with the overall observation that these subunits do not show major conformational differences between the two states. Meanwhile, for GluK2<sub>em</sub> (B/D) subunits, the M3-S2 linkers extend ~12 Å further from the membrane in the desensitized state. This latter measurement suggests that to facilitate channel closure during desensitization, the GluK2 subunits may move away from the membrane in addition to undergoing large in-plane rotations. This analysis yields the conclusion that the M3-S2 linkers on the GluK2 subunit are the core structural element that allows GluK2/K5 to adopt two significantly different LBD arrangements in the antagonist-bound and desensitized states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Defining how the subunits of GluK2/K5 organize and respond to neurotransmitter has been a major research goal since the discovery of the receptor 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>). In our study we show that the heteromer assembles with two copies of each subunit, with GluK2 and GluK5 LBDs arranged in alternating fashion around the receptor central axis and with GluK5 subunits proximal to the pore and GluK2 subunits distal to the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The structure shows that GluK2 and GluK5 LBDs assemble as heterodimers, validating what was hypothesized from previous studies of GluK2/K5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kristensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Litwin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paramo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reiner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>GluK5 is distinguished from GluK2 in that it has high L-Glu affinity and slow deactivation kinetics, which sustains non-desensitizing currents in GluK2/K5 heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberis et al., 2008</xref>). Because of the high affinity of GluK5 for L-Glu, at low neurotransmitter concentration GluK2/K5 is activated by ligand binding to the GluK5 subunits without binding to GluK2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher and Mott, 2011</xref>). Functional studies have found that desensitization is triggered when GluK2 subunits are also bound by neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher and Fisher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reiner and Isacoff, 2014</xref>). The desensitized GluK2/K5 structure helps rationalize this functional role for GluK2, suggesting that it is the GluK2 subunits which undergo large conformational changes to facilitate channel closure during desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The fact that GluK5 can sustain non-desensitizing currents at low-micromolar L-Glu concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher and Mott, 2011</xref>) presents the enticing potential to resolve an active state KAR structure, and also sheds light on how GluK2/K5 may sustain current during its slow deactivation. Another avenue to such a structure would be to visualize GluK2/K5 in the presence of the ligand AMPA, and exploit the fact that GluK5, and not GluK2, binds AMPA to produce stable currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herb et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>This study shows that the LBD layer of desensitized GluK2/K5 is organized with pseudo-fourfold symmetry and with the four LBDs positioned such that their G helices are in a staggered arrangement near the central axis of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This LBD configuration is similar to that observed in desensitized GluK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2016</xref>) and GluK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>), which suggests the arrangement is a hallmark of desensitization in the KAR family. The mechanistic role of this LBD arrangement cannot yet be fully understood because no active state KAR structure is available. However, it is clear that desensitization must involve reorganizing the LBD dimer interface to allow LBDs to remain bound to L-Glu while also closing the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Twomey and Sobolevsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu and Gouaux, 2017</xref>). The LBD layer motif we observe would satisfy these requirements with its ruptured LBD dimers and LBDs arranged to accommodate a closed ion channel. Furthermore, the E662 position at the top of the M3 helices on GluK2 may serve as a fixed point around which GluK2 LBDs and M3-S2 linkers rotate during desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Previous electrophysiology of KARs and X-ray crystallography of isolated LBDs have demonstrated that KAR homomers are regulated by extracellular ions that bind to the LBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Plested and Mayer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plested et al., 2008</xref>). However, a recent molecular dynamics study suggests that the canonical view of ion-dependent gating in homomeric receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawe et al., 2013</xref>) is different in GluK2/K5 heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paramo et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, while sodium stabilizes GluK2 homomers, with a weaker allosteric effect by lithium ions, the situation is reversed in GluK2/K5 heteromers where lithium potentiates the agonist response and prolongs the rate of desensitization. Although we could not address questions of ion binding because of the resolution in our cryo-EM maps, the experimental foundation established in this study along with recent advances in atomic resolution cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yip et al., 2020</xref>) pave the way for the future study of how heteromerization and subunit placement affects anion and cation regulation of GluK2/K5 heteromers. Indeed, further work which combines high-resolution cryo-EM with electrophysiology will make it possible to better understand the full extent to which the ion regulatory mechanism differs between homomeric and heteromeric channels.</p><p>It is notable that after refining the full-length structures of CNQX-bound and L-Glu-bound GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>, we found that the resolutions of the ATD layer and the LBD-TMD assembly could be improved with local refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests some degree of relative mobility between these regions permitted by the ATD-LBD linkers. The ATDs in both of these structures also gave the highest resolutions in the study so we searched for local conformational differences that might point to novel functional attributes of the ATDs. However, close comparison showed no significant differences between the two ATD layers which is consistent with the idea that KAR ATDs are not involved in channel gating. Rather, they are thought to play a key role in subunit oligomerization during receptor biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A key question during this study was whether GluK5 is always found at the A/C positions, or might other assemblies exist. Indeed, we performed extensive image classification in the hopes of discovering receptors that did not obey the proposed assembly. Despite this effort we did not find evidence that such particle subsets exist in the datasets. Importantly, given the 10-fold excess of GluK5<sub>em</sub> versus GluK2<sub>em</sub> virus added during protein expression, we would expect GluK5 to adopt alternative positions (i.e. B or D) if this were possible. That this does not happen led us to conclude that GluK5 can only occupy the A/C positions.</p><p>We note that this study used GluK2 and GluK5 subunits that were modified to facilitate protein expression and purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and while these subunits display similar functional properties to wild-type subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), it will be valuable to test the observed subunit arrangement using an orthogonal approach. To this end the subunit arrangement seen in the structures will be supported by future experiments using a technique such as crosslinking to reinforce the conclusion that it represents the predominant physiological form of GluK2/K5.</p><p>This study marks a milestone in iGluR biology by providing the first structures of the presumed major neuronal type of KAR to accompany structures of the dominant forms of NMDARs and AMPARs. The structures answer long-standing questions about domain arrangements and orientations, and they lay a foundation for high-resolution studies of GluK2/K5 to fully illuminate its gating mechanism and coordination of small-molecule agonists, antagonists, and modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>). Together the availability of molecular models for all iGluR family members now makes possible comparative structure-guided investigation across the iGluR family and a framework for precision targeting of drugs to specific receptor subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GRIK2_RAT</td><td>Provided by Dr. Janet Fisher (University of South Carolina)</td><td>P42260</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GRIK5_RAT</td><td>Provided by Dr. Janet Fisher (University of South Carolina)</td><td>Q63273</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup></td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC, Cat.

These images were used for contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation with CTFFIND4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Reference-free particle auto-picking was done using Laplacian-of-Gaussian tool in Relion. The auto-picked particles were extracted with a box size of 416 pixels, binned to a box size of 64 or 128 pixels, and imported into cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). One round of 2D classification was performed for CNQX-bound and L-Glu-bound datasets but was not used for the apo dataset. Ab initio 3D reconstruction and several rounds of heterogeneous refinement with C1-symmetry were used for all three datasets. This process removed false positives from auto-picking and isolated interpretable particle sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The resulting particles were re-extracted with a box size of 320 or 416 without binning and imported into cryoSPARC. Particles extracted with a box size of 320 pixels were first re-centered. Ab initio 3D reconstruction and several rounds of heterogeneous refinements were again performed with C1-symmetry to obtain the final set of particles. The final 3D reconstructions were obtained by non-uniform (GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-apo) or homogeneous refinement (GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu) in cryoSPARC. The global resolutions were calculated using the FSC as 7.5 Å (apo), 5.3 Å (CNQX), and 5.8 Å (L-Glu) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

For the ATD layer, The LBD-TMD signal was subtracted from the particles in Relion, then the particles were processed with ab initio reconstruction, heterogeneous refinement, non-uniform refinement, and local refinement in cryoSPARC to a resolution of 3.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For the LBD-TMD assembly, the particles were subjected to 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, and several rounds of heterogeneous refinements in cryoSPARC to further isolate a particle subset. A round of non-uniform refinement was performed followed by particle subtraction to remove the ATD layer. The signal-subtracted particles were then processed with 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, and several rounds of heterogeneous refinements to isolate a well-resolved LBD-TMD class. Non-uniform refinement (C2 symmetry) was used in a final step to refine the assembly to 4.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

To refine the ATD layer, particles were subjected to signal subtraction to remove the LBD-TMD region, then processed with ab initio reconstruction and several rounds of heterogeneous refinements to isolate a uniform population of ATD particles. Non-uniform refinement (C2 symmetry) followed by local refinement were used to obtain an ATD structure at 3.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The LBD-TMD assembly was resolved by subtracting ATD signal from the particles, followed by 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, and several rounds of heterogenous refinements to obtain a uniform particle subset, and then a final round of non-uniform refinement (C2 symmetry) gave a resolution of 4.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). C1 symmetry was used throughout unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Additional analysis was performed in an attempt to improve resolutions in the LBD and TMD regions of both GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu, and we first attempted to use masked local refinement of these regions. This strategy did not improve the resolutions likely because of the small masses of the LBD and TMD layers, so we next applied conformational variability analysis in cryoSPARC. This showed no evidence for local conformational variability in either the LBD or TMD regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Structural modeling</title><p>To model GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu, the ATD and LBD-TMD maps were first aligned to their respective full-length maps using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). This made sure that ATD and LBD-TMD maps were correctly positioned relative to each other. The ATD and LBD-TMD maps were then used for model building.</p><p>The ATD cryo-EM maps were resolved to 3.6 Å (GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-CNQX) and 3.8 Å resolution (GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu) which permitted side chain modeling. The ATDs were modeled starting from the GluK2/K5 ATD crystal structure (PDB: 3QLU) which was docked into the maps using Chimera. The model was rebuilt using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and refined using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The LBD-TMD assemblies were built starting from a homology model based on the GluK2 homomer structure (PDB: 5KUF) and generated by the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>). The LBD and TMD homology models were docked into the LBD-TMD maps using Chimera, then rebuilt using COOT. Because the global resolutions of the LBD-TMD maps were 4.2 Å (CNQX) and 4.3 Å (L-Glu) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), the assemblies were modeled as poly-alanine chains. The exception to this was the pore-lining M3-helix bundle crossing in the TMD where side chains were visible in both CNQX-bound and L-Glu-bound maps and could be modeled for structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, side chains were modeled at positions 620–646 (A/C, GluK5 subunits) and 636–661 (B/D, GluK2 subunits). The ATD-LBD linkers, S2-M4 linkers, and M2 helices were not resolved in either structure and were not modeled. In addition, the S1-M1 linkers in GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu were not resolved or modeled.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Fisher (University of South Carolina) for providing genes for GluK2 and GluK5, and N Panitz (SUNY Binghamton) for assistance with image processing pipeline development.

that respond to the neurotransmitter glutamate. This is an important advance because previous structures had all been of homomeric receptors, while it is known that native receptors are largely heteromeric. This paper will be of great interest to molecular neuroscientists. It presents high-quality structural data of a critical synaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor in the context of its known functional properties.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Architecture and structural dynamics of the heteromeric GluK2/K5 kainate receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Merritt Maduke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew J R Plested (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors solve structures of a kainate-type glutamate receptor in a hetermeric form that is expected to be a major form in the brain. By using antagonists and agonists, they could solve the structures in resting, inhibited and desensitized forms. The major strengths are the establishment of a clear assembly rule – the GluK5 subunits sit on the A/C positions – so called proximal subunits – and the GluK2 subunits sit in the B/D positions. Given the different functional properties of heteromeric receptors, it is a shock that the GluK2/K5 heteromers here present very similar structures to GluK2 homomers. These similarities suggest common mechanisms despite molecular diversity. The weakness of the work is that there is no independent test of the subunit arrangement, based on the structural knowledge delivered. Also, the low resolution of some parts of the structures forbids analysis of some aspects of the biology, including one of the linkers. This work will open the way to a more accurate molecular analysis of kainate receptors, and a better understanding of the diversity in the glutamate receptor family. Additional discussion as to how these structures provide insight into extensive functional data available for the heteromeric receptors will increase the impact of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It appears that the authors needed to remove particles that were not amenable to 3D reconstruction in their single particle analyses. After cleaning up the particles, were the authors able to observe meaningful conformational variations that may provide insights into functions? Or is there only one conformation of each for the CNQX-bound and the glutamate -bound (desensitized) structures? The authors may pick these conformational variations by running other software packages such as RELION and/or cisTEM. It is likely advantageous for the authors to run further 3D classification on their dataset to potentially extract meaningful 3D classes to enrich their insights into protein dynamics.</p><p>2) One major concern is that since these structures are with modified constructs and may not represent the predominant physiologically conformation. Hence it is essential to have other measurements, such as cross-linking/ mutational studies/or other biochemical/biophysical methods that can validate these structures. At a minimum the authors should discuss this and in addition rationalize the structure with prior functional data, adding the caveat that the subunit arrangement seen in the structures will be confirmed or supported by future experiments using an orthogonal technique (such as crosslinking).</p><p>3) Related to point 2: while it is good to see that the constructs used for cryo-EM constructs exhibit the expected electrophysiological properties (deactivation and densensitization), the functional characteristics are not directly compared to the wild-type constructs. It would be helpful to know whether the changes to the constructs introduce changes in receptor kinetics. If the authors do not have these data, the issue should at least be raised and discussed.</p><p>4) Additional discussion is needed as to how these structures provide insight into extensive functional data available for the heteromeric receptors. For example, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2017.08.047 and other prior functional studies by co-author Bowie and by others (Barberis/Mulle for example). We found it strange such discussion was missing. (Some studies were cited, but the impression is that the structure adds little. We think the authors could either speculate or say what else has to be done before the new structures can be used to gain additional insight into mechanism; for example, answering questions such as why GluK2/5 have slower deactivation speed and faster desensitization speed compared to GluK2?).</p><p>5) That the structures of GluK5 and GluK2 are so similar that they must be distinguished by differential glycans is somewhat of a surprise. The authors do not comment, except the subunits are described as &quot;mismatched&quot;. The phrase &quot;mismatched subunits are woven together&quot; is pretty, but is it apt? The subunits seem very similar…</p><p>6) Because particles are selected, can we be sure that the rule of assembly the authors propose (GluK5 is always at A/C) is really validated? Are there any further information that they authors can provide to further assure this proposal? Or perhaps to add a caveat?</p><p>7) Subsection “Receptor isolation, functional testing, and structure determination”: The “tilt” is not clear to readers. A figure to explain this point is necessary. Or modify Figure 1—figure supplement 4 to address this point. Also, it is not clear why the authors think this tilt is the reason for not observing cryo-EM density for the linker between ATD and LBD. How is that important in terms of functions of GluK2/5?</p><p>8) Subsection “Receptor organization and symmetry”. While CNQX density is not observed, can the authors say something about the LBD conformations? For example, are the LBD conformations similar to structure of antagonist-bound LBD crystal structures? Usage of &quot;a saturating concentration of CNQX&quot; may be a weak argument for stating this structure as CNQX-bound.</p><p>9) Discussion: We do not see a “pinwheel-shaped” motif in Figure 4.

After cleaning up the particles, were the authors able to observe meaningful conformational variations that may provide insights into functions? Or is there only one conformation of each for the CNQX-bound and the glutamate -bound (desensitized) structures? The authors may pick these conformational variations by running other software packages such as RELION and/or cisTEM. It is likely advantageous for the authors to run further 3D classification on their dataset to potentially extract meaningful 3D classes to enrich their insights into protein dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s interest in this question and looked closely for interpretable classes that could give meaningful insights into conformational variation. At each iteration of three-dimensional classification the class averages were carefully compared to one another. The classes typically had a range of resolutions and feature qualities as seen in our supplementary figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—figure supplement 6, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), so we looked primarily for evidence of major differences in LBD or ATD domain orientations. Although we processed the data multiple times and used classification tools in both Relion and cryoSPARC we were unable to extract classes in obviously distinct conformations on the path to resolving full-length structures.</p><p>However, as described in the manuscript, after producing full-length reconstructions we then refined the ATD and LBD-TMD assemblies separately for both the GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu structures. The fact that reconstructions of isolated ATD and LBD-TMD regions were better resolved than the full-length receptors suggests some degree of relative conformational mobility in the ATD versus the LBD-TMD assembly.</p><p>This also raised the question of local conformational variability within the ATD, LBD, and TMD regions. The ATDs were resolved to high resolution and we found no evidence for additional conformations during classification. However, the lower resolution of the LBD-TMD assemblies suggested local conformational variability that may have resisted classification. We attempted to refine the LBD and TMD layers separately but were unsuccessful, likely because of the small masses of these regions (120 kDa for the LBD layer; 60 kDa for the TMD layer). This motivated us to apply conformational variability analysis (cryoSPARC) to the LBD-TMD assemblies. Unfortunately this analysis showed no evidence for local conformational variability in either the LBD or the TMD.</p><p>In summary, we found one conformation for each full-length structure. Local reconstructions of the ATD and LBD-TMD assemblies indicated that these two regions are mobile with respect to one another. Further investigation of local variability within the ATD, LBD, and TMD regions showed no evidence of meaningful conformational variation within these regions of the structures.</p><p>We feel this is an important point to address and have elaborated on our approach in the Materials and methods section (see Materials and methods section, “Image processing and structure analysis” subsection, paragraph five).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One major concern is that since these structures are with modified constructs and may not represent the predominant physiologically conformation. Hence it is essential to have other measurements, such as cross-linking/ mutational studies/or other biochemical/biophysical methods that can validate these structures. At a minimum the authors should discuss this and in addition rationalize the structure with prior functional data, adding the caveat that the subunit arrangement seen in the structures will be confirmed or supported by future experiments using an orthogonal technique (such as crosslinking).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that applying an additional technique would add value by further validating our expression constructs and structures. Because the present restrictions on lab operations pose a challenge to timely preparation of new data, the subunit arrangement seen in the structures will be confirmed or supported by future experiments using an orthogonal technique such as crosslinking. We have noted this in the text to inform the reader (see Discussion, paragraph seven).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to point 2: while it is good to see that the constructs used for cryo-EM constructs exhibit the expected electrophysiological properties (deactivation and densensitization), the functional characteristics are not directly compared to the wild-type constructs. It would be helpful to know whether the changes to the constructs introduce changes in receptor kinetics. If the authors do not have these data, the issue should at least be raised and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Our initial submission did indeed compare wild-type to cryo-EM constructs. This was presented in the Results section and the data were found in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Specifically, wild-type function was shown in panels B-D, and cryo-EM construct function in panels E-G. In addition, Table 1 provided a summary of all the kinetic properties (deactivation, desensitization time constants) and reveals that the functional behavior of the wild-type and cryo-EM KAR heteromers are very similar.</p><p>This reviewer comment prompted us to re-evaluate our presentation of the functional data and we felt it was essential to improve communication of these data in the text. Accordingly we have revised the Results subsection dealing with functional validation (see Results), and we more clearly alert the reader to Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Additional discussion is needed as to how these structures provide insight into extensive functional data available for the heteromeric receptors. For example, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2017.08.047 and other prior functional studies by co-author Bowie and by others (Barberis/Mulle for example). We found it strange such discussion was missing. (Some studies were cited, but the impression is that the structure adds little. We think the authors could either speculate or say what else has to be done before the new structures can be used to gain additional insight into mechanism; for example, answering questions such as why GluK2/5 have slower deactivation speed and faster desensitization speed compared to GluK2?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Discussion of how the structures in this study relate to functional data on desensitization, deactivation, and to emerging data that suggest the ion-dependent gating of homomeric KARs differs from the GluK2/K5 heteromer. We also comment on the future prospect of using the experimental foundation established in this study to address questions about ion binding, ligand binding, and receptor activation (see Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) That the structures of GluK5 and GluK2 are so similar that they must be distinguished by differential glycans is somewhat of a surprise. The authors do not comment, except the subunits are described as &quot;mismatched&quot;. The phrase &quot;mismatched subunits are woven together&quot; is pretty, but is it apt? The subunits seem very similar…</p></disp-quote><p>In order to improve clarity of the text we changed the phrase “how its mismatched subunits are woven together” to “how its subunits are organized” (see Abstract).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Because particles are selected, can we be sure that the rule of assembly the authors propose (GluK5 is always at A/C) is really validated? Are there any further information that they authors can provide to further assure this proposal? Or perhaps to add a caveat?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also very interested in this question and analyzed the data multiple times throughout the study in the hopes of discovering receptors that did not obey the proposed assembly. Despite extensive three-dimensional classification we never found evidence that such particle subsets exist in the datasets. Given the ten-fold excess of GluK5<sub>em</sub> versus GluK2<sub>em</sub> virus added during protein expression, we would expect GluK5 to adopt alternative positions (i.e. B or D) if this were possible. That this does not happen led us to conclude that GluK5 is indeed always at the A/C positions. We have now addressed this point in the Discussion section (see Discussion, paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Receptor isolation, functional testing, and structure determination”: The “tilt” is not clear to readers. A figure to explain this point is necessary. Or modify Figure 1—figure supplement 4 to address this point. Also, it is not clear why the authors think this tilt is the reason for not observing cryo-EM density for the linker between ATD and LBD. How is that important in terms of functions of GluK2/5?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added annotations to Figure 1—figure supplement 4 in order to indicate the ATD “tilt”.</p><p>We did not intend to imply or argue that the ATD tilt is the reason for not observing cryo-EM density in the ATD-LBD linkers. Rather, we merely meant to say that the tilted ATD layer, together with the poorly resolved linkers, may indicate flexibility between the ATD layer and the rest of the receptor. Indeed, resolution improvements achieved through local refinement of the ATD region and LBD-TMD region in the GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX structure support this conclusion (see our response to Comment 1 above). Because similar features have been observed in AMPAR structures using both X-ray crystallography (Sobolevsky, Rosconi and Gouaux, 2009) and cryo-EM (Nakagawa, 2019) the “tilt” may be some basic feature of KARs and AMPARs structures that is not yet understood. We have revised the text to clarify this point (see Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Receptor organization and symmetry”. While CNQX density is not observed, can the authors say something about the LBD conformations? For example, are the LBD conformations similar to structure of antagonist-bound LBD crystal structures? Usage of &quot;a saturating concentration of CNQX&quot; may be a weak argument for stating this structure as CNQX-bound.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an absolutely essential point to address. In our initial submission we did indeed compare LBDs from GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX to crystal structures of isolated LBDs. The analysis can be found in Figure 1—figure supplement 5B and shows that the LBDs from GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-CNQX have similar conformations to the antagonist-bound LBD reference structure. In addition, we showed analogous comparisons for GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-apo and GluK2/K5<sub>em</sub>-L-Glu which also support our conclusions about the LBD conformations for those structures.</p><p>We believe this analysis was not communicated clearly in the initial submission. To address the deficiency and expand the analysis we have done the following:</p><p>a) Added text in the manuscript to better alert the reader to the analysis (see Results).</p><p>b) Added RMSD values to quantify how closely the GluK2<sub>em</sub> and GluK5<sub>em</sub> LBDs match the reference LBDs used for comparison (see Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>c) Revised the layout of Figure 1—figure supplement 5 to improve the presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Discussion: We do not see a “pinwheel-shaped” motif in Figure 4. Do the authors mean Figure 5? Also, how exactly is this motif defined (e.g. what residue, where in the structure, etc?)</p></disp-quote><p>The “pinwheel” referred to the entire LBD layer in the GluK2/K5-L-Glu structure when viewed from the extracellular side (Figure 4C and D). It was so named because we felt it resembled a classic pinwheel toy and the naming might aid reader interpretation of the structure. However, we now appreciate it may not appear this way to every reader. As such we have removed the “pinwheel” language from the manuscript and replaced it with plain language descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can the authors gain any insights into the mechanism underlying channel regulation by binding of extracellular ions from the cryo-EM structures?</p></disp-quote><p>The resolution in the LBDs was not high enough to visualize ions so we were unable to gain insights into channel regulation by extracellular ion binding. However, this is certainly an area for future investigation and we have commented on this point in the Discussion (see Discussion, paragraph four).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Is there anything new gained from the 2/5 ATD tetramer considering that the ATD layer has the highest resolution in both CNQX and glutamate structures? Is there any opportunity for targeting ATD as in the case of NMDA receptors (e.g. ifenprodil binding to the NMDAR ATD)? This could be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis we found that the ATDs in CNQX and L-Glu structures do not show conformational differences. This is consistent with the idea that KAR ATDs are not involved in channel gating. Rather, they are thought to play a key role in subunit oligomerization during receptor biogenesis. We have added text to the Discussion section to better contextualize the ATD results (see Discussion, paragraph five). It is currently unclear if KAR ATDs participate in small molecule binding and thus appear to be different from NMDAR ATDs in this respect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Queries about writing/interpretation:</p><p>12) Abstract: &quot;The receptor assembles with two copies of each subunit and positions GluK5 subunits proximal to the channel to direct receptor activation. &quot;</p><p>We are not sure that we agree with the logic of this statement.
