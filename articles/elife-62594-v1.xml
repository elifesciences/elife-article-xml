select the appropriate behavior in response to threat and safety sensory cues. However, the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which the brain learns to encode accurate predictors of threat and safety remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that frontal association cortex (FrA) pyramidal neurons of mice integrate auditory cues and basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs non-linearly in a NMDAR-dependent manner. We found that the response of FrA pyramidal neurons was more pronounced to Gaussian noise than to pure frequency tones, and that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons was the strongest in between conditioning pairings. Blocking BLA-to-FrA signaling specifically at the time of presentation of Gaussian noise (but not 8 kHz tone) between conditioning trials impaired the formation of auditory fear memories. Taken together, our data reveal a circuit mechanism that facilitates the formation of fear traces in the FrA, thus providing a new framework for probing discriminative learning and related disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear learning</kwd><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd><kwd>sound processing</kwd><kwd>cortical plasticity</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>677878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gambino</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011264</institution-id><institution>FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>631044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gambino</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>798326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chenouard</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>ANR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-CE13-0012-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gambino</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006251</institution-id><institution>University of Bordeaux</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Initiative of Excellence senior chair 2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gambino</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004100</institution-id><institution>Labex</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brain grant 2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gambino</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The frontal associative cortex promotes fear learning by non-linearly integrating Gaussian noise in between conditioning trials with the help of basolateral amygdala inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Discriminative learning is an important survival strategy that depends on the repeated contingency and contiguity between sensory cues (conditioned stimuli, CS) and the events (e.g. danger, safety) that they must predict (unconditioned stimuli, US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall, 2002</xref>). It has been classically studied by using differential fear-conditioning paradigms where two different auditory CS are positively (CS+) and negatively (CS-) paired in time with an aversive US (e.g. foot shock). This learning protocol is supposed to assign appropriate emotional valence to the two incoming CSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Likhtik and Paz, 2015</xref>). However, while previous work has thoroughly investigated how CSs modulate fear responses after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>), it remains unclear how the brain processes and encodes CS+ and CS- during conditioning.</p><p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has appeared over the past decade as a critical region that shapes behaviors in response to both aversive and non-aversive environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Likhtik and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>). These effects of the mPFC possibly rely on the specific interaction between its different subdivisions (i.e.prelimbic [PL] and infralimbic [IL] cortices) and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mPFC does not receive direct sensory information neither from sensory cortical areas or from the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>), thereby supporting the idea that a higher order neuronal network above the mPFC might encode specific memories that are later selected preferentially during recall together with its downstream cortical (e.g. PL or IL mPFC) or subcortical structures (e.g. BLA). Specifically, the frontal association cortex (FrA), a region of the lateral part of the agranular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uylings et al., 2003</xref>), receives inputs from the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mátyás et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>) and sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the FrA appears non-reciprocally connected to the PL/IL subdivisions of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the FrA may function as a relay station during learning from sensory cortical areas and the BLA to the mPFC. However, whether and how the FrA integrates the variety of sensory information required for discriminative learning is not understood.</p><p>The involvement of the FrA in auditory fear conditioning has constantly been reported. For example, the pharmacological inactivation of FrA neurons alters both the expression and extinction of learned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, fear conditioning and extinction have been shown to induce dendritic spine elimination and formation in the FrA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, this phenomenon occurs within the same dendritic branch, supporting the idea that a unique FrA circuit could form memory traces with distinct emotional values. Nonetheless, no previous evidence has demonstrated the contribution of the FrA in the encoding of incoming sensory cues during learning, and, if so, how such a process may be controlled by inputs from the BLA.</p><p>To address the possible role of the FrA in discriminative learning and the mechanisms behind it, we investigated auditory-evoked computations of layers II/III FrA pyramidal neurons, as well as the dynamics of long-range projections from the BLA during the acquisition of fear memory traces. By using two-photon (2P) calcium imaging in head-restrained mice, in vivo whole cell recordings and optogenetics, we found that FrA pyramidal neurons process auditory tones based on their spectral properties. Unlike pure frequency tones, Gaussian noise produced somatic and dendritic depolarizations in FrA pyramidal neurons. The photo-stimulation of BLA-to-FrA neurons resulted in the supra-linear integration of auditory tones. During conditioning, the activity of BLA-to-FrA axons was stronger between CS+/US pairings (that is, when CS- is presented) than during pairings. Inhibiting these axons during CS- impaired auditory fear learning but only when Gaussian noise is used as CS-. Taken together, our data suggest that FrA and BLA-to-FrA neurons promote learning by integrating non-conditioned Gaussian noise (i.e. not paired to the footshock), and provide additional evidence for a critical function of cortical areas when animals learn from complex tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohl et al., 1999</xref>). In conclusion, the study reveals a potent dendritic mechanism for encoding predictors in the FrA, and thus extends the cortical framework for probing discriminative learning and related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Auditory tones recruit NMDARs conductances in FrA L2/3 pyramidal neurons</title><p>We performed somatic whole-cell recordings in anesthetized naive animals and characterized the activation of FrA L2 pyramidal cells to different sounds by presenting white Gaussian noise (WGN), pure frequency tones (4 and 8 kHz), as well as linear chirps of these frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In those mice, the magnitude of CS+ evoked freezing responses was significantly lower during recall than in control mice (protocol 1, GFP: 51 ± 7%, n = 12 mice; ArchT: 24.5 ± 5%, n = 13 mice; p=0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that when <italic>WGN</italic> is paired negatively to footshock during conditioning, it promotes fear memory traces in the FrA circuit, thus confirming the specific nature of complex auditory cues during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2016</xref>). To further clarify the synaptic mechanisms involved, we measured auditory-evoked dendritic and somatic responses following conditioning protocol 1.

In contrast, local dendritic events evoked by a conditioned cue (8 kHz) or cues that were not presented during conditioning (2 kHz) were not altered, indicating that fear learning specifically affected WGN-mediated dendritic signaling. In addition, WGN-induced somatic plateau potentials were reduced in conditioned animals in a learning-dependent manner, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent plasticity mechanisms in FrA neurons were engaged during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rioult-Pedotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, the somatic and dendritic responses to both 8 kHz and WGN tones were similar during recall while mice performed better at discriminating these stimuli. This suggest that, while dendritic signaling appears critical during learning to recruit pyramidal neurons into memory traces, other circuit and cellular mechanisms are at play to discriminate sensory cues after learning. Whether the effect of learning on FrA pyramidal neurons is cancelled following fear extinction remains unknown and would be interesting to explore.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BLA-to-FrA axons are recruited during fear conditioning</title><p>The above-mentioned results indicate that the FrA is required for fear learning and guides behaviors by integrating non-conditioned complex auditory cues during conditioning.

While the activity of individual BLA boutons in FrA was relatively low at rest, it increased significantly upon successive pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Interestingly, it also never occurred before the end of the first US presentation. Indeed, the number of transients observed during the first CS+ (i.e. before the delivery of the first US) was significantly lower than the other CS that were paired with the US (<italic>learning+</italic>, CS/No US: 1.03 ± 0.15, CS/US: 1.97 ± 0.4, n = 5 mice, p=0.011; <italic>learning-</italic>: CS/No US: 0.74 ± 0.05, CS/US: 0.68 ± 0.08, n = 5 mice, p=0.863) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As a consequence, the activity of boutons measured during the first CS- was always higher than during the first CS+ (<italic>learning+</italic>, CS+1: 1.03 ± 0.15, CS-1: 2.03 ± 0.4, n = 5 mice, p=0.003; <italic>learning-</italic>, CS+1: 0.74 ± 0.05, CS-1: 0.88 ± 0.09, n = 5 mice, p=0.425) (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data suggest that neither the tone alone nor the foot shock influence the activity of BLA-to-FrA axons. In agreement, calcium transients between conditioning trials were not modulated by the presence of CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, BLA-to-FrA axons were never activated by auditory stimulations in naive mice (i.e. before fear conditioning) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our data support the idea that BLA axons projecting to the FrA convey information about learning, that is the CS+/US association itself rather than about the nature of the auditory tones.</p><p>Then, we summed the amplitude of all calcium transients detected during each CS presentation (cumulative ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> averaged across all CS+ or CS-). The averaged cumulative ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> measured during CS- was always higher than during CS+ (CS-: 0.27 ± 0.07 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, CS+: 0.21 ± 0.06 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, n = 10 mice; p=0.012), revealing that the overall activity of BLA-to-FrA axons was stronger between conditioning trials, notably at the time when CS- occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

In fact, when plotted as a function of freezing percentage observed during recall, the Δcumulative correlated positively with learning performance (r²=0.89, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that the level of activity of BLA-to-FrA axons during CS- is critical for the acquisition of fear memories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Non-linear interaction in FrA L2/3 pyramidal neurons between segregated BLA and auditory inputs</title><p>The activation of BLA neurons instructs prefrontal circuits during learning and memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klavir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>).

BLA neurons expressing ChR2 projected to the superficial layer 1 of the ipsilateral FrA (&lt;150 µm from the pia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), thereby most likely contacting dendritic tufts of L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Local photostimulation of ChR2-BLA axons in acute slices produced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in FrA pyramidal neurons with short latencies (3.5 ± 0.36 ms, n = 9 cells) and low jitter (0.289 ± 0.04 ms, n = 9 cells), suggesting that a fraction of BLA neurons are connected monosynaptically to L2/3 FrA pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klavir et al., 2017</xref>). In vivo, the photostimulation of BLA neurons with an implanted optical fiber produced plateau-like depolarizations in all FrA neurons (averaged peak amplitude: 6.2 ± 1.2 mV*sec, full-width at half-max (fwhm): 551 ± 80 ms; n = 13 cells). However, BLA-to-FrA inputs were mostly undetectable and became visible only when the stimulation was delivered during down states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), suggesting that the responses of FrA neurons to BLA stimulation in vivo are likely to be altered by on-going spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferezou and Deneux, 2017</xref>).

Taken together, our data demonstrate that rather than being an obstacle, Gaussian noise facilitates auditory fear learning when not paired to the foot shock (i.e. delivered between conditioning trials), thereby confirming the sophisticated nature of differential conditioning protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonnell and Abbott, 2009</xref>). This is possibly due to: (1) the specific dendritic and somatic responses of FrA pyramidal neurons to <italic>WGN</italic>;(2) the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons between conditioning pairings, which might support (3) the non-linear integration of Gaussian noise in FrA neurons. Unlike <italic>WGN</italic>, none of the optogenetic manipulations aiming at altering pure tone processing in FrA and BLA during conditioning had an effect on fear learning. Thus, our data bring additional perspectives to central questions regarding how frontal circuits contribute to learning, thus going beyond the BLA-mPFC interactions classically described in fear learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Likhtik and Paz, 2015</xref>). Lesion studies revealed the decisive functions of cortical areas when animals learn to predict threat specifically from complex tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grosso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohl et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, despite the dendritic and somatic properties of WGN that we observed in the FrA, it remains likely that other complex tones, including natural tones or more complex frequency-modulated tones covering a wider spectrum of pure frequencies, could also facilitate learning in a similar way than WGN.</p><p>Accumulating evidence from anatomical and functional studies has demontrated that despite its pivotal role in the acquisition and expression of associations between sensory stimuli and the emotional valence of these stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laviolette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>), the mPFC is not directly involved in sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin-Cortecero and Nuñez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, due to its anatomical connections with distributed cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), the FrA might serve as a hub that coordinates incoming sensory information before reaching the mPFC. Here, we show that it is indeed required for fear learning in a rather unconventional way, and further clarify the underlying synaptic mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that auditory sensory stimulation produces NMDAR-dependent depolarization in FrA L2/3 pyramidal neurons and activates their dendrites during both anesthesia and wakefulness. These depolarizations persisted beyond the end of the stimulation, which possibly reflects changes in the dynamics of network activity through local recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferezou and Deneux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasanetz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shu et al., 2003</xref>). The somatic and dendritic events were more pronounced with Gaussian noise than with pure frequency auditory stimulation. Although we cannot rule out that <italic>WGN</italic> tones are structured and further abstracted throughout the entire auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deneux et al., 2016</xref>), the simplest explanation is that frequency-tuned spines are distributed widely and heterogeneously throughout the same FrA dendrite, as already reported in the auditory cortex of anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). As a consequence, the multiple frequencies composing <italic>WGN</italic> might promote the activation of a dense pattern of neighboring spines that in turn facilitate the generation and propagation of local non-linear events toward the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antic et al., 2010</xref>). Multiple calcium transients occurring simultaneously in multiple dendritic branches are necessary to affect somatic voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). Both those findings and ours suggest that <italic>WGN</italic>-induced depolarization is the consequence of multiple calcium events that occur in different dendritic branches of the same neuron. In contrast, pure-frequency tone appeared unable to activate enough branches simultaneously, thereby making the alteration of somatic voltage less probable. In support of this hypothesis, we found that simple linear chirps produced more somatic depolarization than pure tones. This further suggests that more complex frequency-modulated tones could theoretically also activate FrA pyramidal neurons and affect fear learning like WGN did in our experimental conditions.</p><p>The FrA and the BLA are strongly interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mátyás et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>). However, the functional properties of these connections remain unknown, notably during learning. Our results confirm that BLA neurons project to the superficial layer of the FrA, thereby most likely contacting dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal neurons. However, and in contrast to what we observed in vitro, the photo-stimulation of ChR2-expressing BLA neurons in vivo at the same intensity than for behavioral experiments produced depolarizations in FrA pyramidal neurons that were rather weak and unreliable. The difference between in vitro and in vivo conditions may reflect the interaction between evoked responses and on-going spontaneous activity that occurs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferezou and Deneux, 2017</xref>). It thus seems unlikely that they can summate during rhythmic activation to create favorable conditions for the integration of coincident sensory-driven inputs. Alternatively, it is possible that the modest activation of BLA synapses in FrA apical dendrites gates the propagation towards the soma of tone-evoked dendritic events which could enhance the generation of somatic action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we observed that the coincident activation of BLA-to-FrA inputs increased both <italic>WGN</italic> and <italic>8 kHz</italic>-evoked depolarization non-linearly. Although the BLA+<italic>WGN</italic> nonlinearities were much stronger than those generated by BLA+<italic>8 kHz</italic>, it did not generate somatic action potential in FrA pyramidal neurons. While the absence of spiking could have been caused by the anesthesia, it is known that the non-linear interaction between compartmentalized streams of neural activity also induces long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dudman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larkum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGaugh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement, we found that the activation of BLA neurons during <italic>WGN</italic> affected subsequent spontaneous activity more robustly and for a longer period of time than during <italic>8 kHz</italic>. Although this effect was analyzed no longer than 30 s after the end of the stimulation, it also prompts the speculation that the alteration of FrA membrane potential evoked by the BLA+<italic>WGN</italic> nonlinearities might reflect a global brain state change which would modify the integration of future incoming sensory inputs, such as it occurs during consecutive pairing upon conditioning.</p><p>The mechanism by which these BLA-mediated nonlinearities affect learning remains unclear. The BLA presumably transfers information to the FrA that is relevant for fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, inhibiting the activity of FrA neurons during CS-, or BLA neurons projecting to the FrA, attenuated freezing responses in response to CS+ during recall. However, this counterintuitive effect occurred only when <italic>WGN</italic>, but not <italic>8 kHz</italic> tone, was used as CS- during conditioning (protocol 1). This alteration of learning is unlikely to be the consequence of insufficient activation of the BLA. Instead, given the low number of BLA neurons expressing ArchT and their precise inhibition during CS-, an alternative explanation is that when <italic>WGN</italic> is combined with the activation of BLA projecting axons, which is maximal between conditioning trials, it might promote the representation of sensory cues predicting threat (i.e. CS+, <italic>8 kHz</italic>) within the FrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall, 2002</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the late modification of membrane potential fluctuations observed after the activation of BLA with <italic>WGN</italic> presentation, which occurred when an <italic>8 kHz</italic> tone was presented during conditioning. Interestingly, omitting CS-/WGN during fear conditioning does not prevent learning. However, freezing responses during recall were significantly lower than when CS- were presented between conditioning trials, but similar to those obtained when FrA or BLA-to-FrA neurons were inhibited during CS. Taken together, it indicates that the BLA-mediated, non-linear integration of <italic>WGN</italic> in FrA neurons between conditioning trials facilitates the acquisition of fear memory traces.</p><p>BLA neurons send multiple projections to cortical and subcortical areas that have been shown to project also to the FrA. It is thus possible that the information is transmitted from the BLA to the FrA through an indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Price, 2003</xref>). Here, we found that BLA-to-FrA neurons do not send axonal collaterals to the mPFC. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 in BLA neurons makes it possible to monitor optically the activity of target-specific BLA axons during learning. Using this strategy in awake mice, we demonstrate for the first time that BLA-to-FrA axons are progressively recruited upon successive conditioning trials, thereby ruling out the indirect activation of the FrA circuit. First, we show that BLA-to-FrA axonal activity is never affected by the presentation of auditory cues alone. Our data contrast with previous work showing an increase in local field potential and unit activity in the BLA upon auditory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins and Paré, 2000</xref>), and suggest instead the existence of a subpopulation of BLA neurons projecting specifically to the FrA that might play a specific role during the learning of emotion. Although it remains unknown whether BLA axons might convey contextual information to the FrA, they seem to transmit integrated information about the association itself. First, these axons are activated only after the first CS+/US pairing. Then, the level of activity of BLA-to-FrA axons was stronger between conditioning trials (i.e. during CS- presentation) and correlated with learning performance. This suggests a putative <italic>Hebbian</italic>-like frontal mechanism that could integrate any Gaussian noise that is contiguous to the maximal activation of BLA-to-FrA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larkum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2015</xref>). Supporting this idea, we found that <italic>WGN</italic> but not <italic>8 kHz</italic>-dendritic and somatic signaling were reduced in conditioned mice in a learning-dependent manner, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent plasticity mechanisms in FrA neurons were engaged during fear learning. While this mechanism would occur only if <italic>WGN</italic> is presented between conditioning trials (and thus used as CS-), it might eventually facilitate the recruitment of neurons into specific cue memory traces. Dendritic plateau potentials have been shown to regulate synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Humeau and Lüthi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>), which might subsequently facilitate the stabilization or pruning of synaptic inputs during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holtmaat and Caroni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In support of the latter, the level of fear learning has been shown to correlate with the percentage of spine elimination in FrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai et al., 2012</xref>) which possibly explains the negative relation we observed during anesthesia between <italic>WGN</italic>/(CS-)-evoked subthreshold depolarizations and the strength of learning.</p><p>Collectively, our data reveal the specific properties of Gaussian noise in FrA during fear conditioning. The question arises as to the function or benefit of Gaussian noise in the BLA-to-FrA circuit during learning. Previous studies highlighted the critical function of the BLA in attention for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laviolette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons is independent of the nature of the CS presented. It thus seems unlikely that BLA-to-FrA axons convey the emotional valence of this association. In addition, the activation of BLA alone, while necessary, is not sufficient to trigger learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>). BLA neurons might signal to frontal circuits any new association independently of its valence, which might subsequently be assigned by the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klavir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Likhtik and Paz, 2015</xref>). While acoustic noise is often viewed as a disturbing variable, it can enhance signal processing, facilitate sensory signaling and improve cognitive performance, notably in individuals with poor attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonnell and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonnell and Ward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stein et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, given that noise is abundant in the environment and communication of most mammals, it might facilitate learning in coordination with BLA-to-FrA inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council Committee (2011): Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th ed.

Briefly, after skull’s exposure a <sub>~ </sub>5 mm plastic chamber was attached on the area of interest and a 3 mm craniotomy was made on the right hemisphere above FrA and M2, with a pneumatic dental drill, leaving the dura intact. The craniotomy was covered with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) and sealed with a 3-mm glass cover slip after viral injection (for imaging experiments). The chamber, the cover slip and a custom-made stainless steel head stage were well attached to the skull using dental acrylic and dental cement (Jet Repair Acrylic, Lang Dental Manufacturing).</p><p>To evaluate the viral expression profiles in BLA and FrA, fixed brain slices were imaged post-hoc using a wide-field epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse N-iU). Illumination was set such that the full dynamic range of the 16-bit images was utilized. A two-dimensional graph of the intensities of pixel was plot using Fiji Software. 16-bit images’ brightness was processed and masks were registered to the corresponding coronal plates (ranging from −1.94 to −2.70 mm) of the mouse brain atlas using Illustrator (Adobe), at various distances anterior (FrA) or posterior (BLA) to the bregma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fear conditioning and quantification of learning</title><p>At least 5 days before starting behavioral experiments, mice went through handling with the same experimenter that performed the experiments in order to decrease stress. For consistency across experiments, mice were then habituated to auditory tones during three successive days. During habituation, mice were placed on the conditioning compartment (context A, consisting of a squared box with a grid floor that allows the delivery of a foot shock and with home cage litter under; cleaned between individuals with 70% ethanol). Two conditional auditory stimuli (CS) (8 kHz pure tone; and white Gaussian noise (WGN); each composed of 27 pips, 50 ms in duration, 0.9 Hz for 30 s) were presented four times with a 80 dB sound pressure level and variable inter stimulus interval (ISI). The freezing time during each CS presentation was measured and the mice returned to their home cage. Mice were fear conditioned 24 hr after the last habituation phase by using a classical differential protocol. Briefly, mice were exposed to context A and five auditory tones (CS+) were paired with the unconditional stimulus (US, 1 s foot-shock, 0.6 mA). The onset of US coincided with the CS+ offset. 5 CS- presentations were intermingled with CS+ presentations with a variable (10–60 s) ISI. CS were counterbalanced with WGN and 8 kHz pure tones being used as CS+ and CS-, respectively. Both CS+ and CS- have always the same duration (30 s each) regardless of their spectral properties, with the same number of pips (27 pips at 0.9 Hz). Only the delays between the end of a pairing (CS+/footshock) and the beginning of the next CS-, as well as the delays between the end of a CS- and the beginning of the next CS+ have been chosen randomly during conditioning. Recall tests were carried out 24, 48, and 72 hr after the conditioning phase by measuring the freezing time during the presentation of 2 CS+ and 2 CS- in a new context (context B, consisting of a cylindrical white compartment with home cage litter on the floor; cleaned between individuals with septanios MD 2%).</p><p>For optogenetic experiments using <italic>archeorhodopsin</italic> (ArchT) or GFP controls, mice were subjected to the same behavioral protocol described above. Optogenetic inhibition of FrA neurons or BLA-to-FrA projections upon CS presentation was achieved during the conditioning phase by synchronizing each pip (50 ms) composing the CS+ or the CS- with a 50-ms-laser pulse. For the experiments in which the conditioning phase was taken place under the two-photon microscope, the context consisted of the microscope shading box in which the mice were head-restrained in a custom tube containing a shocking grid at the bottom. CS and US presentations were triggered by a MATLAB routine, associated to a pulse-stimulator (Master-8, A.M.P.I) capable of triggering the foot shock. For somatic and dendritic calcium imaging experiments, behavior was assessed at least 6 hr after imaging sessions. For whole-cell recordings experiments, mice were anesthetized and prepare for patch recordings immediately after behavior.</p><p>For each behavioral session, the total time duration (s) of freezing episodes upon CS+ and CS- presentation was quantified automatically using a fire-wire CCD-camera connected to an automated freezing detection software (AnyMaze, Ugo Basile, Italy), and expressed as % of freezing. Learning index was further quantified for each CS by multiplying the % of freezing in each condition by the corresponding index of discrimination by using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Learning index &lt;20% during recall was considered as a failure of conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo whole cell recordings</title><p>Isoflurane (4% with ~0.5 l min<sup>−1</sup> O<sub>2</sub>) combined with an i.p. injection of urethane (1.5 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, in lactated ringer solution containing in [mM] 102 NaCl, 28 Na L Lactate, 4 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was used to induce anesthesia and prolonged by supplementary urethane (0.15 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) if necessary. To prevent risks of inflammation, brain swelling and salivary excretions, 40 µl of dexamethasone (dexadreson, 0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>, i.m.) and glycopyrrolate (Robinul-V, 0.01 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, s.c.) were injected before the surgery. Adequate anesthesia (absence of toe pinch and corneal reflexes, and vibrissae movements) was constantly checked and body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a heating-pad positioned underneath the animal. Ophthalmic gel was applied to prevent eye dehydration. Analgesia was provided as described for viral injection (with lidocaine and buprenorphine). After disinfection of the skin (with modified ethanol 70% and betadine), the skull was exposed and a ~3 mm plastic chamber was attached to it above the prefrontal cortex using a combination of super glue (Loctite) and dental acrylic and dental cement (Jet Repair Acrylic, Lang Dental Manufacturing). A small ~1×1 mm craniotomy centered above the FrA (+2.8 mm from bregma, ±1.0 mm midline) was made using a pneumatic dental drill, leaving the dura intact.</p><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of L2/3 pyramidal neurons were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>) Briefly, high-positive pressure (200–300 mbar) was applied to the pipette (5–8 MΩ) to prevent tip occlusion, when passing the pia. Immediately after, the positive pressure was reduced to prevent cortical damage. The pipette resistance was monitored in the conventional voltage clamp configuration during the descendent pathway through the cortex (until −200 µm from the surface) of 1 µm steps. When the pipette resistance abruptly increased, the 3–5 GΩ seal was obtained by decreasing the positive pressure. After break-in, Vm was measured, and dialysis was allowed to occur for at least 5 min before launching the recording protocols. Current-clamp recordings were made using a potassium-based internal solution (in mM: 135 potassium gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 25 µM, pH adjusted to 7.25 with KOH, 285 mOsM), and acquired using a Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular Devices). Spontaneous activity was recorded prior, during, and after the presentation of auditory stimulation. Spiking pattern of patched cells was analyzed to identify pyramidal neurons. dAP5 (1 mM, Tocris) was topically applied to the dura mater, before whole cell recordings. Offline analysis was performed using custom routines written in Sigmaplot (Systat), IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics) and Matlab (Mathworks).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo optogenetics</title><p>After virus injection for ChR2 or ArchT expression, mice were subsequently implanted with fiber optic cannula for optogenetics (CFML22U, Thorlabs) in the BLA. The optic fibers were previously cleaved with a fiber optic scribe (S90R, Thorlabs) at 4.5 mm for BLA. The cannula were guided and stereotaxically inserted inside the brain with the help of a cannula holder (XCL, Thorlabs) through the same burr hole used for the viral injections (BLA coordinates from bregma: AP, −1.3 mm; DV, −4.5 mm; ML,±2.9 mm) and secured in place with a mix of super glue (Loctite) and dental acrylic and dental cement (Jet Repair Acrylic, Lang Dental Manufacturing). Anesthesia was reversed using AFB-mix for mice assigned to behavioral experiments. For in vivo photostimulation of ChR2-expressing BLA neurons, the fiber optic cannula and the optogenetic patch cable (M83L01, Thorlabs) were connected through a ceramic split mating sleeve (ADAL1, Thorlabs). The patch cable was then coupled to a blue DPSS laser (SDL-473-050MFL, Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology) which was triggered by a pulse-stimulator (Master-9, A.M.P.I), able to synchronize 50 ms laser pulses with 50 ms sound pips composing the CS. For inhibition of BLA-to-FrA projections during learning, in vivo bilateral optic stimulation of ArchT-expressing neurons was achieved by coupling the optic fibers implanted in BLA to a multimode fiber optic coupler (FCMH2-FCL, Thorlabs), with a ceramic split mating sleeve, and subsequently connected to a yellow DPSS laser (SDL-LH-1500, Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro whole-cell recordings</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively) and cardiac-perfused with ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution (NMDG) containing (in mM): 93 NMDG, 93 HCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 Glucose, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 Sodium Ascorbate, 3 Sodium Pyruvate, 2 Thiourea, and 12 mM N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (pH 7.3–7.4, with osmolarity of 300–310 mOsm).

Coronal slices (300 μm) were prepared using a Vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, USA) and transferred to an incubation chamber held at 32°C and containing the same NMDG cutting solution.

The MES Software (MES v.4.6; Femtonics, Budapest, Hungary) was used to control the microscope, the acquisition parameters, and the TTL-driven synchronization between the acquisition and auditory/footshock stimuli. The GCaMPs were excited using a Ti:sapphire laser operating at λ = 910 nm (Mai Tai DeepSee, Spectra-Physics) with an average excitation power at the focal point lower than 50 mW. Time-series images were acquired within a field-of-view of 300 × 300 µm (256 lines, 1 ms/line) for axons; for dendrite: 200 × 60 µm (64 lines, 0.5 ms/line). Each imaging session consisted of 30 s of baseline recording followed by eight Gaussian and eight pure (8 kHz)-tone auditory stimuli delivered with pseudo-random delays. We imaged on average 3500 frames (~900 s) per session, and no visible photo-bleaching was observed. Images were then analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>) using Fiji and Matlab (Mathworks). We registered images over time and corrected XY motion artifacts within a single imaging session by using cross-correlation based on rigid body translation (Stack aligner, Image J, NIH, USA). Motion corrections were then assessed by computing pair-wise 2D correlation coefficient (Image correlation, Image J, NIH, USA), and frames were discarded from the analysis if lower than 0.7. Regions of interest (ROIs) putative axonal boutons were selected and drawn manually. All pixels within each ROI were first averaged providing a single time-series of raw fluorescence. To limit the effect of fluorescence drift over time, the baseline fluorescence (<italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic>) was calculated as the mean of the lower 50% of previous 3 s fluorescence values. Change in fluorescence (<italic>ΔF<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>0</sub></italic>) was defined as <italic>(F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub></italic>, were <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic> is the fluorescence intensity at time <italic>t (</italic>time of the first pixel in each frame). Calcium events were then detected using a template-based method with a custom library of calcium transients. Templates were created by extracting and averaging segments of data that were visually identified as corresponding to a transient. Calcium transients whose peak amplitude reached a 3 X background standard deviation threshold were further considered for analysis. Each detected event was inspected visually and analysis was restricted to detected events rather than on raw fluorescence. For extracting spatial profiles of dendritic calcium events, small ROIs of 2 × 2 pixels are generated along the dendrite in Fiji. The spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events was then quantified by calculating the full-width at half-max (fwhm, expressed as % of total dendritic length) of the normalized Gaussian fit at the time when the averaged ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was maximal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Experiments and analysis were conducted blind to the operator.

All statistics were performed using Matlab (Mathworks) and Sigmaplot (Systat) with an α significant level set at 0.05. Normality of all value distributions and the equality of variance between different distributions were first assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene median tests, respectively. Standard parametric tests were only used when data passed the normality and equal variance tests. Non-parametric tests were used otherwise. Only two-sided tests were used. When applicable, pair-wise multiple post-hoc comparisons were done by using the Holm-Sidak method. No statistical methods were used to estimate sample size, but β-power values were calculated for parametric tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Deforges, E Normand, and B Darracq (Imetronic) for their technical expertise and support, and A Holtmaat and S Valerio (AquiNeuro) for their critical reading of our manuscript, and all the members of the Gambino laboratory for technical assistance and helpful discussions.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Aime et al. presents a large sets of technically challenging and impressive experiments studying the cellular and circuit mechanisms of discriminative fear learning in the frontal association cortex (FrA). Using recording and modulatory approaches, the authors show that white Gaussian noise (WGN) causes greater depolarization than pure tones, more local dendritic events than pure frequency tones in both the anaesthetized and awake preparation, is differentially modulated by photo-inhibition of FrA during discriminative conditioning (when in the role of CS-). Further, axons within the FrA from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) increased activity between conditioning trials, and predicted the level of auditory fear learning. The topic is of broad interest and the approach taken considers both the cellular and circuit dynamics underlying discriminative fear learning. The authors have addressed the concerns of the reviewers in a previous submission of the manuscript, however, some outstanding concerns remain (detailed below) which we believe can be addressed through revisions in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the main concerns echoed by all reviewers (and was also something noted in the previous version of the manuscript) was the idea of &quot;unique properties of WGN over frequency modulated and pure tone frequency&quot;. This appears to be true for the stimuli tested, however, the chirps and pure frequencies did not cover the same frequency range as the WGN. Put simply, the WGN included frequencies up to 20 kHz, whereas the pure tones and linear chirps only involved frequencies between 4 and 8 kHz. Also, although the chirp stimuli was more complex (and probably involves more cortical processing than pure tones), it is still not comparable to WGN (as clearly shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Therefore, it remains that the 'unique properties' of the WGN stimuli that result in greater neural activity might simply be due to the different frequencies and complexity of the auditory stimuli used. This needs to be made explicit in the manuscript.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, FrA neurons decrease voltage under NMDAR blockade. The authors state that “this suggests that a fraction of the NMDAR conductances recruited by auditory stimulations is masked by non-specific inhibition under control conditions”. However, the “hyperpolarization” is reported from the voltage change during NMDA block (i.e. zeroed to baseline). Couldn't the inhibition reported also be a reflection of the decrease in conductance through NMDA channels (and other Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent channels)?</p><p>3) The finding that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons supports the non-linear integration of auditory tones is interesting. However, non-linear integration typically leads to the generation of action potentials. Clarification on whether there was a change in evoked action potentials during the combined stimulus is necessary. In addition, please clarify why when paired with activation of BLA axons, both WGN and pure tones resulted in a larger than expected change in membrane voltage given that pure tones are not encoded in the PFC.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that &quot;our data indicate that BLA-to-FrA synapses are likely to be weak and unreliable&quot;. This conclusion is surprising based on the evoked responses recorded in vitro (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), especially considering the input presumably lands on the distal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Was the response modulated by different intensities of the photo-activating LED light?</p><p>5) Why does the influence of the auditory stimulus significantly outlast the stimulus presentation? Does the difference between CS- and CS+ in the learner mice return to “unlearnt” (naïve) mice over time?</p><p>6) The behavioural/optogenetic results clearly show the influence of WGN is specific to CS-. However, the BLA-FrA axonal imaging data is less convincing. Could BLA-FrA axons be signaling the contextual threat of the situation with no specificity to CS+ or CS-?</p><p>7) WGN dendritic and somatic activity is reduced after fear conditioning. The authors suggest this is due to plasticity however since the encoding of WGN is similar to pure tones after conditioning. Wouldn't this make more difficult to discriminate?</p><p>8) Figure clarification. It is difficult to compare the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity based on events / dendrite in Figure 2. Please convert to frequency or a measure that can be compared with other conditions. Aside from the fwhm, was there any difference in the waveform (amplitude/duration) of the evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> between the different auditory stimuli? Overall, Figure 3 is difficult to interpret. 3D and 3H should be split into different graphs for protocol type, as it is currently impossible to separate the conditions. In Figure 4F, when was the stimulus presented? Why is the cumulative distribution taken over 40 seconds? How was the cumulative ∆F/F calculated?</p><p>9) Are the fear conditioning protocols equally effective in inducing fear memories? Compared to control mice (Figure 3), there appears to be a big difference in the GFP controls during the different protocols in Figure 6. Was this significant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62594.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the main concerns echoed by all reviewers (and was also something noted in the previous version of the manuscript) was the idea of &quot;unique properties of WGN over frequency modulated and pure tone frequency&quot;. This appears to be true for the stimuli tested, however, the chirps and pure frequencies did not cover the same frequency range as the WGN. Put simply, the WGN included frequencies up to 20 kHz, whereas the pure tones and linear chirps only involved frequencies between 4 and 8 kHz. Also, although the chirp stimuli was more complex (and probably involves more cortical processing than pure tones), it is still not comparable to WGN (as clearly shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Therefore, it remains that the “unique properties” of the WGN stimuli that result in greater neural activity might simply be due to the different frequencies and complexity of the auditory stimuli used. This needs to be made explicit in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the dendritic mechanism we describe is very likely not restricted to WGN during learning and might apply to other complex tones including natural tones. Thus, to make it more explicit we have discarded the term “unique”, and we have added the following sentences in the first and second paragraphs of the Discussion:</p><p>“Thus, despite the dendritic and somatic properties of WGN that we observed in the FrA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), it remains likely that other complex tones, including natural tones or more complex frequency-modulated tones covering a wider spectrum of pure frequencies, could also facilitate learning in a similar way than WGN”.</p><p>“… In support of our hypothesis, we found that simple linear chirps produced more somatic depolarization than pure tones. This further suggests that more complex frequency-modulated tones could theoretically also activate FrA pyramidal neurons and affect fear learning like WGN did”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, FrA neurons decrease voltage under NMDAR blockade. The authors state that “this suggests that a fraction of the NMDAR conductances recruited by auditory stimulations is masked by non-specific inhibition under control conditions”. However, the “hyperpolarization” is reported from the voltage change during NMDA block (i.e. zeroed to baseline). Couldn't the inhibition reported also be a reflection of the decrease in conductance through NMDA channels (and other Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent channels)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed experiments during which we presented different tones on the same cell before and after the blockade of NMDAR (Figure 1—figure supplement 2G-I). This figure shows single cell example of membrane fluctuation upon WGN (G, left) and 8 kHz (G, right) before and after dAP5 application (colored bars represent averaged Vm over 1 sec time window).</p><p>Tones’ presentation hyperpolarized membrane potential when NMDAR are blocked (G-H, middle), whilst 10 sec before auditory stimulation Vm is not affected while NMDAR are already blocked. We concluded that the hyperpolarization depended on effects (such as local inhibitory balance) that are counteracted by NMDAR conductances under baseline conditions. During NMDAR block, this “inhibitory” component becomes visible, and probably reflect a classic feedforward circuit.</p><p>However, we have not tested whether this effect was effectively mediated by inhibition, and we agree with the reviewers that alternative explanations still exist. Therefore, we have modified the sentence: “This suggests that a fraction of the NMDAR conductances recruited by auditory stimulations is masked under control conditions, and that both WGN and pure tones might activate dendrites”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that the activation of BLA-to-FrA axons supports the non-linear integration of auditory tones is interesting. However, non-linear integration typically leads to the generation of action potentials. Clarification on whether there was a change in evoked action potentials during the combined stimulus is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>The BLA+WGN nonlinearities were much stronger than those generated by BLA+8 kHz. However, it failed to produce any somatic action potential in FrA pyramidal neurons during the stimulation. This is now clearly stated in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>We agree that the supra-linear summation of convergent excitatory inputs facilitate the propagation of distal dendritic spikes, which might eventually support the generation of somatic action potential<sup>1,2</sup>. Nevertheless, while the absence of spiking could have been caused by the anesthesia, dendritic spikes and non-linear integration also support other functions, and might induce for example long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability<sup>1,3–7</sup>. As an example, we have shown that the non-linear integration of distinct thalamic inputs does not lead to somatic action-potential in cortical pyramidal, but facilitates instead synaptic plasticity<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>We now acknowledge the fact that the function of these BLA-mediated nonlinearities remains unclear during learning (“The mechanism by which these BLA-mediated nonlinearities affect learning remains unclear”). We also have modified the third paragraph of our Discussion to introduce these two alternatives:</p><p>“…it is possible that the modest activation of BLA synapses in FrA apical dendrites facilitates or gates the propagation towards the soma of tone-evoked dendritic events which could enhance the generation of somatic action potential <sup>1,2</sup>. […] Nevertheless, although the BLA+WGN nonlinearities were much stronger than those generated by BLA+8 kHz, it failed to produce any somatic action potential in FrA pyramidal neurons”.</p><p>“While the absence of spiking could have been caused by the anesthesia, another explanation would be that the non-linear interaction between compartmentalized streams of neural activity induces long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability <sup>1,3–7</sup>. […] Although this effect was analyzed no longer than 30 sec after the end of the stimulation, it also prompts the speculation that the lasting alteration of FrA membrane potential evoked by the BLA+<italic>WGN</italic> non-linearities might reflect a global brain state change which would modify the integration of future incoming sensory inputs, such as it occurs during consecutive pairing upon conditioning”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, please clarify why when paired with activation of BLA axons, both WGN and pure tones resulted in a larger than expected change in membrane voltage given that pure tones are not encoded in the PFC.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data indicate that pure tones hyperpolarized pyramidal neurons in the presence of dAP5 or iMK801, thus revealing a small NMDAR component that was masked under control conditions (please see point 2 above). We have added the following sentence in the Results section: “This suggests that a fraction of the NMDAR conductances recruited by auditory stimulations is masked under control conditions, and that both WGN and pure tones might activate dendrites. However, on average, the NMDAR-mediated component of the evoked cVm change was much larger in response to WGN…”.</p><p>We believe that this small activation during pure tone presentation can be potentiated when BLA inputs are co-activated, although to a much lesser extent as compared to WGN. Altogether, our data indicate that both input streams together are required to generate non-linearity, and that “BLA axons are necessary to produce non-linear integration of auditory inputs in FrA neurons, which is stronger for Gaussian noise than for pure tones”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that &quot;our data indicate that BLA-to-FrA synapses are likely to be weak and unreliable&quot;. This conclusion is surprising based on the evoked responses recorded in vitro (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), especially considering the input presumably lands on the distal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Was the response modulated by different intensities of the photo-activating LED light?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Several possibilities could explain the difference between in vivo and in vitro experiments. The first perhaps lies in the nature of the stimulation (LED have relatively high divergence, causing the power of the LED to be spread across the field of view). Second, we have used in vivo the same laser intensity than for behavioral experiments. Although this was not necessarily the most effective intensity, we haven’t tested higher intensities for the sake of consistency between experiments. Third, and most importantly, it is known that cortical neurons in vivo are spontaneously active both under anesthesia and during quiet wakefulness, with specific pattern of up and down spontaneous states that might profoundly affect the responses to specific stimulations<sup>8</sup>. For example, in the barrel cortex, spontaneous up states inhibit sensory-evoked responses, which are smaller, briefer and spatially more confined than during down states<sup>9</sup>. In agreement, we observed that “BLA-to-FrA inputs were mostly undetectable in vivo and became visible only when the stimulation was delivered during down states, suggesting that BLA-to-FrA inputs in vivo are likely to be modified by on-going spontaneous activity”.</p><p>We also have clarified these points in the second paragraph of the Discussion: “However, and in contrast to what we observed in vitro, the photo-stimulation of ChR2-expressing BLA neurons in vivo at an intensity similar to the one used in behavioral experiments, produced depolarizations in FrA pyramidal neurons that were rather weak and unreliable. The difference between in vitro and in vivo conditions may reflect the interaction between evoked responses and on-going spontaneous activity that occurs in vivo<sup>8</sup>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why does the influence of the auditory stimulus significantly outlast the stimulus presentation? Does the difference between CS- and CS+ in the learner mice return to “unlearnt” (naïve) mice over time?</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an interesting point. While the mechanisms remain unclear, it has been shown that cortical circuits with local recurrent connections can generate self-sustaining activity that can be turned on for long period of time by brief synaptic inputs, causing possibly changes in the global brain state (such as it occurs during switching from asleep to conscious)<sup>8,10–12</sup>. For example, in vivo recordings of striatal neurons in urethane-anaesthetized rats revealed that brief non-physiological stimuli cause a long-lasting depolarized state with fast, low-amplitude modulations that persisted until the cortex resumed ~1 Hz synchronous activity<sup>11</sup>. We have added the following sentence in the second paragraph of the Discussion to introduce this possibility: “These depolarizations persisted beyond the end of the stimulation, possibly reflecting changes in the dynamics of network activity through local recurrent connections”.</p><p>The second question, while interesting, is difficult to address with our current data set. We did not record somatic depolarizations from mice several days after learning, and we cannot answer whether the difference between CS- and CS+ in mice that learned (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) returns to baseline level observed in naïve mice, in other words if fear extinction also affects FrA pyramidal neurons by opposite mechanisms. Nonetheless, a comment on the results description was added to leave this as an open question: “Whether the effect of learning on FrA pyramidal neurons is cancelled following fear extinction remains unknown and would be interesting to explore”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The behavioural/optogenetic results clearly show the influence of WGN is specific to CS-. However, the BLA-FrA axonal imaging data is less convincing. Could BLA-FrA axons be signaling the contextual threat of the situation with no specificity to CS+ or CS-?</p></disp-quote><p>The encoding of context representation is supposed to involve hippocampal-BLA communication during learning<sup>13</sup>. Whether the BLA sends this information to the FrA remains unknown. However, we found that “the averaged cumulative ΔF/F0 measured during CS- was always higher than during CS+ …, revealing that the overall activity of BLA-to-FrA axons was stronger between conditioning trials, notably at the time when CS- occurred”.</p><p>We believe these data go against the signaling of the contextual threat as one would expect in that case no difference between CS+ and CS-. However, answering this question would require to image the same set of axons before/after learning in the same conditioning context. Given that we did not perform these specific experiments, this possibility remains and we have added the following sentence in the Discussion: “Although it remains unknown whether BLA axons might convey contextual information to the FrA, they seem to transmit integrated information about the association itself…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) WGN dendritic and somatic activity is reduced after fear conditioning. The authors suggest this is due to plasticity however since the encoding of WGN is similar to pure tones after conditioning. Wouldn't this make more difficult to discriminate?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. From our point of view, the fact that after learning, the dendritic activity triggered by WGN and pure tone is similar (as captured by dendritic calcium imaging in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and somatic whole-cell recordings in Figure 3—figure supplement 3) does not mean that the local network has less capacity to discriminate both stimuli after learning, but instead that it has less capacity to learn again from the same stimuli after conditioning. In fact, cVm change after conditioning correlates with the learning index (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D). If the changes observed were correlated with poor discrimination between CS+ and CS-, one would expect a correlation with fear generalization or absence of learning, instead of learning. In that context, the non-linear integration of WGN and BLA inputs would not be critical after learning once memories are formed, but might facilitate during learning the recruitment of FrA neurons into memory traces.</p><p>Nevertheless, the question of how dendritic activity is translated during or shortly after learning into action potential (in other words, how pyramidal neurons are recruited into memory traces) is impossible to address with our current data set, and would require the chronic imaging of FrA activity at the population level. We have modified the manuscript in order to accommodate this point:</p><p>“In addition, WGN-induced somatic plateau potentials were reduced in conditioned animals in a learning-dependent manner, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent plasticity mechanisms in FrA neurons were engaged during learning (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). […] This suggest that, while dendritic signaling appears critical during learning to recruit pyramidal neurons into memory traces, other circuit and cellular mechanisms are at play to discriminate sensory cues after learning”.</p><p>“While this mechanism would occur only if WGN is presented between conditioning trials (and thus used as CS-), it might eventually facilitate the recruitment of neurons into specific cue memory traces”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure clarification. It is difficult to compare the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity based on events / dendrite in Figure 2. Please convert to frequency or a measure that can be compared with other conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 2 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aside from the fwhm, was there any difference in the waveform (amplitude/duration) of the evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> between the different auditory stimuli?</p></disp-quote><p>The amplitudes of calcium transient were not different between the different tones. We now provide these data in the Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, Figure 3 is difficult to interpret. Figure 3D and H should be split into different graphs for protocol type, as it is currently impossible to separate the conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 3 to split experimental conditions into different panels. The manuscript and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 have been adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4F, when was the stimulus presented? Why is the cumulative distribution taken over 40 seconds? How was the cumulative ∆F/F calculated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 4F to include the stimulus epoch (0-30 sec). The cumulative ∆F/F was calculated over 40 sec but the analysis was done at 30 sec (end of the stimulation).The cumulative ∆F/F corresponds to the integral of all calcium transients detected during this period of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Are the fear conditioning protocols equally effective in inducing fear memories? Compared to control mice (Figure 3), there appears to be a big difference in the GFP controls during the different protocols in Figure 6. Was this significant?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. To exclude any human or experimental bias, we have performed and analyzed the optogenetic experiments blind to the genotype (GFP or ArchT). Protocols 1 and 2 are indeed not equally effective. We pooled all our control mice together (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E) and freezing responses after protocol 2 were significantly lower than after protocol 1, but were similar to those produced after protocol 1 when CS- was omitted during learning.</p><p>This suggests that: (1) fear conditioning with protocol 1 (CS+: 8kHz tone, CS-: WGN) tends to produce more fear responses during recall than with protocol 2; (2) WGN, when used as CS- during conditioning, facilitated learning.
