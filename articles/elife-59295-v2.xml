ROS-mediated oxidation of host membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) generates the toxic alpha-beta carbonyl 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Although studied extensively in the context of sterile inflammation, research into 4-HNE’s role during infection remains limited. Here, we found that 4-HNE is generated during bacterial infection, that it impacts growth and survival in a range of bacteria, and that the intracellular pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> induces many genes in response to 4-HNE exposure. A component of the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> 4-HNE response is the expression of the genes <italic>lmo0103</italic> and <italic>lmo0613,</italic> deemed <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> (<bold>r</bold>eductase of <bold>h</bold>ost <bold>a</bold>lkenals), respectively, which code for two NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that convert 4-HNE to the product 4-hydroxynonanal (4-HNA). Loss of these genes had no impact on <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> bacterial burdens during murine or tissue culture infection. However, heterologous expression of <italic>rha1/2</italic> in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> significantly increased bacterial resistance to 4-HNE in vitro and promoted bacterial survival following phagocytosis by murine macrophages in an ROS-dependent manner. Thus, Rha1 and Rha2 are not necessary for 4-HNE resistance in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> but are sufficient to confer resistance to an otherwise sensitive organism in vitro and in host cells. Our work demonstrates that 4-HNE is a previously unappreciated component of ROS-mediated toxicity encountered by bacteria within eukaryotic hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Listeria monocytogenes</kwd><kwd>4-HNE</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id id="_idgpn_145" institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution id="_idgpn_74">National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHS NRSA T32GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name id="_idgpn_151"><surname>Tabakh</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name id="_idgpn_152"><surname>Pollock</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McFarland</surname><given-names>Adelle P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI116669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woodward</surname><given-names>Joshua J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI127833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woodward</surname><given-names>Joshua J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30CA239659-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaver</surname><given-names>Shivam A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI055396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glover</surname><given-names>Rochelle C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal is a novel component of the host antimicrobial reactive oxygen burst, and the bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> encodes genes specifically for its detoxification.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune detection of bacterial infection initiates a complex inflammatory response characterized by production of cytokines and small molecule mediators involved in driving antimicrobial immunity. A key aspect of intrinsic cellular immunity is the production of highly reactive molecules, including reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan and Cunningham-Bussel, 2013</xref>). ROS and RNS encompass a broad group of distinct molecules, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, and superoxide, among others. Unlike adaptive immune responses, which are highly specific toward infectious agents, ROS and RNS exhibit broad toxicity toward biological systems through their capacity to react with lipid, amino acid, and nucleic acid moieties that are conserved among both eukaryotic hosts and invading microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobson, 1996</xref>). While such indiscriminate noxious metabolite production provides protection against infection, many bacterial pathogens have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to directly detoxify or repair damaged cellular components following ROS and RNS encounters, such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, and nitric oxide reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staerck et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While many of the distinct chemical agents that comprise ROS and RNS are well characterized molecular components of the innate immune response, these molecules give rise to numerous secondary metabolites that may also contribute to host defense against infection. An initial characteristic of the inflammatory response is the mobilization of arachidonic acid from cellular membranes. Although arachidonic acid is most commonly thought of as the chemical precursor of eicosanoids, upon exposure to oxygen radicals derived from the ROS burst it undergoes a peroxide-mediated structural rearrangement, leading to the generation of breakdown products, the best studied and most abundant of which is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a highly reactive membrane-permeable molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanna and Hafez, 2018</xref>). Over the last 40 years, the production of 4-HNE has been well documented at sites of sterile inflammation and has been associated with many disease pathologies, including atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uchida et al., 1994</xref>), Alzheimers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sayre et al., 2002</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pillon et al., 2012</xref>), obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rahman et al., 2002</xref>), and chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paradis et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>4-HNE’s toxicity is driven by its highly reactive αβ-unsaturated aldehyde, which is subject to both Michael addition and electrophilic addition to the aldehyde. 4-HNE is thus highly reactive against all nucleophilic moieties present in the cell, including amino acids, nucleotides and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dalleau et al., 2013</xref>). To combat this reactivity, eukaryotic organisms utilize detoxification enzymes including oxidoreductases that reduce the carbon-carbon double bond to generate 4-hydroxynonanal (4-HNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Srivastata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mano et al., 2002</xref>), aldo-keto reductases that reduce the carbonyl group, forming the alcohol 1,4-dihydroxynonene (1,4-DHN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartley et al., 1995</xref>), and aldehyde dehydrogenases and P450s that oxidize the carbonyl bond to the corresponding carboxylic acid and 4-hydroxynonenic acid (4-HNEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amunom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guéraud, 2017</xref>). Michael addition by glutathione, a reaction that occurs spontaneously and is catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferases, forms glutathionyl-4-hydroxynonenal (GS-HNE), which is reduced to glutathionyl-1,4-dihydroxynonene (GS-DHN) by aldose reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramana et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to enzymatic detoxification, 4-HNE toxicity can be ameliorated non-enzymatically through buffering agents, including quenching reactions with the endogenous peptides carnosine and GHK (Gly-His-Lys), as well as the small molecule hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mol et al., 2017</xref>). Although reactive oxygen species generation and arachidonic acid mobilization and detoxification are well-known and well-studied components of innate immune responses, detailed studies characterizing the role of 4-HNE during infectious disease, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogens, are lacking.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that 4-HNE is generated during bacterial infection both in cell culture and in vivo. This mammalian metabolite is able to penetrate the bacterial cell envelope and access the cytoplasm, leading to bacterial growth delay or death. We observed that relative to a variety of bacterial species, the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is highly resistant to the bactericidal effects of 4-HNE and that a broad transcriptional response is induced by toxic 4-HNE exposure, including two genes <italic>lmo0103</italic> and <italic>lmo0613,</italic> deemed <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> (<bold>r</bold>eductase of <bold>h</bold>ost <bold>a</bold>lkenals), respectively. The loss of both <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> sensitizes <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to 4-HNE toxicity. Through in vitro analysis of recombinant Rha1 and Rha2, we found both enzymes reduce 4-HNE in an NADPH-dependent-manner to the saturated aldehyde 4-HNA. Importantly, when <italic>rha1/2</italic> are expressed in the 4-HNE sensitive and avirulent organism <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, they significantly increase bacterial survival in the presence of 4-HNE in vitro and following phagocytosis by murine macrophages in a manner dependent upon ROS generation. Our findings are consistent with the premise that 4-HNE is a heretofore unrecognized component of ROS-toxicity encountered by bacteria during infection and that detoxification mechanisms used to counteract 4-HNE-mediated cytotoxicity facilitate bacterial survival within eukaryotic hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>4-HNE accumulates during <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection</title><p>4-HNE is a highly reactive electrophilic αβ-unsaturated aldehyde that undergoes Michael addition with nucleophilic amino acids, resulting in stable conjugates that correlate with cellular levels of free 4-HNE.

Dot blots of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell lysates from bacteria exposed to increasing concentrations of 4-HNE indicated an accumulation of 4-HNE-protein adducts that correlated with increased 4-HNE exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), establishing that this aldehyde penetrates the bacterial cell envelope and impacts cytosolic proteins.</p><p>4-HNE adduct accumulation can result in protein misfolding and crosslink-induced aggregation. Eukaryotic cells clear 4-HNE damaged proteins through proteasome and autophagy-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Forman, 2017</xref>). Bacteria target damaged proteins for degradation through the proteases that comprise the heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parsell and Lindquist, 1993</xref>). Because this response is primarily transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yura et al., 1993</xref>), RT-qPCR was performed on a subset of genes representing two major groups of heat shock genes in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>: HrcA-regulated chaperones and CtsR-regulated proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roncarati and Scarlato, 2017</xref>). When <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was exposed to 640 µM 4-HNE for 20 min, the four genes tested (<italic>clpC, clpE, dnaK, groES</italic>) were induced 3-to-40-fold compared to vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data, combined with the dot blot results, support the hypothesis that 4-HNE causes protein damage to which <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> mounts a heat shock response. These observations are consistent with previous reports of electrophile stress induced expression of Clp proteases in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). To further explore this connection, bacteria were treated with increasing concentrations of 4-HNE prior to a sublethal heat shock (50°C for 10 min) and bacterial survival was determined by CFU analysis. Consistent with 4-HNE-induced proteotoxic stress, elevated levels of 4-HNE exposure sensitized the bacteria to heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The elevated induction of cellular proteases relative to chaperones may indicate that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> primarily combats electrophilic 4-HNE stress through turnover of damaged proteins rather than chaperone-mediated stabilization. Collectively, these observations suggest that despite the formation of protein adducts and delayed growth following exposure, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> has a robust capacity to survive 4-HNE toxicity, although its exposure sensitizes this organism to other proteotoxic stressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> expresses potential 4-HNE detoxification enzymes</title><p>Our data suggest that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is exposed to 4-HNE during infection and that only high concentrations of this aldehyde impact its growth.

To probe further, we performed global transcriptome analysis during 4-HNE exposure using RNA sequencing.

However, among the various stressors tested, the most robust induction of both <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> was with 4-HNE (300 and 500-fold, respectively), as we observed previously with the panel of aldehydes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed if <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> are induced by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> during intracellular infection.

We also show that 4-HNE exhibits antimicrobial effects in several bacterial species and that in the highly resistant intracellular pathogen <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, exposure to this aldehyde induces a broad and robust transcriptional profile. Among the highest induced genes are components of the heat shock response, consistent with aldehyde induced protein damage, a known effect of 4-HNE exposure. In addition, two genes, <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2,</italic> are highly and specifically induced by 4-HNE exposure, and these two enzymes reduce 4-HNE to 4-HNA in an NADPH-dependent manner in vitro. Disruption of <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> results in a decrease in viability in the presence of 4-HNE in vitro but not in vivo, and heterologous expression of <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, a non-pathogenic 4-HNE-sensitive organism, conferred increased tolerance to 4-HNE toxicity. Rha1 and Rha2 expression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> also allowed for greater survival following phagocytosis by bone-marrow-derived macrophages in a manner entirely dependent upon phagocyte ROS generation. Together this work supports the conclusion that 4-HNE represents one of the individual molecular components of ROS-mediated host defense through its direct antimicrobial effects on bacteria and that pathogens have likely evolved complex mechanisms of surviving its encounter within eukaryotic hosts.</p><p>There are many parallels between the chemical and biological functions of 4-HNE and other toxic metabolites that function in antimicrobial defense. The freely diffusible and highly reactive diatomic gas nitric oxide (NO) is produced during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iyengar et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stuehr and Marletta, 1985</xref>) and has a direct role in preventing bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nathan and Hibbs, 1991</xref>). However, due to the conservation of its reactive targets, elevated levels of NO also exert pathological effects during both sterile inflammation and acute infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagafuji et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galley and Webster, 1998</xref>). 4-HNE is membrane diffusible, highly reactive, and contributes to disease pathology due to its cytotoxic activity toward eukaryotic cells. These parallels, together with our findings that bacterial infection induces 4-HNE production are consistent with the premise that 4-HNE represents a component of ROS-mediated host defense, among such other toxic metabolites as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite.</p><p>While a role for 4-HNE in host antimicrobial defense has yet to be appreciated in mammals, plants utilize a variety of lipophilic molecules generated by the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), collectively referred to as oxylipins. While generally considered to be involved in signal transduction, many oxylipins can directly inhibit bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prost et al., 2005</xref>) and 4-HNE itself is a component of the oxylipin burst in soybean where it serves an anti-fungal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaughn and Gardner, 1993</xref>). Because 4-HNE is one of several distinct metabolites produced following oxidation of PUFAs in mammals, it is conceivable that other reactive byproducts of this process also contribute to microbial defense in a similar manner.</p><p>The contrasting observations between the liver and spleen were somewhat surprising given our observation that infection of murine hepatocytes in tissue culture with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in vitro induced accumulation of 4-HNE conjugates. These observations are likely a consequence of several factors. The liver is a major site of small molecule detoxification and hepatocytes are known to produce high levels of many of the 4-HNE metabolizing proteins, including aldo-keto reductases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and the 4-HNE glutathione transferase, GSTA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the immune-driven mobilization of arachidonic acid and ROS precursors that lead to 4-HNE generation may result in elevated accumulation of this host aldehyde in the spleen. These observations suggest that the need to counteract 4-HNE toxicity may be distinct depending upon the tissue tropism of an infecting pathogen.</p><p>To survive within the sterile tissues of eukaryotic hosts, bacterial pathogens often counteract the toxic effects of the immune response. Our discovery of two genes that confer synergistic resistance to 4-HNE in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> begin to provide insight into the mechanisms by which 4-HNE toxicity might be overcome. In vitro studies suggest that Rha1 and Rha2 both metabolize 4-HNE in an NADPH-dependent manner to 4-HNA, suggesting redundant functions. Redundancy in bacterial resistance to ROS is a relatively common phenomenon, including the need to eliminate five individual enzymes in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Serovar Typhimurium to exhibit a phenotype in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hébrard et al., 2009</xref>) and simultaneous disruption of four enzymes in <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> to observe a phenotype in the presence of superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cybulski et al., 2009</xref>). Such redundancy in bacterial detoxification programs likely decreases the chances that genetic drift or other genomic damage would render an organism defenseless against oxidative stress. It remains unclear, however, why both Rha1 and Rha2, which have similar in vitro enzymatic properties, are both required for 4-HNE resistance following exposure to the pure compound. If their effects were simply redundant, the loss or addition of both genes in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, respectively, would be additive. Our findings are contrary to this expectation, suggesting a more complex role. We speculate that either alternative localization of these proteins resulting in detoxification within specific subcellular compartments or unidentified alternative roles in mediating 4-HNE resistance are at play.</p><p>A wide range of susceptibility to 4-HNE exposure was observed among the various bacterial species tested in this study. These observations may reflect unique mechanisms by which these organisms combat 4-HNE as well as potential conservation of the Rha1 and Rha2 proteins. Among the most 4-HNE-sensitive organisms, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which resides in the soil, likely does not encounter 4-HNE and appears to have no resistance to its exposure, while another highly 4-HNE-sensitive bacterium, <italic>F. novicida,</italic> is known to block the generation of ROS by the host NADPH oxidase, perhaps limiting the need to detoxify this metabolite directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohapatra et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were the most resistant organisms tested. Among all organisms tested, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has the clearest homologs based on sequence identity to Rha1 (59%) and Rha2 (71%) from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. It is difficult to predict substrate specificity of flavin-dependent and NADPH-dependent reductases solely on sequence conservation, and without direct enzymological characterization, homologous function cannot be concluded. Additionally, while these two genes are most robustly induced by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> 4-HNE exposure, it cannot be concluded that they are not a part of a broader stress response. In particular, Rha2 is induced by diamide stress and exhibits enzymatic activity toward 4-HHE, suggesting a wider role in stress responses and substrate promiscuity. Given that many flavin and NADPH-dependent reductases have roles in detoxifying endogenous enone containing compounds, like quinones, or other exogenous electrophilic toxic metabolites susceptible to Michael-addition, including nitroaromatic compounds, it is certainly feasible that these enzymes play roles beyond 4-HNE resistance.</p><p>While Rha1 and Rha2 both contribute to 4-HNE resistance, the ∆<italic>rha1∆rha2 L. monocytogenes</italic> strain still exhibits several logs of survival benefit relative to the related organism <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, suggesting that other mechanisms of 4-HNE resistance remain to be identified. Among the many uncharacterized genes induced during 4-HNE exposure, <italic>lmo0796</italic> shows homology to <italic>bcnA</italic>, a secreted lipocalin in <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> which sequesters long-chain lipophilic antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Halfawy et al., 2017</xref>). 4-HNE, with its long hydrophobic tail, could conceivably be neutralized in an analogous manner. It is also possible that many intrinsic resistance properties of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> are not reflected through transcriptional responses. For instance, addition of amine containing constituents on the cell’s surface through lysinylation of teichoic acids and/or lipids, as well as deacetylation of peptidoglycan, may provide a nucleophile reactivity barrier that prevents 4-HNE entry into the bacterial cell. Additionally, αβ-unsaturated aldehydes have preferential reactivity toward sulfhydryl groups, including cysteine and glutathione, and it is expected that thiolate depletion would be the major mechanism of 4-HNE toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LoPachin and Gavin, 2014</xref>). Indeed, the thiol responsive transcription factor <italic>spxA1</italic> was induced &gt;2 fold in response to 4-HNE and the magnitude of heat shock gene induction mirrored results reported for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> following diamide treatment, a potent inducer of disulfide stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leichert et al., 2003</xref>). While our findings provide initial molecular insight into one pathogen’s resistance to 4-HNE, it is clear that many details are yet to be revealed.</p><p>Taken together, our findings extend the range of antimicrobial molecules generated through the reactive oxygen burst to include the byproducts of lipid peroxidation. Additionally, bacteria whose infection cycles involve intimate exposure to these molecules, such as <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, have the capacity to resist this toxicity. Future investigation of the impacts of 4-HNE on a diverse array of organisms with varied infection models will highlight the importance of this metabolite on host defense and the varied mechanisms by which pathogens counteract its toxicity to promote infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Camille Danne (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest but, as described below, essential additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option or use these reviews to revise and submit elsewhere.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Tabakh et al. studied the ability of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to detoxify 4- hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a well-studied compound in inflammatory disease but a rather unexplored metabolite during infection. In this study, 4-HNE is shown to accumulate in mouse hepatocytes and spleens during infection by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and is inhibitory to the growth of Firmicutes bacteria. However, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is somewhat resistant to this compound as it encodes a detoxification system comprised of rha1 and rha2, which neutralize the ROS activity of 4- HNE via NADPH dependent reduction.</p><p>This study is intriguing, mostly well controlled and potentially opens up a new field of 4-HNE metabolism in infection. However, the mechanism by which rha1 and 2 mediate the turnover of 4-HNE needs to be further strengthened wit rigorous biochemistry. In addition, while the Rha proteins appear to affect 4-HNE, some of the claims need to be tempered based on the data presented. The most important being that this study does not convincingly show that 4-HNE production by the host contributes to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> control given that there was no phenotype in immunocompetent mice for the rha double mutant v. WT <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strains.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following experiments are required for acceptance:</p><p>1. Rha1/Rha2 role as NADPH dependent oxidoreductases needs to be further established with rigorous biochemical studies. The in vitro 4-HNE <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> resistance phenotype of the rha1 and rha2 mutants is somewhat convincing, however the authors should have followed up these results either by measuring 4-HNE levels or adducts in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> or by better delineating an enzyme mechanism in vitro. These data would be more supportive of the model that Rha1/2 breaks down 4-HNE or its derivatives in a physiological setting. It appears Rha1 and especially Rha2 are not very active under the conditions tested, barely showing a curve representative of catalytic activity. Characterization of this enzyme requires changes in assay conditions. and more rigorous analysis.</p><p>2. The authors proposed that Rha1/2 could specifically reduce 4-HNE based on similarity to various enone reductases, but 4-HNE does not contain an enone group. Also, although it was shown that other aldehydes did not induce rha1/2 expression, another aldehyde as potential Rha1/2 substrates in this assay could have been tested to support the specificity claim. Also, is it feasible to measure depletion of 4-HNE alongside NADPH oxidation over the course of the assay?</p><p>3. Are the rha1/rha2 genes conserved? What is the evolutionary picture for these genes. Some bioinformatics is warranted to understand how prevalent is this protection mechanism. Are there homologs found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>? Did you test 4-HNE toxicity on bacterial species from a different phylum, such as Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria? Another intracellular bacteria?</p><p>4. Many genes encoding general protein quality control factors were also strongly induced upon 4-HNE exposure (clpC, groS, dnaK among others). Based on the data presented, it is possible that Rha1 and Rha2 contribute to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> stress responses by another mechanism and not necessarily through the specific detoxification of 4-HNE. Does 4-HNE treatment make bacteria more susceptible to well-characterized proteotoxic stresses like heat shock given that several well known HSP genes were induced? Does 4-HNE lead to accumulation of insoluble proteins? How could you explain the interplay between rha1 and rha2? Do you think they have the same redundant function or rather a complementary function? If redundant functions, how do you explain that the expression of rha2 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> does not provide at least partial resistance to 4-HNE?</p><p>5. In Figure 1A, a positive control with direct exposure to 4-HNE should be included along with infection to provide comparable levels of adduct formation during other inflammatory diseases.</p><p>6. In Figure 4A, a positive control should be included.</p><p>7. Figure 2 Show a gene that is not impacted by 4-HNE to highlight the specificity of the response.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;4-hydroxy-2-nonenal antimicrobial toxicity is neutralized by an intracellular pathogen&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers think the authors addressed the majority of concerns.</p><p>However, the text appears to be overstating results and unless complementation experiments are provided the text must correctly reflect the data. Please revise text and/or data and highlight modified text/data changes.</p><p>For Figure 1, the authors are incorrectly interpreting the histopathology; they claim the staining of 4HNE is around bacteria but what I am seeing is tons of 4HNE staining everywhere; The reddish color in the infected tissues clearly shows diffuse staining everywhere. It doesn't take away from their conclusion at all, they just need to reword their text to make them not try to claim the staining is only around the bacteria.</p><p>Concerning characterization of bacterial sensitivity to 4-HNE toxicity, authors use log to describe the reduction in bacterial CFU, except for Lmo where they use %. Please use consistent labeling of axis so comparisons can be made.</p><p>The abstract should be rewritten as the authors say that Rha1 and Rha2 mutations do not impact Lmo infectious potential, but in the Results section the message is not that clear. The finding are fine but the conclusions are over stated as it might be due to redundancy in stress response proteins. The authors need to rephrase to avoid excessive overstating conclusions.</p><p>Finally, the data is not convincing to support the statement that rha genes provide any fitness advantage in vivo to Lmo as all the other animal data are negative. The authors would need a complementation assay for panel F to rule out something else minor like polarity. In the absence of this data, the authors must temper their conclusions based on that figure. The Bacillus result is more robust if they want to claim Rha proteins CAN be protective but there is no convincing data to show they are necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59295.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following experiments are required for acceptance:</p><p>1.

We have now added new data in Figure 4D to the manuscript showing a ~50% increase in 4-HNE adducts in <italic>L. monocytogenes∆∆rha1/2</italic> mutant compared to WT upon incubation with 640µM 4-HNE by dot blot and that complementation with either gene had modest effects. Given the nominal magnitude of adduct accumulation it is difficult to draw much from this data. Because expression of these genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> had much larger impacts on adduct accumulation, these findings suggest that other mechanisms for clearing 4-HNE adducted proteins may be present in <italic>Listeria</italic>, which may mask the effects of Rha1/2. This is also consistent with the significant level of resistance that <italic>Listeria</italic> has over <italic>B. subtilis</italic> even when the latter organism expresses Rha1/2. Clearly Rha1/2 are only the beginning of the story for 4-HNE resistance in <italic>Listeria</italic> and future studies are warranted to explore this resistance in further detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“…by better delineating an enzyme mechanism in vitro.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewers about our initial enzymatic data. As such, we assessed purified enzyme turnover in numerous conditions, including in bacterial lysates, in sterile bacterial media, with the addition of various salts, metals, crowding agents, and different buffers. From this comprehensive screening of in vitro biochemical conditions, we found that the addition of 20% PEG 8000 to the reactions significantly decreased the Km of both Rha1 and Rha2 to within the broad physiological range of 4-HNE (Rha1 134 µM, Rha2 367 µM). We have added these data as new Figure 5B. We suspect PEG-induced crowding is decreasing the Km of both the enzymes, either by shifting the protein to its predicted active dimer form (Rha1) or perhaps by generally reducing protein instability and therefore increasing the potential for successful 4-HNE-protein association (Ma and Nussinov, 2013). To provide a comparison to a known 4-HNE metabolizing enzyme, we tested turnover of the known human 4-HNE NADPH-dependent detoxification enzyme AKR1C1 under the same conditions. While AKR1C1 exhibits a lower Km, the turnover rates of Rha1/2 (kcat) are higher than the mammalian counterpart under these conditions. These data are now presented as new Figure 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Ene-reductases specifically have reduction activity against carbon-carbon double bonds both in enal and enone contexts and we have tried to clarify this in the text (Toogood and Scrutton, 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, although it was shown that other aldehydes did not induce rha1/2 expression, another aldehyde as potential Rha1/2 substrates in this assay could have been tested to support the specificity claim.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we expanded the panel of aldehydes we tested as potential substrates for both Rha1 and Rha2. Our findings largely mirrored observations of <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> gene induction by this same panel (Figure 3B), in which activity was not observed for any combination with one exception, Rha2 exhibited some turnover capacity with the lipid oxidation product of n-3 fatty acids 4-hydroxy 2hexenal. These observations are in line with our assignment of Rha1/2 as reductases of the αβ-double bond of 4-HNE, which is absent in other aldehydes tested in this panel. Collectively these observations are consistent with these genes functioning in response to enal induced stress and toxicity and that perhaps Rha2 is more promiscuous than Rha1. Of course, the conclusions of specificity for 4-HNE are limited by the substrates tested and we have toned down the language relating to specificity. In fact, we hypothesize that these enzymes may indeed have other αβ-carbonyl containing substrates, either endogenous (i.e. quinones) or other αβ-unsaturated compounds that induce electrophilic stress. These data are now presented as new Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is it feasible to measure depletion of 4-HNE alongside NADPH oxidation over the course of the assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We successfully visualized Rha1 and Rha2 enzymatic conversion of 4-HNE using thin-layer chromatography with phosphomolybdic acid visualization. These data are now presented in new Figure 5E. As a control for direct comparison on the TLC plate, we included AKR1C1, known to generate the alcohol 1,4-dihydroxynonene (1,4-DHN) and P1-ZCr, an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> enzyme known to perform a hydrogenation reaction to saturate 4-HNE to 4-hydroxynananal (4-HNA). We found 4-HNE was converted to 1,4-DHN by AKR1C1 as reported, to 4-HNA by P1-ZCr as reported and both Rha1 and Rha2 enzymes converted 4-HNE to 4-HNA. These studies were not done in parallel with NADPH consumption due to technical limitations. Specifically, the amount of enzyme and NADPH in the experiments for monitoring NADPH consumption is not sufficient to detect the 4-HNE and reaction product 4-HNA using TLC. As such, the two experiments were performed with different amounts of enzyme and NADPH. However, we found no 4-HNE conversion with any enzymes in the absence of NADPH. Overall, we were able to successfully demonstrate NADPH-dependent 4-HNE reduction to 4HNA by both Rha1 and Rha2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Are the rha1/rha2 genes conserved? What is the evolutionary picture for these genes. Some bioinformatics is warranted to understand how prevalent is this protection mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed sequence homology analysis for both <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> across the set of bacteria we tested for 4-HNE sensitivity to obtain a sense of the distribution of both genes across a variety of prokaryotes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> reports the sequence identity of the closest matching Rha1 and Rha2-like proteins from tested organisms. <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, which we found to be both the second most 4-HNE tolerant bacteria we tested, had the closest homologs to both Rha1 and Rha2. Among other organisms, we found that the association between 4-HNE survival and closeness or presence of protein homologs was weak. This is not surprising, as functional homology and sequence homology are often not very strongly correlated among oxidoreductase enzymes (Todd, Orengo and Thornton, 2001). This is due to the fact that very small changes in the binding pocket completely alters substrate specificity and it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to predict with any confidence the substrate of many oxidoreductase enzymes from simple sequence homology. We speculate that some close relatives of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, including perhaps <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, may utilize similar mechanisms of 4-HNE detoxification and that other bacteria that are distantly related, like <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> likely have other enzymes with limited sequence homology to Rha1/2 that are capable of performing similar functions. Rigorous transcriptional, biochemical and other experimental analysis will be required to say with any confidence if other bacteria code for enzymes with similar 4-HNE detoxification roles.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Organism</th><th>Rha1 identity (%)</th><th>Rha2 identity (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pa</td><td>29</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>SA</td><td>Absent</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Ef</td><td>59</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Ec</td><td>Absent</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Fn</td><td>24</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Bs</td><td>58</td><td>29</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there homologs found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>?

To address this point, we expanded our killing assay to include a set of Gram-negative bacteria: <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10b (K12)<italic>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> U112, which is also an intracellular pathogen. These data are presented as new Figure 2A. We found that even among this expanded bacterial cohort, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> still showed the highest survival capabilities. Interestingly, <italic>F. novicida</italic> was uniquely sensitive to 4-HNE toxicity. Reports that <italic>F. novicida</italic> actively blocks ROS generating pathways during infection (Mohapatra et al., 2010) suggests that this organism may avoid 4-HNE mediated toxicity by halting its production rather than specific detoxification or resistance mechanisms. We have added discussion of these points to the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Many genes encoding general protein quality control factors were also strongly induced upon 4-HNE exposure (clpC, groS, dnaK among others). Based on the data presented, it is possible that Rha1 and Rha2 contribute to L. monocytogenes stress responses by another mechanism and not necessarily through the specific detoxification of 4-HNE.</p></disp-quote><p>Induction of heat shock proteins in response to electrophilic stress has been previously reported in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Huyen et al., 2009). We agree with the reviewers that while it is still formally possible that Rha1/2 contribute to the <italic>Listeria</italic> stress response through an indirect pathway to 4-HNE resistance rather than direct detoxification, our improved in vitro enzymology (new Figure 5) suggests the most parsimonious explanation is that they play a role in directly de-toxifying 4-HNE. However, to provide a more comprehensive picture of Rha1 and Rha2 expression in bacterial stress responses, we measured <italic>rha1/2</italic> expression in response to a panel of non-aldehyde stressors, including heat, diamide induced disulfide stress, and the RNS agent nitric oxide. We found that NO was unable to induce either gene, but that heat did induce both genes by approximately 30-fold, and the disulfide stress agent diamide induced <italic>rha1</italic> by 11-fold and <italic>rha2</italic> by 100-fold. However, the most robust induction of both <italic>rha1</italic> and <italic>rha2</italic> was with 4-HNE, as we observed previously with our aldehyde panel in Figure 3B. Induction by heat and diamide suggests that <italic>rha1/2</italic> are induced during other stress responses in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Despite their induction under both heat and diamide induced thiol stress, loss of each gene had no discernible impact on bacterial survival in these conditions. These data are now presented in Figure 3C and Figure 4B,C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does 4-HNE treatment make bacteria more susceptible to well-characterized proteotoxic stresses like heat shock given that several well known HSP genes were induced?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that indeed, 4-HNE treatment prior to heat shock (50°C for 10 minutes) does increase bacterial death. This is consistent with 4-HNE impacting proteotoxic stress responses. This data is now presented in Figure 2E. Given that many of the proteases involved in the heat shock require active site nucleophiles that are likely highly susceptible to 4-HNE adduction, it is feasible that 4-HNE poisons these proteins from functioning to clear damaged proteins during elevated temperature. While these observations are intriguing, detailing the mechanism of this synergy is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does 4-HNE lead to accumulation of insoluble proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that in WT <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> 4-HNE does not lead to significant total protein aggregation compared to untreated control, especially compared to the positive control of elevated temperature exposure. These data are now presented in Figure 4E. In addition, the <italic>∆∆rha1/2</italic> mutant does appear to have only a modest (10-15%) and not statistically significant increase in protein aggregation accumulation with 4-HNE treatment compared to WT. This suggests that the difference in WT versus <italic>∆∆rha1/2</italic> survival in 4-HNE is not driven by global adduct accumulation or protein aggregation but rather other molecular targets susceptible to 4-HNE reactivity. Such targets may be other macromolecules (i.e. lipids, nucleic acids, etc) or adduction to specific cellular proteins, namely inactivation of specific essential proteins that are not reflected in the global analyses conducted here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How could you explain the interplay between rha1 and rha2? Do you think they have the same redundant function or rather a complementary function? If redundant functions, how do you explain that the expression of rha2 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> does not provide at least partial resistance to 4-HNE?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we do not know exactly what the relationship between the two proteins is, we suspect that the two enzymes serve complimentary functions. Both enzymes reduce 4-HNE to 4-HNA (new Figure 5E) however, they appear to function non-redundantly, with both enzymes being expressed heterologously in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> allowing for greater than simply additive survival for the expressing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Supplemental Figure 3B, Figure 6A). The enzymes have different Km affinities for 4-HNE (Figure 5)</p><p>as well as different 4-HNE turnover specificity. Rha1 is seemingly specific for 4-HNE as a substrate for NADPH oxidation while Rha2 is able to perform the reduction of both 4-HNE and 4-HHE (Figure 5D). The differential induction of <italic>rha1</italic> versus <italic>rha2</italic> with our aldehyde and stress panel (Figure 3B-C; see our response to point 4 above) suggests that the two proteins may be regulated by different inputs or play specific roles during 4-HNE exposure possibly through distinct protein localization within the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1A, a positive control with direct exposure to 4-HNE should be included along with infection to provide comparable levels of adduct formation during other inflammatory diseases.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the TIB73 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection experiments with the included positive control of TIB73s that were treated for 10 minutes with 10µM 4-HNE in PBS. These data are presented in new Figure 1A. We found that the treated cells accumulate adducts at a similar level to 6 hours of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection. Although that suggests overall low levels of 4-HNE, we believe that this is due to the combination of (1) a small amount of cells infected with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> at 6 hours post infection and (2) the highly segregated nature of 4-HNE accumulation. We believe that 10µM overall 4HNE accumulation masks the much higher localized levels of 4-HNE in cells. Additionally, measurement of 4-HNE levels in cells actively producing the metabolite, as during infection, reflects the amount of protein conjugates that are accumulating and being degraded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4A, a positive control should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the positive control of the human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 that is well-known to perform NADPH-dependent oxidation of 4-HNE.

It doesn't take away from their conclusion at all, they just need to reword their text to make them not try to claim the staining is only around the bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that there is an increase in 4-HNE staining throughout the spleen following <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection as indicated by the overall reddish color between the infected and uninfected tissue sections shown in Figure 1B and C, respectively. With increased magnification as shown in Figure 1E, there are clearly regions of the tissue section that stand out as having a much darker staining than the diffuse background seen in much of the tissue section. These cells have such a strong signal for the 4HNE that they are very dark brown. We have added arrows to Figure E to highlight these regions. In comparison to the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> imaging in Figure 1D at the same magnification, the staining pattern looks similar. At 100X magnification, the 4-HNE labeled cells exhibiting the darkest staining have a punctate pattern (Figure 1G) that looks strikingly similar to the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> staining (Figure 1F). We completely agree that this comparison of staining is clearly not sufficient evidence to conclude that the bacteria are being directly labeled by the metabolite. It is equally possible that there is a subset of spleen cells that simply produce significantly elevated levels of 4-HNE. As such, we have removed the statement that this increased staining is around the bacteria (Lines 106-109) and added arrows to Figure 1E to further direct the reader’s attention to the enhanced staining in specific regions of the tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning characterization of bacterial sensitivity to 4-HNE toxicity, authors use log to describe the reduction in bacterial CFU, except for Lmo where they use %.
