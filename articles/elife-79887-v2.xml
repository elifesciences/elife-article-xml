To study how context-appropriate feeding decisions are generated, we combined synaptic resolution circuit reconstruction with targeted genetic access to specific neurons to elucidate a gustatory sensorimotor circuit for feeding initiation in adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This circuit connects gustatory sensory neurons to proboscis motor neurons through three intermediate layers. Most neurons in this pathway are necessary and sufficient for proboscis extension, a feeding initiation behavior, and respond selectively to sugar taste detection. Pathway activity is amplified by hunger signals that act at select second-order neurons to promote feeding initiation in food-deprived animals. In contrast, the feeding initiation circuit is inhibited by a bitter taste pathway that impinges on premotor neurons, illuminating a local motif that weighs sugar and bitter taste detection to adjust the behavioral outcomes. Together, these studies reveal central mechanisms for the integration of external taste detection and internal nutritive state to flexibly execute a critical feeding decision.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gustatory</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>circuits</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Kristin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DK117671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterne</surname><given-names>Gabriella R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DC018225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiu</surname><given-names>Philip K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gustatory information and hunger state impinge on a local, multilayered circuit that drives feeding initiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The decision to initiate feeding depends both on the quality of available food and current nutrient needs. The gustatory system detects nutritious and noxious compounds in the environment and evaluates food quality. Food quality information is integrated with internal nutritive state to ensure that food intake matches energy demands. How do central neural circuits evaluate taste information in the context of internal nutritive state to make feeding decisions?</p><p>As feeding decisions are universal and essential for survival, animals as diverse as humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> share similar strategies to detect taste compounds and assess nutrient needs. Peripheral taste detection in mammals and insects is mediated by sensory cells that detect specific taste modalities and elicit innate feeding behaviors. Both mammals and flies have sugar-, bitter-, water-, and salt-sensing gustatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of sugar-sensing gustatory cells triggers feeding initiation, whereas activation of bitter-sensing cells inhibits feeding. Mammals and insects also evaluate internal nutrient needs with similar strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leopold and Perrimon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nässel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sareen et al., 2021</xref>). Neuromodulators released from neurosecretory centers and the gut signal hunger or satiety to oppositely regulate feeding. Disruption of these hunger and satiety signals results in obesity and anorexia in mammals and insects.</p><p>Although gustatory sensory neurons have been shown to be modulated by hunger signals and conflicting taste information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meunier et al., 2003</xref>), central mechanisms that modulate feeding decisions are unclear because the identity, structure, and function of central feeding initiation circuits are unknown. Recent advances in brain-wide synaptic connectivity mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckstein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) and precise genetic access to single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dionne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luan et al., 2006</xref>) make <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> an ideal system to interrogate how central neural circuits compute feeding decisions. Taste detection in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> begins with activation of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) found in sensory structures located on the body surface, including the external mouthparts, or proboscis labellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stocker, 1994</xref>). The axons of proboscis GRNs project to the primary taste and premotor center of the insect brain, the subesophageal zone (SEZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kendroud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyazaki and Ito, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stocker and Schorderet, 1981</xref>). The motor neurons that execute feeding have cell bodies and dendrites in the SEZ near GRN axons, suggesting a local feeding circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). However, only a few isolated interneurons have been implicated in feeding initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how neural circuits transform taste detection into context-appropriate feeding decisions, we combined electron microscopy-based circuit reconstruction, genetic tools that provide access to single cell types, optogenetics, and imaging of taste responses in awake, behaving animals to uncover a circuit-level view of feeding initiation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This work delineates the neural circuit that transforms taste detection into the motor actions of feeding initiation from sensory inputs to motor outputs, and reveals central mechanisms that integrate taste detection with internal physiological state to shape behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRNs synapse onto multiple second-order neurons</title><p>To examine neural circuits for feeding initiation, we identified neurons directly postsynaptic to gustatory sensory axons in the central brain.

This comparison revealed that we identified 14 of the 15 neurons with the most synapses from sugar GRNs. These second-order neurons represent 12 unique cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The 15 second-order neurons we manually reconstructed receive 21% of sugar GRN synaptic outputs. We note that the distribution of second-order neurons has a very long tail, likely due in part to small neural fragments that are challenging to reconstruct. These second-order neurons have not previously been characterized, except for G2N-1, which was identified as a candidate second-order gustatory neuron based on anatomical proximity to sugar-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). Each of the second-order neurons is a local SEZ interneuron with arbors that overlap extensively with sugar GRN termini.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Multiple second-order taste neurons influence proboscis extension</title><p>To test whether second-order gustatory neurons participate in feeding behaviors, we identified split-Gal4 lines that provide specific genetic access to individual second-order cell types, using NBLAST comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2016</xref>) to a library of SEZ split-Gal4 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sterne et al., 2021</xref>). This provided split-Gal4 matches for seven second-order neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, we used intersectional approaches to gain genetic access to two additional second-order neurons, Cleaver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and Zorro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These genetic reagents are exquisitely specific for each of the nine second-order gustatory neurons, providing the opportunity to evaluate their function.</p><p>As activation of sugar-sensing GRNs on the proboscis labellum causes the fly to extend its proboscis to initiate feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethier, 1976</xref>), we tested whether activation or inhibition of second-order taste neurons influences this behavior. We expressed the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) selectively in each second-order taste neuron, activated each with 635 nm light, and examined the proboscis extension response (PER). Remarkably, optogenetic activation of seven of the nine second-order taste neurons elicited proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, inhibiting the activity of each second-order neuron individually, by optogenetic activation of the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>), reduced proboscis extension to 50 mM sucrose in food-deprived flies, for six of the seven second-order neurons that elicited PER upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At a higher sucrose concentration (100 mM), neural inhibition of only two of the second-order neuron classes decreased proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These studies argue that multiple second-order neurons contribute to normal feeding initiation behavior and suggest that the partial redundancy of these second-order neurons ensures robust feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Second-order taste neurons activate a local SEZ circuit for feeding initiation</title><p>How does activation of a diverse set of second-order neurons drive proboscis extension? Proboscis motor neurons 4, 6, 7, and 9 are involved in extending different segments of the proboscis for feeding initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>). We focused on the well-studied motor neuron 9 (MN9), which is necessary and sufficient for extension of the rostrum, the largest portion of the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>). We located MN9 in the FAFB EM volume by examining large SEZ neurons that lack synaptic output. To identify a pathway from taste detection to proboscis extension, we reconstructed presynaptic partners of MN9 and postsynaptic partners of second-order taste neurons.</p><p>This strategy identified a minimal pathway from taste detection to proboscis extension, composed of interconnected second-order neurons and third-order neurons each receiving inputs from a subset of second-order neurons, and feedforward premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The third-order neurons represent a small subset based on comparisons to Flywire automated reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). They include one previously characterized neuron, the putative feeding command neuron, Fdg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and a set of descending neurons, Bract, that project to the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sterne et al., 2021</xref>).

Eight of the ten neural classes responded to sugar taste presentation in food-deprived animals, and not to water or bitter solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Two second-order cell types responded to water taste detection: Usnea responded specifically to water and Phantom responded equally to water and sugar detection. Usnea and Phantom are reciprocally connected with GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that these second-order cell types may tune GRN responses in the presence of water. One third-order neuron, Fdg, did not respond to proboscis taste stimulation, but did respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that Fdg may respond to pharyngeal or leg taste detection. Together, these studies reveal that sugar taste is processed by a multilayered neural circuit to initiate feeding in food-deprived flies.</p><p>To test whether responses in the proboscis extension circuit are altered based on specific nutrient needs, we examined taste responses in flies that were thirsty rather than hungry. High hemolymph osmolality is a key signal of thirst that acts on central neurons to promote water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>). We mimicked a thirsty-like state by increasing hemolymph osmolality, which enhanced water responses in water-sensing GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In four of the five central neurons tested, response profiles were similar in food-deprived and thirsty-like flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, one second-order neuron, Clavicle, responded to water and to sugar taste detection in a thirsty-like state but only to sugar in a hungry state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that state-dependent responses to water at a single node (Clavicle) may tune the responsiveness of the pathway to bias acceptance of more dilute sugar solutions. However, the majority of neurons uncovered here responded selectively to sugar taste detection regardless of whether the animal was hungry or thirsty.</p><p>Given that two second-order neurons, Usnea and Phantom, responded to water taste stimulation despite synaptic connectivity to candidate sugar GRNs, we examined the connections of the second-order feeding initiation neurons from all GRNs of the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engert et al., 2021</xref>). These GRNs have previously been clustered into candidate taste categories (sugar, water, bitter, high salt, and low salt) based on their morphology and GRN-GRN connectivity. Remarkably, we found that the second-order neurons that receive sugar GRN inputs also receive inputs from candidate water and high-salt (ppk23-positive, Glut-positive) GRNs but do not receive inputs from candidate bitter or low salt (Ir94e) GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The connectivity is consistent with our calcium imaging studies showing responses to sugar taste detection but not bitter taste. However, responses to sugar and water were not consistent with the predicted connectivity for each neuron, suggesting the possibilities of state-dependence, network interactions, and/or errors in GRN modality categorization. As GRN category assignments in the EM dataset were based on anatomy and connectivity alone, some GRNs may be misclassified, leading to errors in assessing sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engert et al., 2021</xref>). While the connectivity suggests the exciting possibility that taste integration may occur at second-order neurons, further functional studies will be necessary to illuminate the taste categories that activate or inhibit individual second-order neurons under different nutritive states. Nevertheless, our studies demonstrate that most second-order neurons respond to sugar taste stimulation but not to water or bitter tastes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Feeding initiation is modulated by hunger at specific nodes</title><p>How is sugar taste information integrated with hunger state to promote feeding initiation in food-deprived flies?

First, we delineate the sensorimotor circuit for feeding initiation from sensory inputs to motor outputs with cellular and synaptic resolution. Then, we demonstrate how this central circuit integrates taste detection with internal state, providing mechanistic insight into how taste modalities and feeding decisions are encoded in the brain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A local, interconnected network transforms sweet taste detection into behavior</title><p>Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have identified gustatory neurons, motor neurons, and three candidate interneurons that influence feeding initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). Here, by elucidating a complete sensorimotor circuit with synaptic resolution, we provide a comprehensive view of the neural pathway that elicits proboscis extension, the first step in feeding. The feeding initiation pathway is a local circuit, with three- and four-synaptic relays to motor output. Each neuron elicits proboscis extension upon optogenetic activation, demonstrating that each neuron participates in a pathway for the behavior. Inhibiting activity of single second-order neurons reduced the behavioral response, whereas inhibiting activity of third-order or premotor neurons did not. As inhibiting activity of single neurons did not abolish proboscis extension, this demonstrates that additional paths not requiring the individual neural cell type contribute to this innate behavior. These results are consistent with the circuit connectivity, which reveals that there are multiple routes between sugar GRNs and MN9 for proboscis extension. The multiple paths from second-order neurons to premotor neurons may enable proboscis extension to be recruited in different contexts to ensure robust feeding. More generally, multiple circuit paths may enhance behavioral flexibility by facilitating sensory tuning and multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miroschnikow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our finding that there are multiple pathways for proboscis extension, EM circuit tracing of sensorimotor paths for feeding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae revealed both direct GRN-motor neuron synapses as well as indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miroschnikow et al., 2018</xref>). The functional significance of this circuit organization has not been explored. Although we did not identify direct GRN-motor neuron synaptic connections for proboscis extension in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, other feeding subprograms such as pharyngeal pumping may utilize direct sensory to motor connections and remain to be discovered.</p><p>Most neurons in the proboscis extension pathway respond to sugar taste detection, but not to water or bitter tastes, in food-deprived flies, demonstrating a direct line from sweet taste detection to the motor output for feeding. How water taste modulates proboscis extension in thirsty flies will require further study. Importantly, we identified and characterized three second-order neurons that respond to water taste detection: one is selective for water taste, another responds to both water and sugar tastes, and the third shows state-dependent sugar and water taste responses. Further study of these second-order neurons and their connectivity will be critical to evaluate the degree of separation or convergence of water and sugar pathways for feeding initiation. Moreover, we find that second-order neurons that respond to sugar receive inputs from sugar GRNs as well as candidate water and high-salt GRNs. This hints at the exciting possibility that second-order neurons integrate multiple taste modalities and may show responses that vary based on nutritive state. Furthermore, functional studies will be essential to assess taste integration by second-order neurons.</p><p>Of the interneurons identified here, only G2N-1 and Fdg have previously been implicated in feeding. G2N-1 was identified as a candidate sugar-sensing second-order neuron based on its anatomical proximity to gustatory axons alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>); here, we elucidated its functional role in taste detection and feeding initiation. Fdg was isolated as a ‘feeding command neuron,’ able to elicit multiple steps in feeding, including proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flood et al., 2013</xref>). In our calcium imaging studies, Fdg did not respond to proboscis taste stimulation but did respond to optogenetic activation of sugar GRNs. This suggests that Fdg may receive gustatory signals from GRNs on the pharynx or legs. Our studies demonstrate that Fdg is a third-order neuron in the feeding initiation pathway, with synaptic connections to Bract descending neurons. A description of the reconstruction of all FlyWire DNs is in preparation (K. Eichler, M. Costa, G. Card, G. Jefferis, personal communication). As Bract synapses with proboscis premotor neurons and ventral cord circuits, Fdg and Bract are well-poised to coordinate proboscis extension with other steps in feeding.</p><p>The architecture of the circuit provides a platform to investigate how taste signals are transformed in the brain to drive behavior. In this study, we focused on MN9, the rostrum protractor motor neuron that elicits proboscis extension, as a key readout of proboscis extension behavior. However, proboscis extension involves not only rostrum protraction but also extension of the haustellum and opening of the labellum, controlled by additional motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesize that the connectivity among second- and third-order neurons may coordinate the precise temporal activation of different muscle groups for coordinated extension. Moreover, proboscis extension is followed by ingestion and then meal termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>).

Hunger modulation of taste processing beyond sensory neurons has been more challenging to evaluate, both because of lack of knowledge of central networks and because changes at the sensory level propagate through the network.</p><p>To isolate the role of central brain neurons in hunger modulation, we used the precise genetic access available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to activate each node of the feeding initiation pathway and examined the behavioral response elicited in fed and food-deprived flies. These studies pinpoint the site of hunger modulation to sensory neurons and two second-order neurons. Although caveats of artificial stimulation exist, the consistent changes seen across different light intensities for neural manipulation early in the pathway, but not downstream, argue that these results are robust. These studies demonstrate that hunger acts at a few critical nodes to modulate feeding initiation: sensory neurons increase detection sensitivity and second-order neurons amplify pathway activation. It will be interesting to examine whether hunger modulation of sensory and second-order neurons occurs independently or over different time scales to adjust behavioral responses as starvation increases. In addition, the specific hunger signals that act on central neurons and their mechanism of modulation may now be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bitter compounds inhibit premotor neurons to prevent feeding initiation</title><p>While previous studies have demonstrated interactions between sweet and bitter taste modalities at the level of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meunier et al., 2003</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>) and through feedback from the mammalian gustatory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2021</xref>), this study reveals a third circuit strategy for weighing sweet and bitter tastes: a local inhibitory network. Inhibitory interactions between bitter and sugar pathways at the level of premotor neurons provide an elegant strategy to weigh incoming sugar and bitter taste information and adjust behavioral probability. In addition, by blocking activity at specific muscles, bitter detection may specifically change behavior to direct the proboscis away from a hazardous food source. The existence of a local inhibitory circuit for bitter-sweet integration has been recently postulated based on studies of mammalian taste circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2021</xref>) and may be a shared strategy across species. These multiple circuit mechanisms for suppression of sweet attraction by bitter signals may reflect the evolutionary importance of robust bitter taste avoidance.</p><p>By examining a complete sensorimotor pathway, we elucidate how a complex nervous system orchestrates the decision to initiate feeding and illuminate central modules that integrate taste detection with internal state. These central controls afford independent amplification and suppression of feeding and stand apart from sensory modulation as mechanisms that dynamically tune behavior. As sensory modulation may suffer from finite amplification and incomplete suppression, central modulation provides a strategy to bypass those limits, allowing a broader range and different temporal dynamics of modulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Rearing conditions and strains</title><p>All experiments were performed in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

Other statistical analyses of calcium imaging were carried out in Python using the SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) and scikit-posthocs packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Terpilowski, 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79887-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data is included in the manuscript or available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://catmaid-fafb.virtualflybrain.org">https://catmaid-fafb.virtualflybrain.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Lori Horhor, Jolie Huang, Neil Ming, Vivian Nguyen, Andrea Sandoval, Neha Simha, Rivka Steinberg, and Parisa Vaziri for EM tracing contributions. We thank David T Harris for his initial studies on FMIn. We thank the FlyLight Project Team (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight">https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight</ext-link>) for performing brain dissections, immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging for split-GAL4 screening. Vivek Jayaraman provided unpublished fly lines used in this study. This work was supported by NIH R01DC013280 (KS), NIH F32DK117671 (GRS) and NIH F32DC018225 (PS). Neuronal reconstruction for this project took place in a collaborative CATMAID environment in which 27 labs are participating to build connectomes for specific circuits. Development and administration of the FAFB tracing environment and analysis tools were funded in part by National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative grant 1RF1MH120679-01 to Davi Bock and Greg Jefferis, with software development effort and administrative support provided by Tom Kazimiers (Kazmos GmbH) and Eric Perlman (Yikes LLC). Peter Li, Viren Jain and colleagues at Google Research shared automatic segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We acknowledge the Princeton FlyWire team and members of the Murthy and Seung labs for development and maintenance of FlyWire (supported by BRAIN Initiative grant MH117815 to Murthy and Seung). We thank Drs. Stefanie Hampel, Jinseop Kim, Mala Murthy, Andrew Seeds, Sebastian Seung, Ibrahim Tastekin and Rachel Wilson and members of their laboratories for FlyWire tracing. We thank K Eichler and members of the Connectomics Group in the Dept Zoology, University of Cambridge (G. Jefferis, M Costa) for FlyWire tracing and sharing some neurons ahead of publication. Confocal imaging for triple intersection characterization was conducted at the CRL Molecular Imaging Center, supported by the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and NSF DBI-1041078. We would also like to thank Holly Aaron and Feather Ives for their microscopy training and assistance. Members of the Scott lab provided comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group

This comparison revealed that we identified 14 of the 15 neurons with the most synapses from sugar GRNs. These second-order neurons represent 12 unique cell types (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1F).

Inhibiting activity of single second-order neurons reduced the behavioral response whereas inhibiting activity of third-order or premotor neurons did not. As inhibiting activity of single neurons did not abolish proboscis extension, this demonstrates that additional paths not requiring the individual neural cell type contribute to this innate behavior. These results are consistent with the circuit connectivity, which reveals that there are multiple routes between sugar GRNs and MN9 for proboscis extension. The multiple paths from second-order neurons to premotor neurons may enable proboscis extension to be recruited in different contexts to ensure robust feeding. More generally, multiple circuit paths may enhance behavioral flexibility by facilitating sensory tuning and multi-sensory integration (Miroschnikow et al., 2018, Ohyama et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does it compare of what we know from direct EM connectomic analysis in other modalities adult fly or larva?</p></disp-quote><p>We now note (ln 327-334):</p><p>“Consistent with our finding that there are multiple pathways for proboscis extension, EM circuit tracing of sensorimotor paths for feeding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae revealed both direct GRN-motor neuron synapses as well as indirect pathways (Miroschnikow et al., 2018). The functional significance of this circuit organization has not been explored.

We also include additional discussion on this topic (ln 205-227):</p><p>“Given that two second-order neurons, Usnea and Phantom, responded to water taste stimulation despite synaptic connectivity to candidate sugar GRNs, we examined the connections of the second-order feeding initiation neurons from all GRNs of the right hemisphere (Engert et al., 2022). These GRNs have previously been clustered into candidate taste categories (sugar, water, bitter, high salt and low salt) based on their morphology and GRN-GRN connectivity. Remarkably, we found that the second-order neurons that receive sugar GRN inputs also receive inputs from candidate water and high-salt (ppk23-positive, Glut-positive) GRNs but do not receive inputs from candidate bitter or low salt (Ir94e) GRNs (figure 3 —figure supplement 1D). The connectivity is consistent with our calcium imaging studies showing responses to sugar taste detection but not bitter taste. However, responses to sugar and water were not consistent with the predicted connectivity for each neuron, suggesting the possibilities of state-dependence, network interactions, and/or errors in GRN modality categorization. As GRN category assignments in the EM dataset were based on anatomy and connectivity alone, some GRNs may be misclassified, leading to errors in assessing sensory inputs (Engert et el, 2022). While the connectivity suggests the exciting possibility that taste integration may occur at second-order neurons, further functional studies will be necessary to illuminate the taste categories that activate or inhibit individual second-order neurons under different nutritive states. Nevertheless, our studies demonstrate that most second-order neurons respond to sugar taste stimulation but not water or bitter tastes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A couple of the experimental results seem counterintuitive and would benefit from further discussion:</p><p>(1) Optogenetic activation of a large subset of the individual neurons in the circuit (2nd order through pre-motor) is sufficient to drive PER, suggesting potential functional redundancy.

However, optogenetic activation of the entire subset of GRNs covered by Gr5a-LexA elicits calcium responses in Fdg. Therefore, activation of pharyngeal GRNs alone or simultaneous activation of some combination of labellar, pharyngeal, and leg GRNs may be required to activate Fdg.</p></body></sub-article></article>
