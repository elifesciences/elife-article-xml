a single path in which a scientist starts as a member of a team working under the guidance of one or more experienced scientists and, if they are successful, ends with the individual leading their own research group and training future generations of scientists. Here we study the author contribution statements of published research papers in order to explore possible biases and disparities in career trajectories in science. We used Bayesian networks to train a prediction model based on a dataset of 70,694 publications from PLoS journals, which included 347,136 distinct authors and their associated contribution statements. This model was used to predict the contributions of 222,925 authors in 6,236,239 publications, and to apply a robust archetypal analysis to profile scientists across four career stages: junior, early-career, mid-career and late-career. All three of the archetypes we found - leader, specialized, and supporting - were encountered for early-career and mid-career researchers. Junior researchers displayed only two archetypes (specialized, and supporting), as did late-career researchers (leader and supporting). Scientists assigned to the leader and specialized archetypes tended to have longer careers than those assigned to the supporting archetype. We also observed consistent gender bias at all stages: the majority of male scientists belonged to the leader archetype, while the larger proportion of women belonged to the specialized archetype, especially for early-career and mid-career researchers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>science of science</kwd><kwd>careers in science</kwd><kwd>gender bias</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>707404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson-Garcia</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Scientometrics and Science, Technology and Innovation Policy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costas</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An analysis of author contribution statements in a large number of published papers reveals biases in the career trajectories of scientists.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Successful research careers are built on concepts such as leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen and Barabási, 2014</xref>), productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKiernan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reskin, 1979</xref>), and impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radicchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). But evidence suggests that the design of a unique career path built on individualistic success may hamper the way in which science is actually produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milojević et al., 2018</xref>). Collaboration has become essential and ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guimerà et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongeon et al., 2017</xref>); however, the increase in team size may come at a cost for those who are not in leading roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milojević et al., 2018</xref>). The overreliance on past success in terms of accrued credit through publications and citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merton, 1968</xref>) may both reduce the scientific careers of team players and introduce gender biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole and Zuckerman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macaluso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larivière et al., 2013</xref>), discouraging women to pursue careers in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gaule and Piacentini, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The heterogeneity in scientists’ profiles realizes the need for distribution of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larivière et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is still a lack of understanding of how research profiles differ from each other, and how they are associated with career stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laudel and Gläser, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this study is to analyze the relation between task specialization and career length of scientists. Do specific profiles of scientists have shorter research careers than others? How do profiles relate to gender? Are these differences also reflected in productivity and citations? To answer those questions, we develop a Bayesian network-that is, a probabilistic graphical model-to predict the specific contributions scientists made to each of their publications throughout their career. We then profile researchers based on contribution statements and explore how those profiles evolve throughout their careers. We investigate how profiles at each career stage affect career length, with a particular focus on the relationship with the perceived gender of the scientist. Finally, we examine the relationship between profiles and bibliometric characteristics, such as research production and scientific impact.</p><p>Our seed dataset contains a total of 70,694 papers authored by 347,136 scientists from PLoS journals in the Medical and Life Sciences fields. Author names are disambiguated using a rule-based scoring algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caron and van Eck, 2014</xref>). Each author has also been linked to their bibliometric data from Web of Science. We restrict our dataset to the Medical and Life Sciences to make it more homogeneous and avoid disciplinary differences in task distribution. We assign papers to fields by identifying the journal to which each of the references of the publications in our dataset belong. We then assign to each publication the field from which most of its references come. Finally, we only include those which are assigned to the Medical and Life Sciences fields. Further details are provided in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We then build a probabilistic model to predict authors’ contribution to publications, based on a set of bibliometric variables. This model allows us to extend our analysis from the initial dataset to the complete publication history of these authors. We reconstruct the publication history of 222,925 authors from our original dataset and predict, for each author, the probability of conducting a given contribution on each of their publications. Based on the new dataset of predicted probabilities of contributorship, we divide scientists’ careers into four stages and conduct an robust archetypal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eugster and Leisch, 2011</xref>) by stage. This allows us to identify differences in scientific profiles by stage and gender, and explore differences in scientific paths.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Contribution statements and predicting variables</title><p>Five types of contribution statements are identified in the contribution dataset: wrote the paper (WR), conceived and designed the experiments (CE), performed the experiments (PE), analyzed the data (AD), and contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools (CT). The number of contributions (NC), that is, the sum by paper of the contributorships each author reports, is also considered. These contributions are assumed to be related with author order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milojević et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mongeon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sauermann and Haeussler, 2017</xref>), with first and last positions in author order reflecting leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinchilla-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>), as per the recommendations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2015</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> relates career stage and author order with contribution role.

Writing the manuscript and contributing reagents and tools increase over time, with a decline in the late-career stage. Conceiving and designing the experiments demonstrates a modal shape, where early-career and mid-career stages are the ones in which these tasks are more prominent. In terms of labor distribution, first authors are heavily associated with all contributions, with the exception of contributing tools, reagents, data, and other materials. Middle authors report to be less involved in writing tasks or in the design and conception of experiments but are associated with contributing resources to a much greater extent. Last authors report contributing mostly to the design and conception of experiments as well as to writing tasks, and to a lesser extent to the performance of experiments.</p><p>Bibliometric indicators are employed as predictors of contributorship. Two types of bibliometric variables are included: paper-level and author-level. Paper-level variables are document type (DT), number of authors (AU), number of countries (CO), and institutions (IN) to which authors of the paper are affiliated. Author-level variables include their position in the authors’ list (PO), number of years since they published their first publication (YE) and the average number of publications per year (PU).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> depicts the coefficients of a mixed correlation matrix of the contributorship and bibliometric data, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the Bayesian network used for predicting the contribution of a researcher for a given publication. The highest correlations within types of contributorship are between writing the manuscript and conceiving and designing the experiments (0.71), while the rest of contributorship variables exhibit low correlations. In the case of bibliometric variables, there is a moderate positive correlation between number of countries and institutions (0.66), author position and number of authors (0.68), and number of authors and number of institutions (0.72). A strong positive monotone relation between the number of contributions and either writing the manuscript (0.85), conceiving the experiments (0.82) or analyzing the data (0.79) is observed. The number of contributions seem therefore to be associated with those type of contributions. Weak monotone negative relationships are suggested by correlations between the number of contributorships and bibliometric variables. Negative correlations are observed between performing the experiments and position in authors list, years since publication and average number of publications. Weak to moderate negative correlations are observed between contributorship variables and the number of countries and institutions, author’s position, and number of authors of a publication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mixed correlation matrix of contributorship and bibliometric variables (<bold>A</bold>) and the Bayesian network used for predicting contributorship (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>Contribution variables are in green, bibliometric variables are in blue. <italic>Bibliometric variables</italic>: PO (author’s position); AU (number of authors); DT (document type); CO (number of countries); IN (number of institutions); YE (years since first publication); PU (average number of publications). <italic>Contribution variables</italic>: WR (wrote the paper); AD (analyzed the data); CE (conceived and designed the experiments); CT (contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools); PE (performed the experiments); NC (number of contributions).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60586-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Bayesian network structure used for predicting contributorship highlighting whitelisted arc relations.</title><p>Contribution variables are in green, bibliometric variables are in blue.

The aim here is to expand our original dataset to the complete publication history of the 347,136 researchers from the Medical and Life Sciences who had published at least one paper in our PLOS seed dataset. A BN is a probabilistic graphical tool used to model multivariate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nielsen and Jensen, 2009</xref>). The variables are denoted as nodes in the network, whereas the arcs denote influences between variables, typically quantified as dependencies. BN accounts not only for dependencies between the predictor variables and variables of interest, but also for dependencies between predictor variables. This characteristic, along with the forthright graphical representation, makes BNs an attractive choice to model dependent multivariate data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the structure of the obtained BN. Five types of contributions along with the number of contributions (in green) of scientists are predicted using the seven bibliometric variables (in blue). The structure of the BN has been obtained by using a hybrid data-learning algorithm called Max-Min Hill Climbing (MMHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsamardinos et al., 2006</xref>), along with the constraint that bibliometric variables are influencing contributorship variables. That is, if an arc between bibliometric and contributorship variables is present in the structure, then it should be directed to the contributorship variable. Furthermore, the structure of the network has been tested for robustness. The strength of the arcs, i.e., relationships between variables, has been investigated using the bootstrap procedure, with 50 repetitions. Only the arcs that were present in 80% of the repetitions have been considered and are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>We evaluate the predictive power of the obtained BN using k-fold cross-validation. That is, the data has been repeatedly divided in 10 random folds, of which 9 have been used to learn the BN structure using the MMHC algorithm together with the aforementioned constraints. The contributions were then predicted for the remaining fold. The procedure has been repeated for each of the 10 folds and results on the prediction errors reported in the Materials and methods section. The predictive performance of the BN has been shown to be extremely good, with an average classification error rate of between 6-8% for all contributorships and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.12 for the predicted NC. The BN is used to predict the contributions for the complete publication history of a subset of 222,925 scientists who have published in PLOS journals, for a total of 6,236,239 publications. Each contribution is predicted as the probability that an author has performed a given contribution on a publication. We further investigate the distributions of the predicted contributorships.</p><p>When distinguishing by career stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the densities clearly depict differences in contributorships. Performing the experiments is the most discriminative contributorship type, with junior scientists more likely be associated with this contribution. The more scientists advance in their career, the less likely that they will perform the experiments. Albeit less dramatic, the same discriminative pattern can be observed for analyzing the data and for the total number of contributorships, with decreasing association by age. Inversely, the contribution roles of wrote the manuscript, conceived the experiments, and contributed with tools are more likely for advanced career stages.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Probability density functions of contribution roles predicted using the Bayesian Network model.</title><p>Distributions are aggregated by career stage.

To avoid the effect of contributorship outliers, we aggregate researchers’ contributorships by choosing the median predicted contributorship of publications for each career stage. We perform a robust archetypal analysis (RAA) to identify types of scientists based on their contributorships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eugster and Leisch, 2011</xref>). Archetypes accentuate distinct features of scientists based on contribution data. Robust archetypal analysis identifies ‘‘prototypical types’’ of the multivariate aggregated contributorship dataset, correcting for outlier effects in the data. Each of these ‘‘prototypical types’’ or archetypes is represented as a convex combination of researchers in the aggregated contributorship dataset and, in turn, each researcher is well described by a convex combination of these archetypes.</p><p>We consider archetypes of scientists at each career stage. A residual sum of squares (RSS) analysis for different archetypes reveals that using two archetypes for the junior and late-career stages, and three for early-career and mid-career stages results in significantly smaller RSS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> reveals the screeplots of RSS per career stage, where the elbow criterion supports the choice of number of archetypes per career stage. The influence of contributorships within each archetype is captured by corresponding coefficient values. Coefficients of each archetype (Leading, Specialized and Supporting) per career stage are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Low values indicate low prevalence of corresponding type of contributorship, whereas high values indicate a high contribution to the archetype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Coefficient values of contributorships by archetype, per career stage.</title><p>Two archetypes are identified in the junior stage (<italic>Specialized</italic> and <italic>Supporting</italic>), three have been identified for the early- and mid-career (<italic>Leader</italic>, <italic>Specialized</italic> and <italic>Supporting</italic>) and two have been identified for the late-career stage (<italic>Leader</italic> and <italic>Supporting</italic>).

Given that the archetypes at each stage have common characteristics, we maintain the same profile naming across stages. Three archetypes are identified. The Leader is characterized by high coefficient values for all contributions, except for PE, indicating a high prevalence of each contribution role, and especially on WR and CE. The Specialized archetype is characterized by high coefficient values for PE and AD. A trend analysis for this archetype indicates a shift between PE and AD contributions. The third archetype is referred to as the Supporting, and is characterized by generally low values for all contributorships. This is the least discriminatory archetype.</p><p>At the junior stage, we observe two archetypes: Specialized and Supporting. Both are characterized by scientists reporting more than two contributions per paper. For the Specialized archetype, the most prevalent roles are on PE and AD, although they show higher coefficients than Supporting for all contributorships except CT (with a marginal difference). At the early-career stage, three archetypes are obtained, with a clear difference on PE between Leader and Specialized. These three archetypes are maintained during the mid-career stage, with the most notable difference being the shift between AD and PE for the Specialized, that now exhibits a higher probability of conducting the former than the latter. In the late-career stage, the Specialized archetype is no longer identified, and again two archetypes emerge. Both archetypes show low probabilities on PE, while the Leader is characterized by a higher probability on WR and CE.

We observe that there is little attrition, regardless of the archetype to which scientists belong, between the junior and early-career stage (93% for junior Specialized and 83% for Supporting authors). At the early-career stage, when the Leader archetype emerges, the advantage of those exhibiting a Leader profile becomes evident: 84% of scientists who belong to the Leader archetype in their early-career reach the next career stage, while 30% and 16% of Specialized and Supporting scientists progress to mid-career stage respectively.

Shifts across archetypes appear more likely at earlier career stages, as well as from the Leader archetype to the other two archetypes (but not vice versa).

Nonetheless, differences emerge for later career stages. Except for the late-career stage, where Supporting scientists are the most productive, the Leader archetype exhibits higher productivity, followed by Supporting. Specialized scientists appear to be much less productive than scientists assigned to the other two archetypes in the early- and mid-career stages. This pattern is also observed for Specialized, in the case of citation impact.

Note that scientists from different generations are included in the analysis, therefore, caution should be expressed in drawing any conclusion on the number of scientists by gender that reach the late-career stage. The share of women who reach the late-career stage is affected by the generational diversity of scientists and hence we make comparisons only within career stage. We observe a gender disparity especially in the early- and mid- career stages. The share of men is higher for the Specialized archetype at the junior stage, and for the Leader archetype at the early- and mid-career stages. The second most frequent is the Specialized archetype, with few men in the Supporting archetype, except for the late-career stage. Women are less likely to appear as the Leader archetype in the early- and mid-career stages. Whereas 87% of men in the junior stage have a Specialized archetype, 43% and 77% in the early- and mid-stage are designated as Leaders; 84% of women in junior are Specialized, and only 27% and 65% in early- and mid-career stages show a leading profile. The gender distribution becomes more balanced again at the late-career stage, where 35% of men and 31% of women are in the Leader archetype. In summary, women appear to group within the Specialized archetype in the early-career stage, and show similar distributions to that of men at the other career stages, although the shares of the Leader archetype are consistently lower to that of men.

They are immersed in a reward system that evaluates them individually following uniform expectations of leadership and excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reskin, 1977</xref>). Recent evidence shows an increasing need for a larger and more stratified scientific workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milojević, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larivière et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wuchty et al., 2007</xref>) which necessarily involves a reconceptualization of research careers and considering a breadth of profiles for which specific paths should be considered. Larger teams require a distribution of tasks which will translate on individuals specializing on certain roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larivière et al., 2016</xref>). Here we identify and characterize such diversity of profiles by career stage, by combining contribution statements with bibliometric variables and applying a machine learning algorithm to predict contributions.</p><p>We find that scientists exhibit different archetypes at different stages, following many paths during their career trajectory. Some paths, however, come at a cost. Out of the 222,295 scientists included in our dataset, only 12% reached the late-career stage. While this should not be striking, as scientists of different ages are included in our analysis, it is worth noting that the vast majority (98%) of these scientists displayed a Specialized archetype in their junior stage. Even though most of them belonged to the Leader archetype in their early- and mid-career stages, scientists at the late-career stage mostly exhibit a Supporting archetype (66%). This could be happening because many scientists adopt a secondary role when they reach seniority, leaving the leading role to their younger colleagues.</p><p>The names assigned to each archetype are figurative but reflect an implicit hierarchy in science. This hierarchy exists at each career stage, indicating that the diversity of profiles is not the result of scientists evolving in their career trajectory and adopting different roles, but that diverse archetypes exist between and within career stages. The robust archetypal analysis identified no Leader archetype at the junior stage, when scientists are still ’earning their stripes’, nor are there Specialized scientists in the late-career stage. Such reality enters into conflict with the current expectations of research careers, which consider roles to be attached with career stages and steps that must be made to progress. Our findings have important policy implications as they indicate that scientists’ career design may be at odds with the way science is produced, and suggest a complete reform wherein reproduction of Leaders is not the only model of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milojević et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate the high versatility of the Leader archetype: scientists with this profile are able to move seamlessly across archetypes during their careers. While there are some scientists with a Specialized or Supporting profile who manage to shift to the other three archetypes, most of the scientists fitting these archetypes in our dataset do not progress to more senior stages. Our analysis on productivity and citation impact by archetype sheds light on the mechanisms which may be affecting trajectories. Specialized scientists are less productive and have a lower share of highly cited publications than Leaders and Supporting scientists, which may serve a disadvantage for career advancement in those environments which prioritize publication productivity indicators in research assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The lack of assessment schemes sensitive to the diversity of profiles, partly due the inappropriate use of bibliometric indicators at the individual researcher level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKiernan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hicks et al., 2015</xref>), limits the capacity of policies to correct for inequalities observed across and within archetypes. Structural changes in the academic reward system are necessary to support the advancement and retention of Specialized and Supporting scientists.</p><p>We observe consistent differences in the distribution of archetypes by gender, which may contribute to explain the higher rates of attrition for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Early-career stage is key to the development of scientific careers, and it is at this stage that large gender differences are observed. While in the other career stages women and men exhibit a similar distribution of archetypes, women are more likely to be of the Specialized archetype in early-career, while men are more likely to be Leaders. That women disproportionately engage in technical labor–even when controlling for academic age–has been demonstrated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macaluso et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with general patterns in academic labor; for example, the higher service work done by women academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heijstra et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Contributorships are generally associated with author order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larivière et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sauermann and Haeussler, 2017</xref>), based on the presumption that first and last author will have major roles, while middle authors will play a secondary role. These roles reinforce hierarchy and organizational strategies: leaders set the agenda and define lines of work, whereas technicians are prized for their ability to implement this agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Latour and Woolgar, 2013</xref>). This model, however, does not provide equal access to career advancement for all types of scientists: those showcasing a Specialized or Supporting archetype in their early- and mid-career stages have greater difficulties to progress in their research career. These obstacles affect women at a greater extent than men, as a higher proportion of female scientists adopt these roles. Our findings suggest systematic biases on the selection of individuals which may be hampering the efficiency of the scientific system to self-organize itself and assemble robust and diverse scientific teams.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The data needed to reproduce the our analysis are openly accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891055">http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891055</ext-link>.

For this, we used the Dutch NOWT Classification which introduces three levels of categorization: 7 broad areas, 14 fields, and 34 subjects. This classification is linked to the the Web of Science subject categories (see correspondence here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cwts.nl/pdf/nowt_classification_sc.pdf">https://www.cwts.nl/pdf/nowt_classification_sc.pdf</ext-link>). The classification is made at the journal level, which implies that, given the high incidence of the PloS One papers in our data set, most publications would be categorized as Multidisciplinary. To overcome this issue, publications in Multidisciplinary were reclassified into other more specific fields based on their reference lists. We identified the journal to which each of the references of the publications in our data set belong to. Then, we assigned to each publication the field from which most of its references come from. Finally, we only include those which are assigned to the Medical and Life Sciences fields. A total of 70,694 publications and 347,136 distinct authors were extracted from this process, constituting the ‘‘seed data set’’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Publication history of individual scientists</title><p>We reconstructed the publication histories of scientists, and predicted their contributions throughout their careers. The set of authors identified is retrieved from the seed dataset to ensure consistency on the predictions of the Bayesian Network model. But a series of thresholds are imposed. First, we retrieve authors’ gender using the following sources to identify gender: Gender API, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ext-link> and Gender Guesser. We apply a 90% accuracy threshold before assigning gender and only include those authors who surpass such threshold. By promoting accuracy over recall, we assume some selection biases derived from limitations on the identification of gender. By doing so, we minimize potentially misclassified authors due to the assumption of gender as a binary variable. Second, we include only authors whose first publication occurred from 1980 onwards. While the CWTS in-house database includes publications prior to 1980, it does not contain metadata of sufficient quality as to rely on the name disambiguation algorithm. Hence, authors with their first publication prior to 1980 are discarded. Third, we include only authors who have contributed to at least five publications. We do this for two reasons. On the one hand, we remove transient authors, that is, those who have published sporadically, and focus only on scientists that have more chances of being pursuing a research career. On the other hand, this increases the accuracy of the author name disambiguation performed on those researchers. This is specially relevant since the algorithm adopts a conservative approach: when confronted with individuals having outlier patterns of behavior, such as rapid shifts across publication venues, disciplines and co-authors, it will consider them as different authors and consequently split their publications across different ‘‘individuals’’. Hence, by including a publication threshold, we focus on those individuals for whom the algorithm is more robust and accurate at identifying them uniquely.

Also, we reported effect sizes using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen, 2013</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Representativeness of the sample of scientists</title><p>The analysis is based on a set of publications and a sample of scientists which may not represent accurately the whole population of scientists. This means that, despite the robustness of the results, any inference to the whole population should be done with caution. Furthermore, the thresholds imposed to introduce such scientists in the archetypal analysis further restricts such inference endeavour. If we compare the productivity distributions of our set of researchers and for the whole population of the Web of Science, we observe that while we still retain a high skewness of productivity, this is much lower than the overall one.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Identification of scientists</title><p>The study relies heavily on the competence of an author name disambiguation algorithm to correctly identify disambiguated authors. As previously noted, this algorithm has some limitations which are partially overcome by the production thresholds imposed. However, inaccurate assignments can still occur.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Author age</title><p>We estimate researchers’ age based on the year of first publication and build the four career stages based on such year. However, alternative approaches could have been adopted and these could have some impact on the results. For instance, first year of first-authored publication could have been used instead. The selection of the first year of publication is based on empirical data suggesting that it is the best proxy for PhD year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nane et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Taxonomy of contributorships</title><p>In this paper, contributions are classified into five types. These types are obtained from the data itself. However, one may question the appropriateness of the number and contribution types. The ones used in this paper are consistent with those used in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larivière et al., 2016</xref>), but different from those implemented in the CRediT initiative, which defines up to 14 types of contributions. Furthermore, evidence suggests that author self-reporting on contributorship is not exempt of limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ilakovac et al., 2007</xref>). Questions like the extent to which contribution types are field-dependent are still unsolved. With this respect, our predictions already point towards some of these issues. Despite the low error rates, we observe that the distribution of predicted probabilities exhibits a normal distribution for writing the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This could be due to the ambiguity of the statement. As observed in the CRediT intitiative, this statement is disclosed into two: wrote the first draft and wrote parts of the manuscript and revised. Such distinction might help the model to better discriminate contributorships.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Lidia Carballo-Costa and Alejandro Quintela del Río (Universidade da Coruña, Spain) for their support in applying the archetypal analysis.

profiles based on contribution taxonomies</title><p>In this paper we profile scientists based on an specific taxonomy of contributorships with five different statements. However, other taxonomies including the more comprehensive proposed by CReDiT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2014</xref> have also been suggested and are implemented in journals. The extent to which the archetypes identified in this study are sensitive to such taxonomies remains to be explored. Furthermore, some of the original contributorships were removed from the final analyses due to the lack of data on authors reporting them. These two contributorships were ’Other’ and ’Approved/Revised final version of the manuscript’. Hence one could question which would be the more appropriate contributorship statement, as well as the appropriate number in order to be meaningful for most publications and at the same time sufficiently detailed as to provide rich information on different types of contributorship.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Value of contribution statements</title><p>Related with the previous question, one might wonder how to disentangle contributorship when more than one author state to have contributed in the same tasks. Is their contributorship for each of the common tasks equal? Is author A more involved in some tasks than author B? How could this be reported in a consistent and quantifiable way? Some of these issues have already been treated with regard to author order, with different types of author counting proposed in case of multi-authored papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waltman, 2016</xref>). How this could be resolved or whether this is an issue that should be addressed should be better explored in the future. Considering that the inclusion of contribution statements is derived from an effort to provide more transparency and go beyond the limitations of authorship especially in multi-authored publications, can the fact that this is self-reported information be misleading in some cases? Furthermore, if this type of statements are to be used and scrutinized in an evaluative context which is highly competitive, it could lead to further disputes and misbehaviour related to contribution disagreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Reporting uncertainty</title><p>From a methodological standpoint, the analyses conducted in this study presented certain challenges when reporting uncertainty. This is due to the fact that neither methods provide confidence intervals to their estimates. The BNs predictions probabilities already account for uncertainty, and RAA does not report any uncertainty. We therefore opted for using the error rates resulted from the cross validation analysis to obtain confidence intervals around the coefficient values of contributions by archetype. We also used the confidence intervals of the employed test statistics when testing for statistically significant differences in median publications and share of highly cited publications and proportion of researchers distributed with respect to gender and author position. However, other methods can be employed, such as probabilistic archetypal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seth and Eugster, 2016</xref>), which we believe is worth exploring further.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Longitudinal analyses of archetypes</title><p>In our study we distinguish between four different stages of a research trajectory, namely junior, early-, mid- and late-career. These stages go in consistency with alternative proposals in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laudel and Gläser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Milojević et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">European Commission, 2016</xref>). However, one could question if shorter periods of time could be analyzed to explore the stability of the profiles identified. For instance, a yearly analysis could be proposed to identify shifts of profiles over time, but the reliance on productivity may hamper the robustness of the findings or would be only limited to highly productive scientists.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Career trajectories, prediction and causality</title><p>Finally, we focus on career trajectories and on factors which influence the length of scientists’ trajectories. An appropriate analysis of researchers’ career trajectories requires an appropriate dataset. Our current dataset, albeit extensive, includes only researchers who published in PloS journals and only over a period of seven years. Extending the analysis over a larger period would include different cohort of scientist with different trajectory lengths and would hence allow for meaningful insights on trajectories, as well as a robustness analysis of the archetypes. We note that, with this respect, our current dataset is somewhat limited, as our most senior scientists have only had a long career up until 2006–2013. Furthermore, a dataset covering more journals would allow to test the methods further and available contribution data would enable the evaluation of the BN’s predictive performance.</p><p>Our current analysis pointed out association between archetype assignment at current stage with assignment at previous career stage, or with gender. A prediction model would allow us to find the best predictor or best combination of predicting factors for career advancement. With this respect, a dynamic BN would account for the temporal dependencies. Once again, a more extensive dataset would enable this analysis. Furthermore, properly assessing the influence of various factors would invoke causal inference. An overview of the statistical method is provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pearl, 2009</xref>. Counterfactual analysis appears to be germane. Additionally, the transition between archetypes within career advancement can be accounted for in the g-computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu and van der Laan, 2002</xref>).</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60586.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>eLife</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Boulder</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Task specialization and its effects on research careers&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article.

We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using data on over 6M publications and 200K authors, the authors aim to consider how prominent various scientific archetypes are across researchers' careers and whether there are gendered differences in these roles. The main takeaways are: (i) contributions shift over career stages, due to who is performing experiments/analyzing data (junior/early-career) or conceiving experiments/writing (mid/late-career); (ii) researchers who present as leaders in their early-careers are more likely to remain; (iii) women are less likely to appear in the leader archetype across career stages (and more likely to be in specialized/supporting roles with typically lower productivity). However, there are a number of points and concerns about the work that need to be addressed to make the article suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Title: I worry that the phrase &quot;its effects&quot; implies a causal relationship that is not warranted by the analysis presented in the paper. Possibly something like: &quot;Task specialization across research careers&quot; is a little more accurate.</p><p>2) Please explain why Bayesian analysis was used to determine which of the variables in the dataset predict the Contributorship categories: to me the use of machine learning with boosting classification would seem more appropriate.</p><p>Also, please explain how various of the criteria used in the analysis were chosen (eg, the definitions of career stage, the number of iterations used in the Bayesian analysis, the ICMJE criteria included in the analysis).</p><p>3) I would like to see the analysis of Contributorship and career stages across years, if possible, to see if there is a change in trends over the years, especially for the gender differences and career advancement.</p><p>[Note from the Features Editor: Addressing this point is optional]</p><p>4) The low error rates in the Bayesian analysis seem very impressive, but to interpret them better I'd appreciate some notion of recall since (I think?) most authors would not fill a given role. I also assume a cutoff value was chosen from the predicted probability, but this was not explicitly said. These suggestions would likely not impact the conclusions of the work, but would aid in reproducibility.</p><p>5) I do not understand why authors use Spearman correlation coefficient because you were investigating an association between nominal/categorical variables and ordinal variables. Please use appropriate measures of association for variables of interest or omit this analysis completely.</p><p>6) In subsection “Bayesian network model for predicting contributorship”: The strength of the arcs, i.e., relationships between variables, has been investigated using the bootstrap procedure, with 50 repetitions. Only the arcs that were present in 80% of the repetitions have been considered and are depicted in Figure 2B.</p><p>Is this standard procedure? If it is, please give a reference, and in case it is not please explain what is the rationale behind choosing those criteria.</p><p>There are several places where I believe the authors should provide statistical hypothesis testing and state the actual differences. These are documented below:</p><p>7) In subsection “Career paths, productivity and citation impact”: Figure 5B/C doesn't lead me to believe the differences in publications or citations are meaningfully different across career stages, but the text alludes to differences. Mentioning whether these are supported by statistical tests would strengthen your claims. Also, please expand the caption for figure 5 to fully explain what is being plotted in panels B and C.</p><p>8) Figure 6: A significance test across the proportions for men and women would be valuable again, since the text draws our attention to them.</p><p>9) Figures 6 and 7: Please include confidence intervals so that the reader can assess whether there are differences between groups.</p><p>10) You argue that there are differences in proportions between men and women in archetypes, but I wonder whether that is really due to the fact because in the previous paragraph you state that is more likely for researchers who are leaders in early stages to come to the late stages of career. I wonder what the more predictive factor for career advancement is - gender or specialization in early stage - and it would be good if the authors could resolve this issue by using some prediction model.</p><p>Also, you state that the shares of leader archetype are consistently lower for women compare to the men. Can you please test this using some kind of test of proportions (chi square for example) and also report the 95% confidence intervals for proportions?</p><p>Also, what does the distribution of \alpha (weights on archetypes) look like for most researchers? Is it easy to distinguish which archetype researchers fall into at a given career stage? This seems slightly important to the interpretation of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60586.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies point by point, as well as a description of the changes made, in Roman.]</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful reading and constructive comments and suggestions to our earlier manuscript.

Possibly something like: &quot;Task specialization across research careers&quot; is a little more accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: the title indeed implied causality, which is not supported by our analysis. We have modified the title following the reviewer’s comment. We have also added an Appendix in which we discuss potential ways in which causality could be studied as further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please explain why Bayesian analysis was used to determine which of the variables in the dataset predict the Contributorship categories: to me the use of machine learning with boosting classification would seem more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have employed Bayesian Networks (BNs) to predict types of contributions, by using the existing dependence relationships within our multivariate dataset. We did not use the BN specifically to select among the predictor variables. However, the resulting network, which was obtained using a best-fitting criterion, as well as the bootstrap step, confirmed the joint influence of the predictor variables on the contributions. We emphasize that, unlike in the regression setting, where one can identify partial influence of each predictor, BNs model the joint influence of the predictor variables. We have now added the following sentences at the beginning of the “Bayesian network model for predicting contributorship” subsection:</p><p>“BN accounts not only for dependencies between the predictor variables and variables of interest, but also for dependencies between predictor variables. This characteristic, along with the forthright graphical representation makes BNs an attractive choice to model dependent multivariate data”.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the boosting classification. To the best of our understanding, boosting encompasses algorithms which train a sequence of weak models to improve classification performance. The models can even be used with BNs (see, for example, Jing et al., 2008) to compensate for the goodness-of-fit focus of the learning algorithms with the prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, we have shown that our BN provides accurate classification in the cross-validation analysis. Furthermore, rather than predicting class labels, we were interested in obtaining prediction probabilities, which have been later used in our archetypal analysis.</p><p>We have considered 50 bootstrap samples to investigate the robustness of the BN structure obtained. The choice of 50 bootstrap samples is partly due to the computational burden this procedure implies. We have also added at the end of the second paragraph of the “Methods and Materials” section two sentences indicating the machine on which the analyses were conducted and the approximate required computational time. We mention that learning the BN’s structure and the bootstrap procedure were the most time intensive parts of our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, please explain how various of the criteria used in the analysis were chosen (eg, the definitions of career stage, the number of iterations used in the Bayesian analysis, the ICMJE criteria included in the analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>The four career stages are defined <italic>ad hoc</italic> but are consistent with what we have observed in other research careers studies or classifications. For instance, the European Commission distinguishes between <italic>first stage researcher</italic> (up to PhD), <italic>recognised researcher</italic> (PhD-holders still not fully independent), <italic>established researcher</italic> (independent researchers) and <italic>leading researcher</italic> (those with a leading role in their field) (European Commission, 2016). Laudel and Gläser refer to the <italic>apprentice</italic> (learning phase), <italic>colleague</italic> (independent researcher), <italic>master</italic> (independent researcher and mentor), and <italic>elite</italic> (leading researcher in their field) (Laudel and Gläser, 2008). These classifications go, to some extent, in accordance with the one we propose, but already introduce some judgment on the role researchers play at each stage (which we try to surface with our analyses). Nonetheless, no classification provides any temporary indication to operationalise the career stages.</p><p>Another proposal, also similar to our four stages is that by Milojevic et al (Milojević et al., 2018). In this case, they do propose temporary boundaries between stages. We employ their terminology, with a slight change in the time periods. Specifically, the full career stage is chosen as &gt;20 years after first publication. We choose the threshold of 30 years, to better identify seniority in our analysis. To clarify this, we have added the following sentence at the end of the first paragraph in the “Results” section:</p><p>“These four stages are defined in consistency with other classifications of career stages in the literature (Laudel and Gläser, 2008; Milojević et al., 2018; European Commission, 2016)”</p><p>With regard to the ICMJE criteria, we do not use it in our analysis, but refer to it (as to other studies) to mention and test (Figures 1B and 7) whether the common assumption on relating contributorship or task role with author position is observed in our data. In the revised version of the manuscript we have highlighted that this is a common assumption. For this, see the first paragraph of the section “Results”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I would like to see the analysis of Contributorship and career stages across years, if possible, to see if there is a change in trends over the years, especially for the gender differences and career advancement.</p><p>[Note from the Features Editor: Addressing this point is optional.]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the archetypal analysis per year. Our only concern (apart from the computational constraints) is that there might be high variations in the number of publications of researchers per year. For example, one researcher might have 10 publications in year 1, no publications in year 2, and 2 publications in year 3. Constructing archetypes and, more importantly, assigning researchers to archetypes based on a few number of publications is not desirable, as the archetypal analysis might not be so robust. Moreover, the archetypes will be sensitive to outliers and noise in general and we will probably not see the 2-3 archetypes so clearly.</p><p>To have an indication of the abovementioned variability, we have plotted the number of publications each scientist produces every year, by career stage (see Author response 1). As you can see, while the productivity distribution is highly skewed, still, the majority of scientists publish below 5 publications a year.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60586-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In any case, we believe that the point raised by the reviewer is of great interest and should be further explored. We have addressed the issue of stability of archetypes and the ideal time frame in the new Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The low error rates in the Bayesian analysis seem very impressive, but to interpret them better I'd appreciate some notion of recall since (I think?) most authors would not fill a given role.

These suggestions would likely not impact the conclusions of the work, but would aid in reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Since we were interested not only in accurately predicting the presence of a contribution, but also when the contribution was not present, our error rate accounted for both type I and type II errors, cumulating both false positive and negative. Nonetheless, we present in Author response table 1 the recall and precision computed for our cross-validation analysis.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th/><th>WR</th><th>AD</th><th>CE</th><th>CT</th><th>PE</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Precision</td><td>0.98</td><td>0.88</td><td>0.89</td><td>0.89</td><td>0.87</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Recall</td><td>0.89</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.99</td><td>0.99</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We used 0.5 as the cut off value. This is now mentioned in the subsection “Crossvalidation”, when referring to Table 3.</p><p>Reviewer’s comment that “<italic>most authors would not fill a given role</italic>” stirred our curiosity, so we investigated the likelihood that authors fill a certain contribution role. For our initial data, the percentage of authors performing a certain contribution is given in the ‘mean’ column of Author response table 2 below. The lowest percentage is for CT (contributed with tools), with 35% of the authors performing this task. The results suggest that the data is quite balanced. Finally, we mention that the archetypal analysis showed that all contributions have been identified by the predictions of BN.</p><table-wrap id="resptable2" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>WR</td><td>517008</td><td>0.48</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>AD</td><td>517008</td><td>0.52</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>CE</td><td>517008</td><td>0.48</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>CT</td><td>517008</td><td>0.35</td><td>0.48</td></tr><tr><td>PE</td><td>517008</td><td>0.51</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>517008</td><td>2.46</td><td>1.32</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I do not understand why authors use Spearman correlation coefficient because you were investigating an association between nominal/categorical variables and ordinal variables. Please use appropriate measures of association for variables of interest or omit this analysis completely.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The ‘cor’ function in R uses adapted correlation measures for discrete variables. However, we could not find a proper reference and decided to use the functions in the ‘psych’ package in R, which documents the correlation coefficients for binary RVs, as well as for mixed RVs (between continuous and discrete RVs). Tetrachorics correlation is used for binary RVs and polyserial or biserial is used for the mixed RVs. We have therefore obtained a mixed correlation matrix, which is slightly different from the previous correlation matrix in which Spearman correlation is only used for continuous variables. We note that the differences in coefficients are not that big though. This means that Figure 2A is now slightly modified. Also we have modified the text as follows:</p><p>References to Figure 2A now reflect new values in the figure.</p><p>“Methods and Material” section, last sentence in the first paragraph. The following sentences were added:</p><p>“Mixed correlation matrix in Figure 2A was calculated using the psych package (Revelle et al., 2010). Spearman rank correlations have been determined for continuous variables, tetrachoric correlations for binary random variables and biserial and polyserial correlations for mixed random variables, i.e., between binary or other discrete and continuous random variables.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Results subsection “Bayesian network model for predicting contributorship”: The strength of the arcs, i.e., relationships between variables, has been investigated using the bootstrap procedure, with 50 repetitions. Only the arcs that were present in 80% of the repetitions have been considered and are depicted in Figure 2B.</p><p>Is this standard procedure? If it is, please give a reference, and in case it is not please explain what is the rationale behind choosing those criteria.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no standard procedure. Since the bootstrap procedure introduces some variability, we chose 80% as a robust check against the variability. We did try additional thresholds at 95%, 90% and 75% to check for robustness and did not observe major differences on the final BN structure. Regarding the number of repetitions, there is no standard procedure either. We opted for 50 repetitions to have a balance between computational time and robustness. The bootstrapping procedure to develop the BN took around 20 hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several places where I believe the authors should provide statistical hypothesis testing and state the actual differences. These are documented below:</p><p>7) In subsection “Career paths, productivity and citation impact”: Figure 5B/C doesn't lead me to believe the differences in publications or citations are meaningfully different across career stages, but the text alludes to differences. Mentioning whether these are supported by statistical tests would strengthen your claims. Also, please expand the caption for figure 5 to fully explain what is being plotted in panels B and C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting hypothesis testing. We point out that employing a hypothesis test does not answer the question whether the differences are meaningful, but if the differences have occurred by chance or not, assuming the null hypothesis that there is no difference. Nonetheless, we think that hypothesis testing is adding value to our analysis. For productivity and citation impact, we have performed a Wilcoxon rank sum hypothesis test to investigate whether the differences in median publications and median share of highly cited publications for archetypes differ statistically significantly within each career stage.</p><p>As expected, due to the large sample sizes across the career stages, we obtained very low p-values (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 for all tests). To evaluate the strength of the differences, we also investigated the effect sizes and reported the results in the paper, in the sections Results and Methods and Materials. We found large effect sizes for differences in number of publications for early and mid career, and medium for late career. For share of highly cited papers, the effect size was found to be small for all career stages. The results are includes in Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1.</p><p>Finally, the caption of figure 5 has been expanded giving full detail of the indicators depicted in panels B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6: A significance test across the proportions for men and women would be valuable again, since the text draws our attention to them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have employed a two-proportion z-test, which tests that the proportions in two groups are the same. Pearson’s chi-squared test statistics allowed us to determine 95% confidence intervals for the differences in proportions, which, in turn, has been used to construct 95% confidence intervals for each proportion. The confidence intervals have been graphically included in Figure 6. Once again, the very small p-values, as well as the confidence intervals indicate statistically significant differences. However, the power analysis revealed a small and medium effect size, which is included in Figure 6-Figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figures 6 and 7: Please include confidence intervals so that the reader can assess whether there are differences between groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included confidence intervals, as mentioned at the previous point. With respect to the reviewer's comment about “whether there are differences between the groups”, we point out that hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are equally informative on whether differences between groups are <italic>statistically</italic> significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) You argue that there are differences in proportions between men and women in archetypes, but I wonder whether that is really due to the fact because in the previous paragraph you state that is more likely for researchers who are leaders in early stages to come to the late stages of career. I wonder what the more predictive factor for career advancement is - gender or specialization in early stage - and it would be good if the authors could resolve this issue by using some prediction model.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment raises a very interesting point, that is, which are the predictive factors for career advancement, gender or archetype, or other(s)? Nevertheless, we have agreed that a proper predictive analysis should be based on an appropriate dataset. But it is certainly a direction we would like to consider in the future. We have mentioned this in Appendix 1, career trajectories, prediction and causality. For the current manuscript, we have introduced two supplemental figures for Figure 6, in which we illustrate Sankey diagrams by gender. These figures suggest that it is the difference in the distribution of scientists by gender at the early stages which seem to affect later differences, but it also seems that career advancement is affected by scientists’ archetype.</p><p>Of course, these statements need to be supported to proper statistical analysis. For now, they are only suppositions, and are presented as such in the revised version of the manuscript. First, we have removed the sentence “As observed, a gender disparity on the distribution by archetype and stage is consistent in all career stages” from the “Archetypes and gender” subsection and this has been replaced with the following sentence:</p><p>“We observe a gender disparity especially in the early- and mid- career stages.”</p><p>We have also added the following sentence at the end of the subsection “Archetypes and gender”:</p><p>“These differences on the distribution of scientists by archetype and gender and how they might affect their trajectory is made more evident in figures S6-1 and S6-2.”</p><p>The Sankey diagrams also suggest a potential confounding effect of gender. That is, it seems that it is more likely to be in a leader position once having achieved the leader position in the previous career stage. However, the leader career stage is correlated with gender. Nonetheless, a proper predictive analysis would shed more light on this aspect, but, as mentioned earlier, would require an appropriate dataset to analyze.</p><p>With this respect, the (conditional) probabilities, based on the observed frequencies, presented in Author response table 3 below can support the claims above.</p><table-wrap id="resptable3" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 3.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Probability</th><th>All</th><th>Women</th><th>Men</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>P(early Leader)</td><td>0.371</td><td>0.268</td><td>0.4314</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(early Leader| Junior Specialized)</td><td>0.4214</td><td>0.3379</td><td>0.2991</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(mid Leader)</td><td>0.356</td><td>0.249</td><td>0.415</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(mid Leader|early Leader)</td><td>0.685</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.71</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(mid Leader|early Specialized)</td><td>0.197</td><td>0.144</td><td>0.335</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(late Leader)</td><td>0.088</td><td>0.054</td><td>0.107</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>P(late Leader|mid Leader)</td><td>0.246</td><td>0.218</td><td>0.256</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, you state that the shares of leader archetype are consistently lower for women compare to the men. Can you please test this using some kind of test of proportions (chi square for example) and also report the 95% confidence intervals for proportions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used the two-proportion z-test to check if this difference has occurred by chance. The very small p-values indicate that it is very unlikely that the lower share of leader archetype for women to have occurred by chance, when we assume there is no difference (the null hypothesis). Moreover, specifically for the leader archetype, we obtain a medium size effect for early and mid career, the largest size effect within the gender analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what does the distribution of \alpha (weights on archetypes) look like for most researchers? Is it easy to distinguish which archetype researchers fall into at a given career stage? This seems slightly important to the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to look at differences between archetype assignments we compute the difference between the alpha scores for each pair of archetype and by stage. Alpha scores range from 0 to 1. As observed in the table below, median differences are relatively large (above 0.1) except for leader vs. specialized in the early-career stage and specialized vs. supporting at the mid-career stage. Still, in the former case the mean difference is 0.08.
