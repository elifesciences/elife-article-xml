expressed in every cell type and are nearly identical at the amino acid level but play vastly different roles in vivo. Their essential roles in embryogenesis and mesenchymal cell migration critically depend on the nucleotide sequences of their genes, rather than their amino acid sequences; however, it is unclear which gene elements underlie this effect. Here we address the specific role of the coding sequence in β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins’ intracellular functions, using stable polyclonal populations of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts with exogenously expressed actin isoforms and their ‘codon-switched’ variants. When targeted to the cell periphery using β-actin 3′UTR; β-actin and γ-actin have differential effects on cell migration. These effects directly depend on the coding sequence. Single-molecule measurements of actin isoform translation, combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, demonstrate a pronounced difference in β- and γ-actins’ translation elongation rates in cells, leading to changes in their dynamics at focal adhesions, impairments in actin bundle formation, and reduced cell anchoring to the substrate during migration. Our results demonstrate that coding sequence-mediated differences in actin translation play a key role in cell migration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most mammalian cells make both β- and γ-actin, two proteins which shape the cell’s internal skeleton and its ability to migrate. The molecules share over 99% of their sequence, yet they play distinct roles. In fact, deleting the β-actin gene in mice causes death in the womb, while the animals can survive with comparatively milder issues without their γ-actin gene. How two similar proteins can have such different biological roles is a long-standing mystery.</p><p>A closer look could hold some clues: β- and γ-actin may contain the same blocks (or amino acids), but the genetic sequences that encode these proteins differ by about 13%. This is because different units of genetic information – known as synonymous codons – can encode the same amino acid. These ‘silent substitutions’ have no effect on the sequence of the proteins, yet a cell reads synonymous codons (and therefore produces proteins) at different speeds.</p><p>To find out the impact of silent substitutions, Vedula et al. swapped the codons for the two proteins, forcing mouse cells to produce β-actin using γ-actin codons, and vice versa. Cells with non-manipulated γ-actin and those with β-actin made using γ-actin codons could move much faster than cells with β-actin. This suggested that silent substitutions were indeed affecting the role of the protein.</p><p>Vedula et al. found that cells read γ-codons – and therefore made γ-actin – much more slowly than β-codons: this also affected how quickly the protein could be dispatched where it was needed in the cell. Slower production meant that bundles of γ-actin were shorter, which allowed cells to move faster by providing a weaker anchoring system. Overall, this work provides new links between silent substitutions and protein behavior, a relatively new research area which is likely to shed light on other protein families.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin isoforms</kwd><kwd>translation rate</kwd><kwd>coding sequence</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kashina</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA201340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY028450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-1800418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papoian</surname><given-names>Garegin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1806903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papoian</surname><given-names>Garegin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins have different translation rates in cells and exert different nucleotide coding sequence-dependent effects on cell migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin is one of the most essential and abundant eukaryotic proteins, highly conserved across the tree of life. Among the six mammalian actins, β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins are the only two that are ubiquitously expressed in every mammalian cell type and share the highest identity at the amino acid level, with only four conservative substitutions within their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vandekerckhove and Weber, 1978</xref>). Despite this near-identity, the coding sequences for these two actin isoforms are different by approximately 13% due to synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erba et al., 1986</xref>). Our work has previously shown that this coding sequence difference can lead to differential arginylation of these two actins. Arginylated β-actin accumulates in vivo, while arginylated γ-actin is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In mice, β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins play vastly different physiological roles. β-actin knockout leads to defects in embryogenesis and early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shawlot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shmerling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strathdee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tondeleir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tondeleir et al., 2014</xref>), while γ-cytoplasmic actin knockout mice survive until birth and have much milder overall phenotypic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunnell and Ervasti, 2010</xref>). Our prior work has shown that β-actin’s nucleotide sequence, rather than its amino acid sequence, underlies its essential role in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vedula et al., 2017</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9, we edited the five nucleotides at the beginning of the β-actin coding sequence within the β-actin gene (<italic>Actb</italic>), causing it to encode γ-actin protein (<italic>Actb<sup>c-g/c-g</sup></italic>, β-coded γ-actin). Such <italic>Actb<sup>c-g/c-g</sup></italic> mice developed normally and showed no gross phenotypic defects, thus demonstrating that the intact β-actin gene, rather than protein, defines its essential role in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Patrinostro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vedula et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, nucleotide sequence constitutes a major, previously unknown determinant of actin function, even though it is unclear which specific nucleotide-based elements of the actin gene play a role in this effect.</p><p>Here we tested whether the coding sequence alone, in the context of invariant non-coding elements and independent of the positional effects of the actin gene, plays a role in cytoplasmic actins’ intracellular function. To do this, we incorporated the coding sequences of β- and γ-actins and their ‘codon-switched’ variants (β-coded γ-actin and γ-coded β-actin) into otherwise identical constructs containing the human β-actin promoter, an N-terminal enhanced Greef Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) fusion, and the β-actin 3′UTR. Stable expression of these constructs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in dramatically different effects on directional cell migration. While cells expressing β-actin migrated at rates similar to wild-type untransfected cells in wound-healing assays, cells expressing γ-actin migrated nearly twofold faster. This difference depended directly on the coding sequence, as evident by the use of the ‘codon-switched’ actin variants. Expression of γ- or γ-coded β-actin led to changes in cell morphology and distribution of focal adhesions, which were larger in size and localized mostly at the cell periphery rather than under the entire cell, similarly to previously reported cellular phenotypes linked to poorer cell attachment and faster migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim and Wirtz, 2013</xref>). Focal adhesions in γ-actin- or γ-coded-β-actin-expressing cells appeared to be poorly anchored, though often not visibly associated with long actin bundles. In contrast, long actin cables could be clearly seen anchoring focal adhesions in β-actin- or β-coded γ-actin-expressing cells.</p><p>Single-molecule measurements of actin translation using the SunTag system at the focal adhesion sites showed an approximately twofold faster translation elongation of β-actin compared to γ-actin. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that γ-actin accumulation in cells was slower than β-actin, further confirming global differences in actin isoform translation. Molecular simulations of actin assembly at the focal adhesions showed that differences in translation rates can directly impact actin bundle formation, leading to shorter actin bundles in the case of slower translating γ-actin, in agreement with our experimental data.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that nucleotide coding sequence-dependent translation rates, coupled to zipcode-targeted <italic>actin</italic> mRNA localization, play an essential role in differentiating actin isoforms’ function in cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>β- and γ-actin coding sequences have differential effects on cell migration speed</title><p>To test the specific effect of coding sequences on intracellular functions of actin isoforms, we generated immortalized MEF cell cultures stably expressing β- and γ-actin coding sequences, as well as their codon-switched variants (β-coded γ-actin and γ-coded β-actin), cloned into identical expression constructs under the human β-actin promoter, containing an N-terminal eGFP fusion and the β-actin 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top left, and 'Materials and methods'). This construct design enabled us to confine our experiments to the effects of the coding sequence and exclude any potential contribution from other elements known to mediate differences between β- and γ-actins, including promoter-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tunnacliffe et al., 2018</xref>), differential 3′UTR-mediated mRNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill and Gunning, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kislauskis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kislauskis et al., 1994</xref>), and differential N-terminal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Cell populations stably expressing eGFP constructs were checked to ensure similar levels of <italic>eGFP</italic> mRNA, as well as to confirm that the expression of the exogenous eGFP-actin did not have any significant effect on the endogenous <italic>β-actin</italic> and <italic>γ-actin</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also confirmed that β-actin 3′UTR targeted the <italic>eGFP-actin</italic> mRNA to the cell periphery, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that the level and distribution of F-actin in each of the cell cultures transfected with different actin isoforms was largely similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in these cell populations, the effects of exogenously expressed actin could be tested without perturbation of other actin-related processes that are essential for cell viability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell migration speed is regulated by actin isoform coding sequence.</title><p>Top left, mutagenesis strategy used to generate ‘codon-switched’ actin variants and linear maps of the major constructs used in this study.

We, therefore, tested whether cells expressing eGFP-β-actin or eGFP-γ-actin showed any differences in cell migration using a wound-healing assay.

Focal adhesions’ strength and persistence are closely regulated by their association with actin filaments, which grow at the focal adhesion sites to form a dynamic actin bundle that participates in anchoring the cells to the substrate. Thus, focal adhesions critically depend on actin dynamics in the vicinity of the adhesion site. In turn, focal adhesions can regulate cell spreading and polarization, in addition to cell migration rates.</p><p>To test these processes in eGFP-actin isoform-transfected cells, we first looked at the rate and persistence of leading edge protrusions and retractions, but found no consistent differences between the cell populations that correlated with cell migration rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next assessed focal adhesion dynamics in these cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M) of eGFP-β-actin and eGFP-γ-actin. Since the imaging volume in TIRF-M is limited to the basal 300 nm or less, we reasoned that most of the actin signals visible in this volume should be associated with focal adhesion patches. Imaging the long-term (hours) behavior of actin at focal adhesion patches during wound healing using TIRF-M revealed that in migrating cells, eGFP-β-actin patches appeared more prominent and persisted considerably longer than eGFP-γ-actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), suggesting that focal adhesions in eGFP-β-actin-expressing cells persist for longer periods of time.

This could be due to the fact that the majority of focal adhesions in all of these cells were small and dot-like, and only a few larger ones tended to exhibit potential differences in morphology. Thus, β- and γ-actin coding sequences determine the size and distribution of focal adhesions in migrating cells in a manner that correlates with changes in their migration speed.</p><p>We also measured focal adhesion recovery rates in single-cell cultures using FRAP.

To test whether focal adhesion changes in our cell populations are accompanied by changes in cell spreading and polarization, we used Celltool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pincus and Theriot, 2007</xref>) to analyze shape distribution of single cells stably expressing eGFP-β-actin, eGFP-γ-actin, and their codon-switched variants.

The first mode roughly captures the variation in the size of the cell footprint on the substrate and accounts for ~40% of the variance in shape, while the second mode captures cell polarization and accounts for ~20% of the variance in shape. Using these shape modes to analyze images of cells expressing different actin isoforms’ coding sequences, we found that cells expressing eGFP-β-actin had a larger footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>, clustered to the left of the y-axis) and had more variance in their polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>, spread across the y-axis), while cells expressing eGFP-γ-actin exhibited the opposite trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>, clustered mostly in the top right quadrant).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified the area of trypsinized near-spherical cells (pre-spreading), which directly reflects cell size and volume.

This ~6% difference in cell size was far less prominent than the difference in spread cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8B</xref>, right), which accounted for a greater than 80% change in the size of cell footprint.

Such differences, if prominent enough, could in principle lead to changes in cells’ ability to form focal adhesions and migrate. To test this prediction, we first compared the rates of overall protein accumulation of eGFP-β- and eGFP-γ-actin, by comparing FRAP of the total eGFP signal in the cell after whole-cell photobleaching. We reasoned that this would serve as a proxy for estimation of newly synthesized β- and γ-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, the recovery observed in these FRAP experiments within a 10-min imaging window arises from the folding and maturation of already synthesized eGFP fused to actin (since the eGFP maturation rate in vivo has been estimated to be approximately 14 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balleza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka et al., 2011</xref>]); given the constant time delay, this recovery rate directly reflects the rate of de novo synthesized actin accumulation within the imaging window.

Assuming similar translation initiation rates for both constructs (given their identical 5′ sequences at and around the translation initiation sites), fewer elongating ribosomes in this assay arise from their faster translocation over the mRNA, leading to weaker sfGFP signals per mRNA.

Many studies assume that this subunit supply rate is not a limiting factor in vivo, due to high concentrations of G-actin at the cell leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raz-Ben Aroush et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is likely that the actin bundles forming at focal adhesion sites must compete with the actin meshwork at the lamellipodium for polymerization competent actin. There is increasing evidence suggesting such a competition between various actin-driven processes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faust et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suarez and Kovar, 2016</xref>). In addition, it is possible that at a given moment, some, or most, of the free actin can be sequestered, for example, by monomer-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skruber et al., 2018</xref>), forcing the elongating leading edge filaments to depend on de novo synthesized actin. In support, <italic>actin</italic> mRNA targeting to the cell leading edge is essential for cell migration, suggesting that local actin synthesis at the cell leading edge must be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, local actin translation bursts have been observed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that these bursts, regardless of the overall actin concentrations, are required for locally supplying actin subunits at the focal adhesions during cell migration. If so, replacing the faster translationally elongating β-actin with the slower elongating γ-actin at these sites could potentially limit this supply and make a difference in focal adhesion anchoring, leading to shorter actin bundles at the focal adhesions, poorer spreading, and faster migration seen in γ-actin-expressing cells.</p><p>Since measuring local polymerization-competent actin in a cell is impossible experimentally, we used the computational model of active networks, MEDYAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Popov et al., 2016</xref>). We simulated actin bundle growth at the focal adhesions at different subunit supply rates, in the presence of non-muscle myosin II motors and α-actinin as crosslinkers, which are critical for actin filament bundling in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In these simulations, filaments elongate by incorporating newly supplied actin monomers, and then bundle together through the action of myosin motors and crosslinkers. During 10-min simulations, the time window typically sufficient for establishment of robust focal adhesions, varying actin subunit supply rate resulted in pronounced differences in the length of the actin bundle growing from the focal adhesion site (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). A twofold decrease in subunit supply rate resulted in over a twofold decrease in actin bundle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To test this prediction experimentally, we measured the length of eGFP-actin-decorated bundles emanating from paxillin-positive focal adhesion patches in cells stably expressing different eGFP-actin isoforms, using both the migrating cells at the edge of the wound and single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). In both types of cultures, actin bundles associated with the focal adhesion sites were markedly longer in β-actin-expressing cells, compared to those expressing γ-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Moreover, these trends followed the actin coding sequence, rather than the amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Thus, the slower subunit supply dictated by differences in translation elongation rates of β- and γ-actin coding sequences during the initial events of focal adhesion formation and maturation bears direct consequences to cell adhesion and migration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Faster β-actin subunit initial supply rate facilitates actin bundle formation at the focal adhesions to support normal cell migration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Molecular simulations of actin filament growth at the focal adhesion at four different subunit supply rates, using the components listed on the right.

We found that differences in β- and γ-actin coding sequences result in different ribosome elongation rates during their translation, leading to changes in cell spreading, focal adhesion anchoring, and cell migration speed. This study constitutes the first direct comparison of translation rates of two closely related proteins and the first demonstration that these translation rates can mediate their functions in vivo.</p><p>On the surface, it appears to be surprising that expression of the slower-translating γ-actin can make the cells move faster than the faster-translating β-actin. However, this result fits well into the context of the previously proposed localized bursts of β-actin translation, implicated in cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Condeelis and Singer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katz et al., 2012</xref>). Our data show that faster translating β-actin is required for generating stable focal adhesions, while the slower translating γ-actin leads to faster focal adhesion turnover. Importantly, our data also show that the effects mediated by slower translating γ-actin on cell migration manifest only when the <italic>γ-actin</italic> mRNA is targeted to the cell periphery via the β-actin zipcode sequence. Our study on codon profile-mediated actin isoform-specific translation differences, along with studies that showed actin isoform UTRs conferring isoform-specific mRNA localization with unique functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kislauskis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moradi et al., 2017</xref>), establish physiological roles to nucleotide elements in determining cellular phenotypes of isoactins.</p><p>We propose that slower translation at the leading edge makes γ-actin less capable of supporting and sustaining strong focal adhesions. Given that rapid polymerization of actin is required for lamellipodium protrusion and focal adhesion formation, one plausible role of localized fast actin translation at focal adhesions is to balance the competition between actin monomer pools required for protrusion and adhesion formation. In support, in γ-actin-expressing cells, most focal adhesions, while larger in area, do not appear to be visibly anchored by prominent actin bundles. In contrast, cells expressing β-actin contain long actin cables emanating from most of the focal adhesion sites. This difference impairs spreading without significantly changing protrusion dynamics. We propose that the faster migration rate is thus caused by weaker cell-substrate attachment in cells expressing γ-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, this increase in cell speed is only evident in a wound-healing assay, where cells are collectively stimulated to migrate directionally, rather than randomly move around as typical for these cells in single-cell cultures of MEFs. It is likely that actin behavior in response to the strong signals for cells to polarize and move directionally during wound healing depends on local actin translation more critically than during random migration, where cells can change directions or remain stationary for extended periods of time and are not constrained in the direction of their polarization and motility. These constraints could potentially involve tension generated in dense cultures during collective migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trepat et al., 2009</xref>), as well as other forms of signaling in dense cultures.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hypothesis of cell migration regulation by actin isoforms’ translation rates.</title><p>Faster translating β-actin facilitates focal adhesion (FA) formation and persistence, resulting in increased cell spreading and a reduced rate of directional cell movement.

It appears surprising that a twofold difference in translation elongation rate found in our study could exert such a pronounced effect on the length of the actin bundles forming locally at the focal adhesion sites, especially given the fact that polymerization-competent actin should exist everywhere in the lamellipodia. Our results suggest that the concentration of this polymerization-competent actin pool may be far lower than previously estimated, potentially due to the competition between different actin pools undergoing rapid polymerization, as well as the action of monomer sequestering proteins and/or posttranslational modifications that may prevent actin from incorporating into filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skruber et al., 2018</xref>). It is also possible that, even with a higher actin concentration in the lamellipodia, focal adhesions compete with the monomer pool, thus requiring local translation of β-actin. Notably, these differences are expected to be even higher with the native non-eGFP-fused actin isoforms, which likely differ in their translation initiation rates in addition to the difference in elongation rates we observed. These questions, and the exact interplay between newly synthesized and diffusible actin in cells, constitute an exciting direction of future studies.</p><p>Our previous work has shown that actin coding sequence leads to differential arginylation of β- and γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and this arginylation is important for directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karakozova et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, the use of N-terminal eGFP fusions likely excludes arginylation as a variable in our cell populations, since arginylation is believed to require an exposed β-actin N-terminus. The use of GFP-actin fusions also likely limits the types of effects we can observe, since these fusions are not fully functionally equivalent to the native actin and are impaired, for example, in formin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our constructs cannot substitute for all aspects of normal actin in cells, and this could explain the fact that the strongest effects we observe are related to cell adhesion and migration, the processes that are likely able to fully utilize eGFP-actin. Notably, in our cells, the endogenous β- and γ-actin are still present and still able to support cell migration, likely compensating for these types of functions, and potentially diminishing the observed phenotypes.</p><p>Thinking of the nucleotide sequence, rather than the amino acid sequence, as a determinant of actin function is a novel view that opens up many exciting questions. The present study demonstrates that coding sequence alone can play a significant role in cell behavior, but it does not exclude the possibility that other nucleotide-based elements of the actin gene also contribute to actin isoforms’ global role in organism survival. For example, it has been shown that a unique intron in the γ-actin gene can contribute to its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lloyd and Gunning, 1993</xref>). Studies of the interplay of nucleotide- and amino acid-based determinants in actin functions constitute exciting future directions in the field.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>NEB Stable (Stbl3)</td><td>New England Biosciences</td><td>C3040I</td><td>Chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Spontaneously immortalized MEFs</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from E12.5-E16.5 mouse embryos.

The region of interest for photobleaching was defined using a freehand Region of Interest (ROI) manager in Nikon Instruments NIS elements software: an elliptical region encompassing an actin patch at the cell periphery for TIRF-FRAP, the entire cell for widefield whole-cell FRAP, and a single-pixel spot containing the translation site for SINAPS-FRAP. eGFP-actin-expressing cells were seeded on Matek glass bottom dishes and allowed to spread overnight. For photobleaching, the 488 nm laser was set to 80% power and used to bleach a defined eGFP-actin patch at the cell periphery with a dwell time of 400 µs/pixel. Images were acquired in the TIRF mode with the 488 nm laser set to 50% power and 200 ms exposure and an electron-multiplying (EM) gain of 200. Images were acquired at 3 s intervals for 12 s pre-bleach and 6 min post-bleach. The change in fluorescence intensity in a circle within an actin patch that was not bleached was used as a reference to account for photobleaching during acquisition. The change in intensity within a circle of the same area within the bleached actin patch was used to calculate the recovery curve. The obtained values were normalized to one at pre-bleach, and the resulting post-bleach curves were fit using non-linear regression to a single exponential fit in GraphPad PRISM.</p><p>For whole-cell eGFP-actin FRAP, the whole cell was outlined. For photobleaching, the 488 nm laser was set to 70% power with a dwell time of 70 µs/pixel. Acquisition was carried out using a 488 nm LED illumination from Spectra/Aura with 10% illumination intensity and 200 ms exposure with an EM gain of 300. Images were acquired every 10 s for a total of 10 min after bleaching. The recovery curves obtained were fit using a linear regression model in GraphPad PRISM.</p><p>For live-cell SINAPS-FRAP, cells expressing SINAPS-actin constructs were tethered using Vinculin-stdMCP-Halo (see sections 'Constructs' and 'Generation of polyclonal stable cell populations' above). For photobleaching, the 488 nm laser was set to 80% power with a dwell time of 1 ms/pixel. Images were acquired in the spinning disc confocal mode with the 488 nm laser set to 30% power and 35 ms exposure with an EM gain of 300. Images were acquired at 700 ms intervals for 30 s pre-bleach and 7 min post-bleach.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Translation elongation rate measurements</title><p>FishQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>) was used to detect NAP and mRNA signals. Spots in the NAP channel that were within 300 nm of a spot in the mRNA channel were considered bonafide NAPs and were used for estimating the integrated fluorescence intensity in both channels.</p><p>Airlocalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lionnet et al., 2011</xref>) was used to fit the signal from tethered NAPs. The integrated signal was recorded pre-bleach and post-bleach. These values were used to calculate the translation elongation rates of the two actin isoforms.</p><p>Assuming that beta-actin has the same elongation rate as Suntag, AID, and linkers, following the theoretical derivation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2016</xref>, it is straight forward to show that the proportion of beta-actin contribution to recovery time and NAP/mRNA is (L+(N + 1)/2)/(S + L + (N + 1)/2), in which N is the total number of Suntags, S is the beta-actin length in the unit of 1 Suntag, and L is the length of AID and linkers in the unit of 1 Suntag, shown as the gray bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>. It is not surprising to see from those figures that the ratios of recovery time to NAP/mRNA are similar for beta- and gamma-actin, since the initiation rates for both constructs should be the same, given the identical N-termini. Therefore, we calculated the variance-weighted geometric average of the two ratios, which is T ~ 26.9 s, and used it to combine the data from recovery time and NAP/mRNA to calculate the beta-actin elongation rate: Rb=(S + L + (N + 1)/2)/t or Rb=(S + L + (N + 1)/2)/n/T, where t is recovery time and n is NAP/mRNA, for each data point, followed by geometric averaging. The contribution from Suntag, AID, and linkers to recovery time is T0 = (L+(N + 1)/2)/Rb, which is used to calculate the gamma-actin elongation rate: Rg = S/(t-T0) or Rg = S/(n*T-T0) for each data point, followed by geometric averaging. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence staining and analysis</title><p>To quantify the amount of actin polymer, cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates at 20,000 cells/well overnight and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then stained with phalloidin conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired on Leica DM6000 at X40 and the total intensity of phalloidin per cell was measured using Fiji (NIH). To analyze focal adhesions in single cells, eGFP-actin-expressing cells were seeded on coverslips and allowed to adhere and spread overnight. Cells were then fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA at room temperature for 30 min followed by 0.5% Triton-X 100 treatment for 5 min. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), followed by AlexaFluor 555-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Cells were imaged with Citifluor (Cytoskeleton Inc) anti-bleaching agent. To analyze cell spreading and cell area, Celltool was used to outline cell shapes and classify them and extract shape modes. The shape modes that captured 60% of the overall variability in the shape model were used to assess the distribution of cell shapes in a principle component analysis (PCA) plot. Additionally, a kernel density estimate of the marginal was used to plot the area of focal adhesions.</p><p>FISH <italic>eGFP</italic> mRNA probes (conjugated to Quasar 670 dye) were purchased from LGC Biosearch Technologies (VSMF 1015–5) and FISH was carried out as per manufacturers’ protocol.

In brief, MEDYAN simulates actin networks by integrating the stochastic diffusion-reaction dynamics and mechanical relaxation of the cytoskeletal network. Diffusing molecular species, including actin monomers, unbound myosin motors, and unbound crosslinkers, are contained in a solution phase. Stochastic chemical reactions such as actin (de)polymerization and (un)binding of motors and linkers follow mass-action kinetics, and change the mechanical energy of the actin network. The net forces are then periodically relaxed using conjugate-gradient mechanical equilibration. This step also updates reaction rates of motor walking, motor unbinding, and linker unbinding, based on residue tension after minimization.</p><p>We used a 1×1×4 μm<sup>3</sup> simulation box, containing non-muscle myosin II motors, alpha-actinin crosslinkers, actin monomers, and actin filaments growing from the bottom focal adhesion region. The focal adhesion region was presented as a hemisphere with 30 actin filaments attached. We tested and found that the actin filaments never grow longer than 4 μm in the z-direction, and thus, no length constraints on the actin bundles factored into the simulations. Actin filaments were only allowed to elongate at one end (the barbed end), while the elongation rate constant was averaged over filament polymerization rates and depolymerization rates of both the barbed end and the pointed end. The filament elongation was driven by the addition of actin monomers to the system, simulating the synthesis of actin monomers near the focal adhesion region. Multiple actin supply rates were tested at 50% increments based on the experimental measurements of the differences between β- and γ-actin synthesis rates. The simulations were run for 10 min to match the timescale of the experiments. The starting concentration of actin at the attachment site was assumed to be ~2 μM locally, creating an initial bundle at around 0.1 μm long. In the simulation, the majority (more than 90%) of actin for the filament growth was assumed to arise from the de novo subunit addition. The concentrations of myosin mini-filaments (0.012–0.021 μM) and alpha-actinin crosslinkers (1.25 μM) were chosen to ensure proper bundling of filaments (all model parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Model parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Parameter name</th><th>Value</th><th>Reference and notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Filaments</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Filament polymerization and depolymerization rates</td><td valign="top">κ<sub>on</sub> = 12.9 (11.6 + 1.3) <italic>μM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup></italic> κ<sub>off</sub> = 2.2 (1.4 + 0.8) <italic>s<sup>-1</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>) Taking both barbed ends and pointed ends into account</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Filament bending constant</td><td valign="top">672.5 pN·nm</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ott et al., 1993</xref>) Bending constant between connecting cylinders<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Filament stretching constant</td><td valign="top">100.0 pN/nm</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Popov et al., 2016</xref>) Stretching constant of cylinder</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Motors</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Binding rate constant</td><td valign="top">0.2 s<sup>-1</sup> per head</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stam et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Duty ratio</td><td valign="top">0.1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stam et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of motor heads per mini-filament</td><td valign="top">15–30</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verkhovsky and Borisy, 1993</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Stretching constant</td><td valign="top">56.0 pN/nm</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Popov et al., 2016</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Characteristic stall force</td><td valign="top">15.0 pN per head</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Popov et al., 2016</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Characteristic motor unbinding force</td><td valign="top">12.6 pN per head</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erdmann et al., 2013</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Crosslinkers</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Binding rate constant</td><td valign="top">0.7 μM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wachsstock et al., 1993</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Unbinding rate constant</td><td valign="top">0.3 s<sup>-1</sup></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wachsstock et al., 1993</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Stretching constant</td><td valign="top">8.0 pN/nm</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiDonna and Levine, 2007</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Characteristic linker unbinding force</td><td valign="top">17.2 pN</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrer et al., 2008</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>* Filaments are discretized into cylinders, and the length of cylinders ranges from 2.7 nm (1 subunit) to a maximum of 108 nm (40 subunits).

your article &quot;Different translation dynamics of β-and γ-actin regulates cell migration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: R Dyche Mullins (Reviewer #2); Peter W Gunning (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The details of the gene construct used to build the vectors is not clear in Methods. How much 5' upstream sequence of the β-actin gene is used and from what species (chicken, mouse, human)? Are any introns present? Is the full 5'UTR of β-actin included? Is there a linker between GFP and the amino terminus of actin? What provides the transcription termination down stream of the polyadenylation site? This is all important information to enable reproduction of the study.</p><p>2. The authors refer to cell lines throughout the paper. Transfected cell lines relate to a clonal origin whereas these are polyclonal populations of cells. I recommend avoidance of the term cell lines to avoid confusion.</p><p>3. In Figure 1 the legend refers to constructs that lack the β-actin 3'UTR targeting sequence, but this is not shown in the figure. Is only the targeting sequence eliminated or is the entire β-actin 3'UTR removed? If it is the latter, what is used to provide a 3'UTR? Results are mentioned in the text that demonstrate that the functional differences are only observed with the targeting sequence intact in the constructs. This is an important point and addressed in Figure S5, however, it is not clear if removal of the targeting sequence from the γ-actin gene construct produces a significant decrease in motility. Is the difference statistically significant?</p><p>4. The images in Figure 2 would benefit from quantitation of focal adhesion lifetimes and morphology (beyond area convincingly covered in Figure 3) to support the conclusions that both are impacted differently by the nucleotide sequences of β- and γ-actin.</p><p>5. The images in Figure 3 suggest that unlike β-actin with both peripheral and internal focal adhesions, the γ-actin nucleotide sequence promotes almost exclusively only peripheral focal adhesions. Is this widespread in the cells or does it reflect atypical images in the figure?</p><p>6. In the Discussion the authors argue that local synthesis is important for focal adhesion assembly and that there is low availability of actin for polymerisation from the lamellipodium. This seems unlikely because of the rapid polymerisation of actin in the lamellipodium. Could this rather reflect competition between the lamellipodium and focal adhesions for polymerisation competent actin?</p><p>7. The results of Kislauskis and Singer (1997, J Cell Biol) and their work on the spatial distribution of β and α actin isoforms (J. Cell Bio, 1993) and the effect on cell phenotype (J. Cell Bio 1994) should be incorporated into the Discussion since they have addressed the significance of peripheral targeting of β-actin.</p><p>8. More information on statistics would improve the presentation. For example in the scratch assays in Figure 1 the N values are reported as 20 and 22 (for β- and γ-actin respectively) but it is unclear whether this reflects the number of scratches, the number of coverslips, or (unlikely) the number of days on which the experiment was repeated. All of these numbers would be useful for judging the significance of the result. Also in the box-and-whisker plots the authors should indicate the replicate-to-replicate (day-to-day) variation in the results.</p><p>9. The above comment applies generally to the presentation of quantitative cell biological data in the paper. In Figure 3, for example, N is the number of focal adhesions but it is unclear how many cells, coverslips, and/or biological replicates are included in the data. The bar graphs should be replaced by graphics that illustrate the variation between biological replicates (one way to do this would be 'super-plots' https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32346721/ – note that other methods are available). Ditto for quantitative data in Figures 4 and 5 and all the Supplementary Figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68712.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In response to this comment, we updated it with the requested details, including the description of the original plasmids, and the regions replaced in these plasmids to generate the constructs for the study. In brief, the only 5′ upstream non-coding sequence used was the human β-actin promoter. No introns were present. There was a short 5-aminoacid linker between GFP and the N-terminus of actin. Transcription terminator used was bGH polyA, which carries the typical AAUAAA sequence responsible for transcription termination and polyadenylation of the mRNA.

In the plasmids with 3′UTR, the entire 3′UTR from β actin was present. In the plasmids lacking 3′UTR the entire sequence was absent. In both cases, there was the bGH ployA on the 3′ end of the construct, and in the δ 3′UTR plasmid this sequence was the only 3′ UTR element. These details have been added to the Methods section. Of note, this strategy is routine in the actin mRNA targeting studies and these plasmids have been well characterized by R. Singer’s group.</p><p>We modified the supplementary figure S5 to show a comparison of migration rates in cells expressing γ-actin with and without β-actin 3′UTR and included the information on the statistical significance, as well as individual repeats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Focal adhesion morphology described by the aspect ratio was estimated and results plotted in supplementary Figure S13C.

Both parameters show a change consistent with the actin isoforms’ coding sequence, and the differences in focal adhesion numbers are highly statistically significant. These data are now presented in Figure S13A and Figure S13B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The question of availability of monomeric actin in the cell and the various mechanisms that could potentially limit this availability has been a subject of a number of recent studies, and with all the work about how various actin networks are in competition for monomers, this explanation appears likely.
