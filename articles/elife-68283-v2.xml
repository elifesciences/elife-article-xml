One tactic is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In response to certain stimuli, neutrophils decondense their lobulated nucleus and release chromatin into the extracellular space through a process called NETosis. However, NETosis, and the subsequent degradation of NETs, can become dysregulated. NETs are proposed to play a role in infectious as well as many non-infection related diseases including cancer, thrombosis, autoimmunity and neurological disease. Consequently, there is a need to develop specific tools for the study of these structures in disease contexts. In this study, we identified a NET-specific histone H3 cleavage event and harnessed this to develop a cleavage site-specific antibody for the detection of human NETs. By microscopy, this antibody distinguishes NETs from chromatin in purified and mixed cell samples. It also detects NETs in tissue sections. We propose this antibody as a new tool to detect and quantify NETs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>extracellular chromatin</kwd><kwd>NETs</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd><kwd>clipping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zychlinsky</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteolytic events targeting histones can be harnessed to develop antibodies for neutrophil extracellular traps, improving researchers’ ability to distinguish these chromatin-based structures in human samples.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular structures consisting of chromatin components, including DNA and histones, and neutrophil proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2009</xref>). NETs were first described as an antimicrobial response to infection, facilitating trapping and killing of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). They are found in diverse human tissues and secretions where inflammation is evident (recently reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sollberger et al., 2018</xref>). NETs are produced in response to a wide-range of stimuli; bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>; fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urban et al., 2006</xref>; viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saitoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schönrich et al., 2015</xref>; crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>; and mitogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amulic et al., 2017</xref>). Both NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent and NOX-independent mechanisms lead to NET formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hakkim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neeli and Radic, 2013</xref>). NETs are also observed in sterile disease, including multiple types of thrombotic disease (recently reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jimenez-Alcazar et al., 2017</xref>) and even neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zenaro et al., 2015</xref>). NETs, or their components, are implicated in the development and exacerbation of autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (recently reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papayannopoulos, 2018</xref>) as well as cancer and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrengues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cools-Lartigue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demers et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, there is an urgency across multiple fields to establish the pathological contribution of NETs to disease. However, the detection of NETs in affected tissues remains a challenge.</p><p>NETs are histologically defined as areas of decondensed DNA and histones that colocalise with neutrophil granular or cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, reliable detection of NETs requires a combination of anti-neutrophil and anti-chromatin antibodies as well as DNA stains. Immunofluorescent microscopy is a useful method to detect NETs in tissue sections and in vitro experiments. However, this can be challenging since NET components are distributed across the large decondensed structure resulting in a weak signal. For example, the signal of antibodies to neutrophil elastase (NE) is significantly dimmer in NETs than in the granules of resting cells where this protease is highly concentrated. Conversely, anti-histone antibodies stain NETs strongly but not nuclei of naïve neutrophils, where the chromatin is compact and less accessible. This differential histone staining property can be exploited for the detection and quantification of NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinkmann et al., 2012</xref>). However, sample preparation and the subsequent image analysis make results between different labs difficult to compare. Thus, there is a need to identify antibodies against NET antigens.</p><p>NETs can also be detected through post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur during NETosis. Histone 3 (H3) is deaminated in arginine residues - the conversion to citrulline (citrullination) - by protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Citrullinated H3 (H3cit) is widely used as a surrogate marker of NETs in both in vitro and in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pertiwi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). Cleavage of histones by granular derived neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) also contributes to NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Histone cleavage, or clipping, by cysteine or serine proteases is a bona fide histone PTM that facilitates the gross removal of multiple, subtler, PTMs in the histone tail and is conserved from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhaenens et al., 2015</xref>). Until now, histone clipping has not been exploited for the detection of NETs but recent work by our group showed that histone H3 cleavage is a conserved response to diverse NET stimuli, including <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and Group B Streptococcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in this study we map the site(s) of histone H3 cleavage during NETosis. We developed a new monoclonal antibody against cleaved H3 that detects human NETs in vitro and in histological samples. This antibody also facilitates easier NET quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Serine protease dependent cleavage of Histone H3 N-terminal tails during NET formation</title><p>Histones are processed in response to phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate - PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2009</xref>) and other NET stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the cleavage products of H3 were consistent between stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that H3 proteolysis occurs at specific sites during NETosis. In a time course experiment of human neutrophils incubated with PMA, we detected a H3 cleavage product of ~14 kDa as early as 30 min post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further cleavages occurred between 60 and 90 min, yielding products of approximately 13 kDa and 10 kDa, respectively. The histone N-terminal tails protrude from the nucleosome core and are a major PTM target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). A C-terminal, but not an N-terminal, directed histone antibody detected the cleavage products of H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that the N-terminus is cleaved in truncated H3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PMA-induced Histone H3 cleavage occurs in the N-terminal domain and is prevented by serine protease inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neutrophils were preincubated with the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF for 30 min in microcentrifuge tubes and then stimulated with PMA as indicated in the figure.

We tested the contribution of these proteases to H3 cleavage during NET formation. Preincubation with the serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF (4- [2-aminoethyl] benzensulfonylfluoride) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but not with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), inhibited H3 cleavage upon PMA stimulation. AEBSF also inhibited NET formation and nuclear decondensation as shown by immunofluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PMA induced NETosis requires NADPH oxidase activity and, at high concentrations, AEBSF can inhibit activation of NAPDH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diatchuk et al., 1997</xref>). To rule out this upstream effect, we showed that AEBSF did not inhibit ROS production at the concentrations used in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, we verified that at these concentrations AEBSF was not cytotoxic, as shown by limited LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This data shows that the N-terminus of H3 is cleaved early during NET formation and that this event is dependent on serine protease activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Histone H3 is cleaved at a novel site in the globular domain</title><p>To identify the precise H3 cleavage sites we prepared histone enriched extracts from primary neutrophils stimulated with PMA for 90 min and then purified H3 by RP-HPLC as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shechter et al., 2007</xref>).

cleavage site monoclonal antibody</title><p>We adopted a similar strategy to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 2008</xref> to raise antibodies against the cleaved site. We designed a lysine branched immunogen containing the five amino acids at the carboxylic side of the H3R49 cleavage site (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) and used it to immunize mice. After preliminary screening by ELISA against the immunogen and control peptides, we selected sera, and later hybridoma clones, that detected cleaved H3 in immunoblots of PMA stimulated cell lysates. We excluded sera and clones that detected full length histone H3 in addition to cleaved H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We selected sera and clones that detected NETs but not resting chromatin of naive neutrophils by immunofluorescence microscopy. Of the six mice immunised, we obtained one stable clone, 3D9, that functioned in both Western blot and microscopy – other clones performed only in Western blot (data not shown). 3D9 recognised a protein of ~10 kDa in neutrophils stimulated with PMA for 120 min and longer but did not detect any protein in resting or early stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This band corresponded in size with the smallest H3 fragment detected by the H3 C-terminal antibody. Interestingly, by microscopy, 3D9 exclusively recognised neutrophils undergoing NETosis – with decondensing chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To test the binding of the antibody to the de novo N-terminal H3 epitope of NETs, we performed competition experiments with the immunising peptide. In contrast to a control peptide, saturation of 3D9 with the immunising peptide blocked binding to NETs as shown by immunofluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>List of immunisation, screening, and competition peptides.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Immunisation</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H - REIRRK(RRIER)C - NH<sub>2</sub> <italic>KLH conjugated</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Screening</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(+) H - REIRRK(RRIER)C - NH<sub>2</sub><break/>(-) H - AARKSK(SKRAA)C - NH<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table3fn1">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Validation</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H - REIRRK(RRIER) - NH<sub>2</sub> <italic>competition peptide</italic><break/>H - TGGVKK(KVGGT) - NH<sub>2</sub> <italic>negative control</italic></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table3fn1"><label>*</label><p>Alternative branched peptide used for screening.The N-terminal is represented by H (H<sub>2</sub>N) and the C-terminal is represented by NH<sub>2</sub> (CONH<sub>2</sub>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Screening and detection of cleaved H3 and NETs by 3D9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblots of lysates prepared from neutrophils stimulated with PMA (50 nM) for the times indicated in the figure.

This antibody binds to the immunizing peptide and to isolated NETs, but not to equal concentrations of chromatin, recombinant H3 or purified calf thymus DNA, by direct ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, in immunoprecipitation experiments, 3D9, but not an isotype control, pulled down intact H3 in lysates of naïve and activated neutrophils, but only the cleaved fragment from activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We detected these pull downs both by Coomassie and silver stained gels. In a similar experiment, we immunoblotted the immunoprecipitate with the C-terminal antibody as well as 3D9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> [ii]) and showed that only our monoclonal antibody recognises cleaved H3. However, when we performed preliminary experiments to see if the antibody had the potential to work in blood samples, we observed a strong reaction of the antibody with a plasma protein(s), but not with serum-protein(s) as determined by direct ELISA and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, 3D9 may not be suitable for direct detection of NETs in biological fluids that may contain plasma proteins. Together this data shows that 3D9 is selective for cleaved H3 under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE but may also recognize full length H3 under the more native conditions of IP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Epitope mapping</title><p>To determine the binding site of 3D9 in histone H3, we tested the antibody by ELISA with overlapping linear peptide arrays and helical peptide mimic arrays based on a sequence (residues 30–70; PATGGVKKPHRYRPGTVALREIRRYQKSTELLIRKLPFQRL) around the H3R49 cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). In epitope mapping, acetylation is commonly used during peptide synthesis to neutralize the positive charge of the terminal amine groups, making the peptide more closely resemble its native conformation, as part of a larger protein. However, as we were interested in a binding site formed as a consequence of proteolysis, we included both acetylated and non-acetylated arrays of peptides to allow for potential changes in the charge of the terminal amino acid that may contribute to antibody binding. Based on overlapping peptides, the putative core epitope in the linear array was (R)EIRR. The peptides ending in REIRR were in all cases in the top 2 of each peptide mimic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, peptides extended at the N-terminus were still recognized. Moreover, acetylation at the N-terminus of the peptide ending in the REIRR sequence did not affect the binding, suggesting that a free N-terminus may not be recognized by the antibody.

Both methods use automatic thresholding of the DNA channel (Hoechst) to count total cells/objects. The historical semi-automatic method exploits the differential staining by chromatin antibodies of decondensed chromatin (high signal) over compact chromatin (weak signal) to count cells in NETosis. This method uses a manual thresholding and segmentation procedure (denoted manual in the figure). This manual thresholding step is subject to observer bias. In contrast, the modified method uses automatic thresholding at both stages; total cell and NET counts. Both methods use a size exclusion particle analysis step so that only structures larger than a resting nucleus are counted. Both 3D9 and PL2.3 antibodies effectively quantified NETs using previously published method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> - manual). However, PL2.3 failed to accurately quantify the number of NETs with the fully automatic method, specifically at early time points after stimulation (15 min). In this case, the weakly staining lobulated nucleus can extend over a larger surface area during cell activation and adhesion resulting in these cells being wrongly categorised as NETs by the algorithm. Together, this data suggests that the automatic method using 3D9 staining may reduce experimental bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>3D9 detects NETs induced by multiple stimuli</title><p>Histone H3 cleavage is a feature of the neutrophil response to multiple NET stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>). 3D9 detects NETs induced by the bacterial toxin nigericin, which induces NETs independently of NADPH oxidase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>), by heme in TNF primed neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knackstedt et al., 2019</xref>) and by the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

It occurs through PTMs that partially neutralise the histone positive charge and thus the affinity of histones for negatively charged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). One way to achieve this is through proteolytic removal of the lysine and arginine rich histone tails. Using a biochemical and proteomic approach, we determined that H3 is cleaved at multiple sites in its N-terminal tail during the course of NET formation and notably, at a novel cleavage site in its globular domain, H3R49, at ~120 min. We exploited the specificity of this event to produce a mouse monoclonal antibody to the de novo histone H3 epitope, the new N-terminal beginning at R49. This antibody, 3D9, recognises human NETs induced by both microbial and host derived physiological stimuli and distinguishes netotic neutrophils from neutrophils that die via apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis, in vitro. It also discriminates between NETs and other cells in mixed blood cell fractions and, importantly, NETs in human histological samples.</p><p>Until now, histone citrullination is the only PTM that has been used for antibody-based detection of NETs. In this paper, we propose histone cleavage at H3R49 as a new histone PTM that can be used for detection of NETs from human samples. The use of H3cit for the detection of NETs is not without controversy, as discussed in depth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konig and Andrade, 2016</xref>. Not all NETs are citrullinated at H3 and NET formation can occur in the absence or inhibition of citrullinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>). Like citrullination, not all NETs contain H3 cleaved at H3R49. With <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, some NET-like structures were not 3D9 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These may be remnants of other forms of cell death or they may be citrullinated NETs as has been shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenny et al., 2017</xref>. By identifying the precise histone cleavage site through edmann degradation, we shed further light on this. The most commonly used H3cit antibody detects citrullination of R2, R8 and R17. However, histone cleavage at R49 would remove the H3cit epitopes, rendering these NET defining PTMs mutually exclusive on a single histone level. Indeed, co-staining by anti-H3cit and 3D9 in inflamed kidney, gallbladder, and appendix paraffin sections, and purified cells revealed extensive mutual exclusion of the two marks, even on a cellular level, and more abundant staining of decondensed chromatin by 3D9. Thus, we propose that 3D9 will allow detection of NETs induced by varied stimuli but that it may display a preference for more mature or proteolytically processed NETs or NETs that are citrullinated to a lesser degree or not at all. These findings may also suggest a need to re-evaluate NET studies derived from experiments using H3cit as the only method used to detect NETs.</p><p>In contrast to the present study, histone cleavage was reported as discriminating between NOX-dependent and NOX-independent pathways of NET formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pieterse et al., 2018</xref>). Using a sandwich ELISA approach, Pieterse et al concluded that, generally, the N-terminal histone tails are removed in NOX-dependent but not NOX-independent NET formation. They used a suite of N-terminal directed antibodies for H2B, H3, and H4, and all H3 epitopes were located N-terminal to the cleavage site H3R49. However, in the final biological sample testing, the authors did not examine H3. Interestingly, the authors also observed that, by immunofluorescent microscopy, all histone N-terminal antibodies failed to stain NETs at time points after cell lysis. Therefore, to us, this data that suggests that at later stages in NETosis the histone N-terminal tails, at least for H3, are cleaved irrespective of the pathway of activation. This is in line with our observations that both NOX-dependent (PMA) and NOX-independent (heme; nigericin) stimuli result in NETs that are recognised by 3D9 and supports our finding that histone H3 cleavage at R49 is a common feature in human NET formation.</p><p>In this study we detect NETs in fixed or denatured human samples from in vitro experiments and histological samples. While an ELISA with 3D9 revealed a preference for native NETs over isolated chromatin or recombinant H3 (under mild detergent conditions), immunoprecipitation of naive cell lysates by 3D9 also pulled down full length H3 as confirmed by immunoblot. It is not yet clear if this is due to co-immunoprecipitation due to the presence of low levels of clipped histone or if this represents true recognition of intact H3 by 3D9. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation revealed 3D9 reacts with a plasma protein(s) in ELISA and western blot - albeit of a higher molecular weight – (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and thus, care should be taken in the design of future assays and selection of sample when detecting cleaved H3, NETs or vital NETs under native and mild detergent conditions. In particular, 3D9 alone may not be suitable for direct detection of NETs in complex biological fluids and a sandwich approach or colocalization with a neutrophil granule protein is likely to be critical.</p><p>More broadly, and applying to the general principles of NET detection, it is not yet possible to prove conclusively that the detected decondensed chromatin originates from the same cell source as the neutrophil proteins which decorate it. For example, in an infected necrotic wound to which to high numbers of neutrophils are recruited. Here, activated neutrophils might release both proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borregaard et al., 1993</xref>) and citrullinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spengler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) that bind to and modify extracellular chromatin generating, according to the histological definition, a NET. This remains a conundrum that requires further exploration.</p><p>N-terminal histone cleavage at H3R49 is a novel and so far undescribed cleavage site in any eukaryotic organism. Unusually, it is located in the globular rather than the unstructured tail region of H3. H3R49 is one of 6 key residues important for the regulation of H3K36me<sup>3</sup> and forms part of the structured nucleosome surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we speculate that removal of the N-terminal tail, in its entirety, could lead to removal of higher order structure interactions and facilitate chromatin decondensation for example removal of H3K9me and its associated heterochromatin protein 1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Khorasanizadeh, 2002</xref>). To determine the contribution of histone cleavage at H3R49 to the process of chromatin decondensation, future work will focus on establishing the protease(s) responsible and the sequence of proteolytic events leading to this final truncation of H3 and NET formation. Given the specificity of this event and its restriction to NETotic forms of cell death, we propose that N-terminal cleavage at H3R49 is an example of histone ‘clipping’ in neutrophils – a term proposed by the histone/histone proteolysis field for specific histone cleavage sites for which a biological function has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhaenens et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>While this study has attempted to characterise 3D9 as tool to detect human NETs, it is limited by the range of NET inducing stimuli tested. In particular, we were unable to produce NETs in response to immune complexes and it will be important to examine the usefulness of 3D9 in future studies into aberrant NET production in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease among others. Critically, its usefulness with patient serum samples will need to be demonstrated, bearing in mind the cross reaction with a plasma protein. While here we compared 3D9 staining to another NET detection method - NE and chromatin antibodies - in vitro, and included another NET surrogate marker - H3cit - in tissues, a more in depth cross-comparison between 3D9, H3cit and other NET staining methods will be needed to fully understand the NET landscape and usefulness of 3D9 for tissue samples going forward. Giving consideration to the caveats that have arisen for the use of H3cit, and that H3cit may not be detecting NETosis in all instances, it will be important to identify the protease responsible for cleavage at H3R49 and, in turn, examine chromatin and cell death responses in cells expressing this protease to help fully establish the specificity of H3R49 clipping in NETosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study represents the first identification of a distinctive and, so far, exclusive marker of NETs and describes the development and characterisation of a complementary antibody to facilitate easier detection of human NETs. Analogous to finding a smoking gun at a crime scene, the monoclonal antibody 3D9 detects evidence of the proteolytic events that occur in NETosis – the proteolytic signature, histone cleavage at H3R49. In doing so, 3D9 discriminates NETs from chromatin of other cells and chromatin of neutrophils that die via alternative mechanisms. This added layer of specificity will simplify the detection of NETs in tissue samples and facilitate comparison of quantitative studies between labs. This will be an important step in assessing the contribution of extracellular chromatin and NETs to disease pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A549 human lung epithelial cells;

(Leiden, The Netherlands). To reconstruct epitopes of the target molecule (H3 residues 30–70 - PATGGVKKPHRYRPGTVALREIRRYQKSTELLIRKLPFQRL) a library of peptide-based peptide mimics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) was synthesized using Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis. An amino functionalized polypropylene support was obtained by grafting with a proprietary hydrophilic polymer formulation, followed by reaction with t-butyloxycarbonyl-hexamethylenediamine (BocHMDA) using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) with N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and subsequent cleavage of the Boc-groups using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Standard Fmoc-peptide synthesis was used to synthesize peptides on the amino-functionalized solid support by custom modified JANUS liquid handling stations (Perkin Elmer). Synthesis of structural mimics (conformational analysis) was done using Pepscan’s proprietary Chemically Linked Peptides on Scaffolds (CLIPS) technology. The binding of antibody to each of the synthesized peptides was tested in a Pepscan-based ELISA. The peptide arrays were incubated with primary antibody (3D9 or isotype control) at 0.02 µg/ml for linear and conformational analysis and 0.5 µg/ml for amino acid replacement analysis (overnight at 4 °C). After washing, the peptide arrays were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG(H+L) HRP conjugate (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) for one hour at 25 °C. After washing, the peroxidase substrate 2,2’-azino-di-3- ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) and 20 μl/ml of 3% H2O2 were added. After one hour, the colour development was quantified using a charge coupled device (CCD) - camera and an image processing system. The values obtained from the CCD camera ranged from 0 to 3000 mAU, similar to a standard 96-well plate ELISA-reader. The results were quantified and stored in the Peplab database. To verify the quality of the synthesized peptides, a separate set of positive and negative control peptides was synthesized in parallel. These were screened with commercial antibodies 3C9 and 57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Posthumus et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the binding and determine the core epitope, screenings were optimized for concentration and blocking conditions for each sample until clear signals over background values were observed. Peaks were defined as at least in the third quartile for the specific peptide mimic values. In addition, a binding event was only noted if multiple overlapping peaks were present within the binding region. To determine a core epitope, peptides within 40% of the main peak intensity were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Quantification of staining characteristics by Image J and R</title><p>In order to assess staining characteristics of antibodies during NET formation we developed a bundle of Image J and R scripts. These scripts allow for an automated workflow starting from 2-channel microscopic images of an experimental series (DNA stain, antibody stain), to a graphical representation and classification of individual cells and eventually to mapping these classifications back to the original images as a graphical overlay. In the first step, nuclei are segmented based on intensity thresholding (either programmatic or manual), including options for lower and upper size selection limits. The same threshold is applied to the entire experimental series and the upper size limit is used to exclude fused structures that cannot be assigned individual cells. A quality score is assigned to every image based on the fraction of the total DNA stained area that can be assigned to individual cells (or NETs). This score along with all other parameters of the analysis is exported as report file and can be used to automatically exclude images from the analysis. In addition, this part of the script generates a result file that includes the area, circumference (as x,y coordinates) and cumulative intensities for each channel for every detected nucleus along with information such as time point or stimulus that can be assigned programmatically. In order to analyse these data sets, we implemented a series of functions in R. These functions include import of Image J result files, classification of cells based on nuclear area and staining intensity, various plot and data export functions, as well mapping functions that allow to display the classification of nuclei as color coded circumferences overlaid on the original images.

All microscopy image datasets were processed by both methods to allow comparison. Hoechst was used to stain total DNA and NETs were additionally stained with anti-chromatin (PL2.3) or 3D9 antibodies (1 µg/ml) and Alexa-568 coupled secondary antibody according to the previous section. Images were acquired with a Leica DMR upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a Jenoptic B/W digital microscope camera and 10 x (numerical aperture 0.30) or 20 x (numerical aperture 0.50) objective lens. For each experiment, the same exposure settings were used for all samples and a minimum of 3 random fields of view (FOV) were collected. Images were analysed using ImageJ/FIJI software. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinkmann et al., 2012</xref>, each channel was imported as an image sequence and converted into a stack. To count total cells/NETs per FOV, the Hoechst channel stack was imported and segmented using the automatic thresholding function (Bernsen method) with radius 15 and parameter 1 set to 35 to produce a black and white thresholded image. Particle analysis was then performed to count all objects the size of a cell nucleus or bigger (10 x objective: particle size 25-infinity; 20 x objective: particle size 100-infinity) and to exclude background staining artefacts. Total NETs were then counted using the anti-chromatin (PL2.3) or 3D9 channels accordingly. For the method published in 2012, anti-chromatin stains were segmented using manually adjusted thresholding so that the less intense staining of resting cell nuclei was excluded. Particle analysis was then performed to count all objects larger than a resting cell nucleus (10 x objective: particle size 75-infinity; 20 x objective: particle size 250-infinity). This was also performed for 3D9. In contrast, in the second analysis, the workflow was modified so that the automatic Bernsen thresholding and segmentation were used for both Hoechst and NET channels, total cells and NETs respectively. For each method percentage NETs were calculated as (NETs/Total cells) x100. Results per FOV were then averaged according to sample.

Slides were incubated with DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (1:5000) for 5 min, rinsed with water before mounting with Mowiol. Primary antibodies for detection of NETs were as follows: mouse anti-cleaved histone 3 clone 3D9 (2 µg/ml); rabbit anti-histone H3 antibody (citrulline R2+R8+R17; ab5103, Abcam); chicken anti-Histone H2B ab134211 Abcam (1:400); sheep anti-ELANE (NE) LS-Bio LSB 4244 Lot 75251. Secondary antibodies were the following: donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) heavy and light chain (H&amp;L) Alexa Fluor 488 (Jackson 711-225-152); and donkey anti-mouse IgG H&amp;L Cy3 (Jackson 715-165-151); donkey anti-sheep (IgG) H&amp;L Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson 713-605-147). An upright widefield microscope (Leica DMR) equipped with a JENOPTIK B/W digital microscope camera or a Leica confocal microscope SP8 were used for fluorescent imaging. Z-stack images were collected at 63×magnification (Plan Apochromat 63 x/0.75). Where stated colocalisation analysis was performed on confocal images using Volocity 6.5.1 software. Human tonsil (denoted normal but showing neutrophil infiltration) and inflamed kidney paraffin tissue blocks were purchased from AMSbio. Inflamed tissue from a gallbladder and appendix was obtained from archived leftover paraffin embedded diagnostic appendicitis samples and used in an anonymised way after approval through the Charité Ethics Committee (Project EA4/124/19, July 24, 2019). Informed consent from patients for use of biomaterials for research was obtained as part of the institutional treatment contract at Charité.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments were repeated three times unless stated differently in the figure legend.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Felipe Andrade (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please note the following specific points that need to be clarified.</p><p>The authors should demonstrate that 3D9 detects ROS-independent NETs induced by at least two well-described stimuli associated with human diseases (of note, data on platelets as drivers of ROS-independent NETs is puzzling and will need confirmation by the authors if this stimulus is used in these assays).</p><p>There are several very well-defined autoimmune stimuli that are potent inducers of NETs, which can be easily reproduced in vitro. In particular, the authors should validate 3D9 using NETs induced by anti-RNP immune complexes (Sci Transl Med. 2011, 3:73ra20) and by rheumatoid factor (Sci Immunol 2017, 2:eaag3358).</p><p>Can the authors show if the 3D9 antibody detects so-called &quot;vital NETs&quot;?</p><p>Can the authors clarify if the structures induced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> are NETs at all or rather remnants of other forms of neutrophil death?</p><p>Can you the authors show how 3D9 perform in serum samples?</p><p>Figure 7 should also include the analysis of H3cit. It is unclear why PL2.3 was only included in this figure to compare with 3D9.</p><p>Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 should also include the study of pyroptosis. In addition, analysis of H3cit staining should also be included in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. Defining the specificity of 3D9, PL2.3 and H3cit is important to better understand their patterns of staining in tissues.</p><p>To discard that citrullination of H3 blocks its cleavage and detection by 3D9, one possibility could be to determine whether 3D9 detection of NETs induced with calcium ionophores changes in the presence of PAD inhibitors. If H3cit is resistant to cleavage during NETosis, PAD inhibition should increase 3D9 detection particularly at late time points (e.g. 180 mins) in which the H3 fragment is no longer detected by immunoblotting (<italic>eLife</italic>. 2017, 6:e24437, Figure 7).</p><p>To compare the specificity of 3D9, PL2.3 and H3cit in tissues, the study should include the analysis of markers of other forms of neutrophil death. I found very unlikely that apoptotic neutrophils are excluded from sites of inflammation. in vitro studies are useful and elegant, but the real validation of anti-NET antibodies compared with other forms of neutrophil death should be done in tissues.</p><p>Please include the diagnosis of the disease from where the inflamed tissues were collected.</p><p>Additional recommendations:</p><p>Lines 215-217 are not clear. Please rephrase.</p><p>The authors should indicate more details for the microscopy: What kind of objective was used? Please indicate each time numerical aperture and type of objective e.g. Plan Apochromat.</p><p>The Image J procedure should be described more in detail. I am suggesting to add a complete script as Supplemental Material.</p><p>The script also need to answer the following questions:</p><p>What kind of samples were used for threshold setting? Did the authors use specific positive and/or negative NET control images?</p><p>How was the diamater of a resting nucleus defined? Is the value indicated as mean value or maximum value of resting nuclei size?</p><p>What happens if NETs derived from different nuclei have contact with each other? I assume Image J is then counting only one event. Is that influencing the result at later time points?</p><p>This is for example seen in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> or Heme +TNF-mediated NET formation (Figure 6). Is Image J able to quantify those images properly?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Histone H3 clipping is a novel signature of Human Neutrophil Extracellular Traps&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carla Rothlin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>To address these remaining issues we suggest that you include a section on &quot;limitations of the study&quot; after the discussion that fully addresses the concerns described below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised version, the authors have sufficiently reacted to some, although not all, of the essential revisions that had been required by the reviewers. Many of the revisions constitute rephrasing and additions to the discussion rather than having performed additional experiments. I am a bit underwhelmed by the authors´ unwillingness to thoroughly compare tissue staining patterns of 3D9 with those of other antibodies commonly used for detecting NETs in tissues. I do not agree with the authors that this is outside the scope of the manuscript, because cross-comparison would be very important to evaluate the usefulness and added benefit of this new antibody as a tool for detecting NETs.</p><p>I would also have expected to get a more thorough evaluation of the applicability of 3D9 in serum. The information that 3D9 cross-reacts with plasma proteins is valuable, but it does not exclude a potential use of 3D9 for detecting NETs in patients´ sera.</p><p>As it stands the manuscript is still a valuable contribution to the field but important questions remain open and need to be addressed in future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors addressed properly to the majority of the comments. However, there are still some points that require better clarification in the manuscript. There is no doubt about the quality of the work, particularly coming from the Zychlinsky lab. Certainly, while the 3D9 antibody still requires more characterization, it is going to be a powerful tool for the analysis of NETs. The problem is not the 3D9 antibody, but the other NET-&quot;specific&quot; markers used for comparison. Although citrullination of histone H3 (H3cit) is considered &quot;a reasonably specific marker for NETs in disease models&quot; (as recently stated by a panel of experts, J Exp Med. 2022, 219:e20220011), unfortunately, this statement is not true. Thus, the clear lack of co-staining of 3D9 and H3cit in tissues can be explained because H3cit is not detecting NETs. The proposal that H3cit and 3D9 detect different time points during NETosis is interesting, but it is not demonstrated. The new time course experiment (figure 11—figure supplement 2) comparing H3cit and 3D9 used PMA to induce NETs, which is a poor inducer of citrullination <italic>eLife</italic>. 2017 Jun 2;6:e24437. It is unclear why this stimulus was used to address this point. No more experiments are required. But, to be fair in the discussion, the authors should examine/discuss the possibility that the staining of H3cit in tissues is not detecting NETs. Reviewer #1 may be correct that 3D9 &quot;…would potentially render a large part of the literature that has used citH3 staining for the detection of &quot;NETs&quot; useless.&quot;.</p><p>The abnormal and abundant production of NETs as the driver of autoimmunity is currently the hallmark in autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and it is well accepted that the mechanism of NETs induction is mediated by immune complexes. The finding that the Zychlinsky lab was unable to produce NETs using anti-RNP complexes is intriguing, not a criticism, because if there is a place that knows how to study NETs, it is the Zychlinsky lab. Although the study of NETs induced by anti-RNP complexes is out of the scope of this manuscript, this experiment was performed because it was important to validate 3D9. Indeed, compared to PMA or nigericin, anti-RNP-induced NETs is truly critical for human pathology. Therefore, whether the result was positive or negative, it is similarly important and significant. All NETs-inducing mechanisms tested must be mentioned in the text. Unfortunately, 3D9 was unable to be challenged with anti-RNP-induced NETs because this mechanism was not reproducible, and therefore, will require confirmation by others. This caveat must be mentioned somewhere in the text and at least a sentence in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68283.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please note the following specific points that need to be clarified.</p><p>The authors should demonstrate that 3D9 detects ROS-independent NETs induced by at least two well-described stimuli associated with human diseases (of note, data on platelets as drivers of ROS-independent NETs is puzzling and will need confirmation by the authors if this stimulus is used in these assays).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendation to look at additional stimuli. We apologize in advance as we have noted a mistake in the manuscript designating the disease relevant stimulus heme as NOX dependent. This has been corrected (line 302) to “<italic>both NOX dependent (PMA) and NOX independent (heme;nigericin) stimuli result in NETs</italic>”. Heme induces NETs in CGD patients lacking a functioning NADPH oxidase complex but intracellular ROS scavengers inhibit heme induced NETs (Knackstedt et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.aaw0336) -thus this stimulus is ROS dependent while being independent of the NOX induced ROS burst, with the ROS likely being induced by a chemical reaction with heme itself. For this confusion over the designation of ROS dependency, we categorise our stimuli based on their NOX (in)dependency.</p><p>In this manuscript we tested two NOX dependent and two NOX independent stimuli: these are the mitogen PMA and infections with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (NOX dependent), and heme plus TNF and nigericin (NOX independent). <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a medically relevant pathogen. Heme, a product abundant in malaria, and TNF are a model for cytokine activation in Plasmodium infections. Nigericin, while not yet used in humans, is used in veterinary medicine and examined as an anti-tumor agent for the treatment of human colon cancer among others (DOI 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-0906) . Both PMA and Nigericin are strong inducers of the two canonical pathways to NET formation – NOX dependent and independent respectively.</p><p>In deciding to publish this research as a tools and resources paper in <italic>eLife</italic>, we are committing to making this antibody available to the research community for further exploration of NETs in disease contexts. We believe that 3D9 will be useful in exploring NETs in a range of diverse disease contexts, of which other research groups are best placed to assess its performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several very well-defined autoimmune stimuli that are potent inducers of NETs, which can be easily reproduced in vitro.

The occurrence of vital NETs is a rarely observed event. Intravital and live cell imaging studies provide the best evidence for this (Yipp et al., 2013, doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-04-457671). However, our antibody selection method was optimised for use with fixed or denatured human neutrophil samples only.</p><p>We have addressed this limitation and its consequences for choice of assay in the discussion in the new manuscript.</p><p>Line 315-318</p><p>“….thus, care should be taken in the design of future assays and selection of sample when detecting cleaved H3, NETs or vital NETs under native and mild detergent conditions. In particular, 3D9 alone is not suitable for direct detection of NETs in complex biological fluids and a sandwich approach or colocalization with a neutrophil granule protein is critical.”</p><p>In publishing with <italic>eLife</italic> we commit to making this antibody available to serve the research community who may chose to engineer it in a way that could make it useful for live cell imaging or whole blood samples for research purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors clarify if the structures induced by C. albicans are NETs at all or rather remnants of other forms of neutrophil death?</p></disp-quote><p>For this study we use the histological definition of NETs as extracellular chromatin decorated with neutrophil granule proteins. Thus, we can describe these visible structures as NETs as they stain for DNA and neutrophil elastase. It is possible that they are citrullinated NETs, as observed by Kenny et al., (<italic>eLife</italic>. 2017, 6:e24437, Figure 6). However, we cannot exclude that these are remnants of other forms of neutrophil cell death and this remains a problem faced by the entire field as recently reported by Boeltz et al., 2019 (DOI:10.1038/s41418-018-0261-x).</p><p>We have expanded on this observation in the discussion: line 281-284</p><p>“Like citrullination, not all NETs contain H3 cleaved at H3R49. With <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, some NET-like structures were not 3D9 positive (Figure 6). These may be remnants of other forms of cell death or they may be citrullinated NETs as has been shown by Kenny et al., (2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you the authors show how 3D9 perform in serum samples?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an informative experiment for users of this antibody and we thank the reviewers for recommending to include it. In preparation for using the antibody with blood samples, we performed some preliminary experiments to address whether the antibody was suitable for a simple ELISA in the presence of plasma/serum. We have now added Figure 3—figure supplement 4 addressing this. In this experiment<bold>,</bold> we examined the ability of 3D9 to react with healthy donor plasma and serum alone by direct ELISA Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (A) (biological replicate n=1). 3D9 strongly reacted with plasma but not with serum. We also examined detection by 3D9 of western blotted serum and plasma proteins separated by SDS page under reducing and non reducing conditions Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (B) and found that 3D9 also detected proteins, of higher molecular weight than cleaved H3, in plasma but not in serum. We conclude that the direct detection of NETs by 3D9 in plasma containing samples and thus whole blood is not possible due to cross reaction with a plasma protein(s). Based on this we caution the use of 3D9 in serum containing samples alone as it is challenging to ensure all plasma proteins are removed and instead we advocate for the use of sandwich and colocalization approaches.</p><p>In the main text in we have included the following lines 152-156</p><p>“However, when we performed preliminary experiments to see if the antibody had the potential to work in blood samples, we observed a strong reaction of the antibody with a plasma protein(s), but not with serum-protein(s) as determined by direct ELISA and western blot Figure 3—figure supplement 4. Therefore, 3D9 is not suitable for direct detection of NETs in biological fluids that may contain plasma proteins.”</p><p>In the discussion Line 314-319</p><p>“Furthermore, a preliminary investigation revealed 3D9 reacts with a plasma protein(s) in ELISA and western blot – albeit of a higher molecular weight – (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and thus, care should be taken in the design of future assays and selection of sample when detecting cleaved H3, NETs or vital NETs under native and mild detergent conditions. In particular, 3D9 is not suitable for direct detection of NETs in complex biological fluids and a sandwich approach or colocalization with a neutrophil granule protein is critical.”</p><p>And appropriate text has been added to the methods section line 567-575</p><p>“The same approach was used to examine 3D9 interactions with immobilised serum and plasma proteins. Plasma was isolated from whole blood collected with S. Monovette sodium citrate tubes (Sarstedt). Whole blood was centrifuged at low speed to minimise cell lysis (150 xg, 20 min with no brake). Prostaglandin E1 (1 µm) was added to inhibit platelet activation and samples were further centrifuged at 650 xg (8 min) to collect cell free plasma and further centrifuged at 2000 xg (10 min) before being aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.

However the variation in neutrophil responses to pyroptotic stimuli would warrant a deeper investigation beyond the scope of this manuscript. Unlike macrophages, human neutrophils are largely resistant to pyroptotic cell death when inflammasome pathways are activated Chen et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2018, Karamakar et al., 2020, Kovacs et al., (Cell Rep. 2020 Jul 28; 32(4): 107967. ). Stimulation or infection of neutrophils with macrophage pyroptotic stimuli, intracellular pathogen or pathogen signals within the cytosol, elicits some of the characteristics of pyroptosis but not the typical cell morphology. In macrophages pyroptosis is preceded by inflammasome (canonical and non-canonical) activation resulting in activation of specific caspases, caspase mediated activation of Gasdermin D and assembly of a gasdermin pore in the plasma membrane resulting in disruption of osmostic regulation and rapid cell death and the concomitant release of cytokines including IL-1b/ IL-18 that are matured through caspase activity. In contrast, in neutrophils, inflammasome activation by infection with intracellular pathogens can produce diverse outcomes in terms of cell death depending on the specific intracellular pathogen or signal. While <italic>Salmonella</italic> triggers release of caspase 1 activated IL-1beta from neutrophils (Chen et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.06.028) it does not induce pyroptosis. Infection with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> triggers release of IL-β but goes on to produce NETs in a manner that is inflammasome driven and caspase dependent (Chen et al., 2018 Science Immunology) (https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/3/26/eaar6676.long). Most recently Kovacs et al., have shown that instead of oligermising at the plasma membrane, Gasdermin D forms pores in azurophilic granules and autophagolysome and that IL-1b release involves autophagy machinery. Thus, given the variability established in neutrophil pyroptotic-like responses and their inherent resistance to undergo typical pyroptotic cell death, it is unclear what value examining pyroptotic stimuli will add in the context of characterising 3D9 staining of NETs. Indeed, in Figure 6 we use Nigericin as a stimulus to induce NETs which are detected by 3D9 and it is a known activator of the inflammasome pathway and pyroptosis in macrophages but produces NETs in neutrophils.</p><p>To make it clear that we have not exhaustively looked at all forms of neutrophil cell death we have modified the section title, figure titles and main text body to reflect that we have looked at apoptotic, necroptotic and necrotic stimuli.</p><p>line 233-234</p><p>“3D9 distinguishes NETosis from apoptotic, necroptotic and necrotic cell death in neutrophils.”</p><p>line 273-274</p><p>“…and distinguishes netotic neutrophils from neutrophils that die via apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis, in vitro.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, analysis of H3cit staining should also be included in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. Defining the specificity of 3D9, PL2.3 and H3cit is important to better understand their patterns of staining in tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>This response also applies to revision 5.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their critical understanding of the field and their suggestion to add a comparison of staining with H3cit to Figures 7 and 8. Including comparison stains with PL2.3 will always be useful in ensuring we are examining all areas of putative NETs, and staining for histone citrullination and/or histone H3R49 cleavage will add specificity as they detect processes that take place during NET formation. However, from the outset of this manuscript we did not set out to qualitatively compare H3cit as a surrogate marker of NETs to our new antibody. It is possible that other mechanisms of cell death may involve citrullination but our aim in this study was to characterise 3D9 staining behaviour in varied contexts – not H3cit behaviour, which is an ongoing area of debate in the research community - Boeltz et al., 2019 (DOI:10.1038/s41418-018-0261-x).</p><p>Through our investigation into the precise site of the histone cleavage we determined that, by nature of the epitopes of 3D9 and the most commonly used abcam H3cit R2, R8, R17 antibody, they cannot stain the same individual histone. Thus, in theory, examining the staining patterns of 3D9 and H3cit, side by side, as we have done for PL2.3, will not provide insight as to which NETs or other modes of cell death involve citrullination – only whether H3cit is present or absent.</p><p>The finding, that individual neutrophils or NETs showed such ‘either or’ – H3cit or cleaved H3 – characteristics as seen in the tissue sections was surprising and intriguing and this has led us to propose that different types of NETs, specifically those that are more proteolytically processed at the H3 N-terminal, or as a reviewer has suggested, different degrees of citrullination, may be being distinguished by 3D9. However, this will need further investigation that goes beyond the scope of this manuscript and will need to examine other citrullination sites, e.g. H4cit or even pan citrullination to determine if 3D9 distinguishes NETs with more or less citrullination.</p><p>What we have developed in this manuscript is an additional antibody, another tool in the arsenal of NET researchers, to look at NETs (that may or may not also have been citrullinated at H3 R2, 8 or 17 or at a different histone during the process of NET formation). It is another tool for detection. We examine H3cit, 3D9 and H2B co-staining in our final tissue section figures and in doing so demonstrate the diversity of NETs in tissues and highlight how it is important to follow the histological definition of NETs and not rely on a single marker. Individually each antibody has failings but researchers who make use of multiple methods to assess NETs can be confident of their assessment of NETs in their studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To discard that citrullination of H3 blocks its cleavage and detection by 3D9, one possibility could be to determine whether 3D9 detection of NETs induced with calcium ionophores changes in the presence of PAD inhibitors. If H3cit is resistant to cleavage during NETosis, PAD inhibition should increase 3D9 detection particularly at late time points (e.g. 180 mins) in which the H3 fragment is no longer detected by immunoblotting (eLife. 2017, 6:e24437, Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important line of logic to follow for the field’s mechanistic understanding of how citrullination may affect H3 cleavage dynamics however we think this investigation is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we have some interesting unpublished data we can share with the reviewer.</p><p>Indeed, it is quite possible that citrullination may affect the kinetics of histone cleavage, enhancing or inhibiting it. While we have not used the calcium ionophore in this study, we have used another ionophore for potassium, nigericin, and it induces maximum H3 citrullination around 2h as we can see in a preliminary experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of PAD 2/4 by BB CL<sup>-</sup>Amidine completely inhibited citrullination but did not delay histone H3 cleavage. This is in line with Kenny et al., <italic>eLife</italic>. 2017, 6:e24437, Figure 6, who showed that PAD inhibition had no effect on nigericin induced NETs. Together, in the case of a K<sup>+</sup> ionophore, and inflammasome activator, citrullination of H3 does not block H3 cleavage and this cleavage is detectable by 3D9 in immunofluorescence (Figure 6). Citrullination might however, regulate the extent of histone proteolysis with almost complete cleavage of the full length H3 in the presence of inhibitors of citrullination at 2 and 3 hrs versus in the absence of inhibitors.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-68283-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To compare the specificity of 3D9, PL2.3 and H3cit in tissues, the study should include the analysis of markers of other forms of neutrophil death.

I am a bit underwhelmed by the authors´ unwillingness to thoroughly compare tissue staining patterns of 3D9 with those of other antibodies commonly used for detecting NETs in tissues. I do not agree with the authors that this is outside the scope of the manuscript, because cross-comparison would be very important to evaluate the usefulness and added benefit of this new antibody as a tool for detecting NETs.</p><p>I would also have expected to get a more thorough evaluation of the applicability of 3D9 in serum.

We agree the progression of the work will benefit from a deeper investigation and comparison to existing NET staining methods, ideally including but also beyond H3cit e.g. H4cit, and potentially other citrullinated proteins to help elucidate the difference between NETs formed with or without activation of PADs. This will be better served by a subsequent study. We have now highlighted the weaknesses the reviewers have raised and added the importance of the direction the future studies should take, as suggested by the reviewers’ critique, to both the discussion and a new ‘limitations of the study’ section.</p><p>With regards the potential use of 3D9 with patient sera, we agree the study does not exclude a use for 3D9 with patient sera and we have modified the results, discussion and new limitations section to emphasise that, while 3D9 may be not suitable for direct detection is plasma containing samples, future studies will be needed to demonstrate if its useful in patient sera which will be supported by colocalization or sandwich approaches.</p><p>Results: Line 155</p><p>“Therefore, 3D9 may not be suitable for direct detection of NETs in biological fluids that may contain plasma proteins”</p><p>Line 324 (Discussion)</p><p>“In particular, 3D9 alone may not be suitable for direct detection of NETs in complex biological fluids and a sandwich approach or colocalization with a neutrophil granule protein is likely to be critical.”</p><p>Line 349 (limitations)</p><p>“Limitations of the study</p><p>While this study has attempted to characterise 3D9 as tool to detect human NETs, it is limited by the range of NET inducing stimuli tested.

Critically, its usefulness with patient serum samples will need to be demonstrated, bearing in mind the cross reaction with a plasma protein. While here we compared 3D9 staining to another NET detection method – NE and chromatin antibodies – in vitro, and included another NET surrogate marker – H3cit – in tissues, a more in depth cross-comparison between 3D9, H3cit and other NET staining methods will be needed to fully understand the NET landscape and usefulness of 3D9 for tissue samples going forward. Giving consideration to the caveats that have arisen for the use of H3cit, and that H3cit may not be detecting NETosis in all instances, it will be important to identify the protease responsible for cleavage at H3R49 and, in turn, examine chromatin and cell death responses in cells expressing this protease to help fully establish the specificity of H3R49 clipping in NETosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors addressed properly to the majority of the comments. However, there are still some points that require better clarification in the manuscript. There is no doubt about the quality of the work, particularly coming from the Zychlinsky lab. Certainly, while the 3D9 antibody still requires more characterization, it is going to be a powerful tool for the analysis of NETs. The problem is not the 3D9 antibody, but the other NET-&quot;specific&quot; markers used for comparison. Although citrullination of histone H3 (H3cit) is considered &quot;a reasonably specific marker for NETs in disease models&quot; (as recently stated by a panel of experts, J Exp Med. 2022, 219:e20220011), unfortunately, this statement is not true. Thus, the clear lack of co-staining of 3D9 and H3cit in tissues can be explained because H3cit is not detecting NETs. The proposal that H3cit and 3D9 detect different time points during NETosis is interesting, but it is not demonstrated. The new time course experiment (figure 11—figure supplement 2) comparing H3cit and 3D9 used PMA to induce NETs, which is a poor inducer of citrullination (eLife. 2017 Jun 2;6:e24437). It is unclear why this stimulus was used to address this point. No more experiments are required. But, to be fair in the discussion, the authors should examine/discuss the possibility that the staining of H3cit in tissues is not detecting NETs. Reviewer #1 may be correct that 3D9 &quot;…would potentially render a large part of the literature that has used citH3 staining for the detection of &quot;NETs&quot; useless.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this critique and look forward to the future work in unravelling the different staining of NETs, or as it may be, not NETs. We have now included the following statements in the discussion and limitations section to consider the plausible situation that H3cit R2, 8, 17 may not detect NETs and that it is likely we need to re-evaluate some of the previous work done on H3cit and NETs when no other method was used to detect NETs. This is in addition to some of the known controversaries of H3cit we have already raised in the discussion and we now explicitly refer the reader to the in depth discussion of this by Konig and Anrade (2016).</p><p>We have stopped short of saying that anti-H3cit does not detect NETs as, minimally, in the tissue sections presented in this study, H3cit R2, R8, R17 colocalises with areas of decondensed chromatin (DNA/H2B), bearing neutrophil elastase, and thus detects NETs – albeit not the NETs detected by 3D9, bearing the same NET components but whose detection could be excluded by restriction of the antigen present. And, while we have attempted to assess in depth that cleavage at H3R49 is unique to NETs and neutrophils, it may occur during other biological processes that we have not yet considered. We have raised this the new section, Limitations of the study.</p><p>Line 251 (Results)</p><p>“Citrullination of H3 is also used in NET detection, albeit more convincingly when co-stained with a neutrophil granule or cytoplasmic marker”</p><p>Line 283 (Discussion)</p><p>“The use of H3cit for the detection of NETs is not without controversy, as discussed in depth by Konig and Anrade (2016).”</p><p>Line 299 (Discussion)</p><p>“These findings also suggest a need to re-evaluate NET studies derived from experiments using H3cit as the only method used to detect NETs.”</p><p>Line 355 (limitations)</p><p>“While here we compared 3D9 staining to another NET detection method – NE and chromatin antibodies – in vitro, and included another NET surrogate marker – H3cit – in tissues, a more in depth cross-comparison between 3D9, H3cit and other NET staining methods will be needed to fully understand the NET landscape and usefulness of 3D9 for tissue samples going forward.

The finding that the Zychlinsky lab was unable to produce NETs using anti-RNP complexes is intriguing, not a criticism, because if there is a place that knows how to study NETs, it is the Zychlinsky lab. Although the study of NETs induced by anti-RNP complexes is out of the scope of this manuscript, this experiment was performed because it was important to validate 3D9. Indeed, compared to PMA or nigericin, anti-RNP-induced NETs is truly critical for human pathology. Therefore, whether the result was positive or negative, it is similarly important and significant. All NETs-inducing mechanisms tested must be mentioned in the text. Unfortunately, 3D9 was unable to be challenged with anti-RNP-induced NETs because this mechanism was not reproducible, and therefore, will require confirmation by others. This caveat must be mentioned somewhere in the text and at least a sentence in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a statement of the results of our anti-RNP tests in the results and referred to the small range of stimuli tested as a limitation of the study.</p><p>Line 223 (results)</p><p>“To test 3D9 with immune complex induced NETs, we attempted to induce NETs with RNP/anti-RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes, however there was no induction of NETs in healthy neutrophils.”</p><p>Line 349 (limitations)</p><p>“While this study has attempted to characterise 3D9 as tool to detect human NETs, it is limited by the range of NET inducing stimuli tested.
