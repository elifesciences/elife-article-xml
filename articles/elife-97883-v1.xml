movements (saccades). However, the degree to which the voluntary deployment of attention to a location necessarily activates a corresponding saccade plan remains unclear. One problem is that attention and saccades are both automatically driven by salient sensory events; another is that the underlying processes unfold within tens of milliseconds only. Here, we use an urgent task design to resolve the evolution of a visuomotor choice on a moment-by-moment basis while independently controlling the endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (salience-driven) contributions to performance. Human participants saw a peripheral cue and, depending on its color, either looked at it (prosaccade) or looked at a diametrically opposite, uninformative non-cue (antisaccade). By varying the luminance of the stimuli, the exogenous contributions could be cleanly dissociated from the endogenous process guiding the choice over time. According to the measured time courses, generating a correct antisaccade requires about 30 ms more processing time than generating a correct prosaccade based on the same perceptual signal. The results indicate that saccade plans elaborated during fixation are biased toward the location where attention is endogenously deployed, but the coupling is weak and can be willfully overridden very rapidly.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>You are attending a talk at a conference, eyes straight ahead and fixed on the speaker… yet you may in fact also be covertly monitoring your phone, hoping for a long-awaited message to flash on the screen. This ability to focus on something without directly looking at it is called spatial attention. It plays an essential role in everyday tasks, such as spotting keys on a cluttered desk or noticing when a traffic light changes.</p><p>Overlapping brain circuits control spatial attention and eye movements, creating tight links between the two processes. For example, shifting your gaze towards a specific location automatically leads you to pay at least partial attention to what unfolds at this spot. Whether the reverse is true, however, is less clear. In other words: when we are paying attention to something without looking at it, is our brain set to move our eyes towards this location?</p><p>To explore this question, Goldstein et al. designed a visual task that allowed them to track human participants’ attention and eye movements moment by moment, and to unpick various factors affecting these processes. The volunteers fixed their gaze on the center of a screen, knowing that they also needed to pay attention to a certain location at the periphery where a cue was set to appear. The color of the cue determined whether the participants would then need to shift their gaze either towards or away from it – for example, they were instructed to look directly at a green cue but away from a magenta one.</p><p>These analyses showed that participants needed about 30 milliseconds less time to program an eye movement toward the cue – that is, to shift their gaze towards the location that they were already covertly monitoring. Such difference in processing time suggests that eye movements are biased towards the location on which attention is directed, but that this preference can still be overridden quickly.</p><p>By refining our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning attention, the findings by Goldstein et al. may help us better understand conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where the brain struggles to engage and disengage with stimuli effectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antisaccades</kwd><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>capture</kwd><kwd>salience</kwd><kwd>mental chronometry</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH120784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanford</surname><given-names>Terrence R</given-names></name><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Emilio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY025172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanford</surname><given-names>Terrence R</given-names></name><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Emilio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS073553-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Allison T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Psychophysical measurements using time pressure indicate that when attention is willfully deployed, a congruent scaccade is automatically planned, but the coupling is weak and can be rapidly broken.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primates make about four to five quick eye movements (saccades) every second. Before each movement, the oculomotor system selects a new target to look at depending on the match between the content of the current visual scene and the subject’s internal state and current goals, i.e., what, if anything, the subject is looking for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itti and Koch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Theeuwes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolfe and Horowitz, 2017</xref>). The rich dynamic between internal drives and what is out there in the world makes eye movements a good model system for understanding behavior at large.</p><p>Saccades are strongly coupled to visuospatial attention, which comprises a collection of mechanisms that regulate perception and thereby mediate the target selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrasco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maunsell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore and Zirnsak, 2017</xref>). In general, the role of attention is to enhance stimuli that are potentially relevant and filter out those that are not. Neurons implicated in attention control and saccade generation are typically found within the same circuits. And importantly, the functional coupling between saccades and attention is bidirectional.</p><p>On one hand, the planning of a saccade automatically commits attentional resources to the saccade endpoint such that perceptual processing is enhanced at that location. This phenomenon, known as presaccadic attention, is firmly supported by both psychophysical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman and Subramaniam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kowler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deubel and Schneider, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>) and neurophysiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore and Fallah, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore and Fallah, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavanaugh and Wurtz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinmetz and Moore, 2014</xref>). Making a saccade implies attentional deployment.</p><p>The relationship in the opposite direction is less clear. With gaze held fixed, attention can be deployed willfully and covertly to a location in space, such that perceptual sensitivity is (typically) enhanced at that location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrasco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrasco and Barbot, 2014</xref>). This is referred to as endogenous attention, and there is evidence that its deployment impacts subsequent eye movements in two ways: it increases the probability that a saccade will be directed to the attended point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kustov and Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belopolsky and Theeuwes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belopolsky and Theeuwes, 2012</xref>), and if fixation is maintained, it alters the temporal and spatial characteristics of microsaccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafed and Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engbert and Kliegl, 2003</xref>). However, this link between endogenous attention and eye movements is not obligatory; the attentional locus and saccade endpoint can be dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katnani and Gandhi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinmetz and Moore, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klapetek et al., 2016</xref>), and microsaccades are only weak, unreliable markers of attentional allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willett and Mayo, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the effects of directing covert attention or a saccade to a given location can be quite distinct in terms of the activated neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ignashchenkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong et al., 2009</xref>), and may have slightly different perceptual consequences (for instance, on orientation or spatial frequency sensitivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the degree to which the early allocation of attention dictates subsequent saccade planning is still uncertain. This is the subject of the current study.</p><p>There are three factors that make it difficult to mechanistically characterize how the willful allocation of spatial attention typically influences eye movements: (1) to reveal the effects of endogenous attention, most laboratory experiments require prolonged fixation, a condition that is somewhat artificial; (2) both attention and eye movements are drawn to salient events, so their underlying neural circuits both react automatically to some degree whenever a stimulus is presented or changed; and (3) the dynamic processes that underlie the allocation of attention and planning of saccades evolve very rapidly, with timescales on the order of a few tens of milliseconds. Thus, sustained fixation is regularly used to dissociate the endogenous deployment of attention from its overt counterpart (an eye movement) and from exogenous effects, which are transient. Normally, though, these three factors interact continuously, rapidly, and not necessarily in a fixed sequence.</p><p>To circumvent these hurdles, and be able to study how both forms of attention influence eye movements under less constrained conditions, we consider a task design in which the participant must make an eye movement either toward a peripheral cue (prosaccade) or in the opposite direction (antisaccade), toward an uninformative non-cue stimulus, depending on the color of the cue. This task has three main features. First, it is urgent. This means that the fixation requirement is brief and, because there is a reaction time (RT) deadline, motor plans must be initiated early, before the cue information is revealed. As detailed below, the resulting visuomotor dynamics are such that performance can be tracked with high precision as a function of time. Second, the luminances of the cue and non-cue are manipulated so that saccades are biased toward one stimulus, the other, or neither. This way, the contributon of exogenous attention can be precisely characterized and accounted for. And third, endogenous attention is deployed to a fixed (cue) location at the start of each trial. This may either shorten or lengthen the amount of time needed to make a successful choice, depending on the trial type (pro or anti) and on the coupling between endogenous attention and motor plans. Thus, the coupling strength can be inferred from the observed pattern of results.</p><p>For goal-directed movements, we report a consistent time delay of roughly 30 ms between prosaccade and antisaccade processing. This and other results indicate that, under relaxed fixation requirements, saccade plans are indeed coupled to the locus of endogenous attention – but can be voluntarily shifted quite rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A task design for revealing how endogenous attention modulates saccade plans</title><p>In earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>), we used time pressure to characterize the contributions of exogenous and endogenous mechanisms to elementary visuomotor choices involving a single stimulus. By analyzing performance in an urgent prosaccade task (look toward a cue) and an urgent antisaccade task (look away from a cue), we found that exogenous and endogenous signals acted at different times and independently of each other. Specifically, the exogenous response to the cue onset manifested as ‘captured’ saccades, eye movements toward the cue that were, by all accounts, involuntary: they occurred early (∼100 ms after cue onset), were strongly stereotyped across individuals, highly sensitive to luminance, and largely impervious to task rules or top-down control. In contrast, the endogenous response manifested as a sustained rise toward high-performance accuracy that was consistent with a deliberate process: the rise occured slightly later (∼150 ms after cue onset), it was more variable across individuals, and was aligned with the task-defined goal.</p><p>In an effort to further isolate the endogenous component of spatial attention and characterize its impact on saccade planning, we developed a new task, the endogenously driven pro/antisaccade (EPA) task. This is, again, a two-alternative, urgent paradigm in which the participant must either look at a cue stimulus or look away from it, but there are two new elements. First, endogenous attention is deployed to a fixed location, so its influence on competing saccade plans (aligned or misaligned with that location) can be assessed. And second, the exogenous contribution is either unbiased or biased in favor of one or another choice, so that its effect can be cleanly identified. It is worth noting that in standard, non-urgent tasks, the cue is presented either before or simultaneously with the go signal, so the short-lived exogenous response is removed essentially by waiting for it to dissipate before the voluntary choice is made. However, our goal was to study the real-time interaction between attention and saccade planning over its natural timescale, which is on the order of a few tens of milliseconds, and the urgent nature of the paradigm is critical for this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the EPA task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the participant starts by fixating on a central spot (Fixation), and the offset of this spot is the go signal (Go) indicating that a saccade must be made to either the right or the left within 450 ms. At this point, the correct option has not been revealed yet, but if the saccade is to be made on time, the participant must attempt to respond nonetheless. After a variable, unpredictable gap interval (Gap), both a cue and a non-cue appear simultaneously (Cue on). The participant is instructed to look at the cue if the cue is green (pro trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and to look at the non-cue if the cue is magenta (anti trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The cue color is selected randomly on each trial, but the cue and non-cue locations are fixed for each block of trials.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The endogenously driven pro/antisaccade task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A prosaccade trial begins with a fixation period (Fixation, 500, 600, or 700 ms). The disappearance of the fixation point (Go) instructs the participant to look to the left or to the right within a reaction time (RT) window of 425–450 ms. After a variable time gap (Gap, 0–350 ms), a colored cue and a neutral non-cue appear simultaneously (Cue on) at locations that remain fixed for a block of trials. Thus, the participant always knows the cue location. The green color instructs the participant to look at the cue (Saccade). (<bold>b</bold>) An antisaccade trial proceeds in the same way as a prosaccade trial except that the magenta color instructs the participant to look at the non-cue. Pro- and antisaccade trials are randomly interleaved. In both, performance is dictated by the raw processing time (rPT), which is the amount of time during which the stimuli can be viewed and assessed before a response is initiated. The luminances of the stimuli can be set to balance the exogenous responses to the cue and non-cue (Experiments 1 and 2), or to create a bias toward either (Experiments 3 and 4).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97883-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This task has three critical aspects. First, the urgency requirement (RT≤450 ms). Because of time pressure, the participants’ responses range from guesses (uninformed saccades initiated before or soon after cue onset) at one extreme to fully informed choices (saccades initiated well after cue onset) at the other. The quantity that determines the degree to which a specific choice is informed, or the probability that it is informed, is the raw processing time (rPT), which is the time interval between the onset of the cue and the onset of the saccade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, rPT). The rPT corresponds to the cue viewing time in each trial. Because this variable determines the probability of success, the main behavioral metric in the task is the ‘tachometric curve’, the curve that results when the fraction of correct choices is plotted as a function of rPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As for other urgent tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>), the tachometric curve depicts the evolution of the subject’s choice on a moment-by-moment basis, and the details of this evolution can be uniquely revealing of the underlying attentional dynamics. For now, it suffices to note that, for all such data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>), performance typically goes from mostly guesses (∼50% correct) at short rPTs (≲75 ms) to mostly informed choices (∼90% correct) at long rPTs (≳250 ms). Throughout the rest of the Results we will analyze in detail how this transition between chance and asymptotic performance occurs in the EPA task under different conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Performance in pro- (blue traces) and antisaccade trials (red traces) in four experiments where cue and non-cue luminance was varied.</title><p>Each panel plots two tachometric curves.

This is because the cue remains on the same side for an entire block of trials, switching only across blocks (150 trials per block), so the participant always knows where the color cue will appear. The non-cue never changes, so it is not informative. This way, to make an informed choice, the participant must attend to the cue, determine its color, and make a saccade according to the task rule (look to the green cue; look away from the magenta cue). Notably, the urgent nature of the task means that, by the time the cue is revealed, saccade plans must already be ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stanford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salinas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costello et al., 2013</xref>). This creates ideal conditions for studying how endogenous attention and motor plans interact to yield an overt saccadic choice.</p><p>Finally, the third task element that is critical is the non-cue. Although the non-cue stimulus is never informative of the correct choice, it serves a purpose: to control whether attention is exogenously drawn to one side, the other, or neither. That is, by adjusting the relative luminance of the cue and non-cue, it is possible to bias the choice in either direction or, alternatively, to balance the opposing exogenous influences so that the net bias is approximately zero. This study comprises four experiments, each one corresponding to a different luminance combination for the cue and non-cue stimuli (Methods; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In Experiment 1 the cue and non-cue were of equally high luminance, whereas in Experiment 2 they were of equally low luminance. In both cases the exogenous influences were meant to offset each other. In Experiment 3 a high luminance cue was paired with a low luminance non-cue, whereas in Experiment 4 the values were reversed, so the non-cue was brighter than the cue. In these cases the exogenous influence was meant to create a lateral bias favoring either the cue (Experiment 3) or the non-cue (Experiment 4) side.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Stimulus parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Stimulus</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">RGB vector</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Luminance <break/>(cd/m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">High luminance green (cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0 0.88 0]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Low luminance green (cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0 0.1067 0]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">High luminance magenta (cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0.935 0.255 0.935]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Low luminance magenta (cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0.1247 0.034 0.1247]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">High luminance gray (non-cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0.61 0.61 0.61]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Low luminance gray (non-cue)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[0.0813 0.0813 0.0813]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In the following sections, we first examine the effect of exogenous attention on performance.

Thus, each participant generated data and a corresponding tachometric curve from two trial types (pro or anti) times four experiments for a total of eight experimental conditions. For some analyses, participants were divided into two groups, reliable performers (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>11</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) and unreliable performers (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). A participant was included in the reliable-performer group if he or she met a performance criterion in all eight conditions; otherwise they were included in the unreliable-performer group (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For each of the eight experimental conditions, an aggregate tachometric curve was generated by pooling the data from the reliable performers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In this initial comparison, the resulting eight tachometric curves are shown in pairs sorted by task, prosaccade (blue curves) or antisaccade (red curves). Each pair of curves thus represents the fraction of correct saccades made after a given amount of cue viewing time to each target stimulus, the cue (in pro trials) or the non-cue (in anti trials). As such, the effects of stimulus luminance can be easily visualized.</p><p>As intended, exogenous capture was minimized when the luminances of the cue and the non-cue were the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). In this case, for both pro (panel a) and anti trials (panel b), the fraction correct hovers near 0.5 for processing times around 100 ms, which is when the exogenous effect would be expected to be strongest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>). For each task, the subsequent rise toward asymptotic performance at longer rPTs is largely the same for stimuli of low (light-colored traces) and high luminance (dark-colored traces). This confirms that, for the most part, exogenous biases due to simultaneous onsets cancel out when they have similar strengths but point in opposite directions. The gradual, approximately monotonic rise in accuracy that results in this case is interpreted as the behavioral manifestation of the endogenously guided choice process.</p><p>Also as intended, exogenous capture was reinstated when the cue and the non-cue differed in luminance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>), with the exogenous signal always biasing the saccades toward the high-luminance stimulus. In pro trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), the salient cue (dark curve) produced a sharp, transient increase in the probability of making a correct prosaccade, whereas the salient non-cue (light curve) produced a sharp, transient decrease. In anti trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the effect was nearly identical but opposite in sign: the salient cue (dark curve) produced a sharp, transient decrease in the probability of making a correct antisaccade, whereas the salient non-cue (light curve) produced a sharp, transient increase. All of these capture effects were short-lived, peaking at rPT≈100 ms and mostly disappearing for rPT≳150 ms; thereafter, the endogenously driven rise toward asymptotic performance was, once again, basically the same across luminance conditions.</p><p>These results confirm that exogenous and endogenous influences are dissociable across processing time, and that their effects on visuomotor performance are largely independent of each other.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Consistency of exogenous capture across participants and conditions</title><p>Although the early exogenous response is stimulus-driven, it remains uninformed because it does not indicate what the correct choice is; it is simply a bias toward high salience.

This result confirms that the early exogenous signal always tracks the higher luminance stimulus, and that the evoked exogenous response is the same regardless of the task rule.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Possible linkage between endogenous attention and subsequent saccade planning</title><p>The above results circumscribe when and how exogenous attention biases saccadic choices in the EPA task. We now turn to the question of how the early deployment of endogenous attention might influence subsequent saccade planning, and how their interaction (or lack thereof) would manifest during task performance.</p><p>Consider two extreme possibilities. In the first scenario, saccade plans are entirely decoupled from endogenous attention. Thus, at the start of each trial, attention is endogenously deployed to the cue location, but this does not bias the ensuing saccade plans. Right after the go signal, uninformed plans can be as easily initiated to the cue as to the non-cue; and later on, after the cue color has been resolved, they can be as easily redirected (by perceptual information) toward the cue or toward the non-cue. These decoupled dynamics give rise to two specific predictions. (1) On average, making an informed saccade toward the cue (in pro trials) should require the same amount of processing time as making an informed saccade toward the non-cue (in anti trials) – because once the cue color has been resolved, the resulting perceptual signal should be able to guide the developing motor selection process with equal effectiveness toward either stimulus. And (2), guesses toward the cue should, on average, be just as likely as guesses toward the non-cue. That is, internally generated saccade plans that advance rapidly before the cue color is resolved should not be systematically biased by endogenous attention being focused on the cue.</p><p>In the second scenario, saccade plans are strongly coupled to endogenous attention. Now, deploying endogenous attention implies a high degree of concomitant motor preparation. In this case, the initial uninformed plans generated right after the go signal are heavily biased toward the cue because attention is pointing there already; and the same thing is true later on: after the cue color has been resolved, plans are more easily redirected toward the cue than toward the non-cue. The specific predictions under strong-coupling dynamics are straightforward: (1) on average, making a perceptually informed saccade toward the cue (in pro trials) should require less processing time than making a perceptually informed saccade toward the non-cue (in anti trials), and (2) guesses should be predominantly directed toward the stimulus that is attended initially, i.e., the cue.</p><p>These extreme scenarios provide intuitive reference points for interpreting the behavioral data in the next sections, where the predictions are tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The processing-time cost of an antisaccade</title><p>In summary, the intuition outlined in the previous section is that, if the initial deployment of endogenous attention necessarily entails some amount of motor preparation, then we would expect that, in the EPA task, generating an informed antisaccade should systematically require more processing time than generating an informed prosaccade. The question is how much. The difference could conceivably go from 0 ms (no coupling) to 100 ms (strong coupling), which is an estimate of the maximum amount of processing time needed to shift an ongoing motor plan from one location to a diametrically opposite one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To measure the rPT cost of an antisaccade relative to a prosaccade, we first considered the data from Experiments 1 and 2, in which the exogenous response was more muted. An important preliminary question was whether performance differed significantly between these two experiments. So, for each participant, we computed tachometric curves for pro and anti trials in Experiments 1 and 2, and fitted each curve with a sigmoid function (Methods). From each fitted curve, we determined the rise point, which is the rPT at which the curve reaches the midpoint between its minimum and maximum values; this quantity serves as a benchmark for when the saccadic choice becomes endogenously guided. Then we compared the rise points from Experiment 1 to those from Experiment 2 for pro trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and for anti trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Determining the rise point for an individual participant in any given experimental condition requires task performance to increase consistently as a function of rPT. Therefore, only participants that exceeded a modulation criterion were included in these comparisons, to ensure that the fits were acceptable and that the empirical curves were not flat (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). Consistent with the pooled curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>, the rise points were similar across experiments for both prosaccades (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.08</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, permutation test) and antisaccades (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>17</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, permutation test).

This is the average cost, in milliseconds of processing time, incurred for voluntarily programming a saccade away from the attended cue rather than toward it.</p><p>To further validate this difference in processing time, trials (again from Experiments 1 and 2) were pooled across the 11 qualifying participants to yield two aggregate tachometric curves, one for prosaccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, blue trace) and another for antisaccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, red trace). The resulting curves clearly show an earlier rise in prosaccade performance for informed choices (rPT ≳ 150 ms), which have processing times that exceed the exogenous response window. Via sigmoidal fits, rise points were obtained for each of these curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, vertical lines). Computed this way, the rise point from pro trials was 165 ms (in [158, 172] ms, 95% CI from bootstrap), whereas for anti trials it was 194 ms (in [191, 196] ms). The difference of 29 ms is comparable to the mean difference of 35 ms obtained from individual rise points.</p><p>Finally, we conducted the same analysis based on aggregate data from the qualifying participants, but this time pooling trials from Experiments 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The idea was that, because the exogenous effects in pro and anti trials were always opposite and of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>), on average they would cancel out, leaving only the net effect of endogenous guidance at each point in time (or, for short rPTs, any motor biases in the early uninformed choices). Indeed, this procedure yielded aggregate tachometric curves that were qualitatively similar to those obtained from Experiments 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In this case, the rise point for pro trials was 152 ms (in [146, 157] ms, 95% CI), for anti trials it was 187 ms (in [185, 189] ms), and the difference was 35 ms.</p><p>These analyses were based on the rise points of the fitted sigmoidal functions, but results were very similar when using a fixed performance criterion of 70% correct to define the typical processing time required to make an informed choice (Methods). In that case, the differences in processing time between pro and anti trials were 24 ms for the aggregate curves from Experiments 1 and 2, and 34 ms for the aggregate curves from Experiments 3 and 4. Results were also similar when the data from each experiment were kept separate. Finally, when these analyses were repeated but including the data from all the participants, with no exclusions, the rise points in Experiment 1 could not be reliably determined due to strong motor biases (visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>), but in all other cases the rise in antisaccade performance lagged that in prosaccade performance in agreement with the above numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Most notably, the informed antisaccades were consistently delayed even in Experiment 4, in which motor plans were strongly biased toward the non-cue by the early exogenous signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d</xref>).</p><p>These results indicate that the rPT cost of an endogenously guided antisaccade relative to an endogenously guided prosaccade is about 25–35 ms, and support the hypothesis that saccade plans are, to a degree, obligatorily coupled to endogenous attention.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Guesses are predominantly biased toward the attended cue</title><p>As outlined earlier, another potential indicator of coupling between endogenous attention and subsequent saccade plans is the fraction of guesses that are directed toward the attended cue versus the unattended non-cue.

Because both the motor biases and the antisaccade costs were generally consistent across experiments, for this analysis the data were pooled across all four experiments.

This suggests that when the early attentional bias toward the cue is strong, it is more difficult for participants to produce an informed antisaccade later on. Importantly, however, the initial motor bias may contribute to but does not explain the rPT cost of an antisaccade. As indicated by the offset of the regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> (dotted line), the expected cost is 27 ms for zero bias. This agrees with data discussed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b and d</xref>), which showed that there is a cost even for combinations of participants and experiments for which the bias is either minimal or slightly away from the cue. So, in general, producing an informed antisaccade required about 30 ms more of processing time than producing a similarly informed prosaccade, but this number varied by an additional amount in proportion to the strength of the initial bias toward or away from the cue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Higher efficiency for prosaccades versus antisaccades</title><p>The analyses above determined the processing-time cost of making an antisaccade away from the attended cue instead of a prosaccade toward it, everything else being equal. Here, we revisit this issue but from a different perspective. Instead of looking at the processing time needed to achieve a set performance criterion, we consider the reverse. Now we ask, given a fixed amount of processing time sufficient for motor plans to be partially informed, are prosaccades generally more successful than antisaccades? This alternate analysis does not exclude any participants. It is interesting not only as a verification of the above results, but also because it makes the variability in performance across individuals and experiments easier to appreciate.</p><p>In this case, individual trials were grouped according to rPT into four non-overlapping ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, inset at bottom): a guessing range (rPT ≤ 75 ms), a capture range (83 ≤ rPT ≤ 124 ms), a transition range (135 ≤ rPT &lt; 200 ms), and an asymptotic range (rPT ≥ 200 ms). Then, for each range, the fraction of correct choices was computed separately for pro and anti trials for each participant and each experiment. The results show how performance progresses over time in each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>; black dots indicate individual participants). The procedure can be thought of as a simpler, discretized version of the tachometric curve for which only four time bins are considered, but the patterns discussed earlier are still recognizable. For instance, in Experiments 1–3, during pro trials guesses tend to be more successful than chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>, blue bars, G range), whereas during anti trials they tend to be less successful than chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>, red bars, G range). This, of course, reflects the internal bias toward the cue. The salience-driven capture of saccades is also easily recognizable. In Experiment 3, for most participants, the fraction correct in the capture range is well above chance in pro trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, blue bars, C range) but well below chance in anti trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, red bars, C range); and the effect in Experiment 4 is just the reverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>; compare blue vs. red bars in C range). From these data, it is also easy to see that most participants improve their performance with increasing rPT, as their accuracy tends to be highest in the asymptotic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>, A range). Notably, as seen with the full tachometric curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), in all the experiments there is considerable variability across participants, even in the asymptotic range. Such variance at long rPTs reflects a range of bias strengths as well as varying degrees of difficulty with the task (consistent with the easy trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The transition from uninformed to informed performance is more rapid for prosaccades than for antisaccades.</title><p>Processing times were divided into four non-overlapping ranges: a guessing range (G, raw processing time [rPT] ≤ 75 ms), a capture range (C, 83 ≤ rPT ≤ 124 ms), a transition range (T, 135 ≤ rPT &lt; 200 ms), and an asymptotic range (A, rPT ≥ 200 ms); see inset at bottom.

This rPT range covers the part of the tachometric curve during which accuracy rises consistently but has yet to reach its eventual asymptote. The responses produced during this time interval can be interepreted as saccades that are partly but not yet fully informed by the cue color; or alternatively, the data can be thought of as a mixture of informed and uninformed saccades. In either case, the question is whether at the given amount of processing time prosaccades have an advantage in performance over antisaccades.</p><p>The answer is yes. The fraction of correct choices during the transition range was consistently higher for pro than for anti trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). This was true not only when considering the data from all four experiments together (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>72</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, permutation test), but also when considering the data from each experiment separately (in all cases, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.003</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>18</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, permutation test). Again, the most notable result is for Experiment 4: in that case, pro trials demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than anti trials in the transition range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, orange points) in spite of the fact that, during the preceding capture interval, pro trials were at a huge disadvantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>; compare blue vs. red bars in C and T ranges). Thus, as perceptual information originating at the cue location starts to guide the ongoing target selection process, generating a movement toward the cue itself is easier than generating a movement away from it.</p><p>Finally, the data in this format can also be used to re-examine the degree to which the rPT cost of making an endogenously guided antisaccade covaries with the early motor bias. In this case, we contrasted the difference between pro and anti performance (fraction correct) in the transition range with the difference between pro and anti performance in the guessing range. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>) confirmed the trend seen earlier based on the direct calculation of processing-time costs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), namely, there was a positive correlation (Pearson correlation, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.62</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.003</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from two-sided permutation test). This was the case with the data pooled across experiments, but consistent, positive trends were observed for all four experiments individually. The results again suggest that when motor plans are strongly biased toward the cue, additional processing time is needed to overcome such bias and generate an informed (anti) saccade away from the cue – although, as remarked before, a cost is expected even with zero bias (see regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>).</p><p>A last, notable point is that the motor bias was not a reliable predictor of overall task performance during informed choices. Across participants, the mean accuracy averaged over pro and anti trials combined had a weak, non-significant correlation with the bias in both the transition (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.09</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) and asymptotic (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.07</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) ranges. Thus, the bias did not incur an obvious disadvantage in terms of average success in the task. Its main consequence was simply to induce an asymmetry in timing and accuracy between pro- and antisaccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate how the voluntary deployment of spatial attention to an informative cue influences a subsequent eye movement either toward the cue or away from it. Because the interaction between attention and saccade planning is generally very fast, we focused on the difference in processing time required by these two conditions; and because stimulus presentation always implies a certain degree of exogenous influence, we also aimed to distinguish the respective contributions of exogenous and endogenous signals to the saccadic choice process. By imposing urgency we could generate a psychophysical curve describing the evolution of this choice process with high temporal resolution, and by manipulating the relative luminances of the cue and a non-cue we could characterize the strength and temporal extent of the exogenous signals associated with stimulus onsets. In this way, we were able to isolate the endogenously driven responses and resolve a time delay of approximately 30 ms between informed (pro) saccades toward the attended cue location and informed (anti) saccades toward an unattended, diametrically opposed location. This delay was highly consistent; it occurred even when the exogenous signal produced a bias in favor of the slower response. In addition, we also found that when participants made fast guesses, their saccades were significantly more likely to be toward the attended cue than toward the unattended non-cue.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The observed coupling is consistent with prior studies</title><p>The findings indicate that when attention is voluntarily but covertly deployed, a subsequent saccade is generally biased toward the attended location. Thus, oculomotor planning is coupled to endogenous attention. The coupling is relatively weak, though, because motor plans could be willfully shifted very rapidly (within ∼30 ms) to a different location, and because there was relatively high variability across conditions for any given participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The strength of the effect also varied considerably across individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7f</xref>). Importantly, as mentioned in the Introduction, this coupling pertains to only one side of the bidirectional relationship between saccade planning and spatial attention. The attentional effects that occur just before a saccade is executed have been amply characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman and Subramaniam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kowler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deubel and Schneider, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore and Fallah, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore and Fallah, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavanaugh and Wurtz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinmetz and Moore, 2014</xref>), and at this point the data are unequivocal: planning a saccade commits attentional resources to the intended saccade endpoint (or nearby, depending on how the target selection process progresses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wollenberg et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, here we examined the complementary relationship, i.e., how the early deployment of spatial attention biases the next saccade. Consistent with data showing that endogenous attention and saccade planning can be dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ignashchenkova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinmetz and Moore, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klapetek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>), our results are indicative of coupling that is comparatively weak in this direction.</p><p>In this regard, our results are comparable to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belopolsky and Theeuwes, 2009</xref>, who used a task in which participants made saccades to a target location that did or did not coincide with the location of an attended symbolic cue. They measured saccadic RTs that were much longer than in our case (roughly 500–800 ms), and yet their derived time costs for making an eye movement to an attended cue location versus to an unattended non-cue location were remarkably similar to ours, on the order of 20–40 ms. The authors interpreted their data in comparison to prior results by drawing a distinction between the maintenance of attention and the shifting of attention, because the time cost they observed was most robust when participants had to shift their attention to the cue location just before making a saccade to the target. This distinction is consistent with our view of urgency: when the fixation point disappears early on, motor plans can start developing even if the target has not been determined, in which case they will reflect any internal biases, including a bias toward the currently attended location. However, such bias typically becomes invisible under non-urgent conditions, which promote longer fixations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belopolsky and Theeuwes, 2009</xref>, this is because the incipient oculomotor program associated with an attention shift can be suppressed shortly thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Exogenous-endogenous interactions are rich and fast</title><p>A striking aspect of our data is the sharp distinction drawn between exogenous and endogenous attentional components, and the richness of their dynamic. Based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>), we expected the exogenous signal to be brief, involuntary, and luminance-driven. And indeed, we were able to manipulate exogenous, involuntary capture as intended by varying the luminances of the stimuli, with highly consistent results across participants and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Specifically, we were able to bias the participants’ choices toward the cue or toward the non-cue, or to minimize the bias. The results support the notion that exogenous and endogenous influences on saccade programming are fundamentally independent and dissociable based on processing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>). However, the results revealed an interesting wrinkle: the effect of the exogenous signal is not simply to advance the motor plan congruent with it and then fade away, in which case one would expect that responses would simply transition monotonically from captured saccades to informed choices with increasing rPT. Instead, when saccades are strongly biased (Experiments 3 and 4), the tachometric curves demonstrate the corresponding capture but then (briefly) go in the opposite direction. This can be seen in the pro curves of Experiment 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c</xref>, dark blue traces) and in the anti curves of Experiment 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d</xref>, bright red traces); in both cases there is a sharp increase in accuracy during the capture window (approximately 83–124 ms) that is then partially offset immediately afterward, before the final rise toward asymptotic performance. This downward rebound cannot be attributed to the endogenous perceptual signal because it goes in the opposite direction. It is as if the exogenous response was automatically followed by a motor reaction in the opposite direction. Perhaps the oculomotor circuitry is such that an exogenous signal can rapidly trigger a saccade, but if it does not, then the corresponding motor plan is rapidly suppressed regardless of anything else. This idea suggests a symmetry with the effect of endogenous attention discussed in the previous paragraph: it appears that in both cases, exogenous and endogenous, a shift of spatial attention activates a motor plan that is either executed within a few tens of milliseconds (to trigger a saccade) or is rapidly suppressed. Such a mechanism would be consistent with the intrinsic tendency of attentional signals to oscillate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landau and Fries, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogendoorn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiebelkorn and Kastner, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The dissociation of exogenous and endogenous influences over time also presents an interesting symmetry with respect to the effects of attention on saccade trajectories across space. Some of the earliest indications of a tight link between attention and eye movements came from experiments showing that saccades deviate away from a cue location that was previously attended but was never itself the saccade target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sheliga et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheliga et al., 1995</xref>). This led to the hypothesis that the mechanisms responsible for deploying spatial attention and those involved in programming saccades are essentially the same (i.e. the premotor theory of attention; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizzolatti et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belopolsky and Theeuwes, 2012</xref>). However, later studies showed that attention effects on saccade trajectories could be either repulsive or attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van der Stigchel et al., 2006</xref>), and specifically demonstrated that saccade trajectories could deviate either toward a distracter or away from it depending on the time at which the distracter was shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Theeuwes and Godijn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McSorley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giuricich et al., 2023</xref>). This result recapitulates the idea discussed above but in the spatial domain: the exogenous effect of the distracter is, initially, to produce a motor plan toward it (attraction), but later on this plan is suppressed and a motor bias away from the distracter (repulsion) is observed instead.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Different tasks, different exogenous and endogenous signals</title><p>Our EPA task differs in many ways from the classic prosaccade/antisaccade paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antoniades et al., 2013</xref>), in which only the presence of the cue matters, not its features, and the instruction to look toward or look away is known to the subject at the start of each trial. Are such differences important?</p><p>There are many ways to set up an experiment where the subject either looks at a relevant cue or away from it. Conversely, it is also possible to design a task where the behavior is essentially identical to that in the classic antisaccade task without ever introducing the notion of looking away from something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>). We think that, more than the specific task instructions or the structure of the event sequence, the fundamental factors that determine behavior in all of these cases are the magnitudes of the resulting exogenous and endogenous signals, and whether they are aligned or misaligned. Under urgent conditions, consideration of these elements and their relevant timescales explains behavior in a wide variety of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>) showed that the spatial signal encoded by neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during the antisaccade task can be accurately predicted from their stimulus- and saccade-related responses during a simpler task that involves no spatial conflict whatsoever (a memory guided saccade task). That is, these two independent response components explained the evolving attentional pointer observed during a typical antisaccade trial. This indicates that, at the circuit level, the dynamics of target selection are dictated by the relative strengths of the exogenous and endogenous activations and their congruency in space and time, however such activations are generated. Thus, we would expect this premise to also be valid under more natural viewing. In that case, visual transients would simply be less predictable and their corresponding exogenous influences potentially more variable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Attentional dynamics are better resolved under time pressure</title><p>A critical conclusion from our work is that temporal dependencies are much more accurately resolved when the fixation requirement is removed earlier and processing time is considered (instead of RT). There are many examples of this. Prior studies have shown that the effect of salience on saccadic choices is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donk and van Zoest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siebold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>), that stimulus-driven and goal-driven control signals on visual selection are distinct and can be temporally dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Zoest et al., 2004</xref>), and that in the transition between them there is a moment of ambiguity wherein choices are dictated by neither (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Heusden et al., 2022</xref>). And, of course, various forms of capture have been demonstrated, all occurring early, before endogenous control takes over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Theeuwes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Theeuwes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Failing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagten-Murphy and Bays, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nissens et al., 2017</xref>). These findings often span differences in RT between 150 and 450 ms. The tachometric curves presented here and in our preceding reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>) recapitulate these phenomena but on a much faster timescale. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref> are emblematic: they reveal an early salience-driven response (characterized by captured saccades) and a late goal-driven rise toward asymptotic performance (&gt;90% correct) separated by a transition period of ambiguous control, each distinct phase evolving within a few tens of milliseconds. What matters most is not the full saccade latency, but rather the shorter period of time during which the relevant stimuli (cues, distracters) can be viewed and processed, and that is the rPT. By initiating the motor plans early and using rPT as a time base, the fast transitions from uninformed to informed choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stanford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>) or from exogenous to endogenous control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>) are exposed with more clarity.</p><p>The broader lesson is that spatial attention dynamics in oculomotor circuits can vary more rapidly and abruptly than is generally appreciated. Saccades can go from being predominantly triggered in one direction to predominantly triggered in the opposite direction easily within 30–50 ms, and more than one such shift may occur in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>) as a consequence of distinct mechanisms interacting. The implications of these rich dynamics to more naturalistic visuomotor behaviors is an important avenue to explore in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Methods were generally similar to those in preceding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we highlight key experimental procedures and details of the data analysis.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Experimental data were collected from 18 healthy human volunteers, 7 male and 11 female, with a median age of 28 years (range, 24–63). Subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants provided informed written consent before beginning the study. Participants were recruited from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist communities. All procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest University School of Medicine (IRB00035241).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Setup</title><p>The experiments were conducted in a semi-dark room. Participants sat in a height-adjustable chair with their chin and forehead supported on a desk-mounted head support. Stimuli were presented on a VIEWPixx LED monitor (VPixx Technologies Inc, Saint Bruno, Quebec, Canada; 1920 × 1200 screen resolution, 120 Hz refresh rate, 12-bit color) at a distance of 57 cm. Eye position was measured and recorded using the EyeLink 1000 infrared camera and tracking system (SR Research, Ottawa, Canada; 1000 Hz sampling rate). Stimulus presentation and data acquisition were controlled using Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and the Psychtoolbox 3.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><p>The pro- and antisaccade tasks are similar to urgent tasks used in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oor et al., 2023</xref>), and require participants to make a perceptual judgment, a color discrimination in this case, while oculomotor plans are already ongoing. The sequence of events was the same in pro and anti trials, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. A trial began with the onset of a gray central fixation point (RGB vector [0.25 0.25 0.25]) on a black screen. After fixation was maintained within a window (4° diameter) for a required time interval (500, 600, or 700 ms, randomly sampled), the fixation point was extinguished. The fixation point offset instructed the participant to make a saccade within 450 ms (or 425 ms for a few participants), and marked the start of the gap interval. Once the gap interval elapsed, the cue (green or magenta) and non-cue (gray) stimuli were shown, one on the left and the other on the right (at –8° and 8° along the horizontal). Participants were instructed to look at the cue whenever it was green (pro trial) and look at the non-cue whenever the cue was magenta (anti trial). Once a saccade was initiated, the cue and non-cue stimuli remained on the screen for 200 ms and then disappeared. A new trial began after an intertrial interval of 350 ms.</p><p>For all experiments, the cue location was constant throughout each block of 150 trials, and was thus known to the participant. Across blocks, it switched between left and right locations. In each trial, the color of the cue (green or magenta) was randomly sampled. The cue and non-cue were circles of 1.5° diameter. Gap durations were –200, –100, 0, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, and 350 ms, and were randomly sampled across trials. So called ‘easy’ trials (gap &lt; 0) are non-urgent trials in which the cue and non-cue stimuli were presented before the go signal, and were interleaved with urgent trials (gap ≥ 0) throughout each block. The RT was measured as the interval between fixation point offset and saccade onset. The rPT, or cue viewing time, was measured as the interval between stimulus onset and saccade onset, and was computed as rPT = RT – gap. An auditory feedback beep was provided at the end of a trial if the saccadic choice was made within the allowed 450 ms RT window. No sound played if the limit was exceeded. No feedback was provided about the correctness of the choice. The task proceeded in blocks of 150 trials with 2–3 min of rest between blocks.</p><p>To ensure that the task rule was understood, all participants completed short practice blocks of easy trials before beginning the experimental blocks and data collection. Experimental sessions lasted 1 hr, and each participant completed 8 blocks of trials in each of 8 sessions. Each participant completed 16 blocks per experiment: 8 blocks where the cue was always on the left interleaved with 8 blocks with the cue always on the right. For clarity, we refer to green-cue trials as pro trials and magenta-cue trials as anti trials; in practice, however, for participants P1–P10, a green cue instructed a prosaccade and a magenta cue instructed an antisaccade, whereas the colors were reversed for participants P11–P18. No effects of color assignment were found in any of the analyses. The cue and non-cue stimuli could each be of high or low luminance. Luminance values were chosen that triggered strong or weak exogenous capture when using single, lone targets, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>). In Experiment 1, the cue and non-cue were both high luminance. In Experiment 2, the cue and non-cue were both low luminance. In Experiment 3, the cue was high luminance and the non-cue was low luminance. In Experiment 4, the cue was low luminance and the non-cue was high luminance. Respective RGB vectors and luminance values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for each stimulus. Luminance was determined by a spectrophotometer (i1 Pro 2 from X-Rite, Inc, Grand Rapids, MI, USA).

Trials with fixation breaks (aborts) or blinks were excluded from analysis. Trials with saccades that were close to vertical (beyond ±60° of the cue or non-cue; &lt;1% of all trials) were also excluded. There was no explicit amplitude criterion; applying one (for instance, excluding any saccades with amplitude &lt;2°) produced minimal changes to the data. Overall, saccade amplitudes were distributed unimodally with a median of 7.7° of eccentricity and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [3.7°, 9.7°]; for reference, choice targets were located at ±8° horizontally. Most saccades were directed to the choice targets; 95% of them were within ±14.2° of the horizontal plane.</p><p>The RT was measured as the time between the go signal (fixation offset) and the onset of the saccade, which was taken as the first time point after the go signal for which the eye velocity surpassed the 40°/s threshold. Trials were scored as correct or incorrect based on the direction of the first saccade made after the go signal. Completed trials were included even if they exceeded the allotted RT limit.</p><p>Results are based on the analysis of urgent trials (gap ≥ 0) only. Easy, non-urgent trials (gap &lt; 0), which yielded predominantly long rPTs (&gt;200 ms), were excluded from analysis because, timing wise, they could potentially correspond to a slightly different regime (go signal after cue onset). In any case, their inclusion was of no appreciable consequence to the effects of interest. Note, however, that non-urgent trials were used to determine whether participants met a performance criterion (see below). No data were excluded based on participant performance or identity.</p><p>Tachometric curves describe how the fraction of correct choices evolves as a function of time after cue onset, or rPT. This processing time period was computed as rPT = RT – gap for each trial. For each tachometric curve, trials were grouped into rPT bins that shifted every 1 ms. For each bin, the numbers of correct and incorrect responses were tallied and the fraction of correct responses was calculated from them, with CIs determined by binomial statistics (68% CIs for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, 95% CIs for all other figures). The bin width was 31 ms when data were aggregated across multiple participants and 41 ms for tachometric curves for single participants.</p><p>The tachometric curves in Experiments 1 and 2 were fitted with a continuous analytical function, a monotonically increasing sigmoidal curve, to extract key characteristic metrics from the empirical curves.

These processes have been thought to be intertwined since at least the development of the Premotor Theory of Attention in 1987, and their relationship has been a continual source of debate and research for decades. Here, Goldstein et al. capitalize on their novel urgent saccade task to dissociate the effects of endogenous and exogenous attention on saccades towards and away from the cue. They find that attention and eye movements are, to some extent, linked to one another but that this link is transient and depends on the nature of the task. A primary strength of the work is that the researchers are able to carefully measure the time course of the interaction between attention and eye movements in various well-controlled experimental conditions. As a result, the behavioral interplay of two forms of attention (endogenous and exogenous) are illustrated at the level of tens of milliseconds as they interact with the planning and execution of saccades towards and away from the cued location. Overall, the results allow the authors to make meaningful claims about the time course of visual behavior, attention, and the potential neural mechanisms at a timescale relevant to everyday human behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97883.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The present study used an experimental procedure involving time-pressure for responding, in order to uncover how the control of saccades by exogenous and endogenous attention unfolds over time.

In the abstract and at some points throughout the manuscript, the authors indicate that the main purpose of the study was to assess whether the allocation of endogenous attention requires saccade planning [e.g., ll.3-5 or ll.247-248]. While the data show a coupling between endogenous attention and saccades, they do not point to a specific direction of this coupling (i.e., whether endogenous attention is necessary to successfully execute a saccade plan or whether a saccade plan necessarily accompanies endogenous attention).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have modified the text in the abstract and at various points in the text to make it more clear that the study investigates the relationship between attention and saccades in one particular direction, first attentional deployment and then saccade planning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the analyses were performed only on subgroups of the participants. The reporting of these subgroup analyses is transparent and data from all participants are reported in the supplementary figures. Still, these subgroup analyses may make the data appear more consistent, compared to when data is considered across all participants. For instance, the exogenous capture in Experiments 1 and 2 appears much weaker in Figure 2 (subgroup) than Figure S3 (all participants). Moreover, because different subgroups were used for different analyses, it is often difficult to follow and evaluate the results. For instance, the tachometric curves in Figure 2 (see also Figure 3 and 4) show no motor bias towards the cue (i.e., performance was at ~50% for rPTs &lt;75 ms). I assume that the subsequent analyses of the motor bias were based on a very different subgroup. In fact, based on Figure S2, it seems that the motor bias was predominantly seen in the unreliable participants. Therefore, I often found the figures that were based on data across all participants (Figures 7 and S3) more informative to evaluate the overall pattern of results.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our intent was to dissociate the effects on saccade bias and timing as clearly as possible, even if that meant having to parse the data into subgroups of participants for different analyses. We do think conceptually this is the better strategy, because the bias and timing effects were distinct and not strongly correlated with specific participants or task variants. For instance, the unreliable participants were somewhat more consistently biased in the same direction, but the reliable participants also showed substantial biases, so the difference in magnitude was relatively modest. This can be more easily appreciated now that the reliable and unreliable participants are indicated in Figures 3 and 5. The impact of the bias is also discussed further in the last paragraphs of the Results, which note that the bias was not a reliable predictor of overall success during informed choices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) In this experimental paradigm, participants must decide where to saccade based on the color of the cue in the visual periphery (they should have made a prosaccade toward a green cue and an antisaccade away from a magenta cue). Thus, irrespective of whether the cue signaled that a prosaccade or an antisaccade was to be made, the identity of the cue was always essential for the task (as the authors explain on p. 5, lines 129-138). Also, the location where the cue appeared was blocked, and thus known to the participants in advance, so that endogenous attention could be directed to the cue at the beginning of a trial (e.g., p. 5, lines 129-132). These aspects of the experimental paradigm differ from the classic prosaccade/antisaccade paradigm (e.g. Antoniades et al., 2013, Vision Research). In the classic paradigm, the identity of the cues does not have to be distinguished to solve the task, since there is only one stimulus that should be looked at (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade), and whether a prosaccade or antisaccade was required is constant across a block of trials. Thus, in contrast to the present paradigm, in the classic paradigm, the participants do not know where the cue is about to appear, but they know whether to perform a prosaccade or an antisaccade based on the location of the cue.</p><p>The present paradigm keeps the location of the cue constant in a block of trials by intention, because this ensures that endogenous attention is allocated to its location and is not overpowered by the exogenous capture of attention that would happen when a single stimulus appeared abruptly in the visual field. Thus, the reason for keeping the location of the cue constant seems convincing. However, I wondered what consequences the constant location would have for the task representations that persist across the task and govern how attention is allocated. In the classic paradigm, there is always a single stimulus that captures attention exogenously (as it appears abruptly). In a prosaccade block, participants can prioritize the visual transient caused by the stimulus, and follow it with a saccade to its coordinates. In an antisaccade block, following the transient with a saccade would always be wrong, so that participants could try to suppress the attention capture by the transient, and base their saccade on the coordinates of the opposite location. Thus, in prosaccade and antisaccade blocks, the task representations controlling how visual transients are processed to perform the task differ. In the present task, prosaccades and antisaccades cannot be distinguished by the visual transients. Thus, such a situation could favor endogenous attention and increase its influence on saccade planning, even though saccade planning under more naturalistic conditions would be dominated by visual transients. I suggest discussing how this (and vice versa the emphasis on visual transients in the classic paradigm) could affect the generality of the presented findings (e.g., how does this relate to the interpretation that saccade plans are obligatorily coupled to endogenous attention? See, Results, p. 10, lines 306-308, see also Deubel &amp; Schneider, 1996, Vision Research).</p></disp-quote><p>Great discussion point. There are indeed many ways to set up an experiment where one must either look to a relevant cue or look away from it. Furthermore, it is also possible to arrange an experiment where the behavior is essentially identical to that in the classic antisaccade task without ever introducing the idea of looking away from something (Oor et al., 2023). More important than the specific task instructions or the structure of the event sequence, we think the fundamental factors that determine behavior in all of these cases are the magnitudes of the resulting exogenous and endogenous signals, and whether they are aligned or misaligned. Under urgent conditions, consideration of these elements and their relevant time scales explains behavior in a wide variety of tasks (see Salinas and Stanford, 2021). Furthermore, a recent study (Zhu et al., 2024) showed that the activation patterns of neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during the antisaccade task can be accurately predicted from their stimulus- and saccade-related responses during a simpler task (a memory guided saccade task). This lends credence to the idea that, at the circuit level, the qualities that are critical for target selection and oculomotor performance are the relative strengths of the exogenous and endogenous signals, and their alignment in space and time. If we understand what those signals are, then it no longer matters how they were generated. The Discussion now includes a paragraph on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Discussion (p. 16, lines 472-475): The authors suppose that &quot;It is as if the exogenous response was automatically followed by a motor bias in the opposite direction. Perhaps the oculomotor circuitry is such that an exogenous signal can rapidly trigger a saccade, but if it does not, then the corresponding motor plan is rapidly suppressed regardless of anything else.&quot;. I think this interesting point should be discussed in more detail. Could it also be that instead of suppression, other currently active motor plans were enhanced? Would this involve attention? Some attention models assume that attention works by distributing available (neuronal) processing resources (e.g., Desimone &amp; Duncan, 1995, Annual Review of Neuroscience; Bundesen, 1990, Psychological Review; Bundesen et al., 2005, Psychological Review) so that the information receiving the largest share of resources results in perception and is used for action, but this happens without the active suppression of information.</p></disp-quote><p>The rebound seen after the exogenously driven changes is certainly interesting, and we agree that it could involve not only the suppression of a specific motor plan but also enhancement of another (opposite) plan. However, we think that, given the lack of prior data with the requisite temporal precision, further elaboration of this point would just be too speculative in the context of the point that we are trying to make, which is simply that the underlying choice dynamics are more rapid and intricate than is generally appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Methods, p. 19, lines 593-596: It is reported that saccades were scored based on their direction. I think more information should be provided to understand which eye movements entered the analysis. Was there a criterion for saccade amplitude? I think it would be very helpful to provide data on the distributions of saccade amplitudes or on their accuracy (e.g. average distance from target) or reliability (e.g. standard deviation of landing points). Also, it is reported that some data was excluded from the analysis, and I suggest reporting how much of the data was excluded. Was the exclusion of the data related to whether participants were &quot;reliable&quot; or &quot;unreliable&quot; performers?</p></disp-quote><p>The reported results are based on all saccades (detected according to a velocity threshold) that were produced after the go signal and in a predominantly horizontal direction (within ± 60° of the cue or non-cue), which were the vast majority (&gt; 99%). Indeed, most saccades were directed to the choice targets, with 95% of them within ± 14.2° of the horizontal plane. The excluded (non-scored) trials were primarily fixation breaks plus a small fraction of trials with blinks, which compromised saccade determination. There was no explicit amplitude criterion; applying one (for instance, excluding any saccades with amplitude &lt; 2°) produced minimal changes to the data. Overall, saccade amplitudes were distributed unimodally with a median of 7.7° and a 95% confidence interval of [3.7°, 9.7°], whereas the choice targets were located at ± 8° horizontally. This is now reported in the Methods.</p><p>As far as data exclusion, analyses were based on urgent trials (gap &gt; 0); non-urgent (gap &lt; 0) trials were excluded from calculation of the tachometric curves simply because they might correspond to a slightly different regime (go signal <italic>after</italic> cue onset) and to long processing times in the asymptotic range (rPT in 200–300 ms) or beyond, which are not as informative. However, including them made no appreciable difference to the results. No data were excluded based on participant performance or identity; all psychometric analyses were carried out after the selection of trials based on the scoring criteria described above. This is now stated in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Results, p. 9, lines 262-266: Some data analyses are performed on a subset of participants that met certain performance criteria. The reasons for this data selection seem convincing (e.g. to ensure empirical curves were not flat, line 264). Nevertheless, I suggest to explain and justify this step in more detail. In addition, if not all participants achieved an acceptable performance and data quality, this could also speak to the experimental task and its difficulty. Thus, I suggest discussing the potential implications of this, in particular, how this could affect the studied mechanisms, and whether it could limit the presented findings to a special group within the studied population.</p></disp-quote><p>The ideal (i.e., best) analysis for determining the cost of an antisaccade for each individual participant (Fig. 4c) was based on curve fitting and required task performance to rise consistently above chance at long rPTs in both pro and anti trials. This is why the mentioned conditions on the fits were imposed. This is now explained in the text. This ideal analysis was not viable for all tachometric curves not necessarily because of task difficulty but also because of high variability or high bias in a particular experiment/condition. It is true that the task was somewhat difficult, but this manifested in various ways across the dataset, so attempting to draw a clean-cut classification of participants based on “difficulty” may not be easy or all that informative (as can be gleaned from Fig. S1). There simply was a range of success levels, as one might expect from any task that requires some nontrivial cognitive processing. Also note that no participants were excluded flat out from analysis. Thus, at the mentioned point in the text, we simply note that a complementary analysis is presented later that includes all participants and all conditions and provides a highly consistent result (namely, Fig. 7e). Then, in the last section of the Results, where Fig. 7 is presented, we point out that there is considerable variance in performance at long rPTs, and that it relates to both the bias and the difficulty of the task across participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I have some questions related to the initial motor bias:</p><p>a) Based on Figure S3, which shows the tachometric curves using data from all participants, there only seems to be a systematic motor bias in Experiments 1 and 3 but no bias in Experiments 2 and 4. It is unclear to me why this is different from the data shown in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>For the bars in Fig. 7, accuracy (% correct) was computed for each participant and then averaged across participants, whereas for the data in Fig. S3, trials were first pooled across participants and then accuracy was computed for each rPT bin. The different averaging methods produce slightly different results because some participants had more trials in the guessing range than others, and different biases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Based on Figure 7 (and Figure S3), there was no motor bias in Experiment 4. Based on the correlations between motor bias and time difference between pro and antisaccades, I would expect that the rise points between pro and antisaccades would be more similar in this Experiment. Was this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>No. Figs. 3c and S3d show that the rise times of pro and anti trials for Experiment 4 still differ by about 30 ms (around the 75% correct mark), and the rest of the panels in those figures show that the difference is similar for all experiments. What happens is that Figs. 7 and S3 show that on average the bias is zero for Experiment 4, but that does not mean that the average difference in rise times is zero because there is an offset in the data (correlation is not the same as regression). The most relevant evidence is in Fig. 6c, which shows that, for an overall bias of zero, one would still expect a positive difference in rise times of about 25–30 ms. This figure now includes a regression line, and the corresponding text now explains the relationship between bias and rise times more clearly. Thanks for asking; this is an important point that was not sufficiently elaborated before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) If I understand correctly, the initial motor bias was predominantly observed in participants who were classified as 'unreliable performers' (comparing Figure S2 and Figure 2). Was there a correlation between the motor bias and overall success in the task? In other words: Was a strong motor bias generally disadvantageous?</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. Participants classified as ‘unreliable’ were somewhat more consistently biased in the same direction than those classified as ‘reliable’, but the distinction in magnitude was not large. This can be better appreciated now in Fig. 5 by noting the mix of black (reliable) and gray labels (unreliable) along the x axes. The unreliable participants were also, by definition, less accurate in their asymptotic performance in at least one experiment (Fig. S1). In general, however, this classification was used simply to distinguish more clearly the two main effects in the data (timing cost and bias). In fact, the motor bias was not a reliable predictor of performance during informed choices: across all participants, the mean accuracy in the asymptotic range (rPT &gt; 200 ms) had a weak, non-significant correlation with the bias (ρ = ‒0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7). So, no, the motor bias did not incur an obvious disadvantage in terms of overall success in the task. Its more relevant effect was the <italic>asymmetry</italic> in performance that it promoted between pro- and antisaccade trials (Fig. 6c). This is now explained at the end of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) One of the key analyses of the current study is the comparison of the rPT required to make informed pro and antisaccades (ll.246 ff). I think it would be informative for readers to see the results of this analysis separately for all four experiments. For instance, based on Figure 4a and b, it looks like the rise points were actually very similar between pro and antisaccades in Experiment 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ideal analysis would be to compute the performance rise point for pro- and antisaccade curves for each experiment and each participant, but as is now noted in the text, this requires a steady and substantial rise in the tachometric curve, which is not always obtained at such a fine-grained level; the underlying variability can be glimpsed from the individual points in Fig. 7a, b. Indeed, in Fig. 4a, b the mean difference between pro and anti rise points appears small for Experiment 1 — but note that the two panels include data from only partially overlapping sets of participants; the figure legend now makes this more clear. Again, this is because the required fitting procedure was not always reliable in both conditions (pro and anti) for a given subject in a given experiment. Thus, panels a and b cannot be directly compared. The key results are those in Fig. 4c, which compare the rise points in the two conditions for the same participants (11 of them, for which both rise points could be reliably determined). In that case the mean difference is evident, and the individual effect consistent for 9 of the 11 participants (as now noted).</p><p>A similar comparison for Experiments 1 or 2 individually would include fewer data points and lose statistical power. However, on average, the results for Experiments 1 and 2 (separately) were indeed very similar; in both cases, the comparison between pro and anti curves pooled across the same qualifying participants as in Fig. 4c produced results that were nearly identical to those of Fig. 4d (as can be inferred from Fig. 2a, b). Furthermore, results for the four individual experiments pooled across all participants are presented in Figure S3, which shows delayed rises in antisaccade performance consistent with the single participant data (Fig. 4c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3: It would be helpful to indicate the reliable performers that were used for Figure 3a in the bar plots in Figure 3b.

However, the discussed literature and the experimental approach of the current study still rely on experimental paradigms that are far from natural viewing conditions. Thus, I suggest either discussing the link between these paradigms and natural viewing in more detail or leaving out the reference to natural viewing at this point (I think the latter suggestion would fit the present paper best).</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the latter suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Introduction (e.g. p. 3, lines 55-58): The authors discuss the effects that sustaining fixation might have on attention and eye movements. Recently, it has been found that maintaining fixation can ameliorate cognitive conflicts that involve spatial attention (Krause &amp; Poth, 2023, iScience). It seems interesting to include this finding in the discussion, because it supports the authors' view that it is necessary to study fixation and eye movements rather than eye movements alone to uncover their interplay with attention and decision-making.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reference. The reported finding is certainly interesting, but we find it somewhat tangential to the specific point we make about strong fixation constraints — which is that they suppress internally driven motor activity, including biases, that are highly informative of the relationship between attention and saccade planning (lines 466‒472, 541‒561). Whether fixation state has other subtle consequences for cognitive control is an intriguing, important issue, for sure. But we would rather maintain the readers’ focus on the reasons why less restrictive fixation requirements are relevant for understanding the deployment of attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Results, p. 9, lines 264-266: It is reported that &quot;The rise points were statistically the same across experiments for both prosaccades (p=0.08, n=10, permutation test)...&quot;, but the p-value seems quite close to significance.

As this could induce a burst of arousal, I wondered how it affected the subsequent trials.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting issue to ponder. We agree that, in principle, the beep could have an impact on arousal. However, what exactly would be predicted as a consequence? The absence of a beep is meant to increase the urgency of the participant, so some effect of the beep event on RT would be expected anyway as per task instructions. Thus, it is unclear whether an arousal contribution could be isolated from other confounds. That said, three observations suggest that, at most, an independent arousal effect would be very small. First, we have performed multisensory experiments (unpublished) with auditory and visual stimuli, and have found that it is difficult to obtain a measurable effect of sound on an urgent visual choice task unless the experimental conditions are particularly conducive; namely, when the visual stimuli are dim and the sound is loud and lateralized. None of these conditions applies to the standard feedback beep. Second, because most trials are on time, the meaningful feedback signal is conveyed by the <italic>absence</italic> of the beep. But this signal to alter behavior (i.e., respond sooner) has zero intensity and is therefore unlikely to trigger a strong exogenous, automatic response. Finally, in our data, we can parse the trials that followed a beep (the majority) from those that did not (a minority). In doing so, we found no differences with respect to perceptual performance; only minor differences in RT that were identical for pro- and antisaccade trials. All this suggests to us that it is very unlikely that the feedback alters arousal significantly on specific trials, somehow impacting the tachometric curve (a contribution to general arousal across blocks or sessions is possible, of course, but would be of little consequence to the aims of the study).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Methods, p. 18, lines 574-577: I suggest referring to the colors or the conditions in the text as it was done in the experiments, just to prevent readers being confused before reading the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thought, but think that the study is easier to understand by pretending, initially, that the color assignments were fixed.
