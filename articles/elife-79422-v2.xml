To identify the PK isoforms involved, we generated mice lacking β-cell PKm1, PKm2, and mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2) that generates mitochondrial PEP. Glucose metabolism was found to generate both glycolytic and mitochondrially derived PEP, which triggers K<sub>ATP</sub> closure through local PKm1 and PKm2 signaling at the plasma membrane. Amino acids, which generate mitochondrial PEP without producing glycolytic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to allosterically activate PKm2, signal through PKm1 to raise ATP/ADP, close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and stimulate insulin secretion. Raising cytosolic ATP/ADP with amino acids is insufficient to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the absence of PK activity or PCK2, indicating that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are primarily regulated by PEP that provides ATP via plasma membrane-associated PK, rather than mitochondrially derived ATP. Following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is involved in an ‘off-switch’ that facilitates K<sub>ATP</sub> channel reopening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and β-cell PCK2 deletion, which prolongs Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increases insulin secretion. In conclusion, the differential response of PKm1 and PKm2 to the glycolytic and mitochondrial sources of PEP influences the β-cell nutrient response, and controls the oscillatory cycle regulating insulin secretion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pyruvate kinase</kwd><kwd>katp channels</kwd><kwd>β-cell metabolism</kwd><kwd>PEP cycle</kwd><kwd>insulin

Contrary to what is often believed, the glucose-induced signaling process in β-cells has not been largely solved, and the entrenched model implicating a rise in mitochondrially derived ATP driving K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Newgard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prentki et al., 2013</xref>) is incomplete and possibly wrong, the main reason being that it does not consider other sources of local ATP production that may be key for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corkey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrins et al., 2022</xref>). The recent discovery that pyruvate kinase (PK), which converts ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ATP and pyruvate, is present on the β-cell plasma membrane where it is sufficient to raise sub-plasma membrane ATP/ADP (ATP/ADP<sub>pm</sub>) and close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>) provides an alternative mechanism to oxidative phosphorylation for K<sub>ATP</sub> channel regulation. Based on this finding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>, proposed a revised model of β-cell fuel sensing, which we refer to here as the Mito<sub>Cat</sub>-Mito<sub>Ox</sub> model, that is relevant to both rodent and human islets and the in vivo context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abulizi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrins et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In the Mito<sub>Cat</sub>-Mito<sub>Ox</sub> model of β-cell metabolic signaling, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADP availability dictate the metabolic cycles that preferentially occur during the triggering or secretory phases of glucose-stimulated oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The triggering phase, referred to as Mito<sub>Cat</sub> (a.k.a. Mito<sub>Synth</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>), is named for the matched processes of anaplerosis (i.e., the net filling of TCA cycle intermediates) and cataplerosis (i.e., the egress of TCA cycle intermediates to the cytosol). During this electrically silent phase of metabolism, the favorable bioenergetics of PEP metabolism (ΔG°=–14.8 kcal/mol for PEP vs. –7.3 for ATP) by PK progressively increases the ATP/ADP ratio, and by lowering ADP slows oxidative phosphorylation. The shift to a higher mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) elevates the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio in the mitochondrial matrix and slows the TCA cycle, increasing acetyl-CoA that allosterically activates pyruvate carboxylase, the anaplerotic consumer of pyruvate that fuels oxaloacetate-dependent PEP synthesis by mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2). The return of mitochondrial PEP to the cytosol completes the ‘PEP cycle’ that helps fuel PK, which raises ATP/ADP<sub>pm</sub> to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Following membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the increased workload (ATP hydrolysis) associated with ion pumping and exocytosis elevates cytosolic ADP, which activates oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP that sustains insulin secretion in a phase referred to as Mito<sub>Ox</sub>. An unresolved aspect of this model is whether plasma membrane-compartmentalized PK activity is required to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. This question is important because in the current canonical model of fuel-induced insulin secretion, an increase in the bulk cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio (ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub>) is generally assumed to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.</p><p>In the Mito<sub>Cat</sub>-Mito<sub>Ox</sub> model, PK has two possible sources of PEP that may differentially regulate K<sub>ATP</sub> closure: glycolytic PEP produced by enolase, and mitochondrial PEP produced by PCK2 in response to anaplerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). About 40% of glucose-derived PEP is generated by PCK2 in the PEP cycle and is closely linked to insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abulizi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jesinkey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stark et al., 2009</xref>). However, it remains unclear how the PEP cycle influences glucose-stimulated oscillations. We hypothesize that mitochondrial PEP derived from PCK2 may provide a glycolysis-independent mechanism by which PK rapidly increases ATP/ADP<sub>pm</sub> locally at the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in response to amino acids, which are potent anaplerotic fuels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of mouse models to probe the functions of PKm1, PKm2, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) in β-cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hypothesized model in which pyruvate kinase (PK) in the K<sub>ATP</sub> microcompartment is fueled by two sources of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) – glycolytic PEP generated by enolase, and mitochondrial PEP generated by PCK2 in response to anaplerotic fuels. β-Cells express three isoforms of PK, constitutively active PKm1, and allosterically recruitable PKm2 and PKL that are activated by endogenous fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) or pharmacologic PK activators (PKa).

First, spatial privilege provides redundancy in the β-cell glucose response, by permitting the minor PKm2 isoform, when activated by FBP, to transmit the signal from glucose to K<sub>ATP</sub> despite contributing only a small fraction of the whole cell PK activity. Second, the composition of PK isoforms within the K<sub>ATP</sub> compartment tunes the β-cell response to amino acids, which provide mitochondrial PEP for PKm1 without also generating the FBP needed to allosterically activate PKm2.

Conversely, β-cell PKm2 deletion lowered islet lysate PK V<sub>max</sub> by ~20% in the absence of activators, and eliminated both the K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> response to PKa and FBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), thus ruling out any measurable PKL activity. Taken together, mouse islet PK activity is composed of &gt;90% PKm1, with a variable contribution from PKm2 depending on the FBP level. If only considered in terms of total cellular activity related to nutrient-induced insulin secretion (i.e. in the absence of any compartmentalized functions), PKm1 should be dominant over PKm2 under all physiologic conditions. The fact that PKm1-βKO mice maintain metabolic health with unaltered glucose tolerance into adulthood suggests that the remaining PK activity is sufficient for β-cell function, and led us to hypothesize that both PKm1 and PKm2 function in the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel microcompartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Both PKm1 and PKm2 are associated with the plasma membrane and locally direct K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure, however PKm2 requires allosteric activation even at high PEP levels</title><p>We previously demonstrated that PEP, in the presence of saturating ADP concentrations, can close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in mouse and human β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that PK is present near K<sub>ATP</sub> and locally lowers ADP and raises ATP to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Excised patch-clamp experiments, which expose the inside of the plasma membrane to the bath solution (i.e. the inside-out mode), provide both the location of endogenous PK and its functional coupling to K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in native β-cell membranes. This approach was applied in combination with β-cell deletion of PKm1 and PKm2 to directly identify the isoforms of the enzyme present in the K<sub>ATP</sub> microdomain. K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were identified by inhibition with 1 mM ATP, which blocked the spontaneous opening that occurs after patch excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

PKa had a similar effect when applied acutely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that PKm2 does not require allosteric activation to localize to the plasma membrane. Although the PEP concentration is estimated to be 1 mM in rat islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugden and Ashcroft, 1977</xref>), 5 mM PEP was chosen to exceed the K<sub>m</sub> of PKm2 in the absence of FBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the response of PKm2 to PKa at high PEP levels indicates that K<sub>ATP</sub> closure requires an additional increase in the V<sub>max</sub> via either allosteric activation of individual subunits of PKm2, or perhaps more likely, that the functional interaction is sensitive to the quaternary structure of PKm2. β-Cells lacking PKm2 maintained channel closure with the same power as 1 mM ATP, which is attributable to the sufficiency of endogenous PKm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Consistent with the ability of allosteric PKm2 activation to accelerate K<sub>ATP</sub> closure, acute application of PKa to wild-type islets reduced the period as well as the amplitude of the steady-state glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These observations suggest that the PKm2-driven PEP cycle regulates the onset, and even more strongly, the termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Consistently, in PCK2-βKO islets where mitochondrial PEP production is inhibited, both the period and amplitude of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were increased relative to controls islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Although the duty cycle also increased, it was only by a small margin. The period lengthening occurred in part from an increased duration of Mito<sub>Cat</sub>, and especially from an increased duration of Mito<sub>Ox</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that PKm2 controls both an ‘on-switch’ and an ‘off-switch’ for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, both of which depend on the mitochondrial production of PEP.</p><p>While above experiments examined conditions at a fixed elevated glucose concentration (10 mM), we also investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics following the transition from low to high glucose where first-phase insulin secretion is observed.

Conversely, depolarization was delayed in PCK2-βKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In this case, the duration of the first-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse was not calculated since nearly 60% of PCK2-βKO islets failed to exit the first-phase plateau in order to begin oscillations, as compared with only 27% of control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In other words, while the PCK2 knockout had a weaker first-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, it had a much longer plateau that failed to turn off effectively.

In particular, glutamine and leucine generate PEP via glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)-mediated anaplerosis that is followed by PCK2-mediated cataplerosis of PEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kibbey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stark et al., 2009</xref>).

To limit glycolytic PEP, islets were incubated at 2.7 mM glucose. The islets were then stimulated with a mixture of AA including leucine and glutamine to allosterically activate and fuel GDH, respectively. Consistent with defective PEP cataplerosis, the ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> response of PCK2-βKO islets was only 44% of control islets in response to AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In this setting of PCK2 depletion, pharmacologic PK activation did not recover any of the AA-induced ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> response due to the absence of either a glycolytic or mitochondrial PEP source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Our results indicate that PK is controlled by two different sources of PEP – glycolytic and mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Glucose signals to PK via both glycolytic and mitochondrially derived PEP, whereas AA signal to PK exclusively through mitochondrially derived PEP. Since AA do not generate FBP, which is needed to allosterically activate PKm2, PKm1 is necessary to raise ATP/ADP<sub>pm</sub>, close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and stimulate insulin secretion in response to AA. Furthermore, our work supports the concept that the canonical model of fuel-induced insulin secretion, whereby mitochondrially derived ATP produced via the electron transport chain raises ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, is possibly wrong. The evidence for this new view of β-cell metabolic signaling is that while AA efficiently raise ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub>, they do not close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the absence of plasma membrane PK activity. Finally, the data indicate that PK and the PEP cycle have a dual role in the control of insulin secretion – they act as on-signals during the triggering phase, Mito<sub>Cat</sub>, and as off-signals during the active secretory phase, Mito<sub>Ox</sub>. We discuss each of these findings in the sections below.</p><p>A fuel-stimulated rise in ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> was shown to be insufficient to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, ruling out a key aspect of the ‘canonical model’ in which accelerated mitochondrial metabolism raises ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Newgard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prentki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thompson and Satin, 2021</xref>). In PKm1-deficient β-cells, AA increased ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> similarly to control β-cells, but were unable to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Pharmacologic activation of PKm2, present on the plasma membrane of PKm1-deficient β-cells, acutely restored K<sub>ATP</sub> closure. Thus, while mitochondrially derived ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub> may help to buffer the PK-dependent rise in ATPADP<sub>pm</sub>, PK is essential for K<sub>ATP</sub> closure in intact β-cells. Plasma membrane-associated PK is also sufficient for K<sub>ATP</sub> closure in excised patch experiments, including in the presence of high concentrations of ADP that activates K<sub>ATP</sub> channels when complexed with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, further supporting the concept that glycolytic ATP preferentially closes β-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, as previously shown in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhar-Chowdhury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weiss and Lamp, 1987</xref>). These data support the Mito<sub>Cat</sub>-Mito<sub>Ox</sub> model in which plasma membrane-compartmentalized PK increases the ATP/ADP ratio near K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to <italic>initiate</italic> insulin secretion, while oxidative phosphorylation plays the dominant role in providing ATP to sustain insulin secretion <italic>after</italic> membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrins et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse β-cell, we demonstrate that most of the PK activity is the constitutively active PKm1 isoform, with a minor contribution from PKm2 and no detectable PKL activity. In the rat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacDonald and Chang, 1985</xref>, reported PK activity to be primarily PKm2, which may be a species difference. However, in the MacDonald study FBP was shown to have a minor effect on PK activity, which casts doubts about the conclusion of this work. Our prior studies of PK-dependent K<sub>ATP</sub> closure in human β-cell plasma membranes were conducted in the absence of FBP, which is consistent with the presence of PKm1 in the microdomain but not ruling out PKm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). Regardless, PKm2 activators amplify nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion in mouse, rat, and human islets in vitro, and in rats in vivo, indicating that PKm2 is functionally recruitable in all three species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abulizi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Whole-body PCK2<sup>-/-</sup> mice display glucose intolerance and reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose and AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abulizi et al., 2020</xref>). These effects may arise independently of the β-cell, since here we show that PCK2-βKO mice of similar age are glucose tolerant, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets is actually increased when AA are present. Nevertheless, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by AA stimulation at low glucose is blocked in both models, demonstrating the important role of mitochondrial PEP in regulating K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. We further demonstrate that, in response to AA, β-cell PCK2 is rate controlling for ATP/ADP<sub>c</sub>, K<sub>ATP</sub> closure, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and insulin secretion. However, in the presence of elevated glucose, AA stimulation in fact increased insulin secretion. This may be explained by the dual function of the PEP cycle playing a role in both the on- and off-phases of pulsatile insulin secretion. β-Cell deletion of PCK2 had a strong effect on glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, delaying <italic>both</italic> the onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and preventing the ability of β-cells to efficiently repolarize. The failure of this off-switch provides a plausible explanation for the hypersecretion in β-cells lacking PCK2 when anaplerosis is fully primed with the combined presence of glucose and AA.</p><p>Insulin release is frequently described in terms of triggering and amplifying on-signals termed ‘metabolic coupling factors’ (MCFs). As defined by Prentki, ‘regulatory MCFs’ are nutrient-dependent signals that facilitate the switch between metabolic networks (e.g., malonyl-CoA switches β-cells from fatty acid to glucose oxidation), while ‘effectory MCFs’ (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP/ADP, cAMP, monoacylglycerol, and reactive oxygen species) are transient, necessary on-signals that dose-dependently stimulate insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prentki et al., 2013</xref>). Is PEP a regulatory or effectory MCF for insulin secretion – or both? PEP has some properties of a regulatory signal, since its metabolism by PK generates a bioenergetic feedforward that progressively deprives mitochondria of ADP, shutting down oxidative phosphorylation in favor of activating both pyruvate carboxylase and the PEP cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). Through a positive Hill coefficient, the increasing concentration of PEP progressively activates PKm2 to increase ATP/ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrins et al., 2013</xref>), further reinforcing the PEP cycle. ATP/ADP<sub>pm</sub> is clearly an effectory signal in that it is sufficient to cause depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashcroft et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook and Hales, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rorsman and Trube, 1985</xref>) while at the same time priming granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eliasson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pizarro-Delgado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>). Arguably, PEP also acts as an effectory MCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugden and Ashcroft, 1977</xref>), since its presence in the K<sub>ATP</sub> microenvironment in the excised patches can override channel opening by continuous ADP to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. This property requires either PKm1 or allosterically activated PKm2.</p><p>Effectory MCFs must be counterbalanced by a strong off-switch that ensures the signal is transient. That is, the β-cell can fail if K<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is activated without a coordinated homeostatic mechanism to turn it off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Remedi and Nichols, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thielen and Shalev, 2018</xref>). While PKm2 activation during Mito<sub>Cat</sub> was found to facilitate K<sub>ATP</sub> closure and increase Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we also found that PKm2 activation during Mito<sub>Ox</sub> accelerated K<sub>ATP</sub> channel reopening and lowered Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This off-switch most likely occurs outside the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel microcompartment, and may involve mitochondrial PEP, since β-cell PCK2 deletion stalls the β-cell in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated state. In addition to these temporally compartmentalized effects, spatial considerations, such as the stimulus-dependent movement of the mitochondria away from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griesche et al., 2019</xref>), may also be important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p><p>Further studies are needed to elucidate precisely how the PK and the PEP cycle may contribute to turning off Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and insulin secretion during the Mito<sub>Ox</sub> phase. Notably, these studies were limited to mice and the isoform-specific functions of PK await confirmation in human islets, although the effect of TEPP-46 to increase insulin secretion in human β-cells strongly implicates a role for PKm2/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abulizi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>).

kinase isoforms impact pancreatic β-cell ATP/ADP levels, ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel (KATP channel) activity, calcium handling, and insulin secretion. This is an important study that challenges the current paradigms of KATP-channel regulation, the major signaling mechanism through which pancreatic β cells couple blood glucose levels to insulin release. Future studies will determine whether similar mechanisms are used in human pancreatic β cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79422.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sussel</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03wmf1y16</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hodson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kebede</surname><given-names>Melkam A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0384j8v12</institution-id><institution>University of Sydney</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.09.478817">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.478817v6">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This strongly suggests that the increase in islet calcium oscillations shown when stimulated with TEPP-46 (Figure 3F) are likely to be mediated via PKm2 activation. It would be important to confirm this by assessing the impact of TEPP-46 on PKm2-βKO islet calcium oscillations in 10 mM glucose.</p><p>– Although the authors show that glucose-induced islet calcium entry is greater in terms of amplitude and oscillation duration, 2nd phase insulin secretion from PCK2-βKO islets does not seem to be impacted. The manuscript does show that in the presence of high glucose that amino acids immediately increase insulin secretion in PCK2-βKO islets above controls (figure 6c). However, the amplitude of islet calcium in response to glucose and amino acids is reduced PCK2-βKO islets (figure 6b). Some experiment showing that under the same conditions of insulin perifusion (figure 6c) that islet calcium shows elevation with AA stimulation following glucose pretreatment would be useful.</p><p>– The authors mention that &quot;following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is also involved in an off-switch that facilitates KATP channel reopening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and β-cell PCK2 deletion that prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increased insulin secretion.&quot; The &quot;off-switch&quot; is proposed to be mediated via KATP activation, and it is not clear how the factors that the authors have shown to block KATP channels are so tightly coupled with KATP activation. PK would be predicted to produce ATP close to KATP channels, but not to consume ATP close to these channels; thus, the authors should indicate how PEP (that has been shown to inhibit KATP) is linked to ATP utilization in a microdomain close to the KATP channels. The data do show that following KATP channel closure with amino acids that PKa can partially reopen KATP channels within a minute. While MitoOx could lead to eventual ATP reduction, the TEPP-46 should still activate PK close to KATP channels (especially immediately after addition in attached patch confirmation), which would locally increase ATP near the channels and close them further (this does not seem to be observed in the single channel activity show in Figure 5b).</p><p>Moreover, the authors show that TEPP-46 addition during AA induced calcium entry reduced calcium entry likely through activation of KATP channels (yet PK activation near the KATP channels would still be predicted to transfer phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP to produce ATP leading to further KATP closure); it is not clear how TEPP-46 addition during AA induced calcium entry would so quickly consume ATP next to the KATP channel (especially because PKm2-βKO islets show reduced ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation, which suggests that TEPP-46 addition would actually increase islet ATP/ADP). The authors indicate that MitoOx is initiated during amino-acid induced calcium influx (figure 5G). While figure 5b suggests that ATP turnover (also shown in Supplemental Figure S1) occurs during amino acid induced islet calcium influx, in figure 4 the Percival recordings show an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio during amino acid stimulation when islet calcium would be high. The increase in the islet ATP/ADP ratio in response to amino acid stimulation of islet calcium entry (Figure 5) differs from what happens during an islet glucose-stimulated calcium oscillation where ATP/ADP drops during the elevation in islet calcium (PMID: 33147484); this suggests that the amino acid experiments are not showing ATP turnover that the authors indicate happens during MitoOx (Figure 3A and PMID: 33147484; also Supplemental Figure S1). The Percival recordings in response to amino acids are monitoring cytoplasmic ATP/ADP that reflects mitochondrial activity and importantly loss of β-cell PKm2 reduces the ATP/ADP ratio stimulated by amino acids compared to controls. Thus, it is important to define how global ATP could be rising in response to amino acid stimulation, but KATP channels are instead activated by TEPP-46; this is important because TEPP-46 activation of PKm2would be predicted to increase global islet ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation, which is predicted from the PKm2-βKO islets showing reduced ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation (Figure 4E). Taken together, the authors should define how PK activation induces specific ATP depletion near the KATP channel and not in the cytoplasm during amino acid stimulation. Also, more clarification on PK-mediated KATP activation is required in particular in relation to the Percival data of this manuscript and differences in ATP/ADP ratio in the amino acid MitoOx conditions (with increased ATP/ADP) compared to glucose-stimulated calcium oscillation MitoOx conditions (with decreased ATP/ADP).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please find below a number of constructive comments to help strengthen the conclusions of the study:</p><p>– The title should be modified to include 'in mice', since the results in their present form are only applicable to mouse β cells. This is not a problem per se, since mice are the most widely used model for investigating KATP channel activity, and the genetic manipulations used here cannot be easily performed in human islets.</p><p>– &quot;β-cell deletion of PKm1 or PKm2 did not reveal any biologically meaningful differences in the oscillatory period, the fraction of each oscillation spent in the electrically-active state (i.e. the duty cycle), or the amplitude of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in intact islets (Figure 3b, d).&quot; Please qualify how 'biologically meaningful' was assessed. The increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation period in Figure 3D (Pkm2-BKO) is the same magnitude as the changes reported in Figure 3F and G (PKa), which are stated to be 'reduced'.</p><p>– In experiments reporting G2.7 -&gt; G10, why does it take ~3-5 mins to observe a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>? Does the grey box indicate G10 entering the perifusion system, or achievement of G10 in the cuvette?</p><p>– &quot;Thus, while neither PK isoform is required for AA stimulation to increase ATP/ADPc, PCK2 displays high control strength over ATP/ADPc in response to AA, especially considering that the PCK2 protein was only reduced by about two-thirds (Figure 1d).&quot; Logic of this sentence is unclear. Both PKm1 and PKm2 KO impair ATP/ADP responses to AA. So the kinases are required for AAs to increase ATP/ADP to maximal. In any case, even PCK2-BKO does not prevent AAs from stimulating ATP/ADP.</p><p>– &quot;These remarkable findings&quot;, &quot;novel&quot; etc. Please remove statements of novelty. What one individual finds remarkable, another might find unsurprising.</p><p>– While not essential, this reviewer found themselves wanting Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings to confirm that changes in KATP-channel activity are linked to downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes and alterations in insulin during AA + high glucose (G10) perifusion insulin assays (Figure 6).</p><p>– Maybe I failed to make a link somewhere, but how do impaired cytoplasmic ATP/ADP rises in PKm2-BKO islets lead to apparent increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>/insulin secretion?</p><p>– The majority of the data are from in vitro models, with the various KO mice showing no changes in glucose homeostasis.

This would be a powerful corroborative link between in vitro and in vivo phenotype unless the authors believe this not to be the case.</p><p>– &quot;Since amino acids do not generate FBP, which is needed to allosterically activate PKm2, PKm1 is necessary to raise ATP/ADPpm, close KATP channels, and stimulate insulin secretion in response to amino acids.&quot; I don't recall that the authors measured plasma membrane (PM)-localised ATP/ADP rises. A PM targeting sequence might be something to add to Perceval-HR in the future.</p><p>– Male mice are used throughout the study.

Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> phenotype in PCK2-βKO islets (Figure 3h, i) is well-matched to the insulin secretion (Figure 6c). Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is plateaued under the glucose + mixed AA condition shown in Figure 6, which is why we used glucose + leucine in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors mention that &quot;following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is also involved in an off-switch that facilitates KATP channel reopening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and β-cell PCK2 deletion that prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increased insulin secretion.&quot; The &quot;off-switch&quot; is proposed to be mediated via KATP activation, and it is not clear how the factors that the authors have shown to block KATP channels are so tightly coupled with KATP activation.

The data do show that following KATP channel closure with amino acids that PKa can partially reopen KATP channels within a minute. While MitoOx could lead to eventual ATP reduction, the TEPP-46 should still activate PK close to KATP channels (especially immediately after addition in attached patch confirmation), which would locally increase ATP near the channels and close them further (this does not seem to be observed in the single channel activity show in Figure 5b).</p><p>Moreover, the authors show that TEPP-46 addition during AA induced calcium entry reduced calcium entry likely through activation of KATP channels (yet PK activation near the KATP channels would still be predicted to transfer phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP to produce ATP leading to further KATP closure); it is not clear how TEPP-46 addition during AA induced calcium entry would so quickly consume ATP next to the KATP channel (especially because PKm2-βKO islets show reduced ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation, which suggests that TEPP-46 addition would actually increase islet ATP/ADP). The authors indicate that MitoOx is initiated during amino-acid induced calcium influx (figure 5G). While figure 5b suggests that ATP turnover (also shown in Supplemental Figure S1) occurs during amino acid induced islet calcium influx, in figure 4 the Percival recordings show an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio during amino acid stimulation when islet calcium would be high. The increase in the islet ATP/ADP ratio in response to amino acid stimulation of islet calcium entry (Figure 5) differs from what happens during an islet glucose-stimulated calcium oscillation where ATP/ADP drops during the elevation in islet calcium (PMID: 33147484); this suggests that the amino acid experiments are not showing ATP turnover that the authors indicate happens during MitoOx (Figure 3A and PMID: 33147484; also Supplemental Figure S1). The Percival recordings in response to amino acids are monitoring cytoplasmic ATP/ADP that reflects mitochondrial activity and importantly loss of β-cell PKm2 reduces the ATP/ADP ratio stimulated by amino acids compared to controls. Thus, it is important to define how global ATP could be rising in response to amino acid stimulation, but KATP channels are instead activated by TEPP-46; this is important because TEPP-46 activation of PKm2would be predicted to increase global islet ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation, which is predicted from the PKm2-βKO islets showing reduced ATP/ADP in response to amino acid stimulation (Figure 4E). Taken together, the authors should define how PK activation induces specific ATP depletion near the KATP channel and not in the cytoplasm during amino acid stimulation. Also, more clarification on PK-mediated KATP activation is required in particular in relation to the Percival data of this manuscript and differences in ATP/ADP ratio in the amino acid MitoOx conditions (with increased ATP/ADP) compared to glucose-stimulated calcium oscillation MitoOx conditions (with decreased ATP/ADP).</p></disp-quote><p>This seems to be a simple misunderstanding. In agreement with the reviewer, we do not believe that the off-switch is mediated by KATP channel reactivation by PK (see the text above). Although the application of TEPP-46 during Mito<sub>Ox</sub> accelerates KATP channel reopening and reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> (i.e. an “off-switch”; Figure 5b, i), the PK reaction is effectively irreversible so there is no way that the local consumption of ATP by PK in the KATP channel microdomain mediates this effect. In the revised text, we clearly state that the off-switch functions only after KATP channel closure and most likely involves a multi-step process outside of the KATP channel microdomain. Indeed, our findings suggest that the off-switch requires the mitochondrial PEP cycle, since PCK2-βKO islets exhibited prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and fail to efficiently repolarize.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please find below a number of constructive comments to help strengthen the conclusions of the study:</p><p>– The title should be modified to include 'in mice', since the results in their present form are only applicable to mouse β cells.

Since KATP channel closure occurs quickly, we do not know why it takes 3-5 minutes for membrane depolarization, but this timing has been consistently observed by many studies and no satisfying explanation has emerged in the literature. Given that each β-cell is estimated to be coupled to 6 other β-cells by gap junctions, we speculate that the islet behavior reflects the need for first responder cells to overcome the inhibitory conductance from gap junctions. Outside of reporting that PK and the PEP cycle accelerate the time to depolarization (Figure 3), the network behavior of the islet is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Thus, while neither PK isoform is required for AA stimulation to increase ATP/ADPc, PCK2 displays high control strength over ATP/ADPc in response to AA, especially considering that the PCK2 protein was only reduced by about two-thirds (Figure 1d).&quot; Logic of this sentence is unclear.
