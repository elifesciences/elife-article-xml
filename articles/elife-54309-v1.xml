system to study RNA-mediated chromatin changes and epigenetic inheritance. Recent studies have indicated that the regulation and function of nuclear RNAi-mediated heterochromatin are highly complex. Our knowledge of histone modifications and the corresponding histonemodifying enzymes involved in the system remains limited. In this study, we show that the heterochromatin mark, H3K23me3, is induced by nuclear RNAi at both exogenous and endogenous targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In addition, dsRNA-induced H3K23me3 can persist for multiple generations after the dsRNA exposure has stopped. We demonstrate that the histone methyltransferase SET-32, methylates H3K23 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both <italic>set-32</italic> and the germline nuclear RNAi Argonaute, <italic>hrde-1,</italic> are required for nuclear RNAi-induced H3K23me3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data poise H3K23me3 as an additional chromatin modification in the nuclear RNAi pathway and provides the field with a new target for uncovering the role of heterochromatin in transgenerational epigenetic silencing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNAi</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>histone methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>H3K23me</kwd><kwd>nuclear RNAi</kwd><kwd>transgenerational epigenetics</kwd><kwd>H3K9me</kwd><kwd>RNA-mediated chromatin modification</kwd><kwd>heritable silencing</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>LTR retrotransposon</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Sam G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rutgers BuschBiomedical</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Sam G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DCHS19PPC030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz-Orbach</surname><given-names>Lianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.The content is solely the responsibility of the 291 authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>H3K23me3 is a RNAi-mediated transgenerationally heritable heterochromatin mark in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in which small RNAs mediate transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wassenegger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pezic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martienssen and Moazed, 2015</xref>). Nuclear RNAi plays an important role in genome stability and germline development. It is a highly tractable system for the study of RNA-mediated chromatin regulation and epigenetic inheritance.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a number of unique advantages for the study of nuclear RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiser and Kim, 2019</xref>). Genetic screens have identified numerous protein factors involved in this pathway. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, nuclear RNAi relies on the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). In current models, HRDE-1 binds secondary siRNAs and recruits nuclear RNAi factors, including chromatin modifying enzymes and remodeling factors, to genomic sites of RNAi. We and others have characterized over 150 genomic loci in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are de-silenced and/or lose repressive chromatin modifications in nuclear RNAi-deficient mutants, the so-called âendogenous targetsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, nuclear RNAi-mediated silencing can be experimentally triggered at actively transcribed genes by exogenous dsRNA administration or piRNA (âexogenous targetsâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahringer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vastenhouw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>). Silencing at the exogenous targets can persist for multiple generations. Germline nuclear RNAi-deficient mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit several phenotypes, including progressive sterility under heat stress (Mrt phenotype) and large-scale de-silencing and chromatin decompaction at the endogenous targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields and Kennedy, 2019</xref>).</p><p>There are two known nuclear RNAi-induced histone modifications in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: trimethylation at lysine 27 and lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3). The best studied nuclear RNAi-induced histone modification is H3K9me3, however the function of this histone modification in nuclear RNAi remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>). Prior models assumed that the heterochromatin mark was required for transcriptional silencing in nuclear RNAi, but surprisingly, H3K9me3 is not essential for silencing maintenance if HRDE-1 is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodhouse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lev et al., 2019</xref>). By uncovering the histone methyltransferases (HMTs) responsible for each histone modification, we can better understand their function in nuclear RNAi. Two HMTs, MET-2 and SET-25, are suggested to function sequentially for H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). In embryos, MET-2 and SET-25 appear to be the sole contributors of H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>). However, in adults, nuclear RNAi-mediated H3K9me3 is dependent on a third additional HMT, SET-32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spracklin et al., 2017</xref>). While MET-2, SET-25 and SET-32 are all required for the formation of H3K9me3, they are not functionally equivalent. MET-2, but not SET-25, is required for DNA replication stress survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padeken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). SET-25 and SET-32, but not MET-2, are required for the silencing of a piRNA-targeted reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, while MET-2, SET-25, and SET-32 were all dispensable for silencing maintenance in nuclear RNAi, SET-32 and, to a lesser extent, SET-25 are required for silencing establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalinava et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodhouse et al., 2018</xref>). Given SET-32âs unique role in nuclear RNAi, we hypothesized that its biochemical activity may differ from MET-2 and SET-25.</p><p>The chromatin landscape in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is dynamically regulated during both somatic and germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaner and Kelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidoli et al., 2016b</xref>). From the embryonic stage to adulthood, the two most prominently methylated lysines of histone H3 are H3K27 and H3K23, while H3K9me is proportionally much lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vandamme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidoli et al., 2016b</xref>). H3K23me has been suggested as a heterochromatin mark in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vandamme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidoli et al., 2016b</xref>) and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papazyan et al., 2014</xref>) and is involved in DNA damage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papazyan et al., 2014</xref>). In comparison to the two classical heterochromatin marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, H3K23me is poorly studied. Almost all histone lysine methylation is catalyzed by SET-domain containing histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qian and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Husmann and Gozani, 2019</xref>). Although different HMTs share core catalytic motifs in the SET domain, they can target different lysine residues with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Tetrahymena,</italic> the SET-domain containing enzyme, EZL3, is required for H3K23me3 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papazyan et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, loss of SET-32 causes reduced levels of H3K23me1 and H3K23me2 (H3K23me3 was not tested) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodhouse et al., 2018</xref>). No H3K23 HMT has been biochemically validated at the time of this manuscript publication.</p><p>In this paper, we determined that SET-32 is an H3K23 methyltransferase <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that H3K23me3 can be induced by exogenous dsRNA and persists for four generations after the dsRNA exposure has been stopped. H3K23me3 is broadly enriched in <italic>C. elegans</italic> heterochromatic regions, including the endogenous targets of nuclear RNAi. In addition, H3K23me3 at nuclear RNAi targets is dependent on HRDE-1 and SET-32, and, to a lesser extent, MET-2 and SET-25.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SET-32 methylates lysine 23 of histone H3 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine the enzymatic activity of SET-32, we performed histone methyltransferase (HMT) assays using recombinant GST-SET-32 and [3H]-labeled S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

To probe this question, we identified genes with SET-32 or HRDE-1-dependent H3K23me3 profiles.

(2) The genetic requirement of SET-32 for H3K9me3 suggests that H3K23me3 promotes H3K9me3. (3) At some of the endogenous nuclear RNAi targets, H3K9me3 and H3K23me3 appear to be mutually dependent. (4) H3K27me3 is largely independent of H3K9me3 and H3K23me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalinava et al., 2017</xref>).

For the histone mass spectrometry analysis, 150 Âµl reaction mix containing approximately 0.3 ÂµM GST-SET-32, 2.5 ÂµM H3, and 213 ÂµM SAM and 1 x HMT buffer without Triton X-100 was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Histone peptides were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidoli et al., 2016a</xref>). Briefly, histone pellets were resuspended in 20 Î¼L of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.0) plus 5 Âµl of acetonitrile. Derivatization was performed by adding 5 Âµl of propionic anhydride rapidly followed by 16 Âµl of ammonium hydroxide and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was performed twice to ensure complete derivatization of unmodified and monomethylated lysine residues. Samples were then dried, resuspended in 20 Î¼L of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and digested with trypsin (Promega) (enzyme:sample ratioÂ =Â 1:20, 2 hr, room temperature). The derivatization reaction was then performed again twice to derivatize peptide N-termini. Samples were then desalted by using in-house packed stage-tips and dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge.</p><p>Dried samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and injected onto a 75 Âµm ID x 25 cm Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ (3 Âµm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) nano-column packed in-house using a Dionex RSLC nanoHPLC (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA).

The histone H3 peptide KQLATKAAR (aa 18â26) was considered in all possible modified forms (unmodified, me1/2/3). The relative abundance of each form was calculated using the total area under the extracted ion chromatograms of all peptides in all the (un)modified forms and considered that as 100%. To confirm the position of the methylation, we extracted the chromatographic profile of the MS/MS fragment ions and verified that no unique fragment ions belonging to the K18me1/2/3 possible peptide isoforms had detectable intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strain N2 was used as the standard WT strain.

nuclear RNAi factor SET-32 deposits the transgenerational heritable histone modification, H3K23me3&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers are interested in your manuscript and actively discussed that more functional analysis in needed to further substantiate the study regarding the role of H3K23me3 in regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, it was discussed that case inheritance of H3k23me3 is not convincing. It remains possible that small RNAs are inherited and the H3K23me3 in future generations could be a consequence. We therefore encourage you to submit a revised version of the manuscript providing more mechanistic insights in the role of small RNAs in the inheritance of H3K23me3.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In particular, we would like you to provide experimental evidence whether the H3K23me3 is inherited meiotically or re-established at each generation with the help of small RNAs. This could be done, for example by employing HRDE-1 mutants. Also, the physiological role of the H3K23me3 remains unclear. This could be address for example by performing qPCR experiments at the <italic>oma-1</italic> locus after 4 generations. More generally, the phenotype of the embryo lacking SET-32 should be analyzed and discussed.</p><p>The individual reviews are attached below to so that you can see the specific concerns raised by each reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I enjoyed this very interesting paper by Schwartz-Orbach et al. It continues their past work on the involvement of HMTs and other chromatin marks (mostly K9) in silencing and transgenerational RNAi in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. K9 methylations, while originally thought to be crucial for heritable RNAi, are now known to be important only in specific cases (for heritable regulation of specific genes, mostly newly evolved genes, and K9 mutants are largely ok. Chromatin marks, like K9me1/2/3 do play a role in transgenerational RNAi, modulating it and controlling its duration, and this likely involves also interactions with other histone modifications. The discovery presented here, that H3K23me3 (an abundant mark) plays a role in nuclear RNAi, could shed light on the mechanism. The authors provide evidence that their antibody is specific, and that loci which are targeted by endogenous and exogenous small RNAs indeed get modified with the mark. Also, the involvement of SET-32 and HRDE-1 (both play a role but are not completely required) is convincing. I think these are all valuable discoveries that would be interesting to many in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the paper &quot;<italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclear RNAi factor SET-32 deposits the transgenerational heritable histone modification, H3K23me3&quot; the authors use <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model system to study the H3K23me3 epigenetic mark in the germline.</p><p>The current work in <italic>eLife</italic> from Sam Gu lab is really timing and potentially could increase our understanding of H3K23me3, its role in the transgenerational inheritance of repressive epigenetic states and its role in the phenomenon of RNAi. Although the paper is very sound, there are some major points below that need to be addressed and that are required to strengthen the paper for a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>From their study, it is clear that SET-32 methylation activity is toward H3K23 and that the appearance of H3K23me3 relies upon exogenous dsRNA. Despite the authors show in Figure 2B that the levels of H3K23me3 seems higher than H3K9me3 (after 4 generations), I believe this is not very convincing and I would rather interpret from their plot that H3K23me3 behave very similarly to H3K9me3 (upon normalisation). This data should be validated by qChIP, just on this locus.</p><p>The authors should also tag SET-32 so that to perform ChIP-seq and also IP from whole embryo with subsequent mass spec, trying to identify the protein complex containing SET-32.</p><p>The paper also lacks some more functional studies. The authors should deplete/ or make a catalytic dead of SET-32 and study the phenotype of the worms. Moreover, in this mutant background the authors should study the transcriptional effect/defect on exogenous and endogenous RNAi depended sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is quite an interesting study that characterises SET-32 as an H3K23me3 histone methyl transferase and links this under-studied histone modification to the nuclear RNAi pathway and heterochromatin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>What is missing is any convincing insight into the role of H3K23me3 in the nuclear RNAi pathway or gene repression. Therefore, the speculations in the discussion trying to link published SET-32 phenotypes to the role of H3K23me3 in the establishment or maintenance of nuclear RNAi mediated silencing are very vague. Otherwise the overall quality of the study seems to be good.</p><p>Sometimes the statements in the text do not reflect the data (e.g. ChIP data profiles subsection â<italic>set-32</italic> and <italic>hrde-1</italic> are required for nuclear RNAi-induced H3K23me3â. vs Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is hard to untangle the SET-32 H3K23 and H3K9 HMT activity â one possibility would be to create mutants that lack one or the other HMT activity. Also, site-specific (e.g. <italic>oma-1</italic> locus) demethylation of H3K9me3 by Cas9-based epigenome editing. Both approaches are however probably out of scope for this study. <italic>set-32</italic> mutants still show H3K23me3 marks, which speaks for the presence of additional and unknown H3K23me3 HMT(s), making functional insights even more challenging to obtain. RNA expression data to accompany the multigenerational ChIP profiles at the <italic>oma-1</italic> locus (Figure 2B). This would reveal whether there is still a significant repression at the F4 generation when H3K9me seems to be reduced to background levels, but H3K23me3 still shows a (small) peak.</p><p>Figure 4B does not appear to be a very representative locus to show given the genome-wide data but rather one that matches the prior hypothesis.</p><p>The exact definitions of GRH and GRTS genes need to be given in the methods.</p><p>Subsection âH3K23me3 is a heterochromatic mark in <italic>C. elegansâ</italic>. referring to Figure 3A: there is similarity between H3K9me3 and H3K23me3; however, such similarity is not present between H3K9me3 and H3K23me2 as stated by the author. Similarity on different chromosomes (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1) also shows a very weak correlation between H3K9me3 and H3K23me3 at Chr III.</p><p>Subsection âH3K23me3 is a heterochromatic mark in <italic>C. elegansâ</italic> states that H3K23me1 is uniformly distributed (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1) but it looks like H3K23me2 distribution across the genome is just as uniform and doesn't cluster at the constitutive heterochromatic regions as H3K23me3 or H3K9me3.</p><p>These results and distributions all need quantifying.</p><p>Results section: There is no reference to Figure 4B in the text (endogenous <italic>hrde-1</italic> target).</p><p>Results section: Figure 4 should be renamed Figure 4C-G as these represent the genome-wide data mentioned in the sentence.</p><p>Results section: Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 shows slightly stronger H3K9me3 reduction in regions of germline nuclear RNAi-mediated heterochromatin (GRH). However, regions of germline nuclear RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing (GRTS) show even a stronger depletion of H3K9me3 in <italic>set-32</italic> mutants compared to <italic>met-2 set-25</italic> double mutants. This is not in line with the statement of the author &quot;As in published works, we found that H3K9me3 has a larger requirement of MET-2 and SET-25 than SET-32&quot; and the conclusion that this further supports different functions of SET-32 and MET-2/SET-25.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclear RNAi factor SET-32 deposits the transgenerational heritable histone modification, H3K23me3&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Reviewers are overall supportive and also sympathetic about the circumstances based on which some of the additional key experiments could not be performed. However, since you have not addressed the most significant concerns of the reviewers, namely that the multi-generation 'inheritance' of H3K23me3 may be a secondary consequence of the transmission of small RNAs or other histone modifications and the lack of 'function' for H3K23me3. The title and associated text need to be toned down.</p><p>Furthermore, please explicitly state (Figure legend and text) where experiments are performed without biological replicates and tone down the strength of the conclusions. For example, as pointed out by reviewer#2: &quot;These findings indicate that the regulation of H3K23me3 at nuclear RNAi targets is complex, and likely to involve other HMTs&quot;, as this cannot be concluded based on experiments lacking biological replicates and therefore not being quantitative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I didn't have too many issues with the original submission and the few questions that I had have been answered in the revision process.

However, I do think this is an interesting body of work.</p><p>For the reasons stated in the original reviews, I think the title has the potential to be misleading to a general audience: 'transgenerational heritable histone modification' is a strong statement and something that has not been directly demonstrated and I think this should be toned down.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54309.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In particular, we would like you to provide experimental evidence whether the H3K23me3 is inherited meiotically or re-established at each generation with the help of small RNAs.

We have updated the text to reflect these findings.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have addressed some major concerns and the paper could be accepted for publication.</p><p>I, though, noticed that many ChIP experiments do not have biological replicates.</p><p>This is especially relevant the second paragraph of subsection âset-32 and hrde-1 are required for nuclear RNAi-induced H3K23me3â; where the authors try to understand the loss of H3K23me3 in different mutant backgrounds.</p><p>I suggest to remove from this paragraph the sentence &quot; These findings indicate that the regulation of H3K23me3 at nuclear RNAi targets is complex, and likely to involve other HMTs.&quot;, as this cannot be concluded based on experiments lacking biological replicates and therefore not being quantitative. The authors should also mention in the figure legends the number of biological replicates for each experiment, each time, as otherwise for the reader it is hard to find this info.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in both the Materials and methods section, supplementary files and figure legends. For example, we made a new subsection âChIP-seq replicatesâ listing the number of replicates for each experiment. For most experiments there are at least two biological replicates. For <italic>oma-1</italic> heritable RNAi there is only 1 replicate and for H3K23me2 and H3K23me1 there is only one replicate for each experiment. All the rest have two to three replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Unfortunately the authors have not been able to definitively address the most important referee concerns â that the multi-generation 'inheritance' of H3K23me3 may be a secondary consequence of the transmission of small RNAs or other histone modifications and the lack of 'function' for H3K23me3. However, I do think this is an interesting body of work.</p><p>For the reasons stated in the original reviews, I think the title has the potential to be misleading to a general audience: 'transgenerational heritable histone modification' is a strong statement and something that has not been directly demonstrated and I think this should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that at this point we do not know the mechanism by which dsRNA-induced H3K23me3 persists in the later generations. We have changed our language to reflect this. We no longer use the phrase âtransgenerationally inheritedâ. In the revised manuscript, we replaced it with either âtransgenerational epigenetic effectâ or âtransgenerational histone modificationâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
