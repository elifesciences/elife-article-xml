mitosis, including kinetochores and the spindle midzone. In traditional model eukaryotes such as yeasts and humans, the CPC consists of the catalytic subunit Aurora B kinase, its activator INCENP, and the localization module proteins Borealin and Survivin. Intriguingly, Aurora B and INCENP as well as their localization pattern are conserved in kinetoplastids, an evolutionarily divergent group of eukaryotes that possess unique kinetochore proteins and lack homologs of Borealin or Survivin. It is not understood how the kinetoplastid CPC assembles nor how it is targeted to its subcellular destinations during the cell cycle. Here, we identify two orphan kinesins, KIN-A and KIN-B, as bona fide CPC proteins in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the kinetoplastid parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. KIN-A and KIN-B form a scaffold for the assembly of the remaining CPC subunits. We show that the C-terminal unstructured tail of KIN-A interacts with the KKT8 complex at kinetochores, while its N-terminal motor domain promotes CPC translocation to spindle microtubules. Thus, the KIN-A:KIN-B complex constitutes a unique ‘two-in-one’ CPC localization module, which directs the CPC to kinetochores from S phase until metaphase and to the central spindle in anaphase. Our findings highlight the evolutionary diversity of CPC proteins and raise the possibility that kinesins may have served as the original transport vehicles for Aurora kinases in early eukaryotes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic></kwd><kwd>kinetoplastid</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>chromosomal passenger complex</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Berrow Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballmer</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/210622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akiyoshi</surname><given-names>Bungo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>227243/Z/23/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akiyoshi</surname><given-names>Bungo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/203149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akiyoshi</surname><given-names>Bungo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The Aurora B kinase is a key mitotic regulator widely conserved among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hochegger et al., 2013</xref>). It undergoes dynamic localization changes throughout mitosis to enable the spatially restricted phosphorylation of substrates involved in chromosome alignment, chromosome bi-orientation, spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling, and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carmena et al., 2012</xref>). In early mitosis, Aurora B is first detected on chromosome arms and during prometaphase becomes enriched at centromeres, where it destabilizes incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</xref>). Upon anaphase onset, Aurora B translocates to the spindle midzone, and during cytokinesis associates with the equatorial cortex to regulate cell abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooke et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Trivedi and Stukenberg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic localization pattern of the Aurora B kinase is in part achieved through its association with a scaffold comprised of <underline>in</underline>ner <underline>cen</underline>tromere <underline>p</underline>rotein (INCENP), Borealin, and Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gassmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sampath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vader et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wheatley et al., 2001</xref>). Together, these proteins form a tetrameric complex referred to as the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). The CPC can be partitioned into two functional modules: The ‘catalytic module’ and the ‘localization module’. The catalytic module is composed of Aurora B in complex with the IN-box at the INCENP C-terminus, which is required for full activation of the Aurora B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop and Schumacher, 2002</xref>). The localization module comprises Borealin, Survivin, and the N-terminus of INCENP, which are connected to one another via a three-helical bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jeyaprakash et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeyaprakash et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klein et al., 2006</xref>). The two modules are linked by the central region of INCENP, composed of an intrinsically disordered domain and a <underline>s</underline>ingle <underline>a</underline>lpha <underline>h</underline>elical (SAH) domain. INCENP harbors microtubule-binding domains within the N-terminus and the central SAH domain, which play key roles for CPC localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cormier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mackay et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nakajima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Noujaim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Samejima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">van der Horst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wheatley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wheelock et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, recruitment of the CPC to centromeric chromatin depends on two pathways, involving the Haspin and Bub1 kinases. Haspin phosphorylates histone H3 on Thr3 (H3T3ph), which is recognized by the <underline>b</underline>aculovirus <underline>I</underline>AP <underline>r</underline>epeat (BIR) domain of Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). H3T3ph is initially found along the entire length of chromosomes between sister chromatids but becomes enriched at the inner centromere (the space between sister kinetochores) during late prophase. In contrast, the kinetochore-associated Bub1 kinase phosphorylates histone H2A on Thr120 (H2AT120ph) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>). H2AT120ph recruits Shugoshin-like proteins (Sgo1 and Sgo2), which in turn are bound by Borealin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tsukahara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamagishi et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, Sgo1 has also been demonstrated to interact with the BIR domain of Survivin through an N-terminal histone H3-like motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jeyaprakash et al., 2011</xref>). The interactions of Borealin and Survivin with Sgo1 form the basis for a kinetochore-proximal pool of the CPC which is distinct from the inner centromere pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Broad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hadders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In most studied eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans, kinetochore assembly is scaffolded by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allshire and Karpen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Black and Cleveland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hori and Fukagawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Maddox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Westhorpe and Straight, 2013</xref>). An assembly of inner kinetochore protein complexes, referred to as the constitutive centromere-associated network, interacts with centromeric CENP-A chromatin throughout the cell cycle and provides a platform for recruitment of the outer kinetochore KNL1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex network that has microtubule-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). Some of these kinetochore proteins are present in nearly all sequenced eukaryotes, suggesting that key principles of chromosome segregation are widely shared among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Drinnenberg and Akiyoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Hooff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meraldi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tromer et al., 2019</xref>). However, a unique set of kinetochore proteins (KKT1–20, KKT22–25, KKIP1–12) are present in kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brusini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Archivio and Wickstead, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nerusheva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nerusheva and Akiyoshi, 2016</xref>), a group of flagellated protists that are highly divergent from commonly studied eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavalier-Smith, 2010</xref>). <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. are causative agents of African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis, respectively, and as such pose a serious threat to public health and prosperity across the tropics and subtropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stuart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">WHO, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite the absence of canonical kinetochore components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berriman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lowell and Cross, 2004</xref>), Aurora kinases are conserved in kinetoplastids. Early studies suggested that the Aurora B homolog (Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>) in <italic>T. brucei</italic> forms a complex with <underline>c</underline>hromosomal <underline>p</underline>assenger <underline>c</underline>omplex proteins 1 and 2 (CPC1 and CPC2) and plays a crucial role in mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tu et al., 2006</xref>). CPC1 was later found to be a divergent INCENP homolog (hereafter referred to as INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>) based on the presence of a conserved C-terminal IN-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). However, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> lacks the central SAH domain and N-terminal residues, which in other eukaryotes interact with Survivin and Borealin. In addition, two orphan kinesins, KIN-A and KIN-B, have been proposed to transiently associate with Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Although homologs of the ‘localization module’ proteins Survivin and Borealin have not been identified in kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Komaki et al., 2022</xref>), the trypanosome CPC displays a dynamic localization pattern similar to that of the metazoan CPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>): Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, and CPC2 localize to kinetochores in early mitosis and then translocate to the central spindle upon anaphase onset. From late anaphase onward, an additional population of CPC proteins is detectable at the tip of the new flagellum attachment zone (FAZ), the point of cytokinesis initiation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. It is presently not understood how the CPC assembles in these evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes nor how its localization dynamics are regulated during the cell cycle.</p><p>Here, by combining biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches in procyclic form <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we show that the trypanosome CPC is a pentameric complex comprising Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, CPC2, and the two orphan kinesins KIN-A and KIN-B. KIN-A and KIN-B interact via their coiled-coil domains to form a subcomplex within the CPC, which serves as a scaffold for the catalytic module (Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> + INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>). The C-terminal unstructured tail of KIN-A directs kinetochore localization of the CPC from S phase to metaphase, while the N-terminal motor domain promotes the central spindle enrichment in anaphase. Furthermore, we identify the KKT7-KKT8 complex pathway as the main kinetochore recruitment arm of the trypanosome CPC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KIN-A and KIN-B are bona fide CPC proteins in trypanosomes</title><p>To identify additional interactors of the CPC in trypanosomes, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of endogenously YFP-tagged Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>).

To our surprise, KIN-A-YFP and GFP-KIN-B exhibited a CPC-like localization pattern similar to that of Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>: Both kinesins localized to kinetochores from S phase to metaphase, and then translocated to the central spindle in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Moreover, like Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, a population of KIN-A and KIN-B localized at the new FAZ tip from late anaphase onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). This was unexpected, because KIN-A and KIN-B were previously reported to localize to the spindle but not to kinetochores or the new FAZ tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>).

In addition, KIN-A has a long, disordered C-terminal tail (see below). Unlike full-length KIN-B, KIN-B<sup>2-316</sup> (inactive motor domain) failed to enrich at kinetochores and was instead found in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). KIN-A<sup>2-309</sup> (motor domain) was also primarily detected in the nucleolus, although we observed additional spindle and weak kinetochore-like signal in some metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). By contrast, both KIN-A<sup>310-862</sup> (coiled-coil domain+C-terminal disordered tail) and KIN-B<sup>317-624</sup> (coiled-coil domain) clearly localized to kinetochores from S phase to metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Weak anaphase kinetochore signal was also detectable for KIN-B<sup>317-624</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). GFP fusions of the central coiled-coil domain or the C-terminal disordered tail of KIN-A did not localize to kinetochores (data not shown). These results show that kinetochore localization of the CPC is mediated by KIN-A and KIN-B and requires both the central coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal disordered tail of KIN-A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural model of the trypanosome CPC</title><p>To gain structural insights into the trypanosome CPC, we used AlphaFold2 (AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>) to predict the overall structure of the trypanosome CPC by testing combinations of full-length Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, CPC2, KIN-A, and KIN-B, and truncations thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). AF2 confidently predicted parallel coiled coils between KIN-A and KIN-B, with the main region of interaction contained within the central region of KIN-A (residues ~310–550) and the C-terminal region of KIN-B (residues ~320–580). The C-terminal tail (residues ~550–862) of KIN-A is predicted to be intrinsically disordered (pLDDT scores &lt;20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The first ~55 residues of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, predicted to form two α-helices (residues ~7–20 and ~36–55), interact with the coiled coils of KIN-A:KIN-B in close proximity to the kinesin motors. A flexible central linker in INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> bridges the N-terminus of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> and the catalytic module of the CPC (Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> + INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> IN-box). Similarly to INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, an N-terminal α-helical region in CPC2 (residues ~19–75) interacts with the KIN-A:KIN-B coiled coils immediately downstream of the INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> binding site. Consistent with these predictions, GFP-tagged INCENP<sup>CPC1 2-147</sup> or CPC2<sup>2-120</sup> displayed normal localization dynamics indistinguishable from the corresponding full-length constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F, H, I</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal domains of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> or CPC2 impaired kinetochore localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> forms a subcomplex with the C-terminus of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, and that INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> and CPC2 interact with the coiled-coil domain of KIN-A:KIN-B via their N-terminal domains.</p><p>To validate these findings biochemically, we performed bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) crosslinking of native CPC complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation of endogenously tagged YFP-Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> from cells arrested prior to anaphase, followed by mass spectrometry analysis (IP-CLMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Indeed, our IP-CLMS data revealed high-score crosslinks between the predicted coiled-coil domains of KIN-A and KIN-B, suggesting that the two kinesins form a parallel heterodimer. As expected, Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> formed contacts with the C-terminal IN-box of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, consistent with these two proteins constituting the catalytic module of the CPC. The N-terminal region of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> interacted mainly with KIN-B and to a lesser degree with KIN-A, with most contacts confined to the N-terminal ends of the predicted coiled-coil domains of the kinesins close to their motor domains. The N-terminus of CPC2, on the other hand, formed crosslinks with the coiled-coil domain of KIN-A. We used PyXlinkViewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schiffrin et al., 2020</xref>) to map our IP-CLMS data onto the assembled AF2 model of the trypanosome CPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using a Euclidean distance cut-off of 30 Å, ~85% of crosslinks were compatible with the model, providing confidence in the AF2 predictions. The few crosslinks that violated the distance constraints mainly represent intra-protein contacts between the INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> N- and C-terminal domains or inter-protein contacts between the INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> C-terminal domain and the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A. The central domain of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> is predicted to be unstructured (pLDDT scores &lt;20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and may act as a flexible linker, permitting multiple orientations of the catalytic module relative to the KIN-A:KIN-B scaffold. Taken together, these data indicate that KIN-A and KIN-B interact via their coiled-coil domains, which serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the remaining CPC subunits.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural model of the trypanosome chromosomal passenger complex (CPC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circular view of the bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>) crosslinks observed between the subunits of the trypanosome CPC, obtained from native complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation of YFP-Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> (cell line: BAP2198). pLink2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) was used to obtain crosslinks from mass spectrometry data. xiView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Graham et al., 2019</xref>) was used for data visualization.

To validate these findings, we co-expressed combinations of 6HIS-KKT8, KKT9, KKT11, and KKT12 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and performed metal affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). 6HIS-KKT8 efficiently pulled down KKT9, KKT11, and KKT12, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020</xref>). In the absence of KKT9, 6HIS-KKT8 still pulled down KKT11 and KKT12. Removal of either KKT9 or KKT11 did not impact formation of the KKT8:KKT12 subcomplex. In contrast, 6HIS-KKT8 could not be recovered without KKT12, indicating that KKT12 is required for the formation of the full KKT8 complex. These results support the idea that the KKT8 complex consists of KKT8:KKT12 and KKT9:KKT11 subcomplexes. The two subcomplexes appear to be connected to each other through interactions between the C-terminal region of the KKT8:KKT12 coiled coils and the C-terminus of KKT11. Two alpha helices in KKT7<sup>2-261</sup> (residues ~149–181) are predicted to interact with KKT9:KKT11. Using a distance cut-off of 30 Å, ~70% of crosslinks were compatible with the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Of the crosslinks that failed to meet the distance criteria, ~90% involved unstructured regions within KKT7 or the C-terminal tail of KKT8. Collectively, our results reveal that KKT7 recruits the KKT8 complex through interaction with the KKT9:KKT11 subcomplex.</p><p>We next examined the localization dependency of KKT8 complex components in cells. Using RNAi constructs against individual subunits of the KKT8 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marcianò et al., 2021</xref>), we assessed localization of endogenously YFP-tagged KKT8, KKT9, and KKT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). We found that knockdown of any subunit of the KKT8 complex affected protein levels and kinetochore localization of the other subunits, indicating that presence of all subunits is required to stabilize the full complex. YFP-KKT9 was least affected and was still detectable at kinetochores in ~50% of cells depleted of KKT8, KKT11, or KKT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, KKT9:KKT11 may lie upstream of KKT8:KKT12. Indeed our IP-CLMS data suggest that the KKT9:KKT11 subcomplex directly interacts with the N-terminus of KKT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). KKT7 also formed robust crosslinks with the KKT10/19 kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), supporting our previous finding that KKT7 and KKT10 form a stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the KKT7-KKT8 complex pathway serves as the main CPC recruitment arm in trypanosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The KIN-A C-terminal tail interacts with the KKT8 complex through a conserved domain</title><p>By IP-CLMS we failed to detect reliable crosslinks between the CPC and the KKT7-KKT8 complex or other kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This suggests that the IP-CLMS approach, although well suited for characterizing stable protein complexes, may not be sensitive enough to detect transient or lower affinity interactions. To overcome this, we used AF2 to probe for potential interactions between the KKT8 complex and chromosomal passenger subunits or (sub)complexes. AF2 did not predict interactions between the KKT8 complex and INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, CPC2, or KIN-B (data not shown). Intriguingly, AF2 predicted with high confidence interactions between KKT9:KKT11 and a conserved region (residues ~722–741) within the KIN-A C-terminal tail, which we termed <underline>c</underline>onserved <underline>d</underline>omain 1 (CD1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2A</xref>). This interaction involves a triple helix composed of KIN-A CD1, KKT9, and KKT11 in a region close to the KKT7-binding site. pLDDT scores improved significantly for KIN-A CD1 in complex with KKT9:KKT11 (&gt;80) compared to KIN-A CD1 alone (~20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that CD1 forms a helical structure upon binding to KKT9:KKT11. Sequence alignment revealed the presence of a second conserved domain (residues ~816–862) within the C-terminal tail of KIN-A, hereafter referred to as CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess the contributions of CD1 and CD2 for kinetochore recruitment of KIN-A in vivo, we ectopically expressed GFP fusions of the central coiled coils and C-terminal tail of KIN-A (residues ~310–862) lacking either CD1, CD2, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>).

We were unable to obtain a rescue cell line lacking both CD1 and CD2 as the double-mutant protein was not properly expressed.

KIN-A<sup>∆CD1</sup>-YFP was detectable at kinetochores in G2 but predominantly localized to the mitotic spindle from (pro)metaphase onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>), indicating that removal of CD1 severely weakens the affinity of KIN-A for kinetochores and instead shifts the balance toward microtubule binding. Interestingly, expression of KIN-A<sup>∆CD1</sup>-YFP similarly affected the localization of Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

Central spindle localization of KIN-A in anaphase was unaffected by deletion of either CD1 or CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Remarkably, despite a substantial loss of Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> from kinetochores in metaphase, ∆CD1 cells exhibited normal cell cycle profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2H</xref>) and showed only a modest decrease in proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

In mammalian cells, dephosphorylation of INCENP and the kinesin MKLP2 upon anaphase onset allows formation of a transient CPC-MKLP2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gruneberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hümmer and Mayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kitagawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Serena et al., 2020</xref>). MKLP2 activity then drives plus-directed movement of this complex along microtubules of the anaphase spindle. We therefore speculated that anaphase translocation of the kinetoplastid CPC to the central spindle may involve the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A. KIN-B is unlikely to be a functional kinesin based on the absence of several well-conserved residues and motifs within the motor domain, which are fully present in KIN-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>). These include the P-loop, switch I and switch II motifs, which form the nucleotide-binding cleft, and many conserved residues within the α4-L12 elements, which interact with tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Endow et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, the motor domain of KIN-B, contrary to KIN-A, failed to localize to the mitotic spindle when expressed ectopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and did not co-sediment with microtubules in our in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Ectopically expressed GFP-KIN-A and -KIN-A<sup>2-309</sup> partially localized to the mitotic spindle but failed to concentrate at the midzone during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), suggesting that N-terminal tagging of the KIN-A motor domain may interfere with its function. To address whether the ATPase activity of KIN-A is required for central spindle localization of the CPC, we replaced one allele of KIN-A with a C-terminally YFP-tagged G210A ATP hydrolysis-defective rigor mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rice et al., 1999</xref>) and used an RNAi construct directed against the 3’UTR of KIN-A to deplete the untagged allele. The rigor mutation did not affect recruitment of KIN-A to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). However, KIN-A<sup>G210A</sup>-YFP-marked kinetochores were misaligned in ~50% of cells arrested in metaphase, suggesting that ATPase activity of KIN-A promotes chromosome congression to the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>). In anaphase, the KIN-A rigor mutant failed to concentrate at the central spindle and instead widely decorated the mitotic spindle, with increased signal observed at spindle poles likely due to poleward flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Importantly, expression of the KIN-A<sup>G210A</sup> rigor mutant prevented Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> from translocating to the central spindle and caused lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). The KIN-A rigor mutation also slowed cell proliferation even in the presence of wild-type protein and caused accumulation of cells in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>).

Homologs of the CPC proteins Aurora B kinase and its associated partner INCENP have been detected in almost all sequenced eukaryotes, including kinetoplastids. The dynamic localization pattern exhibited by the CPC (e.g. transferring from centromeres to the central spindle upon metaphase-anaphase transition) is likewise highly conserved across eukaryotes but appears to be achieved through a variety of different mechanisms. For instance, while CPC recruitment to the centromeres in higher eukaryotes is governed by two histone phosphorylation marks (Haspin-mediated H3T3ph and Bub1-mediated H2AT120ph), budding yeasts employ a combination of histone modifications (Bub1-mediated H2AT121ph) and kinetochore proteins as CPC receptors. Borealin<sup>Bir1</sup> not only recognizes Sgo1 but also interacts with the CBF3 complex through Ndc10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cho and Harrison, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yoon and Carbon, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, INCENP<sup>Sli15</sup>/Aurora B<sup>Ipl1</sup> interact with the Ctf19 subunit of the COMA complex at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fischböck-Halwachs et al., 2019</xref>). The proteins that form the localization module of the CPC in different species appear to mirror the diversity in centromeric CPC receptors. In fact, many phyla lack Borealin or Survivin homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Komaki et al., 2022</xref>). Komaki et al. recently identified two functionally redundant CPC proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Borealin Related Interactor 1 and 2, which engage in a triple helix bundle with INCENP and Borealin using a conserved helical domain, but employ an FHA domain instead of a BIR domain to read H3T3ph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Komaki et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have identified KIN-A and KIN-B as components of the CPC in trypanosomes, and delineated a novel pathway for centromeric recruitment of the CPC in this evolutionary divergent group of eukaryotes. In agreement with our work, an early study on the CPC in <italic>T. brucei</italic> found that KIN-A and KIN-B co-purified with Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, and CPC2 based on a pull-down of an Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>-PTP fusion protein followed by mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2008</xref>). However, HA-tagged KIN-A and KIN-B were not detected at kinetochores (from late interphase until metaphase) nor at the new FAZ tip (from late anaphase), and hence were not interpreted as CPC proteins. Contrary to this report, our data clearly show that KIN-A and KIN-B are constitutive components of the CPC in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. First, YFP-tagged KIN-A and KIN-B co-localize with Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup>, INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, and CPC2 throughout the cell cycle. Second, KIN-A and KIN-B are readily detected within native CPC complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation of CPC subunits from cells arrested prior to anaphase and form robust crosslinks with the other CPC subunits. Finally, YFP-Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> and INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>-YFP are crucially dependent on KIN-A and KIN-B for localizing both to kinetochores from S phase until metaphase and to the central spindle in anaphase. Thus, the KIN-A:KIN-B subcomplex represents the localization module of the trypanosome CPC.</p><p>Biochemical, cell biological, and in silico modeling approaches indicate that the kinesins KIN-A and KIN-B form coiled coils between their central and C-terminal domains, respectively, which then serve as a scaffold onto which INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> and CPC2 assemble via their N-terminal α-helical domains. The catalytic module of the trypanosomes CPC, consisting of Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> bound to the C-terminal IN-box of INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>, is connected to the KIN-A:KIN-B scaffold through a flexible linker in INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup>. While our on-beads crosslinking of native CPCs suggests that the catalytic module is positioned in close proximity to the kinesin heads, this may not necessarily be true in vivo. For example, the catalytic module may exist in both ‘locked’ and ‘open’ conformations with regard to its association with the kinesin motor domains. We speculate that the interaction of the KIN-A motor domain with microtubules from prometaphase onward may cause the catalytic module to disengage from its kinesin head-associated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In analogy to the SAH domain of INCENP in other model eukaryotes which has been proposed to function as a dog leash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Samejima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</xref>), the INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> flexible linker in trypanosomes (~100 amino acids long) may then permit Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> to roam across a larger but nevertheless spatially constrained target area to phosphorylate its substrates while still being anchored to the kinetochore via KIN-A:KIN-B, which can interact both with kinetochore components and spindle microtubules. Importantly, this mechanism would allow the CPC to act as an intrinsic ‘sensor’ of KT-MT attachments. Such models dealing with alternative conformations of the CPC in various cellular context will require further testing in the future.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) localization and function in trypanosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KIN-A (magenta) and KIN-B (yellow) interact via their coiled-coil domains and form a scaffold for the assembly of CPC2 (cyan) and the catalytic module of the CPC, composed of Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> (red) and INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> (green). During interphase, the catalytic module is positioned close to the kinesin head domains of KIN-A and KIN-B. CPC recruitment to the inner kinetochore is mediated through multiple weak interactions between the C-terminal unstructured tail of KIN-A, containing CD1 and CD2, with the coiled-coil domain of KKT9:KKT11 (dark blue:light blue) and possibly the N-terminus of KKT7 (blue). The KKT8 complex, comprising KKT9:KKT11 and KKT8:KKT12 (dark gray:light gray) subcomplexes, is connected to other kinetochore proteins through KKT7. Additional kinetochore targeting domains of the CPC may reside within the C-terminus of KIN-B and/or CPC2. We propose that the KIN-A:KIN-B subcomplex represents the main localization module of the trypanosome CPC. As illustrated in (<bold>B</bold>), the affinity of the KIN-A C-terminal tail for its receptor(s) at the kinetochore may be further modulated through phosphorylation by the CDK1 homolog CRK3 and the Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> kinase itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballmer et al., 2024</xref>). Interaction of the N-terminal motor domain of KIN-A with spindle microtubules (MTs) from prometaphase onward causes the catalytic module to disengage from its kinesin head-associated state. The ~100 amino acid long flexible linker within INCENP<sup>CPC1</sup> would then permit Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> to phosphorylate its substrates within a larger but nevertheless spatially constrained target area while still being anchored to the kinetochore via KIN-A:KIN-B. The motor domain of KIN-A could thus act as built-in sensor for KT-MT attachments. (<bold>C</bold>) We propose that the trypanosome CPC is recruited to kinetochores via the KKT7-KKT8 complex pathway (dashed arrow) and that motor activity of KIN-A promotes congression of kinetochores to the metaphase plate during early mitosis. The KKT8 complex dissociates from kinetochores at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and is possibly degraded in an APC/C-dependent manner. Elimination of the KKT8 complex, the primary kinetochore receptor of the CPC, coupled to microtubule (MT) binding and motor activity of the KIN-A motor domain strips the CPC off kinetochores and facilitates its translocation to the central spindle in anaphase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93522-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We propose that multiple weak interactions of the KIN-A C-terminal unstructured tail with kinetochore components act in synergy to stabilize the CPC at kinetochores. Critically, these interactions need to be of transient and reversible nature to permit the dynamic release of the CPC upon anaphase onset. Three mechanisms are likely to play a role in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, removal of the KKT8 complex (the ‘CD1 receptor’) at the metaphase-anaphase transition effectively eliminates one of the key CPC-kinetochore interfaces. Second, the affinity of the KIN-A C-terminal tail for its binding partners at the kinetochore may be further fine-tuned through reversible post-translational modifications. In support of this, the KIN-A C-terminal tail harbors many putative CRK3 sites (10 sites matching the minimal S/T-P consensus motif for CDKs) and is also heavily phosphorylated by Aurora B<sup>AUK1</sup> in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballmer et al., 2024</xref>). Finally, we speculate that the interaction of the KIN-A motor domain with microtubules, coupled to the force generating ATP hydrolysis and possibly plus-end-directed motion, eventually outcompetes the weakened interactions of the CPC with the kinetochore and facilitates the extraction of the CPC from chromosomes onto spindle microtubules during anaphase. Indeed, deletion of the KIN-A motor domain or impairment of its motor function through N-terminal GFP tagging causes the CPC to be trapped at kinetochores in anaphase. Central spindle localization is additionally dependent on the ATPase activity of the KIN-A motor domain as illustrated by the KIN-A rigor mutant.</p><p>It remains to be investigated whether KIN-A functions as a plus-end-directed motor. The role of the KIN-B in this context is equally unclear. Because KIN-B does not possess a functional kinesin motor domain, we deem it unlikely that the KIN-A:KIN-B heterodimer moves hand-over-hand along microtubules as do conventional (kinesin-1 family) kinesins. Rather, the KIN-A motor domain may function as a single-headed unit and drive processive plus-end-directed motion using a mechanism similar to the kinesin-3 family kinesin KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</xref>). Formation of transient complexes between the CPC and kinesins or other microtubule plus-end tracking proteins upon anaphase onset appears to be a common theme underlying the central spindle translocation of the CPC. For instance, the CPC interacts with MKLP2 or Bim1<sup>EB1</sup> in human and yeast cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gruneberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zimniak et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, a deeper understanding of CPC regulation in trypanosomes is bound to provide evolutionary insights into fundamental principles of chromosome segregation in eukaryotes and can lead to the discovery of druggable targets to combat kinetoplastid diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saldivia et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>All primers, plasmids, bacmids, and synthetic DNA used in this study as well as their source or construction details are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Proteins were purified and eluted from TALON beads as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Llauró et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown in 2xTY media at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼0.8, at which point protein expression was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG, and then incubated overnight at 20°C. Cells were pelleted at 3400×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C and pellets were resuspended in P500 buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml E-64, 0.4 mM PMSF) and 1 mM TCEP, and were sonicated on ice. Lysates were treated with benzonase nuclease (500 U/1 l culture) and spun at 48,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min. Supernatant was incubated with TALON beads (Takara Clontech) for 1 hr at 4°C, rotating.

The business end of the CPC is Aurora B and its allosteric activation module IN-box, which is located at the C-terminus of INCENP. In most well-studied eukaryotic species, Aurora B activity is locally controlled by the localization module of the CPC, Survivin, Borealin and the N-terminal portion of INCENP. Survivin and Borealin, which bind the N-terminus of INCENP, recognize histone residues that are specifically phosphorylated in mitosis, while anaphase spindle midzone localization is supported by the direct microtubule-binding capacity of the SAH (single alpha helix) domain of INCENP and other microtubule-binding proteins that specifically interact with INCENP during anaphase, which are under the regulation of CDK activity. One of these examples includes the kinesin-like protein MKLP2 in vertebrates. Trypanosoma is an evolutionarily interesting species to study mitosis since its kinetochore and centromere proteins do not show any similarity to other major branches of eukaryotes, while orthologs of Aurora B and INCENP have been identified. Combining molecular genetics, imaging, biochemistry, cross-linking IP-MS (IP-CLMS), and structural modeling, this manuscript reveals that two orphan kinesin-like proteins KIN-A and KIN-B act as localization modules of the CPC in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. The IP-CLMS, AlphaFold2 structural predictions, and domain deletion analysis support the idea that (1) KIN-A and KIN-B form a heterodimer via their coiled-coil domains, (2) Two alpha helices of INCENP interact with the coiled-coil of the KIN-A-KIN-B heterodimer, (3) conserved KIN-A C-terminal CD1 and CD2 interact with the heterodimeric KKT9-KKT11 complex, which is a submodule of the KKT7-KKT8 kinetochore complex composed of KKT7, KKT8, KKT9, KKT11, and KKT12 unique to Trypanosoma, (4) KIN-A and KIN-B coiled-coil domains and the KKT7-KKT8 complex are required for CPC localization at the centromere, (5) CD1 and CD2 domains of KIN-A support its centromere localization. The authors further introduced a KIN-A rigor mutant and knocked-down wild-type KIN-A to show that the ATPase activity of KIN-A seems dispensable for centromere targeting but critical for spindle midzone enrichment of the CPC. The imaging data of the KIN-A rigor mutant suggest that dynamic KIN-A-microtubule interaction is required for metaphase alignment of the kinetochores and proliferation.

As part of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC), along with the Aurora B activator, INCENP, and the CPC localisation module comprised of Borealin and Survivin, Aurora B travels from the kinetochores at metaphase to the spindle midzone at anaphase, which ensures its substrates are phosphorylated in a time- and space-dependent manner. In the kinetoplastid parasite, <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the Aurora B orthologue (AUK1), along with an INCENP orthologue known as CPC1, and a kinetoplastid-specific protein CPC2, also displays a dynamic localisation, moving from the kinetochores at metaphase, to the spindle midzone at anaphase, to the anterior end of the newly synthesised flagellum attachment zone (FAZ) at cytokinesis. However, the trypanosome CPC lacks orthologues of Borealin and Survivin, and <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinetochores also have a unique composition, being comprised of dozens of kinetoplastid-specific proteins (KKTs). Of particular importance for this study are KKT7 and the KKT8 complex (comprising KKT8, KKT9, KKT11, and KKT12). Here, Ballmer and Akiyoshi seek to understand how the CPC assembles and is targeted to its different locations during the cell cycle in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p><p>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:</p><p>Using immunoprecipitation and mass-spectrometry approaches, Ballmer and Akiyoshi show that AUK1, CPC1, and CPC2 associate with two orphan kinesins, KIN-A and KIN-B, and with the use of endogenously expressed fluorescent fusion proteins, demonstrate for the first time that KIN-A and KIN-B display a dynamic localisation pattern similar to other components of the CPC, providing compelling evidence for KIN-A and KIN-B being bona fide CPC proteins.</p><p>They then demonstrate, by using RNAi to deplete individual components, that the CPC proteins have hierarchical interdependencies for their localisation to the kinetochores at metaphase. These experiments appear to have been well performed.</p><p>Ballmer and Akiyoshi then go on to determine the kinetochore localisation domains of KIN-A and KIN-B. Using ectopically expressed GFP-tagged truncations, they show that coiled coil domains within KIN-A and KIN-B, as well as a disordered C-terminal tail present only in KIN-A, but not the N-terminal motor domains of KIN-A or KIN-B, are required for kinetochore localisation. These data are strengthened by immunoprecipitating CPC complexes and crosslinking them prior to mass spectrometry analysis (IP-CLMS), a state-of-the-art approach, to determine the contacts between the CPC components. Structural predictions of the CPC structure are also made using AlphaFold2, suggesting that coiled coils form between KIN-A and KIN-B, and that KIN-A/B interact with the N termini of CPC1 and CPC2. Experimental results showing that CPC1 and CPC2 are unable to localise to kinetochores if they lack their N-terminal domains are consistent with these predictions. Altogether these data provide compelling evidence of the protein domains required for CPC kinetochore localisation and CPC protein interactions and indicate that both KIN-A and KIN-B have a role to play.</p><p>Next, using a mixture of RNAi depletion and LacI-LacO recruitment experiments, the authors show that kinetochore proteins KKT7 and KKT9 are required for AUK1 to localise to kinetochores (other KKT8 complex components were not tested here) and that all components of the KKT8 complex are required for KIN-A kinetochore localisation. Further, both KKT7 and KKT8 were able to recruit AUK1 to an ectopic locus in S phase, and KKT7 recruited KKT8 complex proteins, indicating it is upstream of KKT8, in line with previous work showing kinetochore localization of KKT7 is unaffected by disruption of the KKT8 complex. This leads to the conclusion that the KKT8 complex is likely the main kinetochore receptor of the CPC.</p><p>Further IP-CLMS experiments, in combination with recombinant protein pull down assays and structural predictions, suggested that within the KKT8 complex, there are two subcomplexes of KKT8:KKT12 and KKT9:KKT11, and that KKT7 interacts with KKT9:KKT11 to recruit the remainder of the KKT8 complex. The authors also assess the interdependencies between KKT8 complex components for localisation and expression, showing that all four subunits are required for the assembly of a stable KKT8 complex and present AlphaFold2 structural modelling data to support the two subcomplex model. In general, these data are of high quality and convincing, although it is a shame that data showing the effects of KKT8, KKT9 and KKT12 depletion on KKT11 localisation and abundance could not be presented alongside the reciprocal experiments in Fig S4I-L.</p><p>The authors also convincingly show that AlphaFold2 predictions of interactions between KKT9:KKT11 and a conserved domain (CD1) in the C-terminal tail of KIN-A are correct, with CD1 and a second conserved domain, CD2, identified through sequence analysis, acting synergistically to promote KIN-A kinetochore localisation at metaphase, but not being required for KIN-A to move to the central spindle at anaphase. They then hypothesise that the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A (but not KIN-B which is predicted to be inactive based on non-conservation of residues key for activity) determines its central spindle localisation at anaphase through binding to microtubules. In support of this hypothesis, the authors show that KIN-A, but not KIN-B can bind microtubules in vitro and in vivo. However, ectopically expressed GFP-NLS fusions of full length KIN-A or KIN-A motor domain did not localise to the central spindle at anaphase. The authors suggest this is due to the GFP fusion disrupting the ATPase activity of the motor domain, although they provide no evidence that this is the case. Instead, they replace endogenous KIN-A with a predicted ATPase-defective mutant (G210A), showing that while this still localises to kinetochores, the kinetochores were frequently misaligned at metaphase, and that it no longer concentrates at the central spindle (with concomitant mis-localisation of AUK1), causing cells to accumulate at anaphase. From these data, the authors conclude that KIN-A ATPase activity is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate and its central spindle localisation at anaphase. While these data are highly suggestive that KIN-A possesses ATPase activity, and that this activity is essential for its function, definitive biochemical evidence of KIN-A's ATPase activity is still lacking.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>Overall, this work uses a wide range of cutting edge molecular and structural predictive tools to provide a significant amount of new and detailed molecular data that shed light on the composition of the unusual trypanosome CPC and how it is assembled and targeted to different cellular locations during cell division. Given the fundamental nature of this research, it will be of interest to many parasitology researchers as well as cell biologists more generally, especially those working on aspects of mitosis and cell division, and those interested in the evolution of the CPC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93522.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ballmer</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Akiyoshi</surname><given-names>Bungo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study identifies the mitotic localization mechanism for Aurora B and INCENP (parts of the chromosomal passenger complex, CPC) in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>.

Indeed, motor activity remains to demonstrated using an in vitro system, which is beyond the scope of this study. What we show here is that the motor domain of KIN-A effectively co-sediments with microtubules and that spindle localization of KIN-A is abolished upon deletion of the motor domain. Moreover, mutation of a conserved Glycine residue in the Switch II region (G210) to Alanine (‘rigor mutation’, (Rice et al., 1999)), renders KIN-A incapable of translocating to the central spindle, suggesting that its ATPase activity is required for this process. To clarify this point in the manuscript, we have replaced all instances, where we refer to ‘motor activity’ of KIN-A with ‘ATPase activity’ when referring to experiments performed using the KIN-A rigor mutant. In addition, we have included a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of KIN-A and KIN-B from different kinetoplastids with human Kinesin-1, human Mklp2 and yeast Klp9 in Figure 6A and S6A, showing the conservation of key motifs required for ATP coordination and tubulin interaction. In the corresponding paragraph in the main text, we describe these data as follows:</p><p>‘We therefore speculated that anaphase translocation of the kinetoplastid CPC to the central spindle may involve the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A. KIN-B is unlikely to be a functional kinesin based on the absence of several well-conserved residues and motifs within the motor domain, which are fully present in KIN-A (Li et al., 2008). These include the P-loop, switch I and switch II motifs, which form the nucleotide binding cleft, and many conserved residues within the α4-L12 elements, which interact with tubulin (Fig. S6A) (Endow et al., 2010). Consistent with this, the motor domain of KIN-B, contrary to KIN-A, failed to localize to the mitotic spindle when expressed ectopically (Fig. S2E) and did not co-sediment with microtubules in our in vitro assay (Fig. S6B).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors imply that KIN-A, but not KIN-B, interacts with microtubules based on microtubule pelleting assay (Fig. S6), but the substantial insoluble fractions of 6HIS-KINA and 6HIS-KIN-B make it difficult to conclusively interpret the data.

Scale bars, 2 μm.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ballmer and Akiyoshi then go on to determine the kinetochore localisation domains of KIN-A and KIN-B. Using ectopically expressed GFP-tagged truncations, they show that coiled-coil domains within KIN-A and KIN-B, as well as a disordered C-terminal tail present only in KIN-A, but not the N-terminal motor domains of KIN-A or KIN-B, are required for kinetochore localisation. These data are strengthened by immunoprecipitating CPC complexes and crosslinking them prior to mass spectrometry analysis (IP-CLMS), a state-of-the-art approach, to determine the contacts between the CPC components. Structural predictions of the CPC structure are also made using AlphaFold2, suggesting that coiled coils form between KIN-A and KIN-B, and that KIN-A/B interact with the N termini of CPC1 and CPC2. Experimental results show that CPC1 and CPC2 are unable to localise to kinetochores if they lack their N-terminal domains consistent with these predictions. Altogether these data provide convincing evidence of the protein domains required for CPC kinetochore localisation and CPC protein interactions. However, the authors also conclude that KIN-B plays a minor role in localising the CPC to kinetochores compared to KIN-A. This conclusion is not particularly compelling as it stems from the observation that ectopically expressed GFP-NLS-KIN-A (full length or coiled-coil domain + tail) is also present at kinetochores during anaphase unlike endogenously expressed YFP-KIN-A. Not only is this localisation probably an artifact of the ectopic expression, but the KIN-B coiled-coil domain localises to kinetochores from S to metaphase and Fig S2G appears to show a portion of the expressed KIN-B coiled-coil domain colocalising with KKT2 at anaphase. It is unclear why KIN-B has been discounted here.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, a small fraction of GFP-NLS-KIN-B317-624 is indeed detectable at kinetochores in anaphase, although most of the protein shows diffuse nuclear staining. There are various explanations for this phenomenon: It is conceivable that the KIN-B motor domain may contribute to microtubule binding and translocation of the CPC from kinetochores onto the spindle in anaphase. In our experiments, ectopically expressed KIN-B317-624 likely outcompetes a fraction of endogenous KIN-B for binding to KIN-A, which could interfere with this translocation process, leaving a population of CPC ‘stranded’ at kinetochores in anaphase. Another possibility, hinted at by the reviewer, is that the C-terminus of KIN-B interacts with receptors at the kinetochore/centromere. Although we do not discount this possibility, we nevertheless decided to focus on KIN-A in this study, because the anaphase kinetochore retention phenotype for both full-length GFP-NLS-KIN-A and -KIN-A309-862 is much stronger than for KIN-B317-624. Two additional reasons were that (i) KIN-A is highly conserved within kinetoplastids, whereas KIN-B orthologs are missing in some kinetoplastids, and (ii) no convincing interactions between KIN-B and kinetochore proteins were predicted by AF2.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we decided to include KIN-B in the title of this manuscript, which now reads: ‘Dynamic localization of the chromosomal passenger complex is controlled by the orphan kinesins KIN-A and KIN-B in the kinetoplastid parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>’.</p><p>Moreover, we modified the corresponding paragraph in the results section as follows:</p><p>‘Intriguingly, unlike endogenously YFP-tagged KIN-A, ectopically expressed GFP fusions of both full-length KIN-A and KIN-A310-862 clearly localized at kinetochores even in anaphase (Figs. 2, F and H). Weak anaphase kinetochore signal was also detectable for KIN-B317-624 (Fig. S2F). GFP fusions of the central coiled-coil domain or the C-terminal disordered tail of KIN-A did not localize to kinetochores (data not shown). These results show that kinetochore localization of the CPC is mediated by KIN-A and KIN-B and requires both the central coiled-coil domain as well as the C-terminal disordered tail of KIN-A.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, using a mixture of RNAi depletion and LacI-LacO recruitment experiments, the authors show that kinetochore proteins KKT7 and KKT9 are required for AUK1 to localise to kinetochores (other KKT8 complex components were not tested here) and that all components of the KKT8 complex are required for KIN-A kinetochore localisation. Further, both KKT7 and KKT8 were able to recruit AUK1 to an ectopic locus in the S phase, and KKT7 recruited KKT8 complex proteins, which the authors suggest indicates it is upstream of KKT8. However, while these experiments have been performed well, the reciprocal experiment to show that KKT8 complex proteins cannot recruit KKT7, which could have confirmed this hierarchy, does not appear to have been performed. Further, since the LacI fusion proteins used in these experiments were ectopically expressed, they were retained (artificially) at kinetochores into anaphase; KKT8 and KIN-A were both able to recruit AUK1 to LacO foci in anaphase, while KKT7 was not. The authors conclude that this suggests the KKT8 complex is the main kinetochore receptor of the CPC - while very plausible, this conclusion is based on a likely artifact of ectopic expression, and for that reason, should be interpreted with a degree of caution.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that RNAi-mediated depletion of KKT7 disrupts kinetochore localization of KKT8 complex members, whereas kinetochore localization of KKT7 is unaffected by disruption of the KKT8 complex (Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020). Moreover, in contrast to the KKT8 complex, KKT7 remains at kinetochores in anaphase (Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014). These data show that KKT7 is upstream of the KKT8 complex. In this context, the LacI-LacO tethering approach can be very useful to probe whether two proteins (or domains of proteins) could interact in vivo either directly or indirectly. However, a recruitment hierarchy cannot be inferred from such experiments because the data just shows whether X can recruit Y to an ectopic locus (but not whether X is upstream of Y or vice versa). Regarding the retention of Aurora BAUK1 at kinetochores in anaphase upon ectopic expression of GFP-KKT8-LacI, we agree with the reviewer that these data need to be carefully interpreted. Nevertheless, the notion that the KKT7-KKT8 complex recruits the CPC to kinetochores is also strongly supported by IP-MS, RNAi experiments, and AF2 predictions. For clarification and to address the reviewer’s point, we re-formulated the corresponding paragraph in the main text:</p><p>‘We previously showed that KKT7 lies upstream of the KKT8 complex (Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020). Indeed, GFP-KKT72-261-LacI recruited tdTomato-KKT8, -KKT9 and -KKT12 (Fig. S4E). Expression of both GFP-KKT72-261-LacI and GFP-KKT8-LacI resulted in robust recruitment of tdTomato-Aurora BAUK1 to LacO foci in S phase (Figs. 4, E and F). Intriguingly, we also noticed that, unlike endogenous KKT8 (which is not present in anaphase), ectopically expressed GFP-KKT8-LacI remained at kinetochores during anaphase (Fig. 4F). This resulted in a fraction of tdTomato-Aurora BAUK1 being trapped at kinetochores during anaphase instead of migrating to the central spindle (Fig. 4F). We observed a comparable situation upon ectopic expression of GFP-KIN-A, which is retained on anaphase kinetochores together with tdTomato-KKT8 (Fig. S4F). In contrast, Aurora BAUK1 was not recruited to LacO foci marked by GFP- KKT72-261-LacI in anaphase (Fig. 4E).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further IP-CLMS experiments, in combination with recombinant protein pull-down assays and structural predictions, suggested that within the KKT8 complex, there are two subcomplexes of KKT8:KKT12 and KKT9:KKT11, and that KKT7 interacts with KKT9:KKT11 to recruit the remainder of the KKT8 complex. The authors also assess the interdependencies between KKT8 complex components for localisation and expression, showing that all four subunits are required for the assembly of a stable KKT8 complex and present AlphaFold2 structural modelling data to support the two subcomplex models. In general, these data are of high quality and convincing with a few exceptions. The recombinant pulldown assay (Fig. 4H) is not particularly convincing as the 3rd eluate gel appears to show a band at the size of KKT11 (despite the labelling indicating no KKT11 was present in the input) but no pulldown of KKT9, which was present in the input according to the figure legend (although this may be mislabeled since not consistent with the text). The text also states that 6HIS-KKT8 was insoluble in the absence of KKT12, but this is not possible to assess from the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out an error in the text: ‘Removal of both KKT9 and KKT11 did not impact formation of the KKT8:KKT12 subcomplex’ should read ‘Removal of either KKT9 or KKT11 did not impact formation of the KKT8:KKT12 subcomplex’. Regarding the very faint band perceived to be KKT11 in the 3rd eluate: This band runs slightly lower than KKT11 and likely represents a bacterial contaminant (which we have seen also in other preps in the past). We have made a note of this in the corresponding legend (new Fig. 4I). Moreover, we provide the estimated molecular weights for each subunit, as suggested by the reviewer in recommendation #14 (see below):</p><p>‘(I) Indicated combinations of 6HIS-tagged KKT8 (~46 kDa), KKT9 (~39 kDa), KKT11 (~29 kDa) and KKT12 (~23 kDa) were co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, followed by metal affinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The asterisk indicates a common contaminant.’</p><p>The corresponding paragraph in the results section now reads:</p><p>To validate these findings, we co-expressed combinations of 6HIS-KKT8, KKT9, KKT11 and KKT12 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and performed metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 4I). 6HIS-KKT8 efficiently pulled down KKT9, KKT11 and KKT12, as shown previously (Ishii and Akiyoshi, 2020). In the absence of KKT9, 6HIS-KKT8 still pulled down KKT11 and KKT12. Removal of either KKT9 or KKT11 did not impact formation of the KKT8:KKT12 subcomplex. In contrast, 6HIS-KKT8 could not be recovered without KKT12, indicating that KKT12 is required for formation of the full KKT8 complex. These results support the idea that the KKT8 complex consists of KKT8:KKT12 and KKT9:KKT11 subcomplexes.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also surprising that data showing the effects of KKT8, KKT9, and KKT12 depletion on KKT11 localisation and abundance are not presented alongside the reciprocal experiments in Fig S4G-J.</p></disp-quote><p>YFP-KKT11 is delocalized upon depletion of KKT8 and KKT9 (see below).

They then hypothesise that the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A (but not KIN-B which is predicted to be inactive based on non-conservation of residues key for activity) determines its central spindle localisation at anaphase through binding to microtubules. In support of this hypothesis, the authors show that KIN-A, but not KIN-B can bind microtubules in vitro and in vivo. However, ectopically expressed GFP-NLS fusions of full-length KIN-A or KIN-A motor domain did not localise to the central spindle at anaphase. The authors suggest this is due to the GPF fusion disrupting the ATPase activity of the motor domain, but they provide no evidence that this is the case. Instead, they replace endogenous KIN-A with a predicted ATPase-defective mutant (G209A), showing that while this still localises to kinetochores, the kinetochores were frequently misaligned at metaphase, and that it no longer concentrates at the central spindle (with concomitant mis-localisation of AUK1), causing cells to accumulate at anaphase. From these data, the authors conclude that KIN-A ATPase activity is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate and its central spindle localisation at anaphase. While potentially very interesting, these data are incomplete in the absence of any experimental data to show that KIN-A possesses ATPase activity or that this activity is abrogated by the G209A mutation, and the conclusions of this section are rather speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment, which relates to a similar point raised by Reviewer 1 (see above). Indeed, ATPase and motor activity of KIN-A remain to demonstrated biochemically using recombinant proteins, which is beyond the scope of this study. We generated MSAs of KIN-A and KIN-B from different kinetoplastids with human Kinesin-1, human Mklp2 and yeast Klp9, which are now presented in Figure 6A and S6A. These clearly show that key motifs required for ATP or tubulin binding in other kinesins are highly conserved in KIN-A (but not KIN-B). This includes the conserved glycine residue in the Switch II helix (G234 in human Kinesin-1, G210 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> KIN-A), which forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of ATP, and upon mutation has been shown to impair ATPase activity and trap the motor head in a strong microtubule (‘rigor’) state (Rice et al., 1999; Sablin et al., 1996). The prominent rigor phenotype of KIN-AG210A is consistent with KIN-A having ATPase activity. In addition to the data in Fig. 6A and S6A, we made following changes to the main text:</p><p>‘We therefore speculated that anaphase translocation of the kinetoplastid CPC to the central spindle may involve the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A. KIN-B is unlikely to be a functional kinesin based on the absence of several well-conserved residues and motifs within the motor domain, which are fully present in KIN-A (Li et al., 2008). These include the P-loop, switch I and switch II motifs, which form the nucleotide binding cleft, and many conserved residues within the α4-L12 elements, which interact with tubulin (Fig. S6A) (Endow et al., 2010). Consistent with this, the motor domain of KIN-B, contrary to KIN-A, failed to localize to the mitotic spindle when expressed ectopically (Fig. S2E) and did not co-sediment with microtubules in our in vitro assay (Fig. S6B).</p><p>Ectopically expressed GFP-KIN-A and -KIN-A2-309 partially localized to the mitotic spindle but failed to concentrate at the midzone during anaphase (Figs. 2, F and G), suggesting that N-terminal tagging of the KIN-A motor domain may interfere with its function. To address whether the ATPase activity of KIN-A is required for central spindle localization of the CPC, we replaced one allele of KIN-A with a C-terminally YFP-tagged G210A ATP hydrolysis-defective rigor mutant (Fig. 6A) (Rice et al., 1999) and used an RNAi construct directed against the 3’UTR of KIN-A to deplete the untagged allele. The rigor mutation did not affect recruitment of KIN-A to kinetochores (Figs. S6, C and D). However, KIN-AG210A-YFP marked kinetochores were misaligned in ~50% of cells arrested in metaphase, suggesting that ATPase activity of KIN-A promotes chromosome congression to the metaphase plate (Figs. S6, E-H).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Impact:</p><p>Overall, this work uses a wide range of cutting-edge molecular and structural predictive tools to provide a significant amount of new and detailed molecular data that shed light on the composition of the unusual trypanosome CPC and how it is assembled and targeted to different cellular locations during cell division.

Concrete examples:</p><p>(i) Line 144: &quot;we did not include CPC2 for further analysis in this study&quot;Although CPC2 features at a prominent and interesting position in the predicted structures of the kinetoplastid CPC, shown in later main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted RNAi-mediated depletion of CPC2 using two different shRNA constructs.

The XL-MS descriptions that precede them are not so helpful (Fig 3A and 4G and in the text). To emphasize their status as experimental support for the predicted structures, which is very important, it would be good to discuss the XL-MS after presenting the models.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have re-arranged the text and/or figures such that the AF2 predictions are discussed first and the CLMS data are brought in afterwards.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A prominently features an arbitrary color code and a lot of protein IDs without a legend.

The pLDDT scores, and especially those of the non-displayed models, do not add much information and should not be a main panel.

For each structure prediction, we now present two images side by side; one coloured by chain and one colored by pLDDT. We recently re-ran AF2 for the full CPC and also for the KKT7N-KKT8 complex, and got improved predictions. Hence some of the models in Fig. 3/S3 and Fig. 4/S4 have been updated accordingly. For the CLMS plots, we also decided to colour the cross-links according to whether the 30 angstrom distance constraints were fulfilled or not in the AF2 prediction. We also increased the size of the structures shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, we decided to remove the summarizing diagram from Fig. 4 and instead made a new main Fig. 7, which shows a more detailed schematic, which also takes into account the proposed function of the KIN-A motor domain, as suggested by the reviewer, and other points addressed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods section for the structural predictions lacks essential information.

A statement with some details would be useful, as the difference between both studies appears to be crucial for the novelty of this paper. Alternatively, refer to this being covered in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this point, we modified this paragraph in the results section:</p><p>‘To our surprise, KIN-A-YFP and GFP-KIN-B exhibited a CPC-like localization pattern identical to that of Aurora BAUK1: Both kinesins localized to kinetochores from S phase to metaphase, and then translocated to the central spindle in anaphase (Figs. 1, C-E). Moreover, like Aurora BAUK1, a population of KIN-A and KIN-B localized at the new FAZ tip from late anaphase onwards (Figs. S1, B and C). This was unexpected, because KIN-A and KIN-B were previously reported to localize to the spindle but not to kinetochores or the new FAZ tip (Li et al., 2008). These data suggest that KIN-A and KIN-B are bona fide CPC proteins in trypanosomes, associating with AuroraAUK1, INCENPCPC1 and CPC2 throughout the cell cycle.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 285 refers to &quot;conserved&quot; regions in the C-terminal part of KIN-A, referring to Figure 5.

Did the authors spin the proteins in BRB80 before the assay to continue with soluble material and reduce sedimentation in the absence of microtubules? If the authors want to keep the wording in lines 331-332, the MT-binding properties of KIN-A and KIN-B need to be investigated in more detail, for example with a titration and a quantification thereof. Otherwise, they should change the text and replace &quot;confirms&quot; with &quot;is consistent with&quot;. In any case, the legend needs to be expanded to include more information.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the point above, we have added the following text in the legend corresponding to Fig. S6:</p><p>‘Microtubule co-sedimentation assay with 6HIS-KIN-A2-309 (left) and 6HIS-KIN-B2-316 (right). S and P correspond to supernatant and pellet fractions, respectively. Note that both constructs to some extent sedimented even in the absence of microtubules. Hence, lack of microtubule binding for KIN-B may be due to the unstable non-functional protein used in this study.’</p><p>We have also updated the main text in the results section:</p><p>‘We therefore speculated that anaphase translocation of the kinetoplastid CPC to the central spindle may involve the kinesin motor domain of KIN-A. KIN-B is unlikely to be a functional kinesin based on the absence of several well-conserved residues and motifs within the motor domain, which are fully present in KIN-A (Li et al., 2008). These include the P-loop, switch I and switch II motifs, which form the nucleotide binding cleft, and many conserved residues within the α4-L12 elements, which interact with tubulin (Fig. S6A) (Endow et al., 2010). Consistent with this, the motor domain of KIN-B, contrary to KIN-A, failed to localize to the mitotic spindle when expressed ectopically (Fig. S2E) and did not co-sediment with microtubules in our in vitro assay (Fig. S6B).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details:</p><p>The readability of the pAE plots could be improved by arranging sequences according to their position in the structure.

When we previously expressed truncations of KKT2 and KKT3 kinetochore proteins, many fragments did not go into the nucleus presumably due to the lack of an NLS, which prevented us from determining which domains are responsible for their kinetochore localization. We have since then consistently used this short NLS sequence in our inducible GFP fusions in the past without any complications. We added a sentence in the Materials &amp; Methods section under Trypanosome culture: ‘All constructs for ectopic expression of GFP fusion proteins include a short nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Marchetti et al., 2000).’ To avoid unnecessary confusion, we removed ‘NLS’ from the main text and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 148-150 - it would strengthen this claim if KIN-A/B protein levels were assessed by Western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present a Western blot in Fig. S2C, showing that bulk KIN-B levels are clearly reduced upon KIN-A RNAi. The same is true also to some extent for KIN-A levels upon KIN-B RNAi, although this is less obvious, possibly due to the lower efficiency of KIN-B compared to KIN-A RNAi as judged by fluorescence microscopy (quantified in Fig. 2D and 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 253 - the text mentions the removal of both KKT9 and KKT11, which is not consistent with the figure (Fig 4H) - do you mean the removal of either KKT9 or KKT11?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake in the text, which has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 337 - please include a reference for the G209A ATPase-defective rigor mutant - has this been shown to result in KIN-A being inactive previously?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above our answer in public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is not always obvious when fluorescent fusion proteins are being expressed endogenously or ectopically, or when they are being expressed in an RNAi background or not without tracing the cell lines in Table S1 - please ensure this is clearly stated throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now made sure that this is clearly stated in the main text as well as in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 410 - 'KIN-A C-terminal tail is stuffed full of conserved CDK1CRK3 sites' - what does 'stuffed full' really mean (this is rather imprecise) and what are the consensus sites - are these CDK1 consensus sites that are assumed to be conserved for CRK3? I'm not aware of consensus sites for CRK3 having been determined, but if they have, this should be referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the corresponding section in the discussion as follows:</p><p>‘In support of this, the KIN-A C-terminal tail harbours many putative CRK3 sites (10 sites matching the minimal S/T-P consensus motif for CDKs) and is also heavily phosphorylated by Aurora BAUK1 in vitro (Ballmer et al. 2024). Finally, we speculate that the interaction of KIN-A motor domain with microtubules, coupled to the force generating ATP hydrolysis and possibly plus-end directed motion, eventually outcompetes the weakened interactions of the CPC with the kinetochore and facilitates the extraction of the CPC from chromosomes onto spindle microtubules during anaphase. Indeed, deletion of the KIN-A motor domain or impairment of its motor function through N-terminal GFP tagging causes the CPC to be trapped at kinetochores in anaphase. Central spindle localization is additionally dependent on the ATPase activity of the KIN-A motor domain as illustrated by the KIN-A rigor mutant.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Lines 412-416: this proposal is written rather definitively - given no motor activity has been demonstrated for KIN-A, please make clear that this is still just a theory.</p></disp-quote><p>See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Fig 1: KKT2 is not highlighted in Fig 1A - given this has been used for colocalization in Fig 1C-E, was it recovered, and if not, why not?

KKT2 was indeed recovered with Aurora BAUK1 (see Table S2) and is often used as a kinetochore marker in trypanosomes by our lab and others since the signal of fluorescently tagged KKT2 is relatively bright and KKT2 localizes to centromeres throughout the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) A general comment for all image figures is that these do not have accompanying brightfield images and it is therefore difficult to know where the cell body is, or sometimes which nuclei and kinetoplasts belong to which cell where DNA from more than one cell is within the image. It would be beneficial if brightfield images could be added, or alternatively, the cell outlines were traced onto DAPI or merged images. Also, brightfield images would allow the stage of cytokinesis (pre-furrowing/furrowing/abscission) in anaphase cells to be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>Since this study primarily addresses the recruitment mechanism of the CPC to kinetochores and to the central spindle from S phase to metaphase and in anaphase, respectively, and CPC proteins are not observed outside of the nucleus during these cell cycle stages, we did not present brightfield images in the figures. However, this point is particularly valid for discerning the localization of KIN-A and KIN-B to the new FAZ tip from late anaphase onwards. Hence, we acquired new microscopy data for Fig. S1B and S1C, which now includes phase contrast images, and have chosen representative cells in late anaphase and telophase.
