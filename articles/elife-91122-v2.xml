However, factors determining the proteasomal degradation rate remain poorly understood. Proteasome substrates are conjugated with small proteins (tags) like ubiquitin and Fat10 to target them to the proteasome. It is unclear if the structural plasticity of proteasome-targeting tags can influence substrate degradation. Fat10 is upregulated during inflammation, and its substrates undergo rapid proteasomal degradation. We report that the degradation rate of Fat10 substrates critically depends on the structural plasticity of Fat10. While the ubiquitin tag is recycled at the proteasome, Fat10 is degraded with the substrate. Our results suggest significantly lower thermodynamic stability and faster mechanical unfolding in Fat10 compared to ubiquitin. Long-range salt bridges are absent in the Fat10 structure, creating a plastic protein with partially unstructured regions suitable for proteasome engagement. Fat10 plasticity destabilizes substrates significantly and creates partially unstructured regions in the substrate to enhance degradation. NMR-relaxation-derived order parameters and temperature dependence of chemical shifts identify the Fat10-induced partially unstructured regions in the substrate, which correlated excellently to Fat10-substrate contacts, suggesting that the tag-substrate collision destabilizes the substrate. These results highlight a strong dependence of proteasomal degradation on the structural plasticity and thermodynamic properties of the proteasome-targeting tags.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-proteasome system</kwd><kwd>Fat10</kwd><kwd>NMR spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>MD simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI4006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Ranabir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2021/006032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Ranabir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>dbt/pr12422/med/31/287/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Ranabir</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravichandran</surname><given-names>Aravind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Negi</surname><given-names>Hitendra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biophysical experiments, pulse-chase assays, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how the proteasome targeting signal Fat10 can modulate the structure of substrate proteins to potentially regulate their degradation by the proteasome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteasome substrates must be conjugated with other small proteins, known as proteasome-targeting tags, to target substrates to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017</xref>). Ubiquitin is a proteasome-targeting tag conjugated to substrates by posttranslational modification. It interacts with the 19 S proteasome subunit, which harbors ubiquitin receptors. Consequently, 19 S aligns its base subunits, consisting of AAA +ATPases, with the 20 S Core Particle (CP) to create a channel for substrate entry. Deubiquitinase enzymes cleave the ubiquitin, while the substrate enters the ATPases to unfold and translocate to CP, where it is cleaved into short peptides by proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Worden et al., 2017</xref>). Proteasomal degradation regulates most nuclear and cytosolic protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Global cellular protein degradation rate is modulated in the quiescent state, under nutrient stress, or during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">VerPlank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, mechanisms that regulate proteasome degradation in such conditions remain poorly understood. Partially unstructured regions at the N/C-termini or within the substrate are critical to proteasome engagement and degradation. Global disorder and topology of substrates also influence the degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correa Marrero and Barrio-Hernandez, 2021</xref>). It is unclear if the plasticity of the proteasome-targeting tag can regulate the substrate degradation rate.</p><p>During stress or inflammation, a swift change in proteasomal degradation activity by changing the global disorder in proteins or its biased sequences may be challenging. An alternate mechanism is to upregulate a proteasome-targeting tag that rapidly degrades substrate proteins. The human leukocyte antigen-F adjacent transcript 10 (Fat10) is a proteasome-targeting tag that directly targets substrates for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidtke et al., 2014</xref>). Fat10 expression is restricted to immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buerger et al., 2015</xref>), and other cell types express Fat10 upon induction by proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchsbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raasi et al., 1999</xref>). Fat10 includes two ubiquitin-like domains attached by a flexible linker and is conjugated to substrate proteins by posttranslational modification. Fat10’s surface properties and interactions are distinct from ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichem et al., 2018</xref>). Fat10 has a lower half-life of 1 hr, while ubiquitin has a longer half-life of ~24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haas and Bright, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aichem and Groettrup, 2020</xref>). Fat10’s shorter half-life prevents a prolonged inflammatory response that can potentially lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aichem and Groettrup, 2020</xref>). Mechanisms underlying the rapid degradation of Fat10 are poorly understood.</p><p>The substrates of Fat10 overlap significantly with ubiquitin substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aichem and Groettrup, 2020</xref>), suggesting that Fat10 is an auxiliary proteasomal-targeting signal activated during inflammation. However, several mechanistic differences exist between the ubiquitin- and Fat10-proteasome pathways. Ubiquitin is cleaved by deubiquitinating enzymes at the proteasome before the substrate enters ATPases, but Fat10 remains uncleaved and is degraded along with the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2005</xref>). Well-folded substrates must be globally or partially unfolded for engagement with the proteasome. Accessory unfoldases like Cdc48 assist the process by unfolding substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olszewski et al., 2019</xref>) before they interact with the proteasome. Substrate unfolding by accessory unfoldases is necessary for the ubiquitin substrates but not for the Fat10 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichem et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a profound impact of Fat10 on the substrate’s structure and energetics. However, Fat10’s effect on the substrate’s structure and thermodynamics is unknown.</p><p>While ubiquitin has a rigid structure, Fat10 has a ductile fold, providing an opportunity to probe if the plasticity of proteasome-targeting tags affects substrate degradation rate. In this work, we correlate the thermodynamic properties and conformational plasticity of Fat10 and ubiquitin with the proteasomal degradation rate of their substrates. Our results suggest that the Fat10 free energy barrier is substantially lower than ubiquitin. Consequently, the Fat10 unfolding kinetics are sevenfold faster than ubiquitin, and Fat10’s mechanical resistance to unfolding is weaker than ubiquitin’s. The absence of long-range salt bridges in Fat10 creates partially unstructured regions, leading to efficient proteasome engagement and degradation. Furthermore, Fat10’s structural plasticity reduces the thermodynamic stability of substrate proteins in cellular and in vitro conditions and creates local partially unstructured regions in the substrate. The substrate reciprocally reduces Fat10 stability by thermodynamic coupling, creating more disorder in the conjugate and enhancing degradation. NMR experiments measured enthalpy and conformational entropy to reveal Fat10-induced sites of local disorder in the substrate. Our experimental and computational data suggest that nonspecific collisions with the proteasome-targeting tag destabilize the substrate. These results highlight that the proteasome-targeting tags’s plasticity regulates proteasomal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fat10 undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation</title><p>Although UBLs are structurally similar, they are diverse in sequence landscape.

Fat10 levels dropped sharply compared to ubiquitin, suggesting that Fat10 undergoes rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Treatment with a proteasomal inhibitor restores Fat10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that Fat10 undergoes proteasomal degradation. The protein levels of individual Fat10 domains were also studied.

The isolated Fat10 domains were also degraded via the proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Protein cofactors specific to the full-length Fat10 may bind and bury its partially disordered regions to reduce proteasomal degradation.

VdW and electrostatic interaction energies were calculated between the interacting secondary structures in Fat10 and ubiquitin to study the basis of reduced packing interactions. The VdW interaction energy was comparable between Fat10 domains and ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The electrostatic interaction energy was also similar in all regions except between β2 and α1, where Fat10 has a significantly lower negative value than ubiquitin, suggesting fewer electrostatic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Two hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge between β2 and α1 are present in ubiquitin but absent in Fat10, which reduces the interaction between β2 and α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Another salt bridge between the α2 loop and α1 is also exclusive to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The thermodynamic stability of ubiquitin mutants was measured experimentally. Disrupting the salt bridges reduces the melting point of ubiquitin by 50 °C, suggesting the importance of the salt bridges for ubiquitin stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>).

The protein with engineered salt bridges populated the ground state but not the partially unfolded states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). RMSF and PCA analysis suggested that engineered salt bridges reduced the fluctuations and increased rigidity in the domain. Overall, critical electrostatic interactions present between α1 and β1β2 and between α1 and α2 loop stabilize the ubiquitin fold.

To study whether the substrate destabilization is solely due to Fat10 and not the above effects, the impact of Fat10 was studied in purified proteins. Producing purified Fat10 isopeptide conjugated substrates is technically challenging owing to the lack of a suitable Fat10 E3-substrate pair active under in vitro conditions. Hence, Fat10 was covalently conjugated at the N-terminus of a model ultra-stable substrate protein like the Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) to mimic the N-terminal isopeptide conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciechanover and Ben-Saadon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The free energy of unfolding CFP was calculated by measuring CFP fluorescence during chemical denaturation. CFP is a well-folded substrate with high thermodynamic stability and ΔG<sub>unfolding</sub> = 11 kcal/mol. The change in unfolding energy of CFP is modest ΔΔG<sub>unfolding</sub> = 0.2 kcal/mol when conjugated with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The modest decrease in CFP stability correlates with the finding that ubiquitin conjugation is insufficient for the direct degradation of well-folded substrates and requires Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olszewski et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the ΔΔG<sub>unfolding</sub> was 3.0 kcal/mol and 3.8 kcal/mol when CFP is conjugated to Fat10D1 and Fat10D2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting Fat10 domains destabilize the substrate 15-fold more than ubiquitin. Change in free energy could be due to the nonspecific or specific interactions between Fat10 and CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigman and Levy, 2020</xref>). Specific interactions should depend on the complementary surface properties of Fat10 and CFP and should differentiate between the full-length Fat10 and the smaller individual domains. CFP’s thermodynamic stability after conjugation to the full-length Fat10 reduced by 3kcal/mol, similar to the isolated domains, suggesting that nonspecific interactions due to conjugation reduce CFP stability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The destabilization effect of Fat10 was investigated using CFP as a substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CFP is fused at the C-terminal end of Ub, Fat10, Fat10D1, and FAT0D2.

Ubiquitin was chosen as a well-folded small substrate, as covalent interactions between Fat10 and ubiquitin have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchsbaum et al., 2012</xref>).

Many tag-substrate contacts were formed between the D2 domain and the β1β2 and β4-α2-β5 regions in the substrate ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We compared the long-range intra-substrate contacts in the free substrate and the Fat10-substrate conjugate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The regions where intra-substrate contacts are disrupted overlapped with those where Fat10 contacts the substrate, suggesting that Fat10 interaction disrupts the intra-substrate contacts. To study the higher destabilizing effect of Fat10 compared to ubiquitin, we noted that Fat10 has a higher exposed hydrophobic surface area (23%) than ubiquitin (13%) and can form more hydrophobic interactions with the substrate. Moreover, Fat10 domains are labile and sample partially unfolded forms, exposing their buried hydrophobic residues to enhance hydrophobic interactions with the substrate. We compared the intra-substrate long-range contacts between a linear diubiquitin molecule and Fat10-ubiquitin conjugate. The first ubiquitin serves as the tag in diubiquitin, and the second ubiquitin is the substrate. The number of intra-substrate contacts disrupted in the Fat10-substrate conjugate was higher than diubiquitin, confirming the higher destabilization effect of Fat10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>Most intermolecular contacts were observed between the Fat10 D2 domain and the substrate, and few between the D1 domain and substrate.

The C-terminal tail in substrate ubiquitin is dynamic and explores a larger conformational space, providing greater flexibility for the tag to interact with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consequently, the intermolecular contacts between the tag and substrate were more evenly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>).

Entropy increases further in these regions when D2 is conjugated at the C-terminus. In addition, the α2 loop and β3β4 regions become more entropic. Overall, the Fat10 domain contacts the substrate at multiple regions to weaken its local stability and increase disorder. The intrinsic flexibility of the conjugation site regulates Fat10’s impact on substrate stability.</p><p>The substrate may also influence the stability of the proteasome-targeting tag. The Fat10D2 tag is more compact (low Rog) in free form than in the tag-substrate conjugate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Moreover, the Fat10D2 tag unfolds faster when conjugated with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5B</xref>), suggesting a thermodynamic coupling between the tag and the substrate. The tag-substrate contacts are greater when the tag is conjugated to ubiquitin C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consequently, the tag unfolded faster when conjugated to the substrate C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5C</xref>), suggesting that the tag stability also depends on the conjugation site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Posttranslational modification with proteasome-targeting tags is necessary but insufficient for protein degradation. The substrate/proteasome engagement and the substrate unfolding are rate-limiting steps for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>). Global disorder, topology, local regions with a high disorder, and biased sequences in the substrate are critical factors that regulate proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correa Marrero and Barrio-Hernandez, 2021</xref>). Whether the structural flexibility of the proteasome-targeting tags impacts substrate degradation is unclear. We report that the proteasome-targeting tag Fat10 has a malleable structure that samples multiple partially unfolded forms at physiological temperature. The lack of strong long-range electrostatic interactions between the central helix α1, the β1β2 strands, and the α2 loop, creates the flexible fold that provides weak resistance to mechanical unfolding. These properties of Fat10 expedite its unfolding, degradation, and degradation of Fat10 substrates, highlighting the role of structural plasticity of proteasome-targeting tags in regulating protein degradation rate. Our data correlate well with the previous observations that substituting Fat10 Ubl domains with ubiquitin impedes proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichem et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Fat10’s impact on the substrate structure and dynamics is noteworthy, as it destabilized various substrates in both in-vitro and cellular conditions. We chose two ultra-stable proteins, CFP and Ub, whose melting points are above 90 °C. Fat10 reduced the unfolding energies of both substrates by 3–5 kcal/mol, which was considerably higher than the effect of ubiquitin on these substrates. Our simulations suggested that Fat10 makes several nonspecific intermolecular contacts with the substrate to perturb the intra-substrate contacts. Competition between inter- and intra-molecular interactions has been recently highlighted, where critical salt-bridge interactions at protein-protein interfaces are “stolen” by new posttranslational modifications within the interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skinner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohanty et al., 2019</xref>). A similar mechanism may disrupt critical intra-substrate contacts by substrate-tag collision. Intriguingly, the substrate reciprocally increases partially unfolded regions in Fat10. Thermodynamic coupling between the substrate and tag functions in tandem to increase partially unfolded regions in the substrate-tag conjugate and accelerate its degradation.</p><p>Increased enthalpy and conformational entropy suggest local order-to-disorder transitions in proteins, giving rise to partially unfolded forms. We have measured the Tc values to estimate hbond strength, where higher ΔTc values indicate reduced hbond strength and increased enthalpy. Entropy was calculated from NMR relaxation order parameters. The increase in local enthalpy and entropy values identified Fat10-induced local disorder in the substrate, which agreed well with the computational data. An intriguing question is whether the chemical environment at the Fat10 conjugation site can regulate substrate stability. Our results show that conjugation at disordered regions allows greater conformational space for Fat10, increasing its collisions with the substrate and reducing substrate stability. We explored further by studying the effect of Fat10 conjugation on several substrates with varied electrostatic surface potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravichandran and Das, 2024</xref>) and found that Fat10 conjugation on positively charged surfaces has a lower/insignificant effect on substrate energies because the negatively charged Fat10 tag forms stable interactions with the substrate, which reduces its conformational flexibility. These studies suggest that the local environment around the conjugation site can regulate Fat10’s effect on the substrate energetics.</p><p>Posttranslational modification with ubiquitin destabilizes substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagai and Levy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morimoto et al., 2016</xref>). However, the proteasomal degradation pathways of ubiquitin and Fat10 substrates are distinct. Post cleavage by proteasome deubiquitinases, ubiquitin’s impact on the substrate is unsustained. Hence, few substrates may not interact with the proteasome ATPases and escape degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correa Marrero and Barrio-Hernandez, 2021</xref>). Fat10 remains conjugated to the substrates, and its effect on the substrate persists until the conjugate translocates to the ATPases. Since Fat10 is degraded along with the substrate, its malleability directly influences the substrate degradation rate. While the N-termini of ubiquitin is rigid, a short N-terminal disordered region in Fat10 contributes to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichem et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, Fat10 and ubiquitin’s impact on the substrate structure and energetics are distinct. Fat10 domains have a greater exposed hydrophobic surface than ubiquitin, which can induce more nonspecific substrate-tag collisions. Fat10’s ground state is in equilibrium with partially unfolded forms with exposed hydrophobic patches, further enhancing interactions with the substrate. Together, these structural and thermodynamic properties of Fat10 create a higher disorder in the substrate than in ubiquitin. These mechanistic differences explain the unfoldase(Cdc48)-independent rapid degradation of Fat10 substrates. In hypoxic conditions, however, the 20 S proteasome degrades ubiquitin conjugated to disordered substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sahu et al., 2021</xref>). Since ubiquitin is uncleaved from the substrate, the mechanistic differences between the Fat10 and ubiquitin for 20 S proteasomal degradation is an intriguing question for further investigation.</p><p>The study has a few caveats. Fat10 was conjugated to the N- or C-terminus of the substrates here and not to specific lysines. Without an identified FAT10 E3-substrate pair that is active under in vitro conditions, it is technically challenging to conjugate substrate lysines site-specifically. The discovery of novel FAT10 E3s will facilitate such studies in the future. Previous computational research suggested that conjugation between two proteins can destabilize their folded state, stabilize their unfolded state, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigman and Levy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sokolovski et al., 2015</xref>). While our NMR experiments have exclusively studied Fat10’s effect on the substrate’s folded state, further studies are required to reveal its impact on the substrate’s unfolded state.</p><p>The proteasome degrades 80–90% of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang, 2018</xref>), and understanding its activity has broad implications for understanding cellular response mechanisms to stress and infection. The immune cells undergo major reprogramming of signaling and antigen presentation during inflammation, and the proteasome plays an essential role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Çetin et al., 2021</xref>). An important question is how proteasome degradation is modulated in these cells and why Fat10 is upregulated during infection. Our work provides a plausible understanding that the upregulation of a malleable proteasome-targeting signal Fat10 helps immune cells modulate the proteasomal degradation rate in response to infection. Fat10 is designed as an efficient proteasomal degradation signal activated as an inflammatory response. Intriguingly, Fat10 also presents scope for designing therapeutics by controlled protein degradation. Understanding the physical and thermodynamic effects of Fat10 modification is essential to engineer it for therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>A <italic>Fat10</italic> gene (Life Technologies) was constructed where C7, C9, C160, and C162 were mutated to alanine.

The rest of the protocol is the same as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatova and Gierasch, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>High-temperature unfolding simulations</title><p>Systems were prepared in a cubic box of TIP3p water, with a minimum distance of at least 50 Å between solute atoms and the box edge. Counter ions were added to neutralize the system. The system setup and equilibration procedures were similar to the unrestrained simulations, with 450 K as the equilibration temperature. Protein unfolding simulations were performed at 450 K for 300 ns. The simulations were performed with ten replicas to obtain an average folding pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ASMD simulations</title><p>Constant force explicit solvent ASMD simulations of Fat10D1, Fat10D2, Ub, full-length Fat10, and Ub<sub>2</sub> were carried out. The reaction coordinate is the end-to-end distance between the Cα atoms of the first amino acid and the last amino acid of the respective protein. For simulations consisting of Fat10D1, Fat10D2, and Ub, the proteins were pulled at 1 Å/ns velocity, and for full-length Fat10 and Ub<sub>2</sub>, the pulling velocity was 5 Å/ns. The reaction coordinate was partitioned into ten equal segments, each with ten trajectories. The system was energy-minimized equilibrated, and the resulting coordinates &amp; velocities were used as starting points for ASMD simulations. The simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions in the NPT ensemble; electrostatic interactions were computed using the PME (Particle Mesh Ewald) method. Nonbonded interactions were treated with a cutoff of 8 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Structure-based Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>The structures of 10 available UBL PDBs were retrieved from RCSB PDB as tabulated in Fig. S1A. Crystal structures were cleaned by removing co-crystal structures, multiple domains, ions, and water. For NMR structures, the best representative model was used. For Fat10 and ISG15, individual UBL domains were isolated. RMSD matrix and structure-based sequence alignment were obtained for all structures based on multiple superimpositions using the MUSTANG tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konagurthu et al., 2006</xref>). Further, the phylogenetic tree was plotted using aligned sequences in MEGA X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Structures for individual domains of Fat10D1 &amp; Fat10D2 were retrieved from PDB IDs 6GF1 and 6GF2, respectively. The full-length Fat10 structure was modeled using Swiss-Modeller with 6GF1 and 6GF2 as templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>). Chain B of 6GF1 was further processed for simulation and called Fat10D1. All water and sulfate molecules were removed from the Fat10D1 crystal structure. 6GF2 was an NMR ensemble structure, and the best representative structure, Fat10D2, was further considered for simulation. For chimeric models, the individual domains of Fat10D1, Fat10D2, and ubiquitin were fused between the N-terminal of one domain and the C-terminal of the other using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). These models were further simulated for 500 ns before using the final structure for unfolding simulations. The salt bridge mutants were designed using the Rotamer function in UCSF Chimera. Systems for Fat10D1, Fat10D2, Fat10, and ubiquitin were prepared with the LEaP program of Ambertools18. Systems were prepared in a cubic box of TIP3p water, with a minimum distance of at least 12 Å between solute atoms and the box edge. Counter ions were added to neutralize the system.</p><p>Parameters describing system topology were based on the Amber ff99SBildn force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lindorff‐Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). The systems were first relaxed by energy minimization in two stages using the Sander module of Amber18. In the first stage, water molecules were minimized with restraint on protein, and then the entire system was minimized. The respective systems were then heated incrementally in NVT from 0K to 300K for 5 ns with positional restraints (20 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>) on protein atoms. Further, system density was equilibrated for 5 ns in the NPT ensemble with positional restraints (20 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>) on protein atoms. Further, four subsequent equilibration stages reduced the restraints on the backbone atom from 20 to 0 through a series of molecular dynamics simulations in an NPT ensemble for 400 ps each. The final production run was performed for 2.5 µs in NPT with three replicas. The distance cutoff for short-range nonbonded interactions was set to 1 nm. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. The SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>) was applied to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Temperature was set to 300 K using a Langevin thermostat, and pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat. Using the hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>)⁠, the⁠ integration time step was set to 4 fs. Dynamics were propagated using the leapfrog integrator. Snapshots were saved every 40 ps, giving 65200 conformations from a single run. A total of 7.5 µs (3*2.5 µs) data was pooled for further analysis.</p><p>The trajectory analyses were performed using the AMBER suite’s CPPTRAJ module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2005</xref>). The averages and standard errors were calculated using in-house scripts and were plotted using the R program⁠. Native contacts were calculated using the native-contacts method in CPPTRAJ with a 7 Å distance cutoff. For backbone native contacts across secondary structure pairs, the native contacts were calculated, defining a 3.5 Å distance cutoff on backbone atoms. The data was averaged across ten individual simulations at 450 K to calculate the mean and standard error. The Free Energy plots obtained from bin populations of the 2-dimensional histograms obtained from binning Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) and Radius of Gyration values using the formula:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>Δ</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>β</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where ΔG<sub>i</sub> is the free energy value of bin i, kβ is Boltzmann’s constant in kcal/mol*K, T is the temperature in K, N<sub>i</sub> is the population of bin i, and N<sub>0</sub> is the population of the most populated bin.</p><p>RMSD and Rgyr were calculated using rms and rog methods available in CPPTRAJ with their respective crystal structure as a reference. The data were obtained from three individual 2.5 µs repeats at room temperature. Rgyr represents the Radius of Gyration for the protein without loops. The loops were omitted during the Free Energy calculation to avoid false positives. Rog represents the Radius of Gyration for the entire protein. Principle Component Analysis was performed on Ub, Fat10D1, Fat10D2, and their respective salt bridge mutants. PCA was also performed for Fat10D1-Ub, Fat10D2-Ub, and Ub-Fat10D2 using the Bio3D package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant et al., 2006</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>. PDB format trajectory was further produced that interpolates between the most dissimilar structures in the distribution along PC1. To obtain contact maps, per-residue native and non-native contacts were calculated from trajectories, normalized, and plotted using GNUplot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements</title><p>The Far-UV CD data was collected using Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter in a 1 mm cylindrical quartz cuvette, using a 1 nm/s scan speed from 200 to 250 nm with a digital integration time of 4 s.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. UbiquitinK0 construct ends with GV whereas the FAT10 constructs end with AV. AX is a known C-end degron, which may affect the degradation of FAT10 constructs. For comparison, the authors should have used the same ending sequences for both ubiquitin and FAT10.</p><p>2. The in vitro purification of FAT10 constructs possess mutations on residues C7A, C9A, C160A and C162A whereas for cellular studies the wt FAT10 construct has been used. The author should have tested both mutant and wt in parallel for cellular studies to confirm that both mutant and wt behave the same way in cellulo. It remains unclear what role these cysteines play in the thermal stability of FAT10 constructs.</p><p>3. Since Ubiquitin can form chains and it is the polyubiquitin chain that is recognized by the proteasome, it is not plausible to compare single ubiquitin with diUb-like FAT10. For the MD-based unfolding studies the authors have used diUb for comparison but for the other experiments, single ubiquitin was chosen. Since FAT10 cannot form chains, it is ideal to compare FAT10 with diUb and should have been tested for in vitro unfolding and cellular degradation experiments. For cellular experiments, it would have been interesting to see the comparison of monoUb with FAT10D1 or FAT10D2 tags as compared to FL FAT10.</p><p>4. When we compare the GdnCl melt curves of Ub, FAT010D1 and FAT10D2 with the ASMD-based unfolding shown in Figure 2 we find differences in the results for unfolding.

We have now performed the assay with UbK0AV and compared it with Fat10AV (Figure 1E). The corresponding gel data are plotted in Figure 1 Supplemental 1E.

For in-vitro studies, due to solubility issues, we used the Cys-to-Ala mutant Fat10. The Cys-mutant is commonly used to study Fat10 under in-vitro conditions and has been utilized by other laboratories [Truongvan, N., Li, S., Misra, M. et al. Structures of UBA6 explain its dual specificity for ubiquitin and FAT10. Nat Commun 13, 4789 (2022); Aichem, A., Anders, S., Catone, N. <italic>et al.</italic> The structure of the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 reveals an alternative targeting mechanism for proteasomal degradation. <italic>Nat Commun</italic> 9, 3321 (2018)].</p><p>Given that our study shows that Fat10 has lower thermal stability than Ub, there may be a concern about whether cysteine mutations are causing the difference in stability. However, previous research has shown that the cysteine mutant has a comparable melting temperature with wild-type Fat10 (wild-type Tm=41°C, Cys-mutant Tm=47°C, ∆Tm=6°C), suggesting that the cysteines have a negligible role in the thermal stability of Fat10 [Aichem, A., Anders, S., Catone, N. <italic>et al.</italic> The structure of the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 reveals an alternative targeting mechanism for proteasomal degradation. <italic>Nat Commun</italic> 9, 3321 (2018)]. In comparison, the ∆Tm between ubiquitin and fat10 is 40C, which is significantly higher. Moreover, the wild-type Fat10 has lower stability than the cysteine mutant, which supports our conclusion. Repeating the cellular experiments with the cysteine-mutant may not be essential, as the thermal stability of the cysteine-mutant and wild-type Fat10 are comparable. We have now mentioned this point with appropriate references in the text in page 38, lines 3-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have now compared the stability of diUb-GFP and Fat10-GFP in cells (Figure 5A). Moreover, we have also compared the stability of monoUb-GFP with Fat10D1-GFP in cells (Figure 5B). These measurements confirm a substantial change in the substrate's stability when conjugated to Fat10.</p><p>Unfortunately, cloning a diUb-CFP for in-vitro studies was challenging for some technical reasons. However, we can compare the monoUb-CFP, Fat10D1-CFP, and Fat10D2-CFP melts in Figure 6A to note a substantial effect of Fat10 domains on the substrate’s stability compared to Ub. We have changed the text in the page 24, line 14 to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This could be correlated with the observations of the ASMD-based unfolding study.</p></disp-quote><p>In the GdnCl experiments, Ub had higher ∆Gunfolding and greater stability than Fat10D1 and Fat10D2. When we performed melting experiments without any chemical denaturant, Ub again showed higher stability than Fat10 domains (Figure 1J, last column). If we understand correctly, this is the experiment the reviewer has suggested.</p><p>In the ASMD, Ub required more work to unfold than Fat10 domains, suggesting that Ub has higher mechanical stability than Fat10. Overall, the chemical melt, temperature melt, and ASMD results are in sync, suggesting higher stability in Ub.</p><p>The difference in unfolding energy between Ub and Fat10 domains is distinct in chemical unfolding and mechanical unfolding. It is important to note that comparing the GdnCl melt curves with ASMD-based unfolding results involves contrasting two fundamentally different techniques. Previous studies have reported that the unfolding pathways and the ΔG values obtained from different techniques, such as mechanical unfolding and chemical denaturation, are not directly comparable [Stirnemann G, et al., How force unfolding differs from chemical denaturation. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014;111(9):3413-8]. Similarly, mechanical unfolding and temperature melts are not directly comparable [Tapia-Rojo R, et al., Thermal versus mechanical unfolding in a model protein. J Chem Phys. 2019;151(18):185105]. Hence, we have considered the inherent disparities between chemical denaturation, thermal melts, and mechanical unfolding, which is crucial when interpreting the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 544-550 / Figure 5: Was unmodified CRABP1 unfolding by urea monitored by a 0-3M urea titration as the Ub- and FAT10-modified proteins were? This would be a particularly useful control to show in Figure 5, and to complement the work shown in Figure 6 for CFP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have now provided the in-cell urea-mediated unfolding of CRABP1 as Figure 5 Supplemental 1F. The engineered CRABP1 protein was fairly stable as shown in Figure 5E, but was severely destabilized by Fat10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 581-583 / 697-700: The manuscript is somewhat confusing on the specificity of Ub/FAT10-interactions with substrates and their effects on substrate specificity. The CFP work (581-583) is non-specific, but the Ub work (697-700) suggests differences that are quite dependent on attachment point of the tag onto the substrate. While perhaps not truly &quot;specific&quot; per se, the attachment point dependence suggests some degree of specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has rightly pointed out that in the substrate ubiquitin when we attached Fat10 to either N- or C-terminus, we observed a site-specific effect of Fat10 conjugation on the substrate’s free energy. While this paper was in review, we investigated this further by studying the site-specific effect of Fat10 conjugation on three distinct substrates. [Ravichandran A, et al., “The Thermodynamic Properties of Fat10ylated Proteins Are Regulated by the Fat10ylation Site,” ACS Omega, 2024,9(20):22265-22276]. Conjugation sites near negatively charged or neutral surfaces in the substrates have a more significant effect on substrate energies than positively charged surfaces. When the site is around a positively charged surface, the negatively charged Fat10 D2 domain forms stable interactions with the surface, reducing the conformational flexibility of the Fat10 tag and its effect on the substrate. This point has now been included in the discussion in page 34, line 15 (in track changes).</p><p>Recent studies have studied the specific effects of Ub-conjugation [Carroll EC, et al., Site-specific ubiquitination affects protein energetics and proteasomal degradation. Nat Chem Biol. 2020 Aug;16(8):866-875]. Together, these studies suggest specificity in tag/substrate interactions, which could be a regulatory process to avoid inadvertent degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, I encourage a review of the presentation – this was a challenging manuscript to review given the extensive use of supplementary information (could some of these data be moved into the main work or removed?). Figure legends varied in format substantially across the manuscript on account of their level of detail or summary; some were quite clear (e.g. Figure 2) while others less so (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. Much of the supplementary information for Figures 2, 3, and 7 has been incorporated into the main figures. Figure 7 has been split into two figures for this purpose. A few of the redundant supplementary figures have been removed. The discrepancy between figure legends has been resolved. All figure (including supplementary figure) legends have a summary sentence and are more detailed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 505-507: needs to be explicitly stated that these are 15N relaxation parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now explicitly stated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
