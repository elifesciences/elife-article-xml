obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers in mice. Conversely, <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis in mice without exogenous ligand. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige human or mouse adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selective overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>ADGRA3</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>hesperetin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017610</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20190807154205627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhonghan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017621</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Key Laboratory Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZDSYS20220606100803007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhonghan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ADGRA3 signaling promotes adipose thermogenesis via Gs-PKA-CREB, suggesting hesperetin and ADGRA3 overexpression as obesity therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since 1975, there has been a substantial increase in the global prevalence of obesity, with the magnitude nearly tripling. The World Health Organization projects that the prevalence of obesity among adults will exceed 20% by the year 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Organization WH, 2021</xref>). Currently, the management of excessive adiposity poses a paramount economic burden and healthcare predicament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the detrimental social and psychological implications, a multitude of studies have consistently demonstrated a significant association between obesity and an increased vulnerability to a range of health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Twig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hyppönen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calle, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Activating and maintaining the thermogenesis of beige/brown fat has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yoneshiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finlin et al., 2020</xref>). As a well-established β-adrenergic GPCR, the β3-AR has been identified as a prominent target for stimulating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Regrettably, the clinical application of β3-AR has been impeded due to its low expression in human adipocytes and the cardiovascular risks associated with other adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blondin et al., 2020</xref>). G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most prevalent class of drug targets among all drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They also play a crucial role in the clinical treatment of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Müller et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alba et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is of clinical significance to identify novel GPCR targets that induce adipose thermogenesis.</p><p>ADGRA3 is classified as an orphan adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) and exhibits the typical domains found in aGPCRs within its N-terminal extracellular region (ECR), including a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig), a hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a GAIN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nybo et al., 2023</xref>). ADGRA3 was initially discovered as a distinctive indicator of various spermatogonial progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spiess et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Seandel et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the orphan status of receptors has posed challenges to the study of aGPCRs. However, these studies have also uncovered a conservative mechanism of aGPCR activation, which involves the use of tethered ligands in the GAIN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vizurraga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hamann et al., 2015</xref>). ADGRA3 has been previously identified as a receptor capable of auto-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sakurai et al., 2022</xref>). However, the functional activity of ADGRA3 in a constructive manner is still uncertain. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated a significant correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADGRA3 and body weight in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cha et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the precise role of ADGRA3 in the progression of obesity and adipose thermogenesis remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate three main aspects: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Organization WH, 2021</xref>) the impact of ADGRA3 on browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2018</xref>) the effects of ADGRA3 on metabolic homeostasis, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) the underlying mechanisms by which ADGRA3 induces adipose thermogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADGRA3 is identified as a potential GPCR inducing the development of beige fat</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of three datasets to identify ADGRA3 as a potential GPCR target that promotes the development of beige fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These DEGs were further screened to identify highly expressed GPCRs in BAT relative to WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red). We conducted additional annotation on 1134 DEGs and identified that 27 of these genes were associated with the encoding of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Among the set of 27 genes, it was found that 24 genes were not present in the group of genes that exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes, as determined by the human protein atlas database. Consequently, these 24 genes were excluded from further analysis. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and discovered that out of the three remaining GPCRs namely ADGRA3, ADRA1A, and ADRB1, only ADGRA3 has not been documented to have any association with brown fat. Therefore, our research subsequently shifted towards investigating the potential regulatory role of ADGRA3 in obesity and brown fat.</p><p>The findings indicated that the level of <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in mouse adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) was comparatively lower than that of <italic>Adrb3</italic>, the coding gene for β3-AR.

ADGRA3 is responsible for the activation of the adipose thermogenic program and plays a significant role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis. Additionally, the development of beige adipocytes induced by hesperetin is contingent upon the presence of ADGRA3. The novelty of this study is the discovery that ADGRA3 plays a role in the advancement of beige fat and the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. This suggests that targeting the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway could potentially be a therapeutic approach for obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p><p>The induction of beige fat has been investigated as a potentially effective therapeutic approach in combating obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>). A clinical trial revealed that treatment with the chronic β3-AR agonist mirabegron leads to an increase in human brown fat, HDL cholesterol, and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">O’Mara et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequently, Blondin et al discovered that oral administration of mirabegron only elicits an increase in BAT thermogenesis when administered at the maximal allowable dose, indicating that human brown adipocyte thermogenesis is primarily driven by β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blondin et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we found much higher levels of ADRB2 expression in human white adipose tissue than ADRB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that simultaneous activation of β2-AR and β3-AR enhances whole-body metabolism through beneficial effects on skeletal muscle and BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Talamonti et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>While the promotion of thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes in rodents was effectively achieved by the β3-adrenoceptor agonist, the clinical implications of this finding appear to be unfeasible in humans due to the low efficacy of β3-adrenoceptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kajimura et al., 2015</xref>). It is of utmost importance to investigate alternative therapeutic targets that can effectively and selectively enhance beige adipogenesis in order to combat obesity and its related metabolic disorders. In this study, we have identified ADGRA3 as a novel GPCR therapeutic target that exhibits high expression in human adipocytes. In human adipose tissue, ADGRA3 is expressed at a lower level than ADRB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> E), which has been shown to be the main receptor mediating adrenergic activation of thermogenesis in human brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blondin et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, given ADRB2’s pivotal role in bronchodilation and vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hizawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Morell et al., 2021</xref>), we believe that ADGRA3 has the potential to be an alternative target for inducing adipose thermogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that ADGRA3, when overexpressed or stimulated by its potential agonist, hesperetin, can induce the biogenesis of beige fat.</p><p>Hesperetin has been reported to attenuate the age-related metabolic decline, reduce fat and improve glucose homeostasis in naturally aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yeh et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies showed that hesperetin improved glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yeh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xue et al., 2016</xref>) and was involved in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Subash-Babu and Alshatwi, 2015</xref>), but whether hesperetin induces the biogenesis of beige adipocyte was uncertain. Previously, the influence of hesperetin on ADGRA3 has remained unreported. In this study, we screened hesperetin as a potential agonist for ADGRA3 by using the PRESTO-Salsa tool as well as discovered that hesperetin has an agonist effect on ADGRA3 through a series of experiments. This study focuses on the regulatory effect of hesperetin on adipose thermogenesis and explores whether this effect is dependent upon ADGRA3. As such, we refrained from conducting further investigations into other potential effects of hesperidin, including its potential role in antioxidant and in apoptosis.</p><p>In previous reports, male mice deficient in ADGRA3 showed obstructive azoospermia with high penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nybo et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, a GWAS identified an SNP located in the downstream region of <italic>ADGRA3</italic> as a genomic locus associated with body weight in chickens, suggesting that the ADGRA3 is a potential regulator of body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cha et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the agonist and the downstream signal axis of ADGRA3 remain unclear as well as the effects of ADGRA3 on adipose thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis have not been explored. Consequently, our study has confirmed that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> exacerbates obesity and disrupts glucose homeostasis. Additionally, both the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and the administration of hesperetin have been found to stimulate the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway and improve glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Given the consideration that the non-targeted nanoparticle approach utilized in this study for modulating <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression levels in vivo alter <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in tissues beyond adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>), notably the liver and skeletal muscle, the construction of <italic>Adgra3</italic> adipose tissue-specific knockout/overexpression mouse models is imperative for a more nuanced understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the influence of on adipose thermogenesis. Furthermore, it is crucial to highlight that the observed decrease in TG levels in both serum and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>) might be attributed to the significant increase in <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in the liver, which is a consequence of the nanoparticle-mediated overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic>. While the exact mechanism remains to be fully elucidated, this correlation suggests a potential link between <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in the liver and reduced TG levels in the serum. We will employ more sophisticated models in subsequent studies to further elucidate the effects of ADGRA3 on adipose thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Nevertheless, our findings underlie a potential therapeutic feature of ADGRA3 and hesperetin in obesity and the associated metabolic diseases from the thermogenic viewpoint of beige fat.</p><p>In conclusion, the activation of the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis by ADGRA3 has been found to induce adipose thermogenesis, promote lipid metabolism, and alleviate lipid accumulation in adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, the induction of beige adipocyte biogenesis by hesperetin occurs through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis. Given the importance of identifying signaling pathways that induce beige fat and alleviate obesity-related dysfunction in adipose tissue, our research findings suggest that hesperetin and activation of the intracellular signaling of ADGRA3 could serve as a promising and innovative therapeutic approach.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract.</title><p>This schema summarizes the main roles and functions of ADGRA3 in lipid metabolism.

Genetic approaches to deplete ADGRA3 expression in vitro resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic genes including Ucp1, reduced basal respiration and metabolic activity as reflected by reduced glucose uptake and triglyceride accumulation. In line, nanoparticle delivery of shAdgra3 constructs is associated with increased body weight, reduced thermogenic gene expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT, BAT), and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. On the other hand, ADGRA3 overexpression is associated with an improved metabolic profile in vitro and in vivo, which can be explained by increasing the activity of the well-established Gs-PKA-CREB axis. Notably, a computational screen suggested that ADGRA3 is activated by hesperetin. This metabolite is a derivative of the major citrus flavonoid hesperidin and has been described to promote metabolic health. Using appropriate in vitro and in vivo studies, the authors show that hesperitin supplementation is associated with increased thermogenesis, UCP1 levels in WAT and BAT, and improved glucose tolerance, an effect that was attenuated in the absence of ADGRA3 expression.</p><p>The revised manuscript fails to address several reviewer concerns, such as the measurement of whole-body energy expenditure

the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article identifies ADGR3 as a candidate GPCR for mediating beige fat development. The authors use human expression data from Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases and combine this with experiments performed in mice and a murine cell line. They refer to a GPCR bioactivity screening tool PRESTO-Salsa, with which it was found that Hesperetin activates ADGR3. From their experiments, authors conclude that Hesperetin activates ADGR3, inducing a Gs-PKA-CREB axis resulting in adipose thermogenesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors analyze human data from public databases and perform functional studies in mouse models. They identify a new GPCR with a role in thermogenic activation of adipocytes.</p><p>Considerations:</p><p>Selection of ADGRA3 as a candidate GPCR relevant for mediating beiging in humans:</p><p>The authors identify GPCRs that are expressed more highly in murine iBAT compared to iWAT in response to cold and assess which of these GPCRs are expressed in human subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes. Although this strategy will identify GPCRs that are expressed at higher levels in brown fat compared to beige and thus possibly more active in thermogenic function, the relevance in choosing GPCRs that also are expressed in unstimulated human white adipocytes should be considered. Thermogenic activity is not normally present in human white adipocytes. It would have strengthened the GPCR selection if the authors instead had assessed the intersection with human brown adipocytes that were activated with norepinephrine.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your constructive feedback and believe that by adopting this refined strategy, we will strengthen our selection of GPCRs related to adipose thermogenesis in other ongoing studies. We look forward to continuing our research in this area and contributing to the understanding of adipose thermogenesis and its potential therapeutic applications. Thank you once again for your valuable input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strategy to investigate the role of ADGRA3 in WAT beiging:</p><p>Having identified ADGRA3 as their candidate receptor, the authors investigated the receptor in mouse models, the murine inguinal adipocyte cell line 3T3 and in human subcutaneous adipose progenitors (HAdsc) differentiated in vitro. Calling the human cells &quot;beige&quot; is a stretch as these cells are derived from a white adipose depot. The authors do observe regulation in UCP1 and abundance of mitochondria following modification of ADGRA3 in the cells. However, in future studies, it should be considered if the receptor rather plays a role in differentiation per se, and perhaps not specifically in thermogenic differentiation/activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the reviewer's suggestion to consider whether ADGRA3 plays a role in differentiation per se, rather than specifically in thermogenic differentiation/activity, we acknowledge that this is an important consideration. Our current studies have focused on the role of ADGRA3 in regulating UCP1 expression and mitochondrial abundance, which are hallmarks of adipose thermogenic activity. However, we recognize that ADGRA3 may also have broader roles in adipocyte differentiation and function that are not limited to thermogenesis.</p><p>To address this point, in future studies, we plan to conduct additional experiments to investigate the potential role of ADGRA3 in adipocyte differentiation, including its effects on the expression of markers of adipocyte differentiation and its impact on adipocyte metabolism and function. These studies will provide further insights into the mechanisms by which ADGRA3 regulates adipocyte biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases, ADGRA3 is not only expressed in adipocytes, but also in other tissues and cell types. The authors address this by measuring the expression in a panel of these tissues, demonstrating a knockdown not only in the adipose tissue, but also in the liver and less pronounced in the muscle (Figure S2). It should thus be emphasized that the decreased TG levels in serum and liver in the mice might in fact depend on Adgra3 overexpression in the liver. Even though this might not have been the purpose of the experiment, it is important to highlight this as it could serve as hypothesis building for future studies of the function of this receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments and feedback. We appreciate the insight provided by the Human Protein Atlas and Gtex databases regarding the tissue distribution of ADGRA3. We fully acknowledge that the decreased TG levels observed in both the serum and liver of the mice might be linked to the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> in the liver.</p><p>Although this was not the primary objective of our experiment, we agree that this observation is worth highlighting as it could serve as a basis for future hypothesis-driven research on the functional role of ADGRA3 in different tissues.

Moreover, as the authors stated that ADGRA3 is constitutively active, how could the authors then identify a chemical ligand?</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The revised manuscript by Zhao et al. has limited improvement. The authors refused to perform revised experiments using primary cultures even though two reviewers pointed out the same weakness (3T3-L1 adipocytes are unsuitable). Using infrared thermography to measure body temperature is also problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We regret that human adipocytes induced from human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were not recognized as primary cultures by multiple reviewers. Therefore, we have included relevant experimental results of mouse primary adipocytes induced from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in Figure 8E-H as a supplement. The thermal imaging device was used to measure the temperature of BAT, while the body temperature was measured at 9:00 using a rectal probe connected to a digital thermometer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
