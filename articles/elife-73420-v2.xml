However, human geroprotector trials face a barrier when it comes to outcome measures: humans’ long lifespan makes it prohibitively time-consuming to test whether a treatment extends healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Justice et al., 2018</xref>). What is needed is a way to measure each clinical trial participant’s personal pace of biological aging, before, during, after, and at long-term follow-up, to test whether a gero-protective therapy slows that pace, and whether benefits fade out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moffitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>An ideal research design for isolating biological patterns that differentiate faster and slower aging is longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of individuals who are all the same chronological age. We originally applied this design to test the geroscience-derived hypothesis that the process of biological aging was ongoing in healthy young adults and, critically, that it was already variable across individuals decades before most chronic diseases onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>). We studied a single-year birth cohort of all 1037 babies born in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand, during 1972–1973 and followed-up through midlife. Because aging can be understood as gradual, progressive deterioration simultaneously affecting different organ systems, we tracked declines in the cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, hepatic, immune, periodontal, and pulmonary systems of each participant using multiple biomarker measurements of each organ system, first at ages 26, 32, and 38 years, and subsequently including a fourth assessment at age 45 years. Modeling this one-of-a-kind dataset yielded a metric which quantified how slowly or rapidly each participant had been aging. We called this metric the Pace of Aging.</p><p>People with faster Pace of Aging tend to experience more rapid aging-related decline in physical and cognitive functions and develop early signs of brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasmussen et al., 2019</xref>). This evidence suggests that intervention to slow Pace of Aging could preserve functions lost with aging and extend healthspan. However, Pace of Aging takes many years to measure and requires data from several types of clinical and biological assays, limiting its utility in clinical trials. To address this limitation, we applied machine-learning tools to genome-wide DNA methylation data from Dunedin cohort members’ blood samples to distill the multi-timepoint, multi-assay Pace of Aging measure into a single-timepoint, single-assay blood biomarker previously described in this journal: DunedinPoAm (for Dunedin Study Pace of Aging from methylation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>). DunedinPoAm was designed to measure Pace of Aging biological change over time from a single blood sample. Like the original Pace of Aging, people with faster DunedinPoAm scores more often experienced declines in cognitive and physical functioning by midlife and showed more rapid facial aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>; in older adults, faster DunedinPoAm predicted increased risk of disease and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graf et al., 2021</xref>); in young people, experiences of early-life adversity were linked to faster DunedinPoAm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raffington et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>DunedinPoAm provided proof of concept that Pace of Aging could be measured from a single blood test. But DunedinPoAm was based on biological change observed over just twelve years spanning the transition from young adulthood to midlife, limiting the scope of biological change that could be observed. And this biological change was measured from just three assessment waves, limiting precision. In addition, similar to other DNA methylation composites measured from microarray data, the measure had only moderate test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higgins-Chen et al., 2021</xref>), limiting its value to clinical trials seeking to test within-participant changes from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up. To address these limitations, we incorporated new data from the Dunedin cohort extending Pace of Aging follow-up to include a fourth measurement occasion in the fifth decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>) and restricted DNA-methylation data to exclude probes with poor reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>) to refine our DNA-methylation biomarker of Pace of Aging. The longer follow-up period, which allowed us to observe more aging-related change in system integrity, and the additional measurement occasion included in analysis improve the power and precision of our modeling of longitudinal change in system integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandmaier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rast and Hofer, 2014</xref>). The refined DNA-methylation dataset used for machine-learning improves reliability of measurement. We name the novel algorithm DunedinPACE, for Dunedin (P)ace of (A)ging (C)alculated from the (E)pigenome.</p><p>As a new DNA methylation measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE joins a well-established battery of DNA methylation measures known as ‘clocks’, so-named for their accurate prediction of chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>). However, DunedinPACE is distinct from the DNA methylation clocks in the method of its design and in its interpretation. DunedinPACE is derived from analysis of longitudinal data collected from a cohort of individuals who are all the same chronological age. It reflects differences between those individuals in the rate of deterioration in system integrity occurring over a fixed time interval, age 26 to age 45 years. It therefore has three distinguishing features that isolate aging from other confounds: (1) analysis of a single-year birth cohort distinguishes aging from confounding effects of exposures to factors that alter the methylome and that differ across generations, referred to hereafter as ‘cohort effects’; (2) initiation of follow-up in young adults distinguishes aging from the effects of disease and excludes contamination from survival bias; and (3) focus on changes in multi-organ-system integrity during adult life distinguishes ongoing aging processes from deficits established early in development. The clocks, in contrast, were developed using a single cross-section of data from samples of mixed-age and older adults. They do not distinguish aging from cohort effects, are vulnerable to survival bias and contamination of aging signal by disease processes, and do not distinguish aging-related changes from prenatal/childhood deficits. DunedinPACE, therefore, represents a complementary tool with useful advantages for DNA methylation quantification of biological aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We developed the DunedinPACE measure reported here by analyzing the pace of biological aging in a 1972–1973 birth cohort (N = 1037), the Dunedin Study.

The first part of analysis followed our original method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>) to quantify Pace of Aging from two decades of longitudinal organ-system integrity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>). First, we measured longitudinal changes in 19 biomarkers assessing cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, hepatic, immune, dental, and pulmonary systems, measured at ages 26, 32, 38 and, most recently in 2019, 45 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> provides measurement details about the tracked biomarkers). Second, linear mixed-effects modeling was used to fit growth models to estimate each study member’s personal rate of change for each of the 19 biomarkers. Third, these 19 personal rates of change were combined across biomarkers to calculate each Study member’s personal Pace of Aging. In line with the geroscience hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>), which states that aging represents progressive decline across organ systems, we calculated each Study member’s Pace of Aging as the sum of age-dependent annual changes across all biomarkers: Pace of Aging<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>19</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> μ<sub>1<italic>iB</italic></sub>. The resulting Pace of Aging was then scaled to a mean of 1, so that it could be interpreted with reference to an average rate of 1 year of biological aging per year of chronological aging. Study members showed wide variation in their Pace of Aging (Mean = 1 biological year per chronological year, SD = 0.29). Over the two decades that we measured biological aging, the Study member with the slowest Pace of Aging aged by just 0.40 biological years per chronological year, while the Study member with the fastest Pace of Aging accrued 2.44 biological years per chronological year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>The second part of the analysis followed our original method to distill Pace of Aging into a blood test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>). Using Illumina EPIC array DNA methylation data from blood collected at age 45, we developed DunedinPACE to provide a surrogate for the 20-year Pace of Aging. Briefly, we used elastic-net-regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou and Hastie, 2005</xref>) to develop a DNA methylation algorithm to predict the 20-year Pace of Aging. Analysis included the subset of probes included on both the Illumina 450 k and EPIC arrays which we previously determined to have acceptable test-retest reliability (ICC &gt;0.4, n = 81,2392) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>). Following the method established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horvath, 2013</xref> and used in our prior analysis, we fixed the alpha parameter of the elastic net at 0.5. The final lamda value selected by the analysis was 0.042. The resulting algorithm included 173 CpG sites.

Compared to the original DunedinPoAm, covariate adjustment for smoking tended to have a smaller impact on effect-size estimates for DunedinPACE.

However, DunedinPACE is moderately correlated with some DNA methylation clocks, in particular GrimAge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We therefore conducted analysis to test if DunedinPACE contributed new information about health-span and lifespan over and above existing DNA methylation clocks. We tested if DunedinPACE associations with morbidity, disability, and mortality were statistically independent of each of the DNA methylation clocks within the Framingham Heart Study. In the case of the GrimAge clock, which was developed to predict mortality using this Framingham dataset, this analysis provides an especially rigorous test.</p><p>DunedinPACE associations with health-span endpoints were little-changed by covariate adjustment for the Horvath, Hannum, or PhenoAge Clocks. In models adjusted for GrimAge, DunedinPACE associations with mortality, CVD, and disability were attenuated, but remained statistically different from zero (mortality HR = 1.24 [1.49–1.74], CVD HR = 1.18 [1.05–1.34], Nagi ADL IRR = 1.27 [1.02–1.58], Katz ADL IRR = 1.26 [1.02–1.54], Rosow-Breslau ADL IRR = 1.27 [1.08–1.50]); associations with stroke were similar to unadjusted models (HR = 1.33 [1.05–1.69]).

Thus, Dunedin PACE adds incremental prediction over and above all clocks studied here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed a novel DNA methylation measure of the pace of biological aging from analysis of two decades of longitudinal data from members of the Dunedin Study 1972–1973 birth cohort. The new measure is named DunedinPACE. As in our original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2020</xref>), we utilized a two-step approach that first modeled the Pace of Aging from within-individual changes in organ-system integrity markers and then distilled this longitudinal change measure into a single-time-point DNA-methylation blood test. DunedinPACE is therefore distinct from the DNA methylation clocks in both theory and method. The clocks estimate the progress of aging up to a cross-section in time. DunedinPACE is a DNA methylation estimate of the Pace of Aging, the ongoing rate of decline in system integrity.</p><p>The DunedinPACE measure advances DNA methylation measurement of the Pace of Aging for clinical trials of geroprotective therapies beyond our original DunedinPoAm measure in four ways: (1) Pace of Aging analysis included 20 years of follow-up (instead of 12); (2) Pace of Aging analysis included four time points of measurement (instead of three); (3) DNA methylation modeling of Pace of Aging excluded CpG sites for which probes were determined to have low test-retest reliability in blood datasets; (4) the algorithm to implement DunedinPACE includes a normalization step that allows DunedinPACE values for individual samples to be compared to the Dunedin Study cohort in which the measure was developed.</p><p>As a result of these advances, DunedinPACE provides a more precise measurement of the Pace of Aging as compared to the original DunedinPoAm and shows higher test-retest reliability. Interestingly, in contrast to reports for some epigenetic clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higgins-Chen et al., 2021</xref>), the restriction of machine learning analysis to a more-reliably-measured subset of CpG sites on the Illumina EPIC array did not harm criterion validity of DunedinPACE; effect-sizes for prediction of morbidity and mortality were as large or larger in comparison to DunedinPoAm. Analysis of this more precise and reliable measurement revealed stronger associations with signs of aging. DunedinPACE showed a stronger correlation with chronological age as compared to the original DunedinPoAm, consistent with demographic evidence that biological processes of aging accelerate in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finch and Crimmins, 2016</xref>). In analysis of construct and criterion validity, DunedinPACE was associated with functional decline in midlife adults; it was correlated with measures of biological age derived from blood chemistry and DNA methylation data, and with research participants’ subjective perceptions of their own health; it was predictive of morbidity and mortality in midlife and older adults; and it indicated faster Pace of Aging in young adults with histories of exposure to poverty and victimization. DunedinPACE effect-sizes were similar to or larger than those for the original DunedinPoAm measure even as DunedinPACE was less influenced by participant smoking history. In analysis that took smoking history into account, DunedinPACE effect-sizes were more robust than those for DunedinPoAm, most notably in analysis of mortality in the Framingham Heart Study and of early-life adversity in the E-Risk cohort.</p><p>DunedinPACE effect-sizes in analysis of construct and criterion validity were also larger than those for benchmark DNA methylation clocks proposed by Horvath, Hannum et al., and Levine et al. (PhenoAge), and similar to those for the clock proposed by Lu et al. (GrimAge), and were robust to covariate adjustment for smoking and DNA methylation estimates of cell counts. Moreover, in Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort analysis of incremental predictive validity, DunedinPACE associations with morbidity, disability, and mortality were robust to covariate adjustment for the DNA methylation clocks, including GrimAge, although some associations were attenuated in GrimAge-adjusted models. Framingham analysis represents a decisive test of value added by DunedinPACE over and above GrimAge because GrimAge was developed within the Framingham cohort.</p><p>In sum, DunedinPACE represents a novel measure of aging that is conceptually and empirically distinct from the DNA methylation clocks and that constitutes an advance on the original DunedinPoAm measure. DunedinPACE can complement existing DNA methylation measures of aging in analysis of observational studies and randomized trials to help advance the frontiers of geroscience.</p><p>We acknowledge limitations. Foremost, the Dunedin Study sample we analyzed to develop DunedinPACE is a relatively modestly sized cohort and is drawn from a single country. As additional cohorts develop the multi-time-point organ-system-function datasets to model Pace of Aging, integrating these data into DNA methylation algorithms to measure Pace of Aging may enhance precision. Nevertheless, DunedinPACE does show consistent evidence of criterion and construct validity in several additional datasets, boosting confidence in its external validity. In addition, our work on DunedinPACE thus far has not addressed population diversity in biological aging. The Dunedin cohort and the Understanding Society, NAS, Framingham, and E-Risk cohorts were mostly of white European descent. Follow-up of DunedinPACE in more diverse samples is needed to establish cross-population validity. Importantly, our original DunedinPoAm measure has been followed-up in diverse cohorts and has showed evidence of consistent validity across race/ethnic subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crimmins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raffington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmitz et al., 2021</xref>). Criterion validity analyses conducted in this article do not consider specific diseases or causes of death because the cohorts used for follow-up are relatively small. Geroscience theory predicts aging should increase risk of chronic disease and death overall. Analysis of DunedinPACE in larger datasets with more deaths will allow for tests of whether particular incident diseases or causes of death drive associations. Comparative analyses in this article include only other DNA methylation measures of aging. Recent reports suggest valuable information about aging and healthspan may also be captured in metabolomic and proteomic datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deelen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eiriksdottir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies should compare DunedinPACE to measures derived from these biological levels of analysis. As with all proposed measures of biological aging, ultimately establishing DunedinPACE as a surrogate endpoint for healthspan will require evidence that it is modifiable by intervention and that intervention-induced changes result in changes in healthy-lifespan phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Justice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prentice, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Within the bounds of these limitations, our analysis establishes DunedinPACE as a novel single-time-point measure that quantifies Pace of Aging from a blood test. It can be implemented in Illumina 450 k or in EPIC array data, making it immediately available for testing in a wide range of existing datasets as a complement to existing methylation measures of aging. Code to compute DunedinPACE is publicly available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corcoran et al., 2022</xref>). Through collaboration with ongoing cohort studies, DunedinPACE will soon be available from the US Health and Retirement Study and other studies. Because of its high test-retest reliability, DunedinPACE offers a unique measurement for intervention trials and natural experiment studies investigating how the rate of aging may be changed by behavioral or drug therapy, or by environmental modification.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources</title><p>Data were used from five studies: The Dunedin Study, the Understanding Society Study, the Normative Aging Study (NAS), the Framingham Heart Study, and the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study.

Briefly, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999–2000, when 1116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 56% monozygotic (MZ) and 44% dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). Families were recruited to represent the UK population of families with newborns in the 1990s, on the basis of residential location throughout England and Wales and mother’s age. Teenaged mothers with twins were over-selected to replace high-risk families who were selectively lost to the register through non-response.

The criterion variable was 20-year Pace of Aging. Development of the 20-year Pace of Aging is described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021b</xref>). Briefly, we conducted mixed-effects growth modeling of longitudinal change in 19 biomarkers measuring integrity of the cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, periodontal, and immune systems. Biomarkers were measured at the age 26, 32, 38, and 45 assessments. Biomarkers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. For each biomarker, we estimated random slopes quantifying each participant’s own rate of change in that biomarker. We then composited, the 19 slopes across the biomarkers to calculate a participant’s Pace of Aging. Pace of Aging was scaled in units representing the mean trend in the cohort, that is the average physiological change occurring during one calendar year (N = 955, M = 1, SD = 0.29). Of the N = 818 Dunedin Study members with methylation data at age 45, N = 817 had measured Pace of Aging (M = 0.99, SD = 0.30). This group formed the analysis sample to develop DunedinPACE.</p><p>To compute DunedinPACE in the GSE55763, Understanding Society, NAS, Framingham, and E-Risk datasets, we applied the scoring algorithm derived from elastic net regression in the Dunedin Study. CpG weights for the scoring algorithm are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. To apply the scoring algorithm, a panel of 20,000 probes that represent the underlying distribution of all probes included in the analysis to develop DunedinPACE are drawn from the target dataset. This new dataset is then quantile-normalized to match the reference distribution from the Dunedin Study. The set of 20,000 probes is composed of the 173 probes that make up the DunedinPACE algorithm and 19,827 additional probes selected at random from the full set of probes included in analysis to develop DunedinPACE i.e probes passing quality control checks, which are included on Illumina 450 k and EPIC arrays, and which were reliable at an ICC threshold of 0.4 in the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We conducted analysis of Dunedin, GSE55763, Understanding Society, NAS, Framingham, and E-Risk, data using regression models. We analyzed continuous outcome data using linear regression. We analyzed count outcome data using Poisson and negative binomial regression. We analyzed time-to-event outcome data using Cox proportional hazard regression. To estimate intraclass correlation coefficients for technical replicates in GSE55763, we used mixed-effects regression models. For analysis of repeated-measures longitudinal DNA methylation data in the NAS, we used generalized estimating equations to account for non-independence of repeated observations of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballinger, 2016</xref>), following the method in previous analysis of those data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), and econometric fixed-effects regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wooldridge, 2012</xref>) to test within-person change over time. For analysis in E-Risk, which include data on twin siblings, we clustered standard errors at the family level to account for non-independence of data. For regression analysis, methylation measures were adjusted for batch effects by regressing the measure on batch controls and predicting residual values. Dunedin Study, Understanding Society, Framingham, and E-Risk analyses included covariate adjustment for sex (the NAS included only men). Understanding Society, NAS, and Framingham analyses included covariate adjustment for chronological age. (Dunedin and E-Risk are birth-cohort studies and participants are all the same chronological age.) Sensitivity analyses testing covariate adjustment for leukocyte distributions and smoking are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Leukocyte distributions were measured from complete blood count data in the Dunedin Cohort and were estimated from DNA methylation data for other cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Code for Analysis</title><p>Code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/danbelsky/DunedinPACE-eLife-2022">https://github.com/danbelsky/DunedinPACE-eLife-2022</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:eef3b4232ae87079a409a02f5582ed0b8ebbd060;origin=https://github.com/danbelsky/DunedinPACE-eLife-2022;visit=swh:1:snp:97e16d5328d312f824bbcac8c663713adf1e7822;anchor=swh:1:rev:e38233555b70c34f84f0b73e18f1a6bc4cb0852e">swh:1:rev:e38233555b70c34f84f0b73e18f1a6bc4cb0852e</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky, 2022a</xref>).</p><p>Code to calculate DunedinPACE from Illumina 450 k or Epic Array Data.

Outcome variables in Dunedin Study, Understanding Society Study, and E-Risk Study (Panels A, B, C, and E) were z-transformed for analysis; effect-sizes are interpretable as Pearson r or Cohen’s d. For Normative Aging Study and Framingham Analysis (Panel C), effect-sizes for time-to event outcomes are reported as hazard ratios (HR), effect-sizes for prevalent chronic disease are reported as Risk Ratios (RR), and effect-sizes for incident disability are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR). (<bold>A</bold>) Effect-sizes for associations of DunedinPACE, DunedinPoAm, and DNA methylation clocks with functional assessments at age 45 in the Dunedin Study. Effect-sizes are standardized coefficients from linear regressions of the outcomes on the aging measures. The models adjusted for cell counts (middle column of results) were adjusted for cell counts measured from complete blood count data (white blood cell count and percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). The models adjusted for smoking (left-most column of results) included a covariate for number of pack-years smoked. (<bold>B</bold>) Effect-sizes for associations of DunedinPACE, DunedinPoAm, and DNA methylation clocks with functional decline in the Dunedin Study. Decline was measured as change between the age-38 and age-45 assessments for all measures except cognition, for which change was computed over the interval beginning with an adolescent baseline test at age 13 and ending with the most recent cognitive assessment at age 45. Effect-sizes are coefficients from linear regressions of change scores on aging measures for all outcomes except incident fair/poor health, for which effect-sizes are risk ratios (RR) estimated from Poisson regression of incidence on the aging measures. Change scores were computed by standardizing baseline and follow-up measurements using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the baseline assessment and computing the difference in standardized scores. A single unit of change therefore corresponds to 1 SD of variation at baseline. Effect-sizes are reported for a one SD difference in the aging measures. The models adjusted for smoking (left-most column of results) included a covariate for number of pack-years smoked.

(<bold>D</bold>) Effect-sizes for associations of DunedinPACE, DunedinPoAm, and DNA methylation clocks with mortality, morbidity, and disability in the Normative Aging Study and the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. Effect-sizes are hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event analyses and relative risks (RR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for repeated-measures analyses. Analysis of mortality was conducted in both cohorts. Analysis of incident and prevalent chronic disease morbidity was conducted only in the Normative Aging Study. Time-to-event analysis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) and repeated measures analysis of incident disability were conducted only in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. The models adjusted for smoking included covariates for smoking history (pack-years smoked) in the Normative Aging Study and for smoking status and current smoking quantity (cigarettes per day) in the Framingham Heart Study.

developed using different sets of CpG sites.</p><p>DunedinPACE and DunedinPoAm were both developed from machine-learning analysis fitting DNA methylation data to Pace of Aging measures derived from longitudinal analysis of organ-function and blood chemistry data within the Dunedin Study.</p><p>There are two key differences between the measures. First, the Pace of Aging measure modeled to develop DunedinPoAm included data from only three repeated measures spanning 12 years of follow-up. In contrast, the Pace of Aging measure modeled to develop DunedinPACE included data from four repeated measurements collected over 20 years of follow-up. Second, DunedinPoAm was developed from a DNA methylation dataset including all probes included on both the Illumina450k and EPIC arrays. In contrast, the DNA methylation dataset used to develop DunedinPACE was restricted to a subset of CpG sites meeting a test-retest reliability threshold.</p><p>These differences should have two consequences for DunedinPACE. First, the inclusion of a 4<sup>th</sup> timepoint in Pace of Aging analysis should increase precision of measurement and result in improved fit of DNA methylation data to the 4-timepoint Pace of Aging criterion as compared to the 3-timepoint version. (A less precise Pace of Aging will be harder for the elastic net machine learning analysis to model since more of the variation will be random noise.) Second, the restriction of machine learning to more reliable CpG sites should result in improved test-retest reliability.</p><p>To further test these improvements, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. We repeated the machine-learning analysis to construct DunedinPACE using the unrestricted set of CpG sites included in the original DunedinPoAm analysis. We refer to the resulting measure as “All-probes DunedinPACE”. In parallel, we repeated the machine-learning analysis to construct DunedinPoAm using the subset of more-reliable CpG sites included in the original DunedinPACE analysis. We refer to the resulting measure as “Reliable Probes DunedinPoAm”. We then repeated our analyses testing correlation of the DNA methylation measures with the criterion Pace of Aging and our analysis of test-retest reliability.</p><p>Consistent with the expectation that a 4<sup>th</sup> timepoint would increase precision of Pace of Aging measurement and result in improved criterion fit, both versions of DunedinPACE showed stronger correlation with 4-timepoint Pace of Aging than did the versions of DunedinPoAm with 3-timepoint Pace of Aging. For algorithms trained on all probes, <italic>r</italic> = 0.87 DunedinPACE vs. <italic>r</italic> = 0.58 for original DunedinPoAm. For algorithms trained on reliable probes, <italic>r</italic> = 0.77 for DunedinPACE vs. <italic>r</italic> = 0.65 for DunedinPoAm.</p><p>Consistent with the expectation that training the algorithm using more reliable probes would improve test-retest reliability, the reliable-probes-trained DunedinPACE showed superior test-retest reliability to the all-probes trained DunedinPACE in the test-retest reliability dataset published by Lehne et al. (GSE55763) (reliable-probes ICC = 0.96 vs 0.72 for all-probes). ICCs were similar for the two version of DunedinPoAm (reliable-probes ICC = 0.90 vs 0.89 for all probes).</p></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73420.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Deelen</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xx1tc24</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This paper presents a new DNA methylation-based biomarker of aging: DunedinPACE.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joris Deelen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Suderman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers all agree that it is unclear what the added value of DunedinPACE is over the previously generated DundinPOAM and, even more, the widely used GrimAge methylation biomarkers. This should be discussed more thoroughly and will require some additional analyses (see individual review reports).</p><p>2. The discussion between the reviewers also brought forward that the work by Levine and colleagues (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.16.440205), although shortly mentioned in the introduction, has not sufficiently been taken into account by the authors. This preprint has several implications for the current manuscript. First, the currently used methylation biomarkers, including GrimAge, will soon be updated using the correction proposed by Levine et al. and will outperform the versions used in the current manuscript. Thus, the iterative improvement in DunedinPACE vs DunedinPoAm may be the only relevant comparison. Second, the current manuscript uses test-retest of individual CpG probes to refine DunedinPACE. However Levine et al. show strong evidence that this strategy may improve performance for a single clock (e.g. better performance in DunedinPoAM to DunedinPACE) but that this may not generalize to other clocks. Rather, technical variability was best improved by PCA to extract a 'shared signal' vs individual CpGs. At minimum, the authors should consider various approaches to reduce technical reliability rather than focus solely on individual CpGs, including creating a methylation biomarker using principal components.</p><p>The authors should also address the additional points mentioned in the individual review reports below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study details development of an improved iteration of a DNA methylation biomarker based on Pace of Aging measures developed in healthy, primarily Caucasian adults up to age 45 years in the highly unique longitudinal Dunedin Study. The new methylation biomarker is DunedinPACE; the predecessor DunedinPoAm was reported in Belsky et al. 2020 <italic>eLife</italic> 9,354870.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The key contribution of this study is to address limitations in previous methylation biomarkers: (1) Pace of Aging measures now encompass a 20-year time span vs 12 years in Dunedin study; (2) training population includes adults up to 45 years (vs 38 years); and (3) methylation model is restricted only to probes that meet a minimum threshold for test re-test reliability.</p><p>1. DunedinPACE has good test-retest reliability, which is highly relevant to biomarker performance in clinical studies and interventions testing.</p><p>2. Not unexpectedly, the test-retest reliability is stronger for the new DunedinPACE vs. earlier DunedinPoAm, possibly owing to introduction of minimum probe reliability thresholds, though this is not explicitly tested.</p><p>3. The analyses presented generally follow established tests of criterion and construct validity across a set of cohort studies previously used to develop its predecessor DundedinPoAm (see Belsky et al. 2020 <italic>eLife</italic> 9,354870). The parallel strategy makes the seemingly complex set of validation studies a relatively straightforward comparison across biomarker iterations.</p><p>4. The effect sizes in cross-cohort validation analyses are larger for DunedinPACE relative to the foundational DunedinPoAm, and the effect sizes meet (GrimAge) or surpass effect sizes for other existing DNAm biomarkers. This supports strength of the new PACE biomarker iteration relative to most others.</p><p>5. Conclusions are generally well supported by data and authors refrain from extraneous discussion.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. Though several key limitations in DunedinPACE's predecessors were addressed, it is unfortunate that readers are not provided details regarding their relative contributions to overall biomarker performance.</p><p>2. It would be highly informative for future biomarker development to know if and to what extent population characteristics (cohort, age, or duration of observations for Pace of Aging measure) drive improved performance of DunedinPACE vs. DunedinPoAm relative to test-retest reliability or duration of longitudinal observation.</p><p>3. DunedinPACE performed similarly (reported effect sizes) to GrimAge, yet this equivalence is not addressed in discussion or conclusion. It is unclear under which conditions should one biomarker be prioritized over another if effect sizes are similar.</p><p>4. Forced language regarding DunedinPACE as a proxy for Pace of Aging muddles results presentation and section headings; this may inadvertently misrepresent select analyses.</p><p>5. Remaining concerns and suggestions are to improve readability, clarify nomenclature, and strengthen presentation of results, and do not influence primary conclusions or implications.</p><p>Title:</p><p>6. The title is regurgitated from the <italic>eLife</italic> 2020 publication but with a modification after the colon. This tedious for query building, search engines, and reference lists. The authors should thus consider adapting it.</p><p>Contribution of individual iterative changes:</p><p>7. To address individual contributions of each of the prior limitations, the authors could consider supporting analyses to address:</p><p>• Ddoes the inclusion of persons who are 45 years and now exhibiting detectable declines in health / function improve performance of the methylation biomarker, or is the time span (12 vs 20 years) the key determinant for calibration for improved performance?</p><p>– Potential approach: restrict model to population aged 32-45 years (~12 years, but older) and compare performance to current DunedinPACE and previous DunedinPoAm.</p><p>• Is minimum reliability threshold the key to improved performance or characteristics of the population used to calibrate the methylation biomarker?</p><p>– Potential approach: (a) revisit DunedinPoAm – restrict the existing biomarker to probes meeting reliability threshold, or (b) release test-retest reliability restrictions for probes included in DunedinPACE and evaluate.</p><p>Implications:</p><p>8. DunedinPACE is an iterative change to DunedinPoAm; clearly showing how each of these changes impact the resultant model bolsters significance.</p><p>9. DunedinPACE is tested head-to-head with previous derivations of DNAm clocks, but without insight regarding if or how changes leading to DunedinPACE could be introduced to rebuild better a GrimAge, PhenoAge, etc.</p><p>10. If primary determinant of improved performance is including aged &gt;45 years, what does this mean for generalizability of clocks tuned in young/healthy population to trials in older adults or those in poorer health.</p><p>11. If analyses show that duration of longitudinal observation is key (20 years vs 12 years), then would future Dunedin derivations be expected to consistently outperform the previous versions and what would this mean for durability of the DunedinPACE as a biomarker?</p><p>GrimAge:</p><p>12. Addressing GrimAge vs DunedinPACE similarity in effect sizes may require some speculation, but would aid reader interpretation of results and could be simply handled with a short sentence or two in discussion.</p><p>Language – DunedinPACE as Pace of Aging Proxy:</p><p>13. Language referring to DunedinPACE and Pace of Aging is sometimes confusing, which could be attributed to the forced representation of DunedinPACE as a proxy for Pace of Aging.</p><p>• This results in instances of merged language (pg 12 &quot;DunedinPACE Pace of Aging&quot;).</p><p>• The Results section and headings also suffer from forced association (marketing over reporting findings?). Examples:</p><p>– (Results pg 9) &quot;DunedinPACE is indicates faster Pace of Aging in Chronologically Older Individuals.&quot; Results in text and Figure 3A show association with chronological age.</p><p>– (Results pg 10) &quot;DunedinPACE shows faster Pace of Aging in individuals measured to be…&quot; Forcing reference to Pace of Aging makes the heading cumbersome (&quot;DunedinPACE is associated with other epigenetic clocks, measures of biologic age, and self-rated health&quot;).</p><p>– Authors are recommended to use simplicity and clarity throughout results and save comment about DunedinPACE as possible a proxy for Pace of Aging for the discussion.</p><p>Results, Text and Figure 3 Alignment:</p><p>– Page 9-10. &quot;DunedinPACE indicates faster Pace of Aging in Chronologically Older..&quot;</p><p>– The text opens with a sentences about mortality risk, but the only figure referenced is association with chronological age in Understanding Society study (Figure 3 Panel A). Recommend to omit or move to mortality risk references to Results section on NAS.</p><p>– The second paragraph provides information about exposure histories across birth cohorts. These results distract from the flow of results reporting in Figure 3 and subsequent section. While within-individual change may be supportive they are not essential and detract from readability.</p><p>For consideration (not mandatory): Naming Conventions</p><p>14. One improvement of DunedinPACE is the name; it is much easier to read / say compared with DunedinPoAm. However, would &quot;PACE&quot; or &quot;PACEm&quot; be sufficient? Adding &quot;Dunedin…&quot; seems to suggest that DunedinPACE or DunedinPoAm are specific to the foundational study of origin compared with GrimAge or PhenoAge.</p><p>15. &quot;Faster&quot; and &quot;Slower&quot; are used repeatedly to refer to higher vs. lower DunedinPACE (single-timepoint) compared to Pace of Aging (time component included). Using &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; may be appropriate for a Pace-proxy unlike most clocks. But referring to change in single timepoint DunedinPACE as &quot;faster&quot; is confusing, even if it is proposed as a proxy for Pace of Aging</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Although the paper is well-written, findings are not presented in a way that allows the reader to answer the most important question of the paper: how does DunedinPACE compare to DunedinPOAM? Little can be concluded from the improved performance in the Dunedin study data from which DunedinPACE and DunedinPOAM were both derived. In independent datasets, performance appears to be almost identical. Test-retest evaluations in the Sugden dataset similarly are difficult to interpret because probe reliability was calculated using the Sugden dataset.</p><p>In all evaluations using data used to derive DunedinPACE, authors should clearly state the potential for inflated performance. This is particularly true for comparisons with DundinPOAM which was trained on a subset of DunedinPACE data and previously published aging estimates Horvath/Hannum/Phenoage/Grimage trained entirely on external data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Belsky and colleagues reports the development of an improved methylation biomarker based on longitudinal health data (Pace of Aging) from the Dunedin Study. The authors have now used an additional wave of measurements and excluded methylation probes with low reliability based on recent publications. They subsequently associated their improved biomarker, which they called DunedinPACE, with many different health-related outcomes, such as physical functioning, morbidity and mortality. They show that DunedinPACE shows comparable results as GrimAge, a methylation biomarker based on mortality.</p><p>The major strength of the study is that the authors have managed to improve their previous methylation biomarker (DunedinPoAm) by adding additional data. They also show that DunedinPACE does reasonable well when associated with health-related outcomes. However, it is unclear what the added value of DunedinPACE is in comparison to GrimAge, because it does not outperform this previous biomarker in its association with any of the outcomes. Moreover, the provided data on the most relevant health-related outcomes, i.e. morbidity and mortality, is limited and it is unclear if the methylation biomarker would outperform other omics-based biomarkers (i.e. metabolomics and proteomics).</p><p>– The authors should highlight the added value of DunedinPACE in comparison to GrimAge. It looks like they do equally well in the analysis they performed, so what would be the advantage of using DunedinPACE over GrimAge, given that the latter is already widely used.</p><p>– The authors should also look at cause-specific mortality and morbidity to see if DunedinPACE reflects general health or is specific to one major disease, e.g. cardiovascular disease.</p><p>– The authors should test the predictive ability of DunedinPACE, ideally in comparison to currently used clinical biomarkers and biomarkers based on other omics data (see PMID: 34145379 and PMID: 31431621). If a direct comparison is not possible, the existence of these non-methylation biomarkers should still be mentioned, including their effect sizes for morbidity/mortality (if available).</p><p>– The authors should test the association of DunedinPACE with morbidity and mortality in different age-groups (i.e. stratify their data) to make sure the associations are not driven by early-life morbidity and mortality.</p><p>– It would be interesting if the authors can provide a biological interpretation (e.g. functional annotation / genetic association analysis) of the CpGs that are included in the DunedinPACE biomarker, as already done for some of the other (methylation-based) biomarkers (see for example PMID: 34187551 and PMID: 34038024).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73420.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

PoAm was the first iteration and PACE is an advance on it. Both were derived in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. The value added of DunedinPACE over PoAm is primarily technical and consists of two key advances: (1) PACE offers improved precision of DNA methylation measurement of Pace of Aging; DunedinPACE is nearly twice as accurate as DunedinPoAm in predicting longitudinal Pace of Aging (correlations of r=0.6 and r=0.8 translate into coefficients of determination of R<sup>2</sup>=0.36 and 0.64). (2) PACE offers improved technical reliability of the DNA methylation measurement (ICC&gt;.95 in technical replicates). High reliability is essential for detection of change over time in RCTs. These two advances are reviewed in the first and second paragraphs of the discussion.</p><p>The value added of DunedinPACE over DNAmethylation clocks is in its design. Many features of a person’s biology may predict their risk of disease and death. The 2<sup>nd</sup>-generation PhenoAge and GrimAge clocks operationalize these. But only some of these features are aging. DunedinPACE operationalizes aging itself as decline in physiological integrity over years. DunedinPACE has three design features that isolate aging signal:</p><p>(1) The Dunedin cohort were all born in the same year. This eliminates bias from historical-exposure effects, including differences between people born in different years in their mothers’ health and environment when they were in-utero, their childhood nutrition, their exposure to childhood infections, and their exposure to environmental toxicants, such as air pollution from leaded gasoline and second-hand tobacco smoke in the workplace.</p><p>(2) Dunedin cohort members were young adults at the time of baseline measurements. This eliminates survival bias; none of the cohort had died of aging-related causes by the time of baseline Pace of Aging assessment. It also separates aging from age-related disease; physiological changes observed beginning in cohort members’ 20s represent pre-clinical changes in system integrity that are causes of disease, not disease sequelae.</p><p>(3) DunedinPACE is modeled on decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems during adult life. This isolates aging-related changes from deficits established early in development.</p><p>In contrast, clocks were developed on mixed-age populations and cannot distinguish aging from historical-exposure effects. Clocks were developed from mixed-age or older populations, introducing survival bias and uncertainty about what is aging versus disease. Finally, clocks are based on a single cross-sectional measurement and do not distinguish aging-related changes from deficits established early in development. We have added a final paragraph to the introduction to clarify these points.</p><p>“As a new DNA methylation measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE joins a well-established battery of DNA methylation measures known as “clocks”, so-named for their accurate prediction of chronological age (Horvath and Raj, 2018). […] DunedinPACE, therefore, represents a complementary tool for DNA methylation quantification of biological aging.”</p><p>Consistent with these distinguishing features, DunedinPACE captures information about aging that is not measured by the clocks. We have added a series of multivariate analyses in the Framingham Heart Study cohort (which was used to develop GrimAge) that show DunedinPACE predicts mortality, incident cardiovascular disease, and incident disability over and above the clocks, including GrimAge. This is a rigorous test since GrimAge was developed using the Framingham data. Results are reported in the final paragraph of the Results section and detailed in Supplementary file 1C.</p><p>“Incremental predictive value of DunedinPACE in an analysis of morbidity, disability, and mortality. DunedinPACE is distinct from DNA methylation clocks in the method of its development and in its interpretation. […] Results for all models are reported in Supplementary file 1C.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

At minimum, the authors should consider various approaches to reduce technical reliability rather than focus solely on individual CpGs, including creating a methylation biomarker using principal components.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. First, as our paper reports, DunedinPACE already demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=0.96-0.97). So, the potential for the approach proposed in the Higgins-Chen et al. preprint to improve the test-retest reliability of our measure is virtually nil. Moreover, the method introduced by Higgins-Chen was designed to address the limitation that, when DNAm clocks were re-trained using subsets of more reliable probes, the resulting clock measures were less predictive of morbidity and mortality as compared to their original versions. As our data show, that is not the case for the reliable-probes-based DunedinPACE; DunedinPACE effect-sizes are the same as or larger than effect-sizes for the original DunedinPoAm, which did not use reliable probes. Thus, the Higgins-Chen et al. approach may be a useful a solution to a thorny problem that uniquely afflicts clocks such as PhenoAge, but that problem does not afflict DunedinPACE and the corrective approach is not needed by DunedinPACE.</p><p>However, we agree that it is important to acknowledge that the analysis by Higgins-Chen et al. suggests that the approach we used does not generalize to existing epigenetic clocks. Therefore, in addition to the text in our article which already acknowledges the potential for methods such as those proposed in the Higgins-Chen et al. preprint to improve reliabilities of existing clocks, we now also acknowledge that the method we used may not generalize to the epigenetic clocks.</p><p>“Comparison of DunedinPACE reliability to reliabilities for the original DunedinPoAm and the DNA methylation clocks are shown in Supplemental Figure 2. DunedinPACE is as reliable or more so as compared to the GrimAge clock and more reliable in comparison to the other clocks, although methods have been proposed that may improve reliabilities for the other clocks (Higgins-Chen et al., 2021).” (results p10 para 4)</p><p>“Interestingly, in contrast to reports for some epigenetic clocks (Higgins-Chen et al., 2021), the restriction of machine learning analysis to a more-reliably-measured subset of CpG sites on the Illumina EPIC array did not harm criterion validity of DunedinPACE; effect-sizes for prediction of morbidity and mortality were as large or larger in comparison to DunedinPoAm.” (discussion p17 para 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also address the additional points mentioned in the individual review reports below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study details development of an improved iteration of a DNA methylation biomarker based on Pace of Aging measures developed in healthy, primarily Caucasian adults up to age 45 years in the highly unique longitudinal Dunedin Study. The new methylation biomarker is DunedinPACE; the predecessor DunedinPoAm was reported in Belsky et al. 2020 eLife 9,354870.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The key contribution of this study is to address limitations in previous methylation biomarkers: (1) Pace of Aging measures now encompass a 20-year time span vs 12 years in Dunedin study; (2) training population includes adults up to 45 years (vs 38 years); and (3) methylation model is restricted only to probes that meet a minimum threshold for test re-test reliability.</p><p>1. DunedinPACE has good test-retest reliability, which is highly relevant to biomarker performance in clinical studies and interventions testing.</p><p>2. Not unexpectedly, the test-retest reliability is stronger for the new DunedinPACE vs. earlier DunedinPoAm, possibly owing to introduction of minimum probe reliability thresholds, though this is not explicitly tested.</p><p>3. The analyses presented generally follow established tests of criterion and construct validity across a set of cohort studies previously used to develop its predecessor DundedinPoAm (see Belsky et al. 2020 eLife 9,354870). The parallel strategy makes the seemingly complex set of validation studies a relatively straightforward comparison across biomarker iterations.</p><p>4. The effect sizes in cross-cohort validation analyses are larger for DunedinPACE relative to the foundational DunedinPoAm, and the effect sizes meet (GrimAge) or surpass effect sizes for other existing DNAm biomarkers. This supports strength of the new PACE biomarker iteration relative to most others.</p><p>5. Conclusions are generally well supported by data and authors refrain from extraneous discussion.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. Though several key limitations in DunedinPACE's predecessors were addressed, it is unfortunate that readers are not provided details regarding their relative contributions to overall biomarker performance.</p><p>2. It would be highly informative for future biomarker development to know if and to what extent population characteristics (cohort, age, or duration of observations for Pace of Aging measure) drive improved performance of DunedinPACE vs. DunedinPoAm relative to test-retest reliability or duration of longitudinal observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have conducted additional analyses to refine inference about which aspects of DunedinPACE development contributed to the key improvements over DunedinPoAm, i.e. improved fit to the Pace of Aging criterion and improved test-retest reliability. Specifically, we created two new algorithms: (1) a new version of DunedinPACE trained to fit 20-year Pace of Aging from all probes shared on the EPIC and 450k arrays (referred to as “all probes DunedinPACE”); and (2) a version of DunedinPoAm trained from the subset of probes meeting the reliability threshold set by Sugden. (referred to as “reliable probes DunedinPoAm”). Analysis of criterion fit to Pace of Aging and test-retest reliability are reported in Supplemental Results and mentioned in the Results section (p11, para 1). There are two key findings from this analysis: First, all versions trained on 20-year, 4-time-point Pace of Aging show higher correlation with their Pace of Aging criterion as compared to all versions trained on 12-year, 3-time-point Pace of Aging. This result indicates that the improved criterion fit of DuneindPACE comes from inclusion of additional follow-up in the Pace of Aging measure. Second, all algorithms trained on the subset of reliable probes showed higher test-retest reliability as compared with all algorithms trained in the complete set of probes. This result indicates that the improved test-retest reliability of DunedinPACE comes from the restriction of elastic net regression analysis to the subset of reliable probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. DunedinPACE performed similarly (reported effect sizes) to GrimAge, yet this equivalence is not addressed in discussion or conclusion. It is unclear under which conditions should one biomarker be prioritized over another if effect sizes are similar.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. We view DunedinPACE as a measure complementary to GrimAge. As explained in our response to Essential Revisions 1, DunedinPACE is distinct from GrimAge in its design and its meaning. In addition, it also captures unique information about risk for disease and death; i.e. DunedinPACE improves prediction of morbidity and mortality over and above GrimAge. This is detailed in the final paragraph of the Results section and in Supplementary file 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Forced language regarding DunedinPACE as a proxy for Pace of Aging muddles results presentation and section headings; this may inadvertently misrepresent select analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The text has been revised for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Remaining concerns and suggestions are to improve readability, clarify nomenclature, and strengthen presentation of results, and do not influence primary conclusions or implications.</p><p>Title:</p><p>6. The title is regurgitated from the eLife 2020 publication but with a modification after the colon. This tedious for query building, search engines, and reference lists. The authors should thus consider adapting it.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. The new title is “DunedinPACE: A DNA methylation biomarker of the Pace of Aging”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Contribution of individual iterative changes:</p><p>7. To address individual contributions of each of the prior limitations, the authors could consider supporting analyses to address:</p><p>• Does the inclusion of persons who are 45 years and now exhibiting detectable declines in health / function improve performance of the methylation biomarker, or is the time span (12 vs 20 years) the key determinant for calibration for improved performance?</p><p>– Potential approach: restrict model to population aged 32-45 years (~12 years, but older) and compare performance to current DunedinPACE and previous DunedinPoAm.</p><p>• Is minimum reliability threshold the key to improved performance or characteristics of the population used to calibrate the methylation biomarker?</p><p>– Potential approach: (a) revisit DunedinPoAm – restrict the existing biomarker to probes meeting reliability threshold, or (b) release test-retest reliability restrictions for probes included in DunedinPACE and evaluate.</p><p>Implications:</p><p>8. DunedinPACE is an iterative change to DunedinPoAm; clearly showing how each of these changes impact the resultant model bolsters significance.</p><p>9. DunedinPACE is tested head-to-head with previous derivations of DNAm clocks, but without insight regarding if or how changes leading to DunedinPACE could be introduced to rebuild better a GrimAge, PhenoAge, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea. But, lacking the data used to train the other clocks, we are unable to conduct the same analysis. We now note that the Higgins-Chen preprint explored restriction of CpG sites based on ICC criteria for good test-retest reliability and found this approach was generally harmful; it reduced the criterion validity of their clocks. However restriction of CpG sites to reliable sites did not reduce criterion validity for DunedinPACE (Discussion p17 para 2, text quoted above in response to Essential Revision 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. If primary determinant of improved performance is including aged &gt;45 years, what does this mean for generalizability of clocks tuned in young/healthy population to trials in older adults or those in poorer health.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. Prediction of morbidity and mortality in older adults in the Normative Aging Study and Framingham cohorts in our paper is similar for DunedinPoAm (developed from Pace of Aging measured over ages 26-38) as for DunedinPACE (developed from Pace of Aging measured over ages 26-45). Therefore, the age range used in measuring Pace of Aging does not seem to be a critical feature of prediction of morbidity and mortality in older adults. DunedinPACE, though trained on data from age 26 to 45, predicts morbidity and mortality in cohorts in their 70s and 80s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. If analyses show that duration of longitudinal observation is key (20 years vs 12 years), then would future Dunedin derivations be expected to consistently outperform the previous versions and what would this mean for durability of the DunedinPACE as a biomarker?</p></disp-quote><p>We expect that, when another wave of data from the Dunedin Study is collected in 5-7 years, a new Pace of Aging measurement will be evaluated. At that time, we will be able to clarify whether longer follow-up intervals extending into later stages of life contribute new and important information to a Pace of Aging DNA methylation measure. Until then, geroscience needs the best measurement tools available to evaluate intervention effects today. DunedinPACE is an improvement over what is already available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>GrimAge:</p><p>12. Addressing GrimAge vs DunedinPACE similarity in effect sizes may require some speculation, but would aid reader interpretation of results and could be simply handled with a short sentence or two in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added text to the introduction (p7-8), results (p15-16), and discussion (p17-18). These changes are also summarized in our response to Essential Revision 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Language – DunedinPACE as Pace of Aging Proxy:</p><p>13. Language referring to DunedinPACE and Pace of Aging is sometimes confusing, which could be attributed to the forced representation of DunedinPACE as a proxy for Pace of Aging.</p><p>• This results in instances of merged language (pg 12 &quot;DunedinPACE Pace of Aging&quot;).</p><p>• The Results section and headings also suffer from forced association (marketing over reporting findings?).

Recommend to omit or move to mortality risk references to Results section on NAS.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. The text referencing mortality risk explains why we anticipate a correlation between DunedinPACE and chronological age. We have further revised the text for clarity.</p><p>“In demography, the pace of biological aging in a population can be estimated from the rate of increase in mortality risk from younger to older chronological ages (Hägg et al., 2019). In humans and many other species, the increase in mortality risk with advancing chronological age is nonlinear, suggesting that the pace of biological aging accelerates as we grow older (Gompertz, 1825; Kirkwood, 2015; Olshansky and Carnes, 1997). We tested if, consistent with this hypothesis, DunedinPACE was faster in chronologically older as compared to younger individuals in data from the Understanding Society Study (n=1175, age range 28-95). Chronologically older Understanding Society participants had faster DunedinPACE as compared to younger ones (r=0.32, Figure 3 Panel A). This correlation was threefold larger as compared to the correlation for the original DunedinPoAm (r=0.11). ” (p11 para 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The second paragraph provides information about exposure histories across birth cohorts. These results distract from the flow of results reporting in Figure 3 and subsequent section. While within-individual change may be supportive they are not essential and detract from readability.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We think these data on within-individual change are essential for establishing the independence of DunedinPACE correlations with chronological age from historical exposures that vary by birth year and may alter the methylome (i.e. “cohort effects”). While cohort effects are not yet widely appreciated as a source of bias in biology, they are well established in human epidemiologic research. Therefore, we have retained the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For consideration (not mandatory): Naming Conventions</p><p>14. One improvement of DunedinPACE is the name; it is much easier to read / say compared with DunedinPoAm. However, would &quot;PACE&quot; or &quot;PACEm&quot; be sufficient? Adding &quot;Dunedin…&quot; seems to suggest that DunedinPACE or DunedinPoAm are specific to the foundational study of origin compared with GrimAge or PhenoAge.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We appreciate the inclusion of the name of the study in the name of our measure is somewhat cumbersome. But we also think it is essential. Data sources used in the derivation of machine-learning-based measures can affect the measure in many ways – something we acknowledge in the limitations section of our discussion. In our view, we should all think of the Framingham-GrimAge, the InCHIANTI-PhenoAge, etc. We have therefore elected to retain our original study name to inform the science. In addition, there is an ethical reason. Dunedin Study participants were consulted in focus groups about their views on using Study data to derive a measure that might have intellectual property, and they asked that their contribution of repeated blood samples be acknowledged and recognized in the naming of the measure. Given the current unpleasant situation with the family of Henrietta Lacks in reaction to commercial use of HELA cells, consulting the Study participants was good policy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. &quot;Faster&quot; and &quot;Slower&quot; are used repeatedly to refer to higher vs. lower DunedinPACE (single-timepoint) compared to Pace of Aging (time component included). Using &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; may be appropriate for a Pace-proxy unlike most clocks. But referring to change in single timepoint DunedinPACE as &quot;faster&quot; is confusing, even if it is proposed as a proxy for Pace of Aging.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have retained the language of faster/slower as DunedinPACE is not a clock and does not measure an “age” value. DunedinPACE is a prediction of Pace of Aging. Higher values correspond to faster Pace of Aging and lower values to slower Pace of Aging. Faster/slower therefore aligns with the measure. In addition, this precise language helps to distinguish DunedinPACE from results for the clocks, which were designed to generate values younger/older, but not faster/slower.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Although the paper is well-written, findings are not presented in a way that allows the reader to answer the most important question of the paper: how does DunedinPACE compare to DunedinPOAM? Little can be concluded from the improved performance in the Dunedin study data from which DunedinPACE and DunedinPOAM were both derived. In independent datasets, performance appears to be almost identical. Test-retest evaluations in the Sugden dataset similarly are difficult to interpret because probe reliability was calculated using the Sugden dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We report head-to-head comparisons of DunedinPACE with DunedinPoAm in the text and in the supplemental figures and specifically note the outcomes of these comparisons in the Results section. We have highlighted these comparisons in the revised submission.</p><p>Regarding Test-retest reliability: the probe reliability threshold used to define the CpG set used to develop DunedinPACE was defined in only one of the datasets used to evaluate test-retest reliability (Sugden B n=350 450k-EPIC, Supplemental Figure 2). Results are consistent across all datasets, arguing against the finding being an artifact of the Sugden dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In all evaluations using data used to derive DunedinPACE, authors should clearly state the potential for inflated performance.

This issue applies to the Dunedin data, but not to the several other datasets analyzed.

The authors have now used an additional wave of measurements and excluded methylation probes with low reliability based on recent publications. They subsequently associated their improved biomarker, which they called DunedinPACE, with many different health-related outcomes, such as physical functioning, morbidity and mortality. They show that DunedinPACE shows comparable results as GrimAge, a methylation biomarker based on mortality.</p><p>The major strength of the study is that the authors have managed to improve their previous methylation biomarker (DunedinPoAm) by adding additional data. They also show that DunedinPACE does reasonable well when associated with health-related outcomes. However, it is unclear what the added value of DunedinPACE is in comparison to GrimAge, because it does not outperform this previous biomarker in its association with any of the outcomes. Moreover, the provided data on the most relevant health-related outcomes, i.e. morbidity and mortality, is limited and it is unclear if the methylation biomarker would outperform other omics-based biomarkers (i.e. metabolomics and proteomics).</p><p>– The authors should highlight the added value of DunedinPACE in comparison to GrimAge. It looks like they do equally well in the analysis they performed, so what would be the advantage of using DunedinPACE over GrimAge, given that the latter is already widely used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. As explained in response to Essential Revision 1 and in a new paragraph added to the introduction (p7-8), DunedinPACE represents distinct information about aging from GrimAge. Moreover, empirically, DuedinPACE is an independent predictor of morbidity, disability, and mortality (Results p15-16; Supplemental Table 5). Therefore, DunedinPACE is complementary to GrimAge (Discussion p18 para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should also look at cause-specific mortality and morbidity to see if DunedinPACE reflects general health or is specific to one major disease, e.g. cardiovascular disease.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

See results p14 para 1, Supplemental Table 4, and Supplemental Figure 4 panels C and D.</p><p>We did not include analysis of cause-specific mortality because the number of deaths from individual causes is too small in the datasets available to us for confident ascertainment of differential associations with different causes of death.

All mortality analyses were conducted using data from older adults (Normative Aging Study men were aged 77 years on average at DNA methylation baseline; Framingham participants were aged 66 years on average a DNA methylation baseline; see results p13-14). Therefore, early-life morbidity and mortality cannot explain the results observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be interesting if the authors can provide a biological interpretation (e.g. functional annotation / genetic association analysis) of the CpGs that are included in the DunedinPACE biomarker, as already done for some of the other (methylation-based) biomarkers (see for example PMID: 34187551 and PMID: 34038024).</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted the analysis suggested by the reviewer and results are included below. However, it is our preference not to include these in the manuscript. The reason is that, in our view, this type of bioinformatic annotation is inappropriate to interpretation of CpG sets obtained from machine-learning analysis. The elastic net algorithm we used to derive DunedinPACE is ignorant of biology. It simply chooses the minimum set of sites that, together, maximize prediction of the Pace of Aging criterion. For example, sites that are highly correlated statistically but which are located near different genes and therefore have potentially distinct biological interpretations are, from the view of the elastic net, interchangeable.</p><p>We note that the articles cited performed analysis on CpG sets compiled from many different measures of aging. In our view, this is a substantively different type of analysis than what we can conduct with the single set of probes included in DunedinPACE.</p><p>Pathway Analysis of DunedinPACE probes October 2021</p><p>We performed pathway analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA, Qiagen). We did this in three steps: First, we assigned DunedinPACE DNA methylation probes to the most proximal gene (in base pairs) based on genome assembly hg19. Second, we uploaded this list of genes to IPA, which mapped to 140 HUGO gene names (33 were unmapped and represented non-coding genes/ESTs). Of these, 7 gene names were duplicated (i.e. two DNA methylation probes mapped to the same gene); after removing the duplicates, 133 gene names were left for analysis. Third, we performed pathway analysis, restricting the search to (a) pathways known in humans, and (b) pathways experimentally observed in blood cells.</p><p>This analysis identified 9 canonical pathways which were enriched for genes in our list (nominal <italic>p-value</italic> cut-off = 0.05), with enrichment scores ranging from 1.29-1.86. These pathways were described by 12 of the 133 genes; Four genes were enriched in multiple pathways (<italic>GAD1</italic>, 4 pathways; <italic>ADCY8</italic>, 4 pathways; <italic>KCNQ2</italic>,2 pathways; <italic>SOCS3</italic>, 2 pathways).</p><p>Initial pathway analyses indicate that GABA synthesis and cell signaling might be pathways of interest with respect to DunedinPACE. However, there are some caveats to this conclusion. First, we selected the gene associated with a DNA methylation probe based on physical proximity; transcriptional relationships between genes and DNA methylation probes could be driven by factors other than physical distance between them. Such functional annotation could lead to gene assignation that differs from the one used here. Second, we do not have information on the relationship between the level of probe methylation and gene transcription; inclusion of this information could impact the assigned probabilities associated with pathway enrichment. The third caveat is that DunedinPACE is a statistical construct, not a biological one and, as such, inferences made about individual probes and their biological function may not be appropriate. It is important to remember that DunedinPACE, like PhenoAge and GrimAge, is an efficient algorithm that allows other researchers, who do not have the trained-upon data, to measure the phenotype of interest (in our case, the Pace of Aging which is made up of 20 years of repeatedly measured multiple biomarkers; in the case of GrimAge, a suite of plasma proteins, etc.). These algorithms comprise statistically efficient probes that capture a phenotype that would otherwise be inaccessible. Because their criteria for selection into the algorithm are based in statistics and not function, it is not appropriate to think of the resulting probes in biological terms. Moreover, DunedinPACE does not select every probe that is associated with the Pace of Aging. Rather, the elastic net has selected out probes that best predict DunedinPACE while minimizing both variance and bias in estimation. A biologically meaningful analysis could be performed through an Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) of the Pace of Aging. (The set of CpG sites with significant univariate associations with Pace of Aging is not equivalent to the set of elements identified by elastic net regression as most efficient for predicting Pace of Aging.) For these reasons, we are happy to share the results reported above in this response, but would prefer to not include them in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
