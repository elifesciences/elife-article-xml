The process is regulated by microbially derived ‘autoinducer’ signalling molecules, that accumulate in the local environment. Individual cells sense autoinducer abundance, to infer population density, and alter their behaviour accordingly. In <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, quorum-sensing signals are transduced by phosphorelay to the transcription factor LuxO. Unphosphorylated LuxO permits expression of HapR, which alters global gene expression patterns. In this work, we have mapped the genome-wide distribution of LuxO and HapR in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Whilst LuxO has a small regulon, HapR targets 32 loci. Many HapR targets coincide with sites for the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) that regulates the transcriptional response to carbon starvation. This overlap, also evident in other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, results from similarities in the DNA sequence bound by each factor. At shared sites, HapR and CRP simultaneously contact the double helix and binding is stabilised by direct interaction of the two factors. Importantly, this involves a CRP surface that usually contacts RNA polymerase to stimulate transcription. As a result, HapR can block transcription activation by CRP. Thus, by interacting at shared sites, HapR and CRP integrate information from quorum sensing and cAMP signalling to control gene expression. This likely allows <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to regulate subsets of genes during the transition between aquatic environments and the human host.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd><kwd>quorum sensing</kwd><kwd>cyclic amp</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N005961/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grainger</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M01116X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Lucas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalia</surname><given-names>Ankur B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project reference 1898542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Lucas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overlapping DNA-binding specificity allows global transcription factors to cooperatively bind the same DNA sites and integrate two signals in the control of gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for the human disease cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>). Estimates suggest 3 million annual infections, of which 100 thousand are fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>). Most disease instances are attributed to the El Tor <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biotype, which is responsible for the ongoing 7th cholera pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domman et al., 2017</xref>). Globally, over 1 billion people inhabit areas of endemicity and future climatic change is likely to exacerbate the risk of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadgol et al., 2019</xref>). The success of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> as a pathogen is underpinned by an ability to colonise both aquatic ecosystems and the human intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>). In waterways, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> prospers by forming biofilms on arthropod exoskeletons. Degradation of these chitinous surfaces ultimately liberates <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) for metabolism by the microbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meibom et al., 2004</xref>). Upon ingestion by a human host, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> express genetic determinants for acid tolerance, intestinal colonisation, and virulence. Diverse transcription factors regulate the transition and respond to signals including bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hung and Mekalanos, 2005</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weber et al., 2014</xref>), nucleotide second messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krasteva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manneh-Roussel et al., 2018</xref>), and chitin availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meibom et al., 2004</xref>). Understanding these regulatory networks is important to determine how <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can switch between environments to cause disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamareddine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weill et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Quorum sensing is key for the transition of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> between ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eickhoff and Bassler, 2018</xref>). Briefly, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> produce at least 3 autoinducer (AI) signalling molecules: cholera AI-1 (CAI-1), AI-2, and 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>). In the environment, these compounds are detected by receptors in neighbouring cells and indicate population density. Importantly, whilst AI-2 and DPO are produced by multiple bacterial species, CAI-1 is only made by other members of the <italic>Vibrio</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henke and Bassler, 2004</xref>). Thus, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can determine the crude composition of bacterial populations. In the absence of their cognate AIs, when population density is low, the receptors for CAI-I and AI-2 target the transcription factor LuxO for phosphorylation via a phosphorelay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freeman and Bassler, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freeman and Bassler, 1999b</xref>). When phosphorylated, LuxO upregulates the production of four small quorum regulatory RNAs (Qrrs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenz et al., 2004</xref>). In turn, the Qrrs control expression of two global transcription factors: AphA and HapR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shao and Bassler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutherford et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, whilst AphA production is activated by Qrrs, synthesis of HapR is repressed. Hence, AphA and HapR control gene expression at low and high cell density respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutherford et al., 2011</xref>).

Many clinical isolates of pandemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> have lost the ability to properly express HapR and this may indicate adaptation to a more pathogenic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamareddine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heidelberg et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, HapR regulates the expression of ~100 genes to promote ‘group behaviours’ including natural competence, repression of virulence genes, and escape from the host intestinal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2006</xref>). In other <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp., equivalent regulons are larger. For example, LuxR in <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> regulates over 600 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Kessel et al., 2013a</xref>). Expression of HapR can be influenced by other factors. In particular, cAMP receptor protein (CRP), a regulator that controls metabolism of alternative carbon sources, including chitin, upregulates HapR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silva and Benitez, 2004</xref>). In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify direct DNA binding targets of HapR and its upstream regulator, LuxO. We show that the degenerate DNA consensus bound by HapR frequently overlaps targets for CRP. At such sites, HapR and CRP co-operatively bind offset faces of the double helix. Strikingly, this occludes a key CRP surface required to activate transcription. This simple mechanism allows <italic>V. cholerae</italic> species to integrate quorum sensing, and cAMP signalling, in the control of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide DNA binding by HapR and LuxO in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></title><p>Whilst the impact of HapR on global gene expression in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> has been investigated, it is not known which HapR responsive genes are directly controlled by the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, the extent of the direct LuxO regulon is unknown. Hence, we sought to map the binding of LuxO and HapR across the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome. To facilitate this, <italic>luxO</italic> and <italic>hapR</italic> were cloned in plasmids pAMCF an pAMNF respectively. The resulting constructs, encoding LuxO-3xFLAG or 3xFLAG-HapR, were used to transform <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain E7946. In subsequent ChIP-seq experiments, anti-FLAG antibodies were used to select fragments of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome bound with either LuxO or HapR. The derived binding profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. In each plot, genes are shown as blue lines (outer two tracks) whilst the LuxO and HapR binding signals are red and green respectively (inner two tracks). Examples of individual binding peaks for each factor are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>. In total, we identified 5 and 32 peaks for LuxO and HapR binding respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Previous work identified targets for LuxO adjacent to genes encoding the 4 Qrr sRNAs. We recovered all of these known LuxO targets, and an additional binding site was identified between <italic>VC1142</italic> and <italic>VC1143</italic>. These divergent genes encode cold shock-like protein CspD, and the Clp protease adaptor protein, ClpS, respectively. Note that the LuxO binding signal at this locus is small, compared to the <italic>qrr</italic>1-4 targets, but may still be involved in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify the sequence bound by LuxO, DNA regions overlapping LuxO binding peaks were inspected using MEME. The motif identified matches the known consensus for LuxO binding and was found at all LuxO targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tu and Bassler, 2007</xref>).

However, some known targets had weak or poorly reproducible binding signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A DNA motif common to all 32 HapR ChIP-seq peaks matched prior descriptions of the DNA target for HapR or closely related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kessel et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Occurrences of this HapR binging motif were most frequent in the 200 bp preceding a gene start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Most often, the genes adjacent to HapR binding peaks encode protein functions related to metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that LuxO primarily regulates gene expression via the 4 Qrr sRNA molecules. Conversely, the genome-wide distribution of HapR is consistent with that of a global gene regulator with many undefined regulatory roles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HapR is a direct regulator of transcription at many target sites</title><p>We focused our attention on new HapR target promoters where adjacent coding sequence could be used to predict encoded protein function. For these 24 targets, regulatory DNA was cloned upstream of <italic>lacZ</italic> in plasmid pRW50T. Recombinants were then transferred to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> E7946, or the Δ<italic>hapR</italic> derivative, by conjugation. Strains generated were cultured overnight before β-galactosidase activities were determined. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. Promoters were categorised as inactive, unresponsive, repressed or activated by HapR. We identified 2 and 7 promoters subject to activation and repression by HapR, respectively. Of the remaining promoters, 6 were inactive and 9 unresponsive to HapR in our conditions. Next, the 9 promoter DNA fragments responsive to HapR in vivo were cloned upstream of the λ<italic>oop</italic> terminator in plasmid pSR. The resulting constructs were then provided to housekeeping <italic>V. cholerae</italic> RNA polymerase, as templates for in vitro transcription, in the presence and absence of HapR. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> where the expected size of transcripts terminated by λ<italic>oop</italic> are marked with blue triangles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papenfort et al., 2015</xref>). Recall that the <italic>VC1375</italic> and <italic>VC1403</italic> promoters were activated by HapR in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Consistent with this, HapR also activated the <italic>VC1375</italic> promoter in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, lanes 43–47). However, HapR did not activate in vitro transcription from the <italic>VC1403</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, lanes 48–53). Indeed, interpretation of these data were hampered because the location of the <italic>VC1403</italic> transcription start site (TSS) is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papenfort et al., 2015</xref>). Of the 7 promoters repressed by HapR in vivo, we observed repression in six cases in vitro (<italic>hapR</italic>, <italic>VC0585</italic>, <italic>VC2352</italic>, <italic>VCA0219</italic>, <italic>VCA0663,</italic> and <italic>VCA0960</italic>) (lanes 7–42).

The centre of the ChIP-seq peak for HapR is marked by an asterisk and the predicted binding site is highlighted green. We reasoned that our inability to detect transcription from P<italic>murQP</italic> in vitro was likely because an undefined transcriptional activator is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Inspection of the DNA sequence upstream of <italic>murQP</italic> identified a close match to the consensus binding site for CRP (5'-TGTGA-N<sub>6</sub>-TCACA-3'). Furthermore, this sequence was located 41.5 bp upstream, of the <italic>murQP</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This is a common scenario for CRP dependent transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savery et al., 1998</xref>). To measure binding of CRP to the <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory region we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Consistent with our prediction, CRP bound to the <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). To confirm that we had correctly identified the binding site for CRP, we made a series of P<italic>murQP</italic> derivatives. The Δ183 and Δ211 DNA fragments have large upstream deletions (sites of truncation are shown by inverted triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, which mark the 5' end of the remaining promoter DNA) but still bind CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, lanes 3–6). Conversely, point mutations –35 g and –49 g, within the CRP site, prevent binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, lanes 7–8). To determine the impact of CRP on P<italic>murQP</italic> activity we first used in vitro transcription assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Addition of CRP to reactions resulted in production of an RNA from P<italic>murQP</italic>. We observed similar CRP dependence in vivo using β-galactosidase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, compare wild type promoter activity with and without CRP). Furthermore, in wild type cells, the –35 g and –49 g mutations reduced promotor activity whilst the Δ183 and Δ211 truncations did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We note that the Δ211 derivative is much more active than the starting promoter DNA sequence, but transcription remains totally dependent on CRP. Most likely, the truncation removes a repressive DNA element upstream of the core promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>HapR and CRP bind a shared DNA site at the</italic> murQP <italic>promoter</italic></title><p>At P<italic>murQP</italic>, the DNA site for CRP is completely embedded within the predicted HapR binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To better understand this unusual configuration, we used DNAseI footprinting. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. Lane 1 shows the pattern of DNAseI digestion in the absence of bound protein. In the presence of CRP (lanes 2–4) a footprint was observed between positions –29 and –59 bp relative to the <italic>murQP</italic> TSS. As is usual for CRP, and a consequence of DNA bending, the footprint comprised protection from, and hypersensitivity to, DNAse I attack. Three distinct sites of DNAseI hypersensitivity are marked by orange arrows alongside lane 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. The pattern of DNAse I digestion in the presence of HapR is shown in lanes 5–8. The footprint due to HapR binding exactly overlaps the region bound by CRP and results in complete protection of the DNA from digestion between positions –29 and –58 (green bar adjacent to lane 8). We also observed changes in the relative intensity of bands upstream of the HapR site between promoter positions –60 and –80. We speculate that this may result from changes in DNA conformation. Importantly, there was one further subtle difference between HapR and CRP induced banding patterns. Namely, in the presence of HapR, a band was observed at position –58 (see green triangle adjacent to lane 8). With CRP, a band was instead observed at position –59 (compare lanes 2–4 with 5–8). In a final set of assays, we examined addition of CRP and HapR in unison. We reasoned that three outcomes were possible. First, one of the two protein factors could outcompete the other. This should result in a DNAse I digestion pattern identical to either the individual CRP or HapR footprint. Second, some DNA fragments in the reaction could be bound by CRP and others by HapR. In this case, a mixed DNAse I digestion pattern, containing all features of the individual footprints due to CRP and HapR, should occur. Third, CRP and HapR could bind simultaneously. This might generate a DNAse I digestion pattern with similarities to the CRP and HapR footprints. However, accessibility of the nucleic acid to DNAse I would likely be altered in some way, with unpredictable outcomes. The result of the experiment was analysed in lanes 9–12. The binding pattern matched only some aspects of the individual footprints for CRP and HapR. Hence, we observed 2 of the 3 DNAse I hypersensitivity sites due to CRP binding. Changes in the banding pattern upstream of the binding sequence, due to HapR, were also detected. We did not observe the band at position –58 detected with HapR alone. Rather, we observed a band at position –59. An additional band at position –26 (black triangle adjacent to lane 12) was unique to these reactions. We conclude that HapR and CRP recognise the same section of the <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory region and may bind in unison.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>HapR and CRP co-operatively bind the same section of <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory DNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Binding locations of HapR and CRP upstream of <italic>murQP</italic>.

Thus, we compared binding of CRP and/or HapR using EMSAs. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>. As expected, addition of CRP to reactions caused a distinct shift in electrophoretic mobility (lanes 1–5). Comparatively, at the concentration used, HapR bound the DNA fragment poorly; we observed only smearing of the free DNA at the highest HapR concentration tested (lanes 6–10). The binding pattern due to HapR was dramatically different if DNA was pre-bound with CRP (lanes 11–15). In this scenario, even low concentrations of added HapR were sufficient to generate a super-shifted nucleoprotein complex (lanes 11–15). These data are consistent with HapR having a higher affinity for CRP-P<italic>murQP</italic> than P<italic>murQP</italic> alone. Hence, HapR and CRP bind the <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory region co-operatively. A mundane explanation is that increased molecular crowding, upon CRP addition, increases the effective concentration of HapR. To exclude this possibility, we did two further sets of EMSA experiments. In the first set of assays, CRP was added at a lower concentration. Thus, some DNA remained unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Hence, when added to such reactions, HapR could bind either the free DNA or the CRP-DNA complex. Consistent with HapR preferentially binding the latter, all of the CRP-DNA complex was super shifted upon HapR addition. Conversely, the free DNA remained unbound (compare lanes 2 and 4). In equivalent experiments, with point mutations –49 g and –35 g in the CRP site, neither CRP or HapR were able to bind the DNA (lanes 5–8). In a second set of tests, we used the <italic>hapR</italic> regulatory DNA that binds HapR but not CRP. If CRP addition increased the effective concentration of HapR, this should result in much tighter HapR binding to the <italic>hapR</italic> promoter. However, this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, the promoter is subject to repression by HapR in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). An explanation consistent with both observations is that HapR directly counteracts CRP mediated activation. To test this, we used in vitro transcription assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). As expected, addition of CRP activated <italic>murQP</italic> transcription (lanes 1–4) and this was blocked by addition of HapR (lanes 5–8).

This suggests similar nucleic acid sequences are recognised by each factor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> shows an alignment of DNA logos, derived from CRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manneh-Roussel et al., 2018</xref>) (top) and HapR (bottom) ChIP-seq targets.

This is consistent with the arrangement of binding sites upstream of <italic>murPQ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To understand the importance of this configuration, we first took a bioinformatic approach. The DNA sequences logos shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> were used to create position weight matrices (PWMs) describing either the CRP or HapR binding site. We then searched the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome, using each PWM, and calculated the distance between identified CRP and HapR sites. The data for all sites within 100 bp of each other is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> (top panel). In all cases, the CRP and HapR targets were offset by 1 bp.

An equivalent analysis of the <italic>V. harveyi</italic> genome produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, sites for CRP and HapR have a propensity to coincide in a specific configuration.

When aligned in this way, CRP and HapR recognise the same section of DNA via different surfaces of the double helix. We examined the model in the context of our DNAse I footprinting data. Recall that CRP binding upstream of <italic>murPQ</italic> induces three sites of DNAse I hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

This likely explains why positions –47 and –38 are more readily cleaved by DNAse I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). With both CRP and HapR, position –34 was completely protected from DNAse I attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

This is likely because R123 sits at the HapR dimerisation interface. Hence, we focused on understanding the contribution of CRP sidechain E55 to co-operative DNA binding by HapR and CRP using EMSAs. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>. Both wild type CRP, and CRP<sup>E55A</sup>, were able to bind the <italic>murQP</italic> regulatory region similarly (lanes 1–4 and 10–13). As expected, HapR bound tightly to the wild type CRP:DNA complex (lanes 5–9). Conversely, HapR had a lower affinity for DNA in complex with CRP<sup>E55A</sup> (lanes 14–18). This suggests that the E55A mutation in CRP destabilises the interaction with HapR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title><italic>Repression of P</italic>murQP <italic>by HapR requires CRP residue E55</italic></title><p>Residue E55 locates to a negatively charged surface of CRP called Activating Region 3 (AR3).

Hence, AR3 is likely to be important for activation of P<italic>murQP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We inferred that CRP lacking E55 should activate P<italic>murQP</italic> less efficiently but be less sensitive to negative effects of HapR. To test these predictions, we used in vitro transcription assays. The results for CRP, CRP<sup>E55A</sup> and CRP<sup>E55R</sup> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>. All CRP derivatives were able to activate transcription from P<italic>murQP</italic>. However, consistent with an important role for AR3, the ability of the CRP<sup>E55A</sup> and CRP<sup>E55R</sup> to activate transcription was impaired (compare lanes 1–5, 10–14, and 19–23). Crucially, whilst HapR reduced transcription dependent on wild type CRP by 50-fold (compare lane 4 with lanes 6–9) only a 2-fold effect of HapR was observed with CRP<sup>E55A</sup> (compare lane 13 with lanes 15–18).

Strikingly, the <italic>luxO</italic> mutant (high cell density locked), exhibited a growth defect only when MurNAc was the sole carbon source (compare red data points). Specifically, these cells exhibited an extended lag phase in MurNAc. This extended lag phase was not apparent when both <italic>luxO</italic> and <italic>hapR</italic> were deleted, consistent with the effect of <italic>luxO</italic> being mediated by HapR-dependent repression of <italic>murQP</italic>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Control of <italic>murQP</italic> expression by CRP and HapR at low and high cell density.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <bold><italic>V. cholerae</italic> locked at high cell density are defective for growth using MurNAc as the sole carbon source</bold>.

We selected 5 such targets and examined binding of CRP and HapR using EMSAs. At 1 target, adjacent to <italic>VCA0218</italic>, binding was not co-operative and free DNA remained when both proteins were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). For 4 of the targets, we detected co-operative binding of CRP and HapR, reminiscent of our experiments with P<italic>murQP</italic> DNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

For <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, van Kessel and co-workers used ChIP-seq to identify 105 LuxR binding targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kessel et al., 2013b</xref>). At 77 of these sites, LuxR repressed transcription. Using ChIP-seq and global DNAse I footprinting, Zhang et al. found 76 LuxR bound regions in <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Regulatory effects were evident for 37 targeted genes, with 22 cases of LuxR mediated repression. In the present study, we identified 32 HapR bound sections of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome. Consistent with prior work, repression of target genes was the most common regulatory outcome. Furthermore, the DNA binding consensus derived here for HapR is almost identical to motifs for LuxR binding in <italic>V. harveyi</italic> and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. Contrastingly, Tsou and colleagues used bioinformatic tools to predict HapR binding in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsou et al., 2009</xref>). Two different HapR binding motifs were proposed. Both partially match the HapR target sequence proposed here. Most likely, the analysis of Tsou et al. was hampered by a paucity of targets from which a full consensus could be derived. We note that our list of 32 HapR targets does not include all known targets. However, on inspection, whilst insufficient to pass our stringent selection criteria, weaker signals for HapR are evident at many such locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In particular, we note evidence for binding of HapR upstream of <italic>hapA</italic>, which has previously been only inferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We note that previous work relied on computational predictions and in vitro DNA binding assays to identify potential HapR targets. That not all such targets are bound in vivo, in the single growth condition tested here, is to be expected.</p><p>Recognition of shared DNA targets provides a simple mechanism for integration of quorum sensing signals, relayed by HapR, and cAMP fluctuations, communicated by CRP. In the example presented here, HapR acts to prevent transcription activation by co-binding the same DNA target with CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Hence, at P<italic>murQP</italic>, the function of CRP switches from that of an activator to a co-repressor with HapR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This regulatory strategy is a logical consequence of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> forming biofilms on chitinous surfaces. At low cell density, rapidly dividing cells must continually remodel their cell wall. In these conditions, HapR is not expressed. Thus, MurQ and MurP are produced and can convert cell wall derived MurNAc to GlcNAc-6P. Conversely, in high cell density scenarios, usually involving adherence to chitin, cells divide infrequently, and remodelling of the cell wall is reduced. In addition, GlcNAc-6P can be derived readily from chitin oligosaccharides. Hence, cells locked in the high cell density state are defective for growth when supplied with MurNAc as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). We suggest that HapR and CRP are likely to coordinate the expression of other metabolic enzymes in a similar way. Interestingly, AphA, another quorum sensing responsive regulator, also acts alongside CRP at many <italic>V. cholerae</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haycocks et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, AphA and CRP binding sites can overlap but this results in competition between the factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haycocks et al., 2019</xref>). Together with results presented here, these observations highlight close integration of quorum sensing with gene control by cAMP in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides</title><p>Strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

The read depth at each position of the genome was determined for each BAM file using multibamsummary. Each binding profile was then normalised to an average genome-wide read depth of 1 read per base.

Using ChIP-Seq, the authors find that at several sites, the HapR and CRP binding sites overlap. A detailed exploration of the murPQ promoter finds that CRP binding promotes HapR binding, which leads to repression of murPQ. The authors have a comprehensive set of experiments that paints a nice story providing a mechanistic explanation for converging global regulation. I did feel there are some weak points though, in particular the lack of integration of previously identified transcription start sites, the lack of replication (at least replication presented in the manuscript) for many figures, some oddities in the growth curve, and not reexamining their HapR/CRP cooperative binding model in vivo using ChIP-Seq.</p><p>Review of revised version:</p><p>This revised manuscript by Walker et. al. addresses some of the editorial points and conceptual discussion, but in general, most of my suggestions (as the previous reviewer #1) for additional experimentation or addition were not addressed as discussed below. Therefore, my overall review has not changed.</p><p>1. For example, in point 1, the suggested analysis was not performed because it is not trivial. My reason for making this suggestion is that the original manuscript was limited to Vibrio cholerae, and the impact of the manuscript would increase if the findings here were demonstrated to be more broadly applicable. I expect papers published in eLife to have such broad applicability. But no changes were made to the manuscript in this regard. The revised version is still limited to only <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>.</p><p>2. For point 2, the activity of FLAG-tag luxO could have been simply validated in a complementation assay. Yes, they demonstrated DNA binding, but that is not the only activity of LuxO.</p><p>3. For point 7, the transcriptional fusions were not explored at different times or different media, which is also something that was hinted at by other reviewers. In regard to exploring expression at different time points, this seems particularly relevant for QS regulated genes.</p><p>4. For point 13, the authors express that doing an additional CHIP-Seq is outside of the scope of this manuscript. Perhaps that is the case, but the point of the comment is to validate the in vitro binding results with an in vivo binding assay. A targeted CHIP-Seq approach specifically analyzing the promoters where cooperative binding was observed in vitro could have addressed this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86699.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript by Walker et al describes an elegant study that synergizes our knowledge of virulence gene regulation of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>.

Therefore, my overall review has not changed.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous response, we included (i) extra experimental data illustrating the reproducibility of our results and (ii) added transcription start site data at the request of this reviewer. We included the information because we agreed with the reviewer that these were important points to address. For the points raised again below, we explained why the additional analysis was unlikely to add much in terms of insight or rigour. We have elaborated further below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For example, in point 1, the suggested analysis was not performed because it is not trivial. My reason for making this suggestion is that the original manuscript was limited to Vibrio cholerae, and the impact of the manuscript would increase if the findings here were demonstrated to be more broadly applicable. I expect papers published in eLife to have such broad applicability. But no changes were made to the manuscript in this regard. The revised version is still limited to only <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>Our paper is focused on the unexpected co-operative interactions between HapR and CRP. Such co-binding of two transcription factors to the same DNA site is unexpected. Consequently, it is this mode of DNA binding that is likely to be of broad interest. With this in mind, we did provide experimental, and bioinformatic, analyses for other regulatory regions and other vibrio species (Figures S3 and S6). This, in our view, is where the “broad applicability” for papers published in eLife comes from.</p><p>The analysis the reviewer suggests is not related to the main message of our paper. Instead, the reviewer is asking how many HapR binding sites seen here by ChIP-seq are also seen in other vibrio species by ChIP-seq. This is only likely to be of interest to readers with an extremely specific interest in both vibrio species and HapR. The reviewer states above that we did not make the change “because it is not trivial”. This is an oversimplification of the rationale we presented in our response. The analysis is indeed not straightforward. However, much more importantly, the outcome is unlikely to be of interest to many readers, and has no bearing on the rigour of work. With this in mind, we do not think our position is unreasonable. We also stress that, should a reader with this very specific interest want to explore further, all of our data are freely available for them to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For point 2, the activity of FLAG-tag luxO could have been simply validated in a complementation assay. Yes, they demonstrated DNA binding, but that is not the only activity of LuxO.</p></disp-quote><p>DNA binding by LuxO is the only activity of the protein with which we are concerned in our paper. Furthermore, LuxO is very much a side issue; we found binding to only the known targets and potentially, at very low levels, one additional target. No further LuxO experiments were done for this reason. Indeed, even if these data were removed completely, our conclusions would not change or be supported any less vigorously. We are happy to remove the LuxO data if the reviewer would prefer but this would seem like overkill.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For point 7, the transcriptional fusions were not explored at different times or different media, which is also something that was hinted at by other reviewers. In regard to exploring expression at different time points, this seems particularly relevant for QS regulated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>In their previous review, the reviewer did not request that such experiments were done. Similarly, no other reviewer requested these experiments. Instead, this reviewer (i) commented that lacZ fusions were not as sensitive as luciferase fusions (ii) asked if we had done any time point experiments. We agreed with the first point, whilst also noting that lacZ is not unusual to use as a reporter. For the second point, we responded that we had not done such experiments (which by the reviewer’s own logic would have been complicated using lacZ as a reporter). This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to respond.</p><p>We should stress that these comments all refer to Figure 2a, which was our initial screening of 23 promoter::lacZ fusions, supported by separate in vitro transcription assays. Only one of these fusions was followed up as the main story in the paper. Given that the other 22 fusions were not investigated further, and do not form part of the main story, there would seem little value in now going back to assay them at different time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The work brings a new element of regulation for CRP, notably that CRP and the high density regulator HapR co-occupy the same site on the DNA but modeling predicts they occupy different faces of the DNA. The DNA binding and structural modeling work is nicely conducted and data of co-occupation are convincing. The work could benefit from doing a better job in the manuscript preparation to integrate the findings into our current state of knowledge of HapR and CRP regulated genes and to elevate the impact of the work to address how bacteria are responding to the nutritional environment. Importantly, the focus of the work is heavily based on the impact of use of GlcNAc as a carbon source when bacteria bind to chitin in the environment, but absent the impact during infection when CRP and HapR have known roles. Further, the impact on biological events controlled by HapR integration with the utilization of carbon sources (including biofilm formation) is not explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their overall positive evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rigor and reproducibility of the work needs to be better conveyed.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 made a similar comment (see above) and we have modified the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Specific comments to address:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Abstract. A comment on the impact of this work should be included in the last sentence. Specifically, how the integration of CRP with QS for gene expression under specific environments impacts the lifestyle of Vc is needed. The discussion includes comments regarding the impact of CRP regulation as a sensor of carbon source and nutrition and these could be quickly summarized as part of the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an extra sentence. However, we have used cautious language as we do not show impacts on lifestyle (beyond MurNAc utilisation) directly. These can only be inferred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 74. This paper examines the overlap of HapR with CRP, but ignores entirely AphA. HapR is repressed by Qrrs (downstream of LuxO-P) while AphA is activated by Qrrs. With LuxO activating AphA, it has a significant sized &quot;regulon&quot; of genes turned on at low density. It seems reasonable that there is a possibility of overlap also between CRP and AphA. While doing an AphA CHIP-seq is likely outside the scope of this work, some bioinformatic or simply a visual analysis of the promoters known AphA regulated genes would be interest to comment on with speculation in the discussion and/or supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>In short, everything that the reviewer suggests here has already been done and was covered in our original submission (see text towards the end of the Discussion). Also, we would like to point the referee to our earlier publication (Haycocks <italic>et al</italic>. 2019. The quorum sensing transcription factor AphA directly regulates natural competence in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. <italic>PLoS Genet.</italic> <bold>15:</bold>e1008362)<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 100. Accordingly with the above statement, the focus here on HapR indicates that the focus is on gene expression via LuxO and HapR, at high density. Thus the sentence should read &quot;we sought to map the binding of LuxO and HapR of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome at high density&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that expression of LuxO and HapR is ectopic in these experiments (i.e. uncoupled from culture density).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 109. The identification of minor LuxO binding site in the intergenic region between VC1142 and VC1143 raises whether there may be a previously unrecognized sRNA here. As another panel in figure S1, can you provide a map of the intergenic region showing the start codons and putative -10 to -35 sites. Is there room here for an sRNA? Is there one known from the many sRNA predictions / identifications previously done? Some additional analysis would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an extra panel to Figure S1 showing the position of TSSs relative to the location of LuxO binding. We have altered the main text to accommodate this addition..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 117. This sentence states that the CHIP seq analysis in this study includes previously identified HapR regulated genes, but does not reveal that many known HapR regulated genes are absent from Table 1 and thus were missed in this study. Of 24 HapR regulated investigated by Tsou et al, only 1 is found in Table 1 of this study. A few are commented in the discussion and Figure S7. It might be useful to add a Venn Diagram to Figure 1 (and list table in supplement) for results of Tsou et al, Waters et al, Lin et al, and Nielson et al and any others. A major question is whether the trend found here for genes identified by CHIP-seq in this study hold up across the entire HapR regulon. There should also be comments in the discussion on perhaps how different methods (including growth state and carbon sources of media) may have impacted the complexity of the regulon identified by the different authors and different methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a list of known sites to the supplementary material (new Table S1). We were unsure what was meant by the comment “A major question is whether the trend found here for genes identified by CHIP-seq in this study hold up across the entire HapR regulon”. We have added the extra comment to the discussion re growth conditions, also noting that most previous studies relied on in vitro, rather than in vivo, DNA binding assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The transcription data are generally well performed. In all figures, add comments to the figure legends that the experiments are representative gels from n=# (the number of replicate experiments for the gel based assays). Statements to the rigor of the work are currently missing.</p></disp-quote><p>See responses above. We have added a comment on numbers of repeats to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 357-360. The demonstration of lack of growth on MurNAc is a nice for the impact of the work. However, more detailed comments are needed for M9 plus glucose for the uninformed reader to be reminded that growth in glucose is also impaired due to lack of cAMP in glucose replete conditions and thus minimal CRP is active. But why is this now dependent of hapR? A reminder also that in LB oligopeptides from tryptone are the main carbon source and thus CRP would be active.</p></disp-quote><p>We find this point a little confusing and, maybe, two issues (<italic>murQP</italic> regulation, and growth in general) are being conflated. In particular, we do not understand the comment “growth in glucose is also impaired due to lack of cAMP in glucose replete conditions and thus minimal CRP is active”.</p><p>Growth in glucose should indeed result in lower cAMP levels*, and hence less active CRP, but this does not impair growth. This is simply the cell’s strategy for using its preferred carbon source. If the reviewer were instead referring to some aspect of P_murQP_ regulation then yes, we would expect promoter activity to be lower because less active CRP would be available in the presence of glucose. The reviewer also comments “why is this now dependent of hapR?”. We assume that they are referring to some aspect of growth in minimal media with glucose. If so, the only hapR effect is the change in growth rate as cells enter mid-late log-phase (i.e. the growth curve looks somewhat biphasic). A similar effect is seen in all conditions. We do not know why this happens and can only conclude this is due to some unknown regulatory activity of HapR. Overall, the key point from these experiments is that loss if luxO, which results in constitutive hapR expression, lengthens lag phase only for growth with MurNAc as the sole carbon source.</p><p>*Although in <italic>V. fischeri</italic> (PMID: 26062003) cAMP levels increase in the presence of glucose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. A great final experiment to demonstrate the model would have been to show co-localization of the promoter by CRP and HapR from bacteria grown in LB media but not in LB+glucose or in M9+glycerol and M9+MurNAc but not M9+glucose. This would enhance the model by linking more directly to the carbon sources (currently only indirect via growth curves)</p></disp-quote><p>This is unlikely to be as straightforward as suggested. The sensitivity of CRP binding to growth conditions is not uniform across different binding sites. For instance, the CRP dependence of the <italic>E. coli melAB</italic> promoter is only evident in minimal media (PMID: 11742992) whilst the role of CRP at the <italic>acs</italic> promoter is evident in tryptone broth (PMID: 14651625). Similarly, as noted above, in <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> glucose causes and increase in cAMP levels. (PMID: 26062003).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Discussion. Comments and model focus heavily on GlcNAc-6P but HapR has a regulator role also during late infection (high density). How does CRP co-operativity impact during the in vivo conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We really can’t answer this question with any certainty; we have not done any infection experiments in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the Biphasic role of CRP play a role here (PMID: 20862321)?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we cannot answer this question with any confidence as experimentation would be required. However, the suggestion is certainly plausible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Bacteria sense and respond to multiple signals and cues to regulate gene expression. To define the complex network of signaling that ultimately controls transcription of many genes in cells requires an understanding of how multiple signaling systems can converge to effect gene expression and ensuing bacterial behaviors. The global transcription factor CRP has been studied for decades as a regulator of genes in response to glucose availability. It's direct and indirect effects on gene expression have been documented in <italic>E. coli</italic> and other bacteria including pathogens including Vibrio cholerae. Likewise, the master regulator of quorum sensing (QS), HapR, is a well-studied transcription factor that directly controls many genes in Vibrio cholerae and other Vibrios in response to autoinducer molecules that accumulate at high cell density. By contrast, low cell density gene expression is governed by another regulator AphA. It has not yet been described how HapR and CRP may together work to directly control transcription and what genes are under such direct dual control.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their assessment of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using both in vivo methods with gene fusions to lacZ and in vitro transcription assays, the authors proceed to identify the smaller subset of genes whose transcription is directly repressed (7) and activated (2) by HapR. Prior work from this group identified the direct CRP binding sites in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome as well as promoters with overlapping binding sites for AphA and CRP, thus it appears a logical extension of these prior studies is to explore here promoters for potential integration of HapR and CRP. Inclusion of this rationale was not included in the introduction of CRP protein to the in vitro experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s comment. However, the rationale for adding CRP was not that we had previously seen interplay between AphA and CRP (although this is a relevant discussion point, which we did make). Rather, we had noticed that there was an almost perfect CRP site perfectly positioned to activate PmurQP. Hence, CRP was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Seven genes are found to be repressed by HapR in vivo, the promoter regions of only six are repressed in vitro with purified HapR protein alone. The authors propose and then present evidence that the seventh promoter, which controls murPQ, requires CRP to be repressed by HapR both using in vivo and vitro methods. This is a critical insight that drives the rest of the manuscripts focus. The DNase protection assay conducted supports the emerging model that both CRP and HapR bind at the same region of the murPQ promoter, but interpret is difficult due to the poor quality of the blot.</p><p>There are areas of apparent protection at positions +1 to +15 that are not discussed, and the areas highlighted are difficult to observe with the blot provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree on this point. The region between +1 and +15 is inherently resistant to attack by DNAseI and there are only ever very weak bands in this region (lane 1). Other than seeing small fluctuations in overall lane intensity (e.g. lanes 7-12 have a slightly lower signal throughout) the +1 to +15 banding pattern does not change. Conversely, there are dramatic changes in the banding pattern between around -30 and -60 (again, compare lane 1 to all other lanes). That CRP and HapR bind the same region is extremely clear. Also note that this is backed up by mutagenesis of the shared binding site (Figure 4c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model proposed at the end of the manuscript proposes physiological changes in cells that occur at transitions from the low to high cell density. Experiments in the paper that could strengthen this argument are incomplete. For example, in Fig. 4e it is unclear at what cell density the experiment is conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>Such details have been added to the figure legends and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results with the wild type strain are intermediate relative to the other strains tested.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, and exactly what we would expect to see based on our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cell density should affect the result here since HapR is produced at high density but not low density. This experiment would provide important additional insights supporting their model, by measuring activity at both cell densities and also in a luxO mutant locked at the high cell density. Conducting this experiment in conditions lacking and containing glucose would also reveal whether high glucose conditions mimicking the crp results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this idea in principle but note that the output from our reporter gene, β- galactosidase, is stable within cells and tends to accumulate. This is likely to obscure the reduction in expression as cells transition from low to high cell density. Since we have demonstrated the regulatory effects of HapR and CRP both in vivo using gene knockouts, and in vitro with purified proteins, we think that our overall model is very well supported. Further experimental additions may provide an incremental advance but will not alter our overall story. Also note the unexpected increase in intracellular cAMP due to addition of glucose, in <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> (PMID: 26062003).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the paper it was challenging to account for the number of genes selected, the rationale for their selection, and how they were prioritized. For example, the authors acknowledged toward the end of the Results section that in their prior work, CRP and HapR binding sites were identified (line 321-22).</p></disp-quote><p>This is not quite what we say, and maybe the reviewer misunderstood, which is our fault. The prior work identified CRP sites whilst the current work identified HapR sites. We have made a slight alteration to the text to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear whether the loci indicated in Table 1 all from this prior study. It would be useful to denote in this table the seven genes characterized in Figure 2 and to provide the locus tag for murPQ.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we are unsure if we have confused the reviewer. The results in Table 1 are all HapR sites from the current work, not a prior study. However, some of these also correspond to CRP binding regions found in prior work.</p><p>The reviewer mentions “the seven genes characterised in Figure 2” but 23 targets were characterised in Figure 2a and 9 in Figure 2b. The “VC” numbers used in Figure 2 are the same as used in Table 1 so it is easy to cross reference between the two. We have added a footnote to Table 1, also referred to in the Figure 2 legend, to allow cross referencing between gene names and locus tags (including for <italic>murQP</italic> and <italic>hapR</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of the 32 loci shown in Table 1, five were selected for further study using EMSA (line 322), but no rationale is given for studying these five and not others in the table.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not quite correct, we did not select 5 from the 32 targets listed in Table 1. We selected 5 targets from Table 1 that were also targets for CRP in our prior paper. This was the rationale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since prior work identified a consensus CRP binding motif, the authors identify the DNA sequence to which HapR binds overlaps with a sequence also predicted to bind CRP. Genome analysis identified a total of seven sites where the CRP and HapR binding sites were offset by one nucleotide as see with murPQ. Lines 327-8 describe EMSA results with several of these DNA sequences but provides no data to support this statement. Are these loci in Table 1?</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is a little difficult to follow, and we may have misunderstood, but we think that the reviewer is asking where the EMSA data referred to on lines 327-328 resides. We can see that the text could be confusing in this regard. We had referred to the relevant figure (Figure S6) on line 324 but did not again include this information further down in the description of the result. We have changed the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using structural models, the authors predict that HapR repression requires protein-protein interactions with CRP. Electromobility shift assays (EMSA) with purified promoter DNA, CRP and HapR (Fig 5d) and in vitro transcription using purified RNAP with these factors (Figure 5e) support this hypothesis. However, the model proports that HapR &quot;bound tightly&quot; and that it also had a &quot;lower affinity&quot; when CRP protein was used that had mutations in a putative interaction interface. These claims can be bolstered if the authors calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) value of each protein to the DNA. This provides a quantitative assessment of the binding properties of the proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we do not explicitly provide a Kd. However, in both Figures 5d and 5e, we do provide very similar quantification. In 5d, our quantification is the % of the CRP-DNA complex bound by HapR (using either wild type or E55A CRP). Since the % of DNA bound is shown, and the protein concentrations are provided in the figure legend, information regarding Kd is essentially already present. In 5e, we show the % of maximal promoter activity. This is a reasonable way of quantifying the result.

However, molecular crowding is likely to increase the effective concentration.

As similar experiments have been performed in other Vibrios, it would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between the species. Perhaps a Venn diagram showing how many targets were found in all studies versus how many are species specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion but would prefer not to make this change. A cross-species analysis would be very time consuming and is not trivial. The presence and absence of each target gene, for all combinations of organisms, would first need to be determined. Then, the presence and absence of binding signals for HapR, or its equivalent, would need to be determined taking this into account. For most readers, we feel that this analysis is unlikely to add much to the overall story. Given the amount of effort involved, this seems a “non-essential” change to make.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 101-Are the FLAG tagged versions of LuxO and HapR completely functional? Can they complement a luxO or hapR deletion mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>The activity of FLAG tagged HapR (LuxR in other Vibrio species) has been shown previously (e.g. PMIDs 33693882 and 23839217). Similarly, N-terminal HapR tags are routinely used for affinity purification of the protein without ill effect. We have not tested LuxO-3xFLAG for “full” activity, though this fusion is clearly active for DNA binding, the only activity that we have measured here, since all know targets are pulled down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 106-As the authors state later that there are additional smaller peaks for HapR that could be other direct targets, I think a brief mention of the methodology used to determine the cutoff for the 5 and 32 peaks for LuxO and HapR, respectively, would be informative here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a little more text to the methods section. The added text states “Note that our cut- off was selected to identify only completely unambiguous binding peaks. Hence, weak or less reproducible binding signals, even if representing known targets, were excluded (see Discussion for further details)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 118-Need a reference here to the prior HapR binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figs. 1e-What do the numbers on the x-axis refer to? Why not just present these data as bases? The authors also refer to distance to the nearest start codon, but this is irrelevant for 4/5 of the luxO targets as they are sRNAs. They should really refer to the distance to the transcription start site. Likewise, for HapR, distance to the nearest start codon is not as informative as distance to the nearest transcription start site. A recent paper used transcriptomics to map all the transcription start sites of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and these results should be integrated into the author's study rather than just using the nearest start codon (PMID: 25646441).</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers are kilo base pairs, this has been added to the axis label. We have also changed “start codon” to “gene start” (since “gene start” is also suitable for genes that encode untranslated RNAs).</p><p>Re comparing binding peak positions to transcription start sites (TSSs) rather than gene starts, this analysis would be useful if TSSs could be detected for all genes. However, some genes are not expressed under the conditions tested by PMID: 25646441, so no TSS is found. Consequently, for HapR or LuxO bound at such locations, we would not be able to calculate a meaningful position relative to the TSS. We stress that the point of the analysis is to determine how peaks are positioned with respect to genes (i.e. that sites cluster near gene 5’ ends). Also note that nearest TSSs are now shown in the revised Table 1. In some cases, these are unlikely to be the TSS actually subject to regulation (e.g. because the regulated gene is switched off).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 1e-Is there directionality to the site? In other words, if a HapR binding site is located between two genes that are transcribed in opposite directions, is there a way to predict which gene is regulated? It looks like this might be the case with the list presented in Table 1, but how such determination is made and what the various symbol in Table 1 mean are not clear to me. This also has ramifications for Fig. 2a as the direction to construct the fusion is critical for the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The site is a palindrome so lacks directionality. The best prediction re regulation is likely to be positioning with respect to the nearest TSS (which is now included in Table 1). However, this would remain just a prediction and, where TSSs are in odd locations with respect to binding sites (taking into account the caveats above) predictions would be unreliable.</p><p>We are unsure which symbol the reviewer refers to in Table 1, a full explanation of any symbols used is provided in the table footnotes.</p><p>With respect to Figure 2a, if sites were between divergent genes, and met our other criteria, we tested for regulation in both directions. For example, see the divergent genes VCA0662 (classified inactive) and VCA0663 (classified repressed).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 2a-It is a little disappointing that the authors use LacZ fusions to measure transcription as this is not the most sensitive reporter gene. Luciferase gene fusions would have been much more sensitive. Also, did the authors examine multiple time points. The methods only describe &quot;mid-log phase&quot; but some of the inactive promoters could be expressed at other time points. Also, it would be simple to repeat this experiment in different media, such as minimal with glucose or another non- CRP carbon source, to expand which promoters are expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct regarding the sensitivity of β-galactosidase, which is very stable and so accumulates as cells grow. Even so, this reporter has been used very successfully, across thousands of studies, for decades. We did not examine multiple timepoints. We appreciate that the 23 promoter::lacZ fusions could be re-examined using varying growth conditions but this is unlikely to impact the overall conclusions, though it could generate some new leads for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Fig. 2b and many additional figures quantify band intensity but do not show any replication or error. Therefore, it is impossible to gauge reproducibility of these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a reproducibility statement (all experiments were done multiple times with similar results) as is standard throughout the literature. Also note that there is a lot of internal replication between figures. Figure 4d and Figure 5e lanes 1-9 show essentially the same experiment (albeit with slightly different protein concentrations) and very similar results. To the same effect, Figure 5e lanes 10-18 and lanes 19-27 show the same experiment for two different mutations of the same CRP residue. Again, the results are very similar. Also see the response to your comment 15 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4a-lanes 2-4-the footprint does not change with additional CRP. In other words, it looks the same at the lowest concentration of CRP versus the highest concentration of CRP. The footprints for HapR look similar. This is somewhat troubling as in these types of experiments one would like to observe a dose dependent change in the footprint correlating with more DNA occupancy.</p></disp-quote><p>For CRP we agree but are not concerned at all by this. The site is simply full occupied at the lowest protein concentration tested. Given that the footprint exactly coincides with a near consensus CRP site (which, when mutated, abolishes CRP binding in EMSAs, and regulation by CRP in vivo) all our results are perfectly consistent. Note that (i) our only aim in this experiment was to determine the positions of CRP and HapR binding (ii) our conclusions are independently backed up using gel shifts and by making promoter mutations. With respect to HapR, there are changes at the periphery of the main footprint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4e-Why does the transcriptional activation of murQP decrease with increasing concentrations of CRP? This is also seen in Fig. 5e.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience, this often does happen when doing <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays (with CRP and many other activators). The anecdotal explanation is that, at higher concentrations, the regulator can start to bind the DNA non-specifically and so interfere with transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors demonstrate in vitro that HapR requires binding of CRP to bind the murQP promoter. It would strengthen their model if they demonstrated this in vivo. To do this, the authors only need to repeat their ChIP-Seq experiment in a delta CRP mutant and the HapR signal at murQP would be lost. In fact, such an experiment would experimentally confirm which of the in vivo HapR binding sites are CRP dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, appreciate the comment, and do plan to do such experiments in the future as a wider assessment of interactions between transcription factors. However, doing this does have substantial time and resource implications that we cannot devote to the project at present. We feel that our overall conclusions, regarding co-operative interactions between HapR and CRP at PmurQP, are well supported by the data already provided. This also seems the overall opinion of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 5b-I am confused by the Venn diagram. The text states that &quot;In all cases, the CRP and HapR targets were offset by 1 bp&quot;, but the diagram only shows 7 overlapping sites. The authors need to better describe these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We mean that, in all cases where sites overlap, sites are offset by 1 bp (i.e. we didn’t find any sites overlapping but offset by 2, 3 4 bp etc).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Line 287-288 and Fig. 5d-The authors state that HapR binds with less affinity to the CRP E55A mutant protein bound to DNA. There does seem to be a difference in the amount of shifted bands at the equivalent concentrations of HapR, but the difference is subtle. In order to make such a conclusion, the authors should show replication of the data and calculate the variability in the results. The authors should also use these data to determine the actual binding affinities of HapR to WT and the E55A mutant CRP, along with error or confidence intervals.</p></disp-quote><p>All of these experiments have been run multiple times and we are absolutely confident of the result. With respect to Figure 5d, this was done many times. We note that not all experiments were exact repeats. E.g. some of the first attempts had fewer HapR concentrations. Even so, the defect in HapR binding to the CRP E55A complex was always evident. The two gels to the left show the final two iterations of this experiment (these are exact repeats). The top image is that shown in Figure 5d. The lower image is an equivalent experiment run a day or so previously. Both clearly show a defect in HapR binding to the CRP E55A complex. We appreciate that our conclusion re these experiments is somewhat qualitative (i.e. that HapR binds the CRP E55A complex less readily) but this is not out of kilter with the vast majority of similar literature and our results are clearly reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 6a-It is odd that the locked low cell density mutants have such a growth defect in MurNAc, minimal glucose, and LB. To my knowledge, such a growth defect is not common with these strains. Perhaps this has to do with the specific growth conditions used here, but I can't find that information in the manuscript (it should be there). Furthermore, the growth rate of the luxO and hapR mutants appears to be similar up to the branch point (i.e. slope of the curve), but the lag phage of the luxO mutant is much longer. The authors need to address these issues in relationship to previous published literature and specify their growth conditions because the results are not consistent with their simple model described in Fig 6b.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is a little difficult to pick apart as it covers several different issues. We’ll try and</p><p>answer these individually.</p><p>a) The unusual “biphasic growth curve with hapR and hapRluxO cells: We do not know why cells lacking hapR have a growth curve that appears biphasic. We can only assume that this is due to some regulatory effect of HapR, distinct from the <italic>murQP</italic> locus. Despite the unusual shape of the growth curve, the data are consistent with our conclusions.</p><p>b) The extended lag phase of the luxO mutant in minimal media + MurNAc: We appreciate this comment and had considered possible explanations prior to submission. In the end, we left out this speculation but are happy to include it as part of our response. The extended lag phase might be expected if CRP/HapR regulation is largely critical for controlling the basal transcription of murQP. The locus is likely also regulated by the upstream repressor MurR (VC0204) as in <italic>E. coli</italic>. So, if deprepression of MurR overwhelms the effect of HapR on murQP, we think you would expect that once the cells start growing on MurNAc, the growth rates are unchanged. But the extended lag is due to the fact that it took longer for those cells to achieve the critical threshold of intracellular MurNAc-6-P necessary to drive murR derepression. Obviously, we can not provide a definitive answer.</p><p>c) We have added further details regarding growth conditions to the methods section and the Figure 6a legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. S6-The data to this point with murPQ suggested a model in which CRP binding then enabled HapR binding. But these EMSA suggest that both situations occur as in some cases, such as VCA0691, HapR binding promotes CRP binding. How does such a result fit with the structural model presented in Fig. 5?</p></disp-quote><p>This is to be expected and is fully consistent with the model. Cooperativity is a two-way street, and each protein will stabilise binding of the other. Clearly, it will not always be the case that the shared DNA site will have a higher affinity for CRP than HapR (as at PmurQP). Depending on the shared site sequence, expected that sometimes HapR will bind “first” and then stabilise binding of CRP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Line 354-356-The HCD state of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> occurs in mid-exponential phase and several cell divisions occur before stationary phase and the cessation of growth, at least in normal laboratory conditions. Therefore, there is not support for the argument that QS is a mechanism to redirect cell wall components at HCD because cell wall synthesis is no longer needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intent to suggest cell wall synthesis is not needed at all, rather that there is a reduced need. We made a slight change to the discussion to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Line 357-360-Again, as stated in point 16, the statement that cells locked in the HCD are &quot;defective for growth&quot; is an oversimplification. The luxO mutants have a longer lag phage, but they actually outgrow the hapR mutants at higher cell densities and reach the maximum yield much faster.</p></disp-quote><p>In fairness, we do go on to specify that the defect is an extended lag phase.
