We developed a model that captures bacterial growth dynamics and identifies key factors that predict the infection outcome: the rate of bacterial proliferation and the time required for the host to establish an effective immunological control.

One individual may experience mild symptoms and recover easily, while another may suffer devastating illness or even death. A number of factors are often assumed to account for these differences, including the sex, age and genes of the individuals, and differences in the environments the individuals have been exposed to. However, random variations in how an individual’s immune system interacts with the infection could also play an important role in recovery.</p><p>Duneau et al. have now studied how genetically identical fruit flies who were raised in the same environment respond to different bacterial infections. This enabled them to develop a mathematical model that describes how a bacterial infection develops in an individual. In an initial phase, the bacteria proliferate freely. If the immune defenses activate in time to control the infection, the number of bacteria in the fly decreases to a constant level and the infection enters a long-term, or chronic, phase. The sooner this happens the more likely it is that the fly will survive. If the immune control happens too late, the infection enters a terminal phase and the fly will die once the number of bacteria increases to a certain level.</p><p>The model therefore reveals that the precise time at which the immune system takes control of the bacterial population – termed the “Time to Control” – determines the outcome of the infection. Duneau et al. confirmed this by injecting bacteria into identical flies. A small variation in the Time to Control was sometimes the difference between a fly living or dying. Understanding what controls this apparently random variation is key to understanding infection and potentially developing more efficient treatments for a wide range of diseases – not just those caused by bacteria, but also those caused by viruses and parasites, like HIV and malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>inter-individual variation</kwd><kwd>stochasticity</kwd><kwd>mixture modelling</kwd><kwd>Imd pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1354421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AI083932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazzaro</surname><given-names>Brian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004856</institution-id><institution>New York State Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Empire state stem cell fund C029542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship from P300P3_147874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duneau</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>French Laboratory of Excellence ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duneau</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>French Laboratory of Excellence project ANR-10-LABX-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duneau</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1656118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An analysis of within-host bacterial proliferation reveals that minor &quot;stochastic&quot; variation in the ability of the innate immune response to control bacterial growth early on can result in either survival or death of the host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two hosts exposed to apparently identical infections may have dramatically different outcomes. In one case, the host may experience only mild symptoms and recover easily, while in another the host may suffer devastating illness or even death. In many pathogenic infections, only a fraction of the infected hosts die from the infection or carry a high pathogen burden, while other hosts may strongly limit parasite proliferation. For example, mosquitoes infected with malaria experience high and low pathogen load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina-Cruz et al., 2008</xref>), rats infected with <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> experience bimodal pathogen burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>), and even the abundance of gut microbes exhibits bimodal variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lahti et al., 2014</xref>). Genetically identical hosts may still experience drastically different infection outcomes (e.g. clonal population of <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> infected by one strain of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duneau et al., 2012</xref>]). These observations suggest that the process of infection could itself be intrinsically variable. While such differences can sometimes stem from genetic or environmental variation among hosts, in other cases the difference in outcome appears to be more arbitrary or stochastic, and the relative contributions of genetic, environmental and random individual variation remain unclear.</p><p>Variation in within-host disease processes can affect pathogen evolution by modulating the within-host evolutionary dynamic during the course of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alizon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mideo et al., 2011</xref>). Theory predicts that variation in traits such as bacterial growth rate or host response time to an infection can affect the outcome of the infection and thus the epidemiology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alizon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenton et al., 2006</xref>). To better understand the selection pressures that shape host-parasite interactions, it is important to empirically open the ‘within-host black box’ and characterize the different phases of an infection and to define the evolutionarily relevant parameters in the host and parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alizon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is a prime model to study host-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> relies on both humoral and cellular responses to fight infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). The humoral response consists of the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) into the hemolymph (insect blood) and the activation of the melanization cascade, both of which limit microbial proliferation. The cellular responses include encapsulation of foreign bodies and phagocytosis by dedicated immune cells. Antimicrobial peptides are constitutively expressed in a restricted set of barrier tissues at low levels but are massively upregulated in the fat body in response to infection. Two major signaling pathways, the Toll and Imd pathways, drive the induction of AMPs in the fat body. Importantly, we and other groups have observed strong inter-individual variation in the outcome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> infected with a wide range of bacteria and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemmons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howick and Lazzaro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutzer and Armitage, 2016</xref>), which suggests that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a good model to study the stochastic nature of infection.</p><p>In the present work, we aim to identify key parameters of the intra-host dynamic that underlie the inter-individual variation in the outcome of infection. We first demonstrate that infection of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by a series of bacterial pathogens leads to highly variable infection outcomes. Notably, infections with the Gram-negative <italic>Providencia rettgeri</italic> and the Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> result in one of two binary outcomes: some individuals die with a high pathogen burden, whereas others survive indefinitely with fairly asymptomatic and low-burden persistent infections. Different individuals of the same age and genotype may experience either outcome, even when co-housed in the same rearing vial. We find that bacterial burden upon host death did not correlate with the time post-injection at which death occurs, and that the lethal burden varies across bacterial species and strains. Surviving flies sustain a much lower pathogen burden, which also varies across bacterial species and can depend on the initial inoculum and on the immune response. Using a variety of experimental manipulations, we determined that inter-individual variation occurs as a consequence of the interplay between bacterial growth rate and the activation of the host immune response. We developed a theoretical model that describes the probabilistic nature of bacterial growth and thus host survival based on three key factors: the net rate of bacterial proliferation (<italic>µ</italic>), the timing of effective immunological control (<italic>T<sup>c</sup></italic>), and an inferred threshold pathogen density (<italic>n<sup>tip</sup></italic>) that must be reached to enable the bacteria to switch to a lethally acute infection instead of a chronically persistent one. Our model predicts infection dynamics accurately and suggests that inter-host variation in survival must originate in the ability of the pathogen to reach the <italic>n<sup>tip</sup></italic> threshold before effective immune control is established. We observe empirically that the quantitative activation of the immune response varies among individual hosts, suggesting that inter-individual stochasticity early in infection might lead to differences in the probability of ultimate survival. Altogether, our results illustrate the mechanisms underlying the variable nature of infection outcome and provide a framework for studying the distinct parameters that govern the progression of infection and lead ultimately to life or death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The outcome of infection for individual hosts is highly variable</title><p>Infection with different pathogens produces dramatically different outcomes that range from the certain death of all host individuals to the nearly certain survival of all host individuals. In order to define the range of outcomes, we infected male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> with a panel of seven bacteria by injection of a controlled dose into the abdominal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Infection with <italic>Providencia alcalifaciens</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens Db11</italic> was lethal to the flies in a short timeframe, killing all individuals within one day of infection. Conversely, nearly all individuals survived infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Erwinia carotovora Ecc15</italic> (formally known as <italic>Pectinobacterium carotovorum carotovorum 15</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Infections with different natural pathogens of <italic>Drosophila</italic> including <italic>P. rettgeri</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>P. burhodogranariea</italic> resulted in the death of only a fraction of the infected population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is commonly assumed that inter-individual differences can stem from genetic differences or environmental variation, including nutrition, gut microbes or rearing conditions. We therefore controlled for these sources of variation by infecting same-aged, genetically identical hosts (isogenic lines of the Drosophila Genome Resource Panel and w<sup>1118</sup>), reared in a common environment with a controlled microbiota and given experimentally identical infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Even under experimentally identical conditions, we continued to see dual outcomes of infection. In addition, the relative probability of the infection achieving either outcome varied among genotypes. Inter-individual variation could also stem from small variation in fly handling at the time of infection. For instance, differences in exposure to the CO<sub>2</sub> used for anesthesia during the experiments could influence the probability of death upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helenius et al., 2009</xref>). However, we found that even 15 min of exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> prior to or after injection did not affect the chance of survival relative to 2 min of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results demonstrate stochastic variation in the outcome of infection (life or death) even among genetically identical individuals, although host and bacterial genotype combine to determine the probability of surviving infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28298.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The outcome of infection ranges from 100% to 0% survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Canton S flies were injected with the same inoculum (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1, ca. 30,000 bacteria) of different bacteria species. <italic>Providencia alcalifaciens</italic> (n = 29) and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (n = 30) are lethal pathogens (green solid lines) and killed 100% of the hosts in less than a day. <italic>E. coli</italic> (n = 21) and <italic>E. carotovora</italic> (n = 20) infection did not reduce host survival (blue dashed lines). <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> (n = 44), <italic>P. burhodogranariea</italic> (n = 44) and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (n = 30) infections led to intermediate outcomes (blue solid lines): some individuals died in the first two days after infection while others survived.

To test this, we quantified bacterial loads in individual flies that were still alive seven days after injection with <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>E. carotovora</italic>, <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and <italic>P. rettgeri</italic>. At this point, mortality curves had plateaued and little to no further death was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that none of the bacteria had been entirely cleared from the host and nearly all individual hosts still had measurable loads of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the case of the most benign pathogens, which did not lead to the death of any host individuals, a few host individuals either cleared the infection or sustained loads below our detection threshold of 10 bacteria per fly (~22% for <italic>E. coli</italic> and ~8% for <italic>E. carotovora</italic>). However, most surviving hosts developed persistent, chronic infections. In addition, the bacterial load sustained during the persistent phase of infection was constant but distinct for each bacterium (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We termed this parameter the ‘Set Point Bacterial Load’ (<italic>SPBL</italic>), in analogy to the commonly used ‘Set Point Viral Load’ for chronic viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fraser et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly the <italic>SPBL</italic> for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. carotovora</italic> were significantly lower than those from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> infections, which also differed between each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>SPBL</italic> for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. carotovora</italic>, our two least virulent bacteria, was a few hundred bacteria per infected host. In contrast, the <italic>SPBL</italic> for pathogens of intermediate virulence, such as <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, centered around a few thousand bacteria, and no single fly ever cleared the infection. In addition, we found the <italic>SPBL</italic> for <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> to be significantly different among three <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> host genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), increasing with the size of the initial inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the individual hosts that died from their infections.

Mortality begins as soon as 16 hr post-injection and continues over the course of a few days before survivorship plateaus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We quantified the Bacterial Load Upon Death (<italic>BLUD</italic>) by sampling individual flies within 30 min after their death, before the confounding effect of <italic>post-mortem</italic> bacterial proliferation. We compared those loads to pathogen burdens of still-living individuals sampled from the population all along the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ai</xref>) or at a unique time point where 5% of the population died at once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>). The <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> loads in recently-dead individuals were 2<sup>23.4</sup> ± 2<sup>1.6</sup> (mean ±sd) bacteria/fly, regardless of the time post-injection at which the host died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These loads were consistently 100-fold higher than those of living individuals (2<sup>15.8</sup> ± 2<sup>3.8</sup> bacteria/fly; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The narrow range of bacterial load upon death and the fact that live flies carry fewer bacteria than recently dead flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>) suggests that the <italic>BLUD</italic> is a lethal load and cannot be sustained in living individuals. We found that there is a <italic>BLUD</italic> associated with every bacterium and that the <italic>BLUD</italic> differed significantly between bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that this threshold is a property of the pathogen. Surprisingly, the <italic>BLUD</italic> did not reflect the time it took various pathogens to kill the host.

We therefore next measured both inter- and intra-specific variation in the <italic>BLUD</italic> after infection with <italic>P. rettgeri</italic>. We first assessed the <italic>BLUD</italic> of <italic>P. rettgeri-</italic>infected flies belonging to four different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<italic>D. sechellia</italic>, <italic>D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> and <italic>D. ananassae</italic>) and to four different <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-derived isogenic lines (RAL-714, RAL-359, RAL-138 and RAL-882).

We did not detect significant differences in the <italic>BLUD</italic> between any of the immune-deficient hosts and their corresponding wild-type genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This result supports the idea that the BLUD is an exclusive measure of tolerance and not resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that bacterial infections of <italic>Drosophila</italic> result in binary outcomes. Either the host dies from acute infection with a stereotypical bacterial burden that is independent of dose, the <italic>BLUD</italic>, or the host survives but sustains a chronic infection at low and also stereotypical bacterial burden that does depend on initial dose, the <italic>SPBL</italic>.

In order to test this hypothesis, we initiated an in-depth study of bacterial growth in response to three categories of pathogens: those that quickly kill all infected hosts, those that kill none, and those that kill only a fraction of the infected population. We measured the bacterial load in individual flies at regular one-hour intervals for the first 16 hr after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Upon infection with two avirulent bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. carotovora</italic>, bacterial burdens inside individual flies decreased soon after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that these bacteria are controlled within a couple of hours by the host, even though they are not completely cleared. After injection with bacteria that kill all infected hosts in few hours (<italic>P. alcalifaciens</italic> or <italic>S. marcescens</italic>), the pathogen burdens increased monotonically until all individuals were dead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the host fails to control the infection.

For these, we found that bacteria proliferated homogenously in all individuals during the early phase of infection (up to around 6–8 hr), but that subsequently two groups of hosts could be distinguished. Hosts of one group carried high and increasing bacterial loads, and we hypothesized that these individuals are fated to die. Hosts in the other group exhibited a smaller bacterial load that stabilized over time, and we hypothesize that these are the individuals who will sustain chronic infections. Remarkably, the in vivo proliferation of <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> in the early phase of infection is equivalent to the rate of in vitro growth in LB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the bacteria are growing largely without constraint in this early phase.

Proliferation continues at this same rate in the host group with the higher bacterial load up until the <italic>BLUD</italic> is reached, at which point the host dies.

In order to quantitatively define how the kinetics of bacterial proliferation and host response determine ultimate infection outcome, we developed a model to estimate bacterial growth within each individual host (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our model assumes that in the early phase of infection, the bacteria grow unchecked within the host at rate <italic>μ</italic>. Empirical support for this component of the model comes from the observation that bacteria proliferate at the same rate as in in vitro culture over the first few hours of infection in a wild-type host and until death in an immune deficient host (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We assume that there is a time post-injection where the immune response of an individual fly becomes sufficiently active to restrict bacterial proliferation, which we term the ‘time to control’ (<italic>T<sup>c</sup></italic>), and we define <italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic> as the average time to control of a given population. This is based on the empirical observation that an intact immune response is required for establishment of a persistent infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and that the timing of our observed divergence in host trajectories corresponds roughly to the time at which the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> humoral immune response begins to become active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). We also observed that infections that kill only a fraction of the hosts reach a state where flies either have a high bacterial load, in which case they die, or a low bacterial load, in which case they survive. We model this divergence between the two types of bacterial kinetics by hypothesizing a threshold bacterial number (<italic>n</italic><sup>tip</sup>) that, if reached prior to control, results deterministically in ultimate host death at high bacterial load (the BLUD).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28298.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A generalized model of infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of a conceptual model for within-host bacterial growth dynamics that, upon three phases, lead either to host survival or death.

In this resolution phase, inter-individual variation in the time to control (Tc), appears. We hypothesize that if host immune defenses control bacterial multiplication before bacterial load exceeds a critical threshold called the ‘tipping point’, then the host will survive infection and enters in a chronic phase, sustaining a persistent pathogen burden that we call the Set Point Bacterial Load (<italic>SPBL</italic>). If the tipping point is reached before the host establishes effective control, the infection enters a terminal phase and the bacteria will continue to proliferate until reaching a load that cannot be sustained by the host (the <italic>BLUD</italic>, or Bacterial Load Upon Death), at which point the host dies.

To test this, we first determined the kinetics of Imd pathway activation after infection with <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> by quantifying mRNA levels of the <italic>Diptericin</italic> gene, which encodes an antimicrobial peptide and provides an excellent read-out of Imd pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lemaitre et al., 1997</xref>). We began by measuring <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression in pools of 20 flies Canton S. <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression was extremely low at the time of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, left), but a measurable induction was detected at 2 hr post-injection and its level continuously increased during the first 8 hr post-injection (up to ~100 fold induction compared to the start of the infection). Thus, the Imd pathway is activated transcriptionally very early upon infection, well before we detected any impact on bacterial proliferation. To test whether inducibility is variable among individual hosts, we quantified <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression level in single flies at 4 hr post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, right). Time points equal or earlier than 8 hr were chosen because they occur before <italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic> and before we begin to see inflated variance in the bacterial load of individual flies. At later times of infection, higher bacterial number leads to increased immune system activation in a positive feedback loop, so variation in AMP gene expression level becomes an indicator of the differences in bacterial loads instead of an estimation of the variance of induction in response to a unique bacterial load. At 4 hr post-injection, however, immune induction can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) but immune control is not yet effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and no divergence in bacterial load is yet observed (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). At 4 hr post-injection, we detected strong among-individual variation in <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression, ranging from little induction to strong immune response, with approximately 5-fold difference between extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which may result from experimentally undetectable differences in handling, infection, or developmental history. We then did paired measurements of AMP expression and bacterial loads from single flies at 8 hr post inoculation, which is just before the predicted <italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic>.

Even among hosts that are identical in genotype, sex and age and are raised in a common environment, a fraction of hosts die with high bacterial burden while the remainder survive indefinitely with persistent low pathogen load.

Hosts that survive their infections do so carrying a fixed bacterial load, the <italic>SPBL</italic>.</p><p>Based on the quantification of bacterial load in the host, we have built a model that describes inter-individual variability in bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In an early phase of the infection by pathogens, bacterial proliferation occurs at a rate similar to that of in vitro growth, suggesting that growth is essentially unconstrained in the first hours of infection. After a brief delay, the host immune response becomes sufficiently active so as to limit or perhaps even reverse bacterial growth. This time, which we parameterize as <italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic> in our model, will certainly depend on both the kinetics of immune induction by the host and the sensitivity of the pathogen to the host immune response. In a following phase of our model, the infection resolves in one of two ways. The bacteria may continue to proliferate at the unconstrained rate until the host dies at a lethal load, the <italic>BLUD</italic>, or the bacteria may cease proliferation and settle into a phase of long-term persistent infection with a burden defined as the <italic>SPBL</italic>. In principle, the <italic>SPBL</italic> could be complete elimination of the bacteria, although we very rarely see that with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> hosts. We infer that the probability of an infection entering into the lethal versus persistent state is defined by the probability that control is effective before bacteria grow above the critical threshold density, <italic>n<sup>tip</sup></italic>. Thus, the probability of lethal infection is most influenced and therefore predicted by the rate of bacterial proliferation (<italic>µ</italic>) and the average time required to mount an effective immune response, <italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic>.</p><p>The simplicity of our statistical model yields some crucial insights and implications. First, a complex and apparently stochastic organism-level phenotype (survival versus death) can be satisfactorily predicted by modeling the probability of transitions between a few discrete states of infection (early growth, uncontrollable growth, and decrease/stabilization after control). In the course of infection, each may occur in discrete temporal phases (termed ‘early phase’, ‘resolution phase’, ‘terminal phase’ or ‘chronic phase’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) that have distinct and possibly deterministic outcomes, as those described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duneau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin and Antia, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid-Hempel and Ebert, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, each of these states and the parameters that determine them has a distinct mechanistic underpinning and may be differentially subjected to natural selection. For example, host evolution of shortened time to control through increased inducibility of the immune response would have a different genetic basis than one that involved reduced bacterial proliferation through host sequestration of nutrients (e.g. metal ions or carbon). Both mechanisms might result in apparent ‘resistance’ to infection, both would contribute to increased probability of survival from infection, and each would carry distinct costs or tradeoffs. From the pathogen’s perspective, changes in its growth rate or sensitivity to host immune responses would also alter the probability that they become lethal versus persistent, also with distinct mechanistic bases and costs or tradeoffs. Each predictive parameter in the model can be experimentally manipulated, and the entire model can be theoretically evaluated to identify evolutionary optima in different environments and under different transmission requirements. We note that this model can be easily extended to infection by other classes of pathogen, to specific tissues such as the gut, or to hosts that display secondary immune responses (e.g., antibody-mediated acquired immune responses).</p><p>Interestingly, the two endpoint parameters of infection, bacterial load in survivors (<italic>SPBL</italic>) and in hosts that succumb (<italic>BLUD</italic>), were remarkably invariant among individual hosts of a same genotype even though they varied substantially across infections by different pathogens, host species and genotypes. The mechanisms underlying the death of a fly upon infection have been curiously overlooked, and the nature of damage to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from bacterial infection remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dionne and Schneider, 2008</xref>). We find that flies die at a specific bacterial load that does not depend on initial infection dose or eventual time to death. This implies that death is unlikely to be a direct consequence of accumulated infectious damage, since longer term exposure to low pathogen burdens might trigger as much damage as short-term exposure to high bacterial burden. Instead, our results are more compatible with a model for death occurring as a consequence of sepsis or multiple organ failure driven by pathogen load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baue, 1975</xref>). Of course, the lethal load of different pathogens would vary depending on the toxicity of the particular pathogen. In that sense, we can argue that the <italic>BLUD</italic> is a measure of pathogenicity of the bacterium, as it represents the minimal density of bacteria that kills a host. We hesitate to use the word ‘virulence’ though, because the <italic>BLUD</italic> does not correlate with the speed at which pathogens kill or with the probability of host death. Reciprocally, the <italic>BLUD</italic> also represents a measure of host disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soares et al., 2017</xref>) as it corresponds to the maximal bacterial load that can be sustained in the host without dying from the infection.</p><p>Our results are somewhat inconsistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haine et al., 2008</xref>, which documented rapid cellular elimination of bacteria injected into <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> and posited an only minor role for the humoral response. In contrast, our study indicates that the timing and intensity of AMP production is the most crucial factor for controlling bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. One intriguing hypothesis for reconciling the two observations is that adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> have only a small number of hemocytes due to loss of hemocytes upon aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillou et al., 2016</xref>), while this might not be the case in <italic>Tenebrio</italic>. Thus, the relative importance of cellular versus humoral immunity may differ between the two insects. Additionally, different bacterial pathogens were employed in the two studies, and different microbes may be differentially sensitive to alternative arms of the immune response so generalizations should be made with caution.</p><p>We found that complete bacterial clearance rarely happens in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. With all seven pathogens in this study, in no case were the bacteria fully cleared from all hosts even a week after the initial infection, even in cases where 100% of hosts survived the infection. Persistent infections stabilized at a fixed load for each pathogen, the <italic>SPBL</italic>. On rare occasion, individual flies in our study would carry persistent infections for several days before suddenly dying with a pathogen burden that had reached the <italic>BLUD</italic>. This suggests that there are some conditions under which a persistent infection can re-emerge as an acute infection. This is reminiscent of chronic infections by multiple human pathogens, including HIV, eukaryotic parasites such as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, and bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> or <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. These parasites are considered to be ‘specialists’ at chronic infection, yet our results suggest that qualitatively similar phenomena can be obtained from infection with a broad range of generalist bacteria. As the <italic>SPBL</italic> varies with both host and pathogen genotype, it is presumably subject to selection in both. In that context, it is worth noting that forcing an infection into the persistent state is effectively a disease tolerance strategy from the host perspective, yet the pathogen burden borne may still carry lifelong fitness cost. From the pathogen’s perspective, either persistence or acute lethality may be favored depending on the conditions of transmission. Moreover, selection for high growth rate due to competition between bacterial genotypes within a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alizon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2013</xref>) may trade off against the capacity to establish persistent infection.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin and Antia (2001)</xref> suggested that ‘us and other living organisms are little more than soft, thin-walled flasks of culture media’. With the present work, we argue that hosts are slightly more complex and that potentially minute variations in host or pathogen physiology during the early phase of infection can have dramatic effects on the ultimate outcome. We have defined three parameters (<italic>t̄<sup>c</sup></italic>, <italic>μ</italic>, <italic>n<sup>Tip</sup></italic>) that are sufficient to predict ultimate infection outcome, although we still do not know whether variation in those parameters is due to micro-environmental variation, uncontrolled plasticity in developmental history, somatic mutations, or other factors that are uncontrolled or uncontrollable in experiments (e.g. depth of penetration of the needle during injection, site at which bacteria accumulate etc.) and in nature (e.g. time since last meal or mating, psychological status of the fly etc.). Nevertheless, what is becoming clear is that small differences in pathogen infectivity and host immunological control, especially in the early stages of infection, may manifest as large differences in the outcome of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were reared on glucose-yeast medium (82 g/L yeast, 82 g/L glucose, 1% <italic>Drosophila</italic> agar, supplemented with 2.5 mg/L methylparaben and 10 mL of a solution of phosphoric and propionic acid: 41.5 ml Phosphoric Acid + 418 mL Propionic Acid + 540.5 mL distilled water).

The global log-likelihood of the model is then obtained by summing log-likelihoods computed for each point of the datasets. This was possible because each point of our data set consists of a single individual host, and all measurements at all sampling times are therefore somewhat independent from each other (i.e. the measurements are not repeated on the same fly). We illustrated simulated outcomes of this model of within-host dynamics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We estimated the 11 parameters of this mixture model by maximizing log-likelihood, using the Optim procedure in R.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stochastic variation in the initial phase of bacterial infection predicts the probability of survival in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Bruno Lemaître (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrea Graham (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This elegant and thorough study provides rigorous quantitative dissection, under controlled environmental conditions, of the contributions of host and pathogen genetics plus random individual variation – in this case, stochasticity in the infection process itself – to the dynamics and outcome of infection. The authors make excellent use of the tools available for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including isogenic lines and immune knockouts, as well as a wide array of bacterial species. They are therefore able to quantify variation among pathogen species in odds of killing the host, in the set point bacterial load, and in the consistent bacterial burden at which death occurs (regardless of the time at which that threshold burden is reached, interestingly). Likewise, their extensive empirical data show variation among host species and isogenic lines in bacterial load upon death, which appear independent of inoculum size and immune deficiency. The authors go on to show that stochastic variation within many of their host-pathogen pairings leads to bimodal outcomes: death or chronic infection. The authors explain this bifurcation as a race between rates of bacterial proliferation and immune response induction. The evolutionary implications of this are clear – e.g., selection on rates of immune response induction or bacterial proliferation. Indeed, evolutionary biologists, ecologists, microbiologists, physiologists, and immunologists working in all sorts of biological systems will be intrigued and inspired by this array of findings.</p><p>There are, however, a number of important issues to clarify before considering this paper for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Impact of initial conditions:</p><p>A) In particular, the overall conclusion is that variations in the timing of initiating the humoral immune response (<italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic>) determine the ultimate fate of infected animal – either death or survival with chronic infection. One trivial possibility that is not directly addressed is that (small) differences in initial inoculation (with little or no variation in the <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic>) are actually responsible. This would be consistent with data present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the mathematical model presented, without postulating variation in <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic>. It seems that empirically determined initial dose is only reported in one figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Given the variation in the pulled capillary needle and the injection device, how can the authors be certain small variations don't tip the balance?</p><p>1B) While it looks like that all individual flies were treated identically, another parameter that is clearly different for each individual fly is the exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> during manipulations/injection. It is probable that those flies that were injected first (had lower exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>) in the end were survivors, while those injected last (had longer exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>) succumbed. This should be experimentally addressed, considering that CO<sub>2</sub> is known to increase <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensitivity to infections (Helenius et al., 2009).</p><p>Collectively, the authors should provide more information to support their statements that this is not small variation in the initial condition that explain the stochasticity. While the influence of CO<sub>2</sub> might be easily tested, the impact of differences in the initial dose could be better characterized by adding more measurement of the initial dose for several bacteria. Another way could be to monitor stochasticity in infected flies with two related doses in the same setting (Dose 1 being always slightly superior of Dose 2) and see the existence of flies that die faster with Dose 2 compared to Dose 1).</p><p>2) Analysis of Immune response and bacterial growth:</p><p>The analysis of Imd signaling (Dpt induction) on single flies is a key part of this paper, yet is massively under-developed. Only one time point is shown, and given that transcript is measured, when mature AMP is the functional output, it is not at all clear that this one time point is relevant. Then, in the next panel, a different time point is examined to argue that Dipt levels do not correlate with bacterial loads. It can be argued that an earlier time point, such as 2 hours, is really the most relevant, as the model argues that the timing of the initiation of the response is deterministic, and perhaps at the initiating time point a correlation between load and response would be observed. Did the authors try to analyze immune response and bacterial growth in live flies using adequate fluorescent reporter (Dpt-mcherry, <italic>P. rettgeri</italic> GFP) ? While being less quantitative, this could bring another set of data that support their main conclusions.</p><p>On this line, the notion that the methods used here demonstrate bacterial growth in an individual fly (see language in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend) is grossly overstated. Clearly, as a population, the evidence clearly demonstrates bacterial growth in vivo. However, the bacterial growth within any individual fly cannot be assessed by these methods.</p><p>3) Clarity of the text and relevant information:</p><p>Many parameters affect infection such a temperature, sex, injection methods…. This information should be in the Results section not hidden in the Materials and methods. It is not clear what each survival graph shows, is it a representative result? How many times was it repeated? How many flies? Males or females? For bacterial load graphs, were all individual flies taken from one experiment (one biological replicate) or is it pooled from several replicates? It is often difficult to know how the experiments were done. All these details should be provided. Moreover, we could not exclude batch effect. This is actually suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with the new bacteria appearing more virulent.</p><p>4) All the data should be made publicly available to allow other scientists to use them. I would suggest to include all the raw data in excel sheets (bacterial count, survival data; biological repeats…).</p><p>5) The idea that the bacteria proliferate at the same rate in LB medium and flies should be documented for other strains.</p><p>6) Description of the model: more information on the model should be included to the main text. As it is written it is hard to understand this section of the paper. Moreover, even as written it is not fully and clearly explained to a non-expert in the field of modeling. For example, the meaning and import of mini graph of &quot;Frequency vs. <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> was unclear to one reviewer, and the relationship of <italic>P<sup>c</sup></italic> to the area below &quot;the&quot; curve was likewise unclear, as there are 2 curves presented. Some parameters are introduced but described later: <italic>V<sup>c</sup></italic> is shown in the figure but mentioned only in the Discussion. The confusion on the description of the model stem partly because of the high density at which series of hypotheses, tests and results are presented, and different sets of empirical results invoked (e.g., the third paragraph of the subsection “A mixture model to capture within-host bacterial growth dynamics”, which covers huge terrain very rapidly). Perhaps greater use of paragraph breaks or subheadings would help the reader navigate.</p><p>Globally, a longer paragraph with the model, the definition of each parameter could improve the impact of this paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Stochastic variation in the initial phase of bacterial infection predicts the probability of survival in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Both the external reviewer and the reviewing editor found that the authors have adequately answered to most of reviewers’ comments. As you can see from the reviewer 3, there is regret that the paper does not include in vivo monitoring of antimicrobial peptide gene expression to back up the model. Nevertheless, it is true that GFP reporters are slow and might not be the appropriate tool to monitor the immune dynamic at early time point. To address this in particular, we would recommend that you adjust your text, in both the Results and the Discussion, to make it explicitly clear that you are inferring a variance in the initiation of response, but do not (yet) have tools available to demonstrate it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This remains one of the most thought provoking papers I have read in recent years. I think it will be a landmark in the field.</p><p>That being said, I continue to struggle with the big issue, which is not directly addressed by the revisions. In short, the authors have inferred that the differences in the timing or strength of the initial immune response following infection determine the outcome (death at <italic>BLUD</italic> or chronic infection at <italic>SPBL</italic>). Surprisingly, they write in the rebuttal that they have been unable to measure AMP induction via fluorescent protein reporters at these early time points, at least in intact flies. Ideally, I would love some type of data that can probe this inference.</p><p>Another more significant issue, is (still) the presentation of the mathematical model. Lots is made of the probability calculation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and beyond, but the way this probability is determine is not explained in the Results section. It is presented in detail in the Materials and methods, but frankly the math is over my head.

Given the variation in the pulled capillary needle and the injection device, how can the authors be certain small variations don't tip the balance?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a key premise for our work is that the initial conditions are as homogenous as possible. Our method of infection by injection allows precise, reproducible introduction of a quantified bacterial suspension into individual flies. The empirically determined initial dose (time zero) is reported in both panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, 3C and 3E</xref>, in 3B, 5B, both panels of 5C, 5D and in 7A. In all cases, the range of inoculation size is never larger than two log<sub>2</sub> (i.e. two bacterial divisions) and it is generally within one log<sub>2</sub> of difference. In experiments where we did not quantify bacterial load at time = 0 hours, we have a quantification 1hr post-injection (i.e. about one division after the injection) and we detect inter-individual variation in bacterial load lower than a log<sub>2</sub> in these conditions too. From the experiments where we intentionally varied the dose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), we know that a 2-fold difference in initial dose is not sufficient to guarantee the outcome of infection. We performed experiments using a 100-fold range of infection doses (from optical density 0.01 to optical density 1 and saw the binary outcome of infection across this entire range. This indicates that variation in the number of bacteria injected cannot explain by itself the binary outcome of infection.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that there is variability in the damage inflicted to the fly during the injection process, and it is possible that this contributes to the dual outcome of infection. We limited this possibility by injecting flies in the abdomen and using a very thin needle. This infection method has been shown to be less lethal than classical pinprick method (see Chambers et al. 2014 Infection and Immunity).</p><p>We believe our data demonstrate that differences in <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> are central to the variation in infection outcome, and any variation in <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> that arises because of minor differences in experimental handling is sufficiently small that we are still able to clearly detect differences between host genotypes and infections with different bacterial species. If the primary cause of variation in the outcomes was random experimental differences, we would expect no consistent differences among host genotypes or between bacteria with similar but non-identical killing kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B) While it looks like that all individual flies were treated identically, another parameter that is clearly different for each individual fly is the exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> during manipulations/injection. It is probable that those flies that were injected first (had lower exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>) in the end were survivors, while those injected last (had longer exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>) succumbed. This should be experimentally addressed, considering that CO<sub>2</sub> is known to increase Drosophila sensitivity to infections (Helenius et al., 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>It is an intriguing possibility that differences in exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> could generate differences in resistance to infection and thus explain the variability we observe, but we do not believe there is any cause for concern. In our design, each round of injection lasts a maximum 15 min on a CO<sub>2</sub> pad, and all flies remain on the pad for the entire time the treatment group is being infected. Thus, the flies that are injected first do not have shorter exposure to CO<sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, we quantified the effect of 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> exposure before or after injection, compared to 2min of CO<sub>2</sub> exposure, thus covering the full experimental variation in CO<sub>2</sub> exposure in our settings. A difference of 15min of exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> did not affect the chance of survival, we therefore believe that CO<sub>2</sub> exposure is not responsible for our phenotype. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Collectively, the authors should provide more information to support their statements that this is not small variation in the initial condition that explain the stochasticity.

Clearly, as a population, the evidence clearly demonstrates bacterial growth in vivo. However, the bacterial growth within any individual fly cannot be assessed by these methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the analysis of the immune response is central to our argumentation. We limited ourselves to one time point only (8hrs), not because of experimental limitations, but because of theoretical assumptions. In our model, individual hosts behave similarly before the time to control, but after <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> is reached by the population, individual flies show very different bacterial loads (depending on their level of control) and we know from other experiments that positive feedback amplifies the immune response in flies that have higher bacterial loads at later time points. Our assumption is therefore that before <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic>, the immune response results <italic>only</italic> from the detection of uncontrolled bacteria (could therefore correlate with the number of bacteria with high precision). After <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic>, additional processes occur, death of bacteria in some cases, continued growth of bacteria, accumulation of damage as a consequence of infection, and probably often a mix of all of the above. In very early time points, like 2hrs, the difference of bacterial load among individuals is so low that it would be difficult to detect a correlation. We therefore chose the latest possible time point that occurs before <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> for our experiment.</p><p>In response to the suggestion of additional methods of monitoring AMP expression, we evaluated fluorescence from transgenic flies (DIG flies) bearing 4 copies of <italic>Dpt-GFP</italic>. Unfortunately, however, in both replicates of this experiment, the GFP signal was too low to quantify through the cuticle at 6-8 hours post-injection. At a later time point, 10-12hrs post-injection, we detected inter-individual variation in GFP signal. However, as stated above, this is after the point where some individuals have controlled their infections, while others did not (and will eventually never do). Thus, the variation may only reflect the individual variation in the number of bacteria, and would therefore not help demonstrate inter-individual variation in the initiation of the immune response upon infection.</p><p>We agree that we infer bacterial growth in individual flies from multiples snapshots of an infection, rather than following directly bacterial growth within a single fly. We have now mentioned that point in the Materials and methods (subsection “Model of growth dynamics”, third paragraph) and in the Results (subsection “A mixture model to capture within-host bacterial growth dynamics”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarity of the text and relevant information:</p><p>Many parameters affect infection such a temperature, sex, injection methods…. This information should be in the Results section not hidden in the Materials and methods. It is not clear what each survival graph shows, is it a representative result?

For bacterial load graphs, were all individual flies taken from one experiment (one biological replicate) or is it pooled from several replicates? It is often difficult to know how the experiments were done. All these details should be provided. Moreover, we could not exclude batch effect. This is actually suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with the new bacteria appearing more virulent.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more details describing the sample sizes and experimental structures in Materials and methods, Results and Figure legends. In general, our survival graphs are a representative example of the pool of replicated experiments but the analyses were performed taking vial and blocking effects into account. Our bacterial load experiments are also replicated, and often are additionally replicated in the context of another experiment. For instance, we quantified <italic>Ecc15</italic> load for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and this was independently replicated to calculate <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. The same is true for the quantification of bacterial growth in an Imd mutant, which is a key result. The result is presented first in 4B but is replicated in 7A. We now mention in the manuscript that some results were confirmed later to point out this type of independent replication. In addition, the dual outcomes of infection we describe were replicated over several host genotypes. Altogether, we have replicated this phenomenon extensively, first for specific conditions, across genotypes, and generally across different bacteria.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> represents a different type of experiment intended to test the possible effect of bacterial selection within the host as a mechanism for the variation in infection outcome. This experiment was not designed as other experiments in the manuscript. In this experiment, the bacteria injected were cultured directly from infected flies (of high or low bacterial burden) and subsequently injected to flies. This experiment demonstrates that passage through the host does not change the variation in infection outcome. We are very confident that the apparent increase in virulence is a consequence of how the bacteria were handled during this experiment specifically, and we have no evidence for evolved increase in virulence or experimental batch effects. Outside of this experiment, and in our infection settings, we note a robust replication of the outcomes of our infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All the data should be made publicly available to allow other scientists to use them.

Specifically, we quantified the growth of additional bacterial species that we know are not controlled within the first 8 hours both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that their growth in vitro did not differ significantly from their growth in Canton S flies measured in parallel. We now conclude that for multiple bacteria, the bacteria proliferate at the same rate in LB medium and flies early during infection before the <italic>t<sup>c</sup></italic> occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Description of the model: more information on the model should be included to the main text.

Ideally, I would love some type of data that can probe this inference.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the disappointment of the reviewer as a non-invasive and quantitative method to measure the immune response in living flies would be invaluable. If we had such an assay, we could directly test the correlation of early immune induction with later bacterial load. Unfortunately, however, every sufficiently quantitative assay is destructive and every non-destructive assay is not sufficiently quantitative. Although GFP and dsRed transgenic reporters for immune system activity exist, the fluorescence is not strong enough in the first few hours of infection for reliable in vivoquantification by fluorescence microscopy through the cuticle. The signal becomes stronger much later in infection, but by then, a positive feedback loop between the number of bacteria and strength of immune activity has initiated resulting in a positive correlation between bacterial load and immune gene expression. Even in the best of circumstances, transgenic reporters provide indirect estimates of immune system activity. In addition, kinetics of GFP transcript and protein accumulation may be different from the endogenous AMPs. We therefore believe that RT-qPCR is the most precise method to quantify transcriptional expression of the immune response. To address our experimental question, we really would need to precisely and non-destructively measure activity of the immune system at very early stages of infection, before bacterial loads have begun to diverge among individuals, and such tools sadly do not exist right now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another more significant issue, is (still) the presentation of the mathematical model. Lots is made of the probability calculation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and beyond, but the way this probability is determine is not explained in the Results section. It is presented in detail in the Materials and methods, but frankly the math is over my head. I would prefer some discussion of this computation directly in the Results section so as to make sense of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer, and in order to explain how the probability is calculated, we added more detail to the Results (subsection “A mixture model to capture within-host bacterial growth dynamics”, first paragraph). The probability of control is computed as (1 – the probability that bacterial load reaches <italic>n<sup>tip</sup></italic> before control is effective). However, the actual calculation is not simple and is not a primary result, so we prefer to keep it in the method section and supplement. We hope that sufficiently interested readers will probe the methods and supplement and we believe this strategy will minimize confusion for the more casual reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the rationale for the time points used in 7B (4 hour) and 7C (8 hours) is presented, and argued compellingly, in the rebuttal but this logic is still missing from the actual text of the article.
