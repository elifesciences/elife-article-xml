Motivated by this concept, we hypothesized that thermal acclimation in poikilothermic organisms, owing to their inability to maintain their body temperature, is connected to their microbiome composition. To test this hypothesis, we used a unique experimental setup with a transgenerational selective breeding scheme for cold tolerance in tropical tilapias. We tested the effects of the selection on the gut microbiome and on host transcriptomic response. Interestingly, we found that host genetic selection for thermal tolerance shapes the microbiome composition and its response to cold. The microbiomes of cold-resistant fish showed higher resilience to temperature changes, indicating that the microbiome is shaped by its host's selection. These findings are consistent with the hologenome concept and highlight the connection between the host and its microbiome's response to the environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals and plants host diverse microbial communities that are vital for their survival.

Thus, adaptations to temperature fluctuations are expected to be found across all organisms. When exposed to cold temperatures, animals undergo remarkable physiological adjustments in order to maintain homeostasis. Such adjustments may occur through genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms that increase their fitness. Recent work in mice revealed that the gut microbiome facilitates key adaptations during cold exposure by promoting energy demand-driven regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018</xref>). This is not surprising, as many studies have already proven the vital importance of gut microbial communities for host survival, homeostasis, development and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shabat et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, the universality of host–microbe associations, either transient or tight, inspired the hologenome concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bordenstein and Theis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brucker and Bordenstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theis et al., 2016</xref>), which proposes that within the holobiont, units at different levels, such as genes, chromosomes or biont combinations (i.e., host and microbes), are subject to selection or neutrality. Within this concept, host–microbe interactions have an important role in the host's physiology, whilst microbiome composition may be affected by host selection. Taking this into account, we hypothesized that host selection may facilitate changes in the host-associated microbial species and in their response to environmental selection pressure.</p><p>Poikilothermic organisms, such as fish, must develop strategies to maintain homeostasis within diverse temperature gradients because environmental temperature changes would otherwise disrupt homeostasis and cause deleterious effects on vital physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guschina and Harwood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vinagre et al., 2012</xref>). The physiological response to stress may vary among populations or individuals and can be affected by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Somero, 2010</xref>). Microbial communities in aquatic environments have also been reported to be affected by abiotic factors that act as a habitat-filtering force, such as temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuhrman et al., 2008</xref>). In poikilothermic organisms, the gut microbiome experiences temperature fluctuations that do not exist in homeotherms. There is evidence of a temperature effect on the microbial dynamics associated with invertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beleneva and Zhukova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lokmer and Mathias Wegner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahalaxmi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Preheim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zurel et al., 2011</xref>), but such information is largely missing for aquatic poikilothermic vertebrates.</p><p>Taking the hologenome concept into account, we asked whether host transgenerational selection for thermal tolerance, which is instrumental to poikilothermic organisms’ fitness, involves the host–gut microbiome axis. More specifically, how does microbiome composition respond to temperature changes and does host tolerance shape this response? Here, we hypothesized that the thermal tolerance of poikilothermic vertebrates affects their associated gut microbial species, as well as the response of these microbes to temperature alterations. We focused specifically on the association of changes in the microbiome with the transgenerational low-temperature response in tropical fish, such as tilapia species. The growth of these fish species is highly affected by temperature; they are subject to growth inhibition and mortality when exposed to low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cnaani et al., 2000</xref>). However, recent work revealed transgenerational inheritance of cold tolerance in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we used a unique setup, composed of 66 fish families that are part of a transgenerational selective-breeding scheme for enhanced cold tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this setup, we chose fish progeny from families with the most extreme phenotypes, selected on the basis of the survival rate of their siblings at low temperatures and characterized as cold-resistant or cold-sensitive. Hence, these fish progenies had never experienced low temperature exposure before they were challenged. We used this setup to understand how selection on host thermal tolerance corresponds to microbiome shifts. Our results suggest that host selection for cold tolerance is followed by changes in the gut microbiome, which are manifested by higher resilience to temperature shifts and which may be a key factor in orchestrating cold acclimation in poikilothermic animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selection for cold-adapted individuals on the basis of a breeding scheme.</title><p>The fish parental lines used in this study originated from an Israeli strain of <italic>Oreochromis aureus</italic> which was subjected to an ongoing selective breeding program for optimal harvest weight at the Dor Aquaculture Research Station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zak et al., 2014</xref>).

Temperature is known to affect microbial composition in aquatic habitats and to act as a habitat filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuhrman et al., 2008</xref>). There is some limited information on the effect of temperature on the gut microbiome, showing compositional changes in homeotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier et al., 2015</xref>). However, such information is largely missing in poikilothermic vertebrates, in which physiology is strongly influenced by environmental temperature.</p><p>To explore whether the thermal tolerance of poikilothermic vertebrates affects their associated gut microbial species and their response to temperature alterations, we used the blue tilapia, <italic>Oreochromis aureus</italic>, as our experimental model. The optimal temperatures for this species, similar to those for other tilapiine species, are 24–28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trewavas, 1983</xref>), but this species is one of the most cold-tolerant among this group of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cnaani et al., 2000</xref>). An ongoing selective-breeding process, which has been running for the past few years in Israel, is aimed at improving growth and cold-tolerance traits in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zak et al., 2014</xref>). In a recent study, we found that the fish's tolerance to temperatures below 16°C is transgenerational and potentially connected to maternal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the present study focused on understanding host–microbiome interactions in relation to temperature stress and cold acclimation.</p><p>To evaluate the responses of the fish that are resistant and sensitive to cold exposure, we challenged a total of 84 fish, sampled at 24°C or 12°C, originating from 3 tilapia families with high tolerance and 3 with low tolerance to cold temperatures (7 fish per family). For our experiments, we chose fish originating from mothers that had the most extreme phenotypes, selected on the basis of their sibling’s survival rate at low temperature, as determined by previous cold-challenge trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All of the fish within each generation were kept in the same tank to eliminate confounding effects. The test groups, consisting of 42 fish each from resistant and sensitive families, were challenged by temperature reduction to 12°C over a period of 2 weeks and compared to a control group, consisting of 42 fish from the same families kept at 24°C. At the end of the temperature-challenge trial, we analyzed the fish gut microbiomes from the test and control groups using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and we also looked at the host's response using liver transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that temperature was the major factor shaping microbial community diversity and richness within the fish gut (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; F<sub>Shannon</sub> = 46.43, F<sub>Richness</sub> = 45.79, p = 0.001). Indeed, we found a dramatic decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ai</xref>; Wilcoxon t-test, two-sided, 95% confidence interval (CI), p = 7.2E-02) in microbial diversity (Shannon index H’) and richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Wilcoxon t-test, two-sided, 95% CI, p = 2.7E-08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, rarefaction curves) when both groups were exposed to cold temperature. This decrease was in agreement with the low-temperature decrease in the 16S gene copy numbers (real-time PCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the microbial communities in the fish that were subjected to cold temperatures exhibited lower variability in richness between samples, whereas greater individual variation was observed in the high temperature group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1i</xref>), suggesting that low-temperature conditions are very selective and potentially constrain microbial communities, decreasing their inter-individual variation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Both temperature and host thermal tolerance have a major effect on shaping microbial communities in the fish gut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (i) Shannon H’ diversity was decreased (Wilcoxon t-test, two-sided, 95% CI), when fish from both groups were exposed to cold conditions (12°C, blue).

Moreover, if host thermal tolerance is connected to cold temperature acclimation, then we would expect the microbiome response to relate to different tolerance phenotypes. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the response of the cold-sensitive and cold-resistant selected families to the changing environmental conditions. We compared the gut microbial compositions of the sensitive and resistant families and found that host thermal tolerance has a significant effect on gut microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; F<sub>Tolerance</sub> = 2.2269, p = 0.04). Furthermore, we also observed a significant interaction between host thermal tolerance and temperature, indicating a different microbiome response to the lower temperature in the resistant vs. sensitive hosts (F<sub>TxT</sub> = 3.6113, p = 0.012). Interestingly, when fish from both groups were kept under their optimal temperature conditions of 24°C, the sensitive fish exhibited higher microbial diversity (Shannon H′) than the resistant ones, as well as higher individual variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>; Wilcoxon t-test, two-sided, 95% CI, p = 0.048). Indeed, when we compared the β-diversity of the two groups under these optimal conditions, we found that cold-resistant fish had a higher within-group microbiome similarity than the sensitive fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ci</xref>; non-parametric Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.01, using 1000 Monte Carlo permutations), potentially because of the selection process to which resistant fish have been subjected with regard to the cold-resistance trait, thus showing host control of microbiome composition.</p><p>We further aimed to gain better insight into the microbiome composition of these host groups. We first compared the microbiome composition of cold-resistant and cold-sensitive hosts under each temperature condition; more specifically, we asked whether microbiomes of similar (Shannon H′) diversity also share the same microbiome compositions. To answer this, we stratified our data and examined individuals from each host group with similar Shannon H′ diversity (individuals from each group with the 10 highest or 10 lowest Shannon H′ diversity values; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S2). We found that the individuals from both high- and low-diversity microbiomes (Principal coordinate analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) clustered significantly according to host group (Permanova analysis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4), suggesting that host genetic background (genetic selection for cold tolerance) had a strong effect on shaping the microbiome composition.</p><p>Our next step was to explore the microbial taxa that are associated with genetic background effects. Indicator species analysis (which identifies habitat-associated species on the basis of their fidelity and relative abundance in different environments; see 'Materials and methods') revealed several microbial taxa that were significantly associated with host genetic background and had been described previously as naturally occurring strains in the tilapia gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giatsis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haygood and Jha, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables S5 and S6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>).

On the other hand, a higher diversity of taxa, including <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp., <italic>Streptococcus luteciae</italic> and Bacteroidetes species, as well as species from the families <italic>Christensenellaceae, Succinivibrionaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>,was enriched in the sensitive fish gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables S5 and S6). Altogether, our results indicate that host genetic background shapes microbiome composition by selecting for specific microbes, with some of them potentially carrying fitness traits for low-temperature tolerance.</p><p>As host fish were specifically selected according to their thermal tolerance, and as our findings indicated that temperature and host genetic background affect the fish gut microbiome, we further asked whether the microbiome's response to temperature stress is also affected by its host's tolerance. When exposed to the cold temperature of 12°C, both resistant and sensitive hosts exhibited a decrease in their microbiome diversity and richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as changes in microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>). When we compared the β-diversity within each of these host groups in relation to changing temperature, however, we found that after exposure to the stressful low-temperature conditions, the microbiomes of cold-resistant fish families were less affected than those of sensitive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cii</xref>; non-parametric Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.02, using 1000 Monte Carlo permutations). More specifically, when we compared the similarity of the microbial compositions between fish at 24°C and 12°C, we found it to be significantly greater in the resistant fish families than in the sensitive ones, showing a stronger effect of temperature change in the sensitive fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cii</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether the microbiome's differential response to temperature in the two host groups also applies to microbes that are shared between the two host groups. We assessed microbiome resilience by looking at 11 selected taxa that were present in &gt;50% of the individuals from each temperature environment (the 'core microbiome'). After renormalizing the core microbes' abundance (expressed as percentage within the core microbiome community; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we evaluated the fold changes in the abundance of these taxa upon change from 24°C to 12°C in both the cold-resistant and cold-sensitive fish. Similar to the overall microbiome response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cii</xref>), the fold change in the relative abundance of the core microbiome in resistant fish was significantly lower than that in sensitive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Eii</xref>). We further designed specific primers to measure the absolute copy numbers of the two most abundant and prevalent (&gt;95% of the individuals) core taxa (<italic>Pseudomonas veronii</italic> and <italic>Janthinobacterium lividum</italic>) in both host groups and quantified their abundance by quantitative PCR (see 'Materials and methods'). Our results were in agreement with the sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ei</xref>, ii), showing a significantly less pronounced temperature effect on the abundance of the core microbes in the gut of the resistant fish compared to that in the gut of the sensitive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Eiii</xref>). These results thus supported our hypothesis that host thermal tolerance modulates the microbiome's response to temperature changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Microbial functional diversity corresponds to cold stress and host acclimation</title><p>Since we found that microbiome composition and response to temperature changes are connected to the host's thermal tolerance, we next evaluated the microbial community composition and attributes in relation to temperature and host cold acclimation. We utilized the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segata et al., 2011</xref>) and the PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langille et al., 2013</xref>). During cold exposure, we found a significant change (enrichment or depletion) in several pathways in all host microbiomes, resistant and sensitive. More specifically, a decrease in the abundance of genes belonging to metabolic pathways was observed, whereas genes in pathways related to cellular processes and signaling increased significantly in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with the changes in microbial composition, the overall fold change in microbial coding capacity between warm and cold temperature was significantly greater in the cold-sensitive fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, two-sided), showing a more pronounced response in this group. Specifically, microbiome composition changes resulting from cold exposure seem to relate to functional shifts, which overall correspond to a stress-related response and to cell defense, in line with prior studies suggesting reduction of metabolic activity and transcription, and increases in motility, chemotaxis and membrane transport in response to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nachin et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, host thermal tolerance seems to contribute to and to enhance the differences in microbiome functions with respect to thermal stress, potentially suggesting that not only microbiome composition, but also certain attributes of the microbiome may be influenced by host genetic background and response to low temperatures.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Microbial functional diversity corresponds to cold stress and the host's acclimation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pathway enrichment analysis using PICRUSt-predicted KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthologs revealed a decrease in microbiome pathways related to metabolism during cold exposure, with an increase in the number of ortholog groups related to cellular processes, genetic and environmental information and processing.

Specifically, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for both the microbiome and transcriptome and we correlated the top five microbiome principal components (PCs) to the top five transcriptome PCs by means of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which aims to maximize and measure the correlation between two multivariate datasets. Interestingly, the measured correlation coefficient was significant when we compared it to correlation coefficients achieved after randomly shuffling the sample labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; p = 0.0044). This analysis showed that more than 80% of the variance observed in the microbiome response to temperature could be explained by the variance observed in the transcriptomic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; actual variance was 83% vs. permuted 44%), thus supporting a host–microbiome interaction in response to environmental changes. Notably, when we looked at the host transcriptome response to cold exposure, we found several metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that were also affected in the microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with most of the changes occurring in the same direction (depletion or enrichment). Looking at the functions that are commonly shared between the host and the microbiome response to cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we found that some of these functions, namely transcription- and cytochrome P450-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), were also reported as key cell metabolism cold-induced adaptations in homeotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 2013</xref>). Such findings led us hypothesize that these functions may be conserved with regard to host and gut microbiome responses to temperature changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Within the hologenome concept, host–microbe interactions are connected and make up a unit of natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theis et al., 2016</xref>). Inspired by this concept, we hypothesized that this association between the host and its microbes may relate to the host's response to environmental changes, such as exposure to low temperature. Cold exposure led to dramatic changes in gut microbiome composition, representing a notable determinant of the microbial communities, by increasing several orders of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (<italic>Vibrionales</italic> and <italic>Alteromonadales</italic>) and decreasing all other phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, some species of the order <italic>Alteromonadale</italic>s have been shown to facilitate adaptations for survival under different conditions, including low temperatures (<italic>Alteromonas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Math et al., 2012</xref>]; <italic>Shewanella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abboud et al., 2005</xref>]), whereas several <italic>Vibrionales</italic> species have been found to adapt to low temperatures, such as <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Townsley et al., 2016</xref>), which was enriched under our cold conditions. These changes in microbial composition also led to a substantial change in the functional profile of the gut microbial communities. Notably, our analysis revealed that pathways related to metabolism were depleted during cold exposure, in both the microbiome and host transcriptomic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthologs related to cell communication, membrane transport and structure, signaling and cell motility were enriched, indicating a potential overall stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nachin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsimring et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, such changes have also been associated with ecological fitness traits (i.e., membrane transport, signal-transduction genes, tRNA diversity, carbon metabolism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Math et al., 2012</xref>) that assist in microbial survival strategies during cold adaptation in some <italic>Alteromonadales</italic> species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Math et al., 2012</xref>. It should be noted that the enrichment of microbial taxonomic groups that are associated with fish hosts and temperature changes, such as the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> orders, potentially resulted in the enrichment of functions associated with these taxa, while not necessarily being connected to cold tolerance. However, we did find several of these functions that were not only shared between the host and the microbiome but also similarly affected in the host and microbiome after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Some of the functions were actually previously reported as key cell metabolism cold-induced adaptations in mice (i.e. downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and cytochrome-450-related pathways; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 2013</xref>]), thus suggesting a potential conserved response to low temperatures.</p><p>Motivated by the hologenome concept, we deduced that the microbiome response to low temperatures would also be associated with the host response and would be related to host thermal tolerance. We used two different groups of tilapias originating from mothers with different tolerance to low water temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we found agreement between transcriptomic and microbiome responses to cold exposure, marking a host–microbiome interaction that potentially leads to higher microbiome stability and lower physiological stress in the cold-resistant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As these animals originate from different families (crosses) and not from the same population, and were kept under the same experimental conditions (same tanks) across generations, we conclude that this effect originates from differences in the genetic background, thermal tolerance and acclimation of the fish.</p><p>The decrease in microbiome richness and diversity with cold exposure in both resistant and sensitive fish could be explained in terms of selective pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As these fish are poikilothermic organisms, their gut microbiome is directly exposed to water temperature. Warmer temperatures, which are optimal for tilapias, are more permissive and can lead to greater heterogeneity and richness of microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erwin et al., 2012</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Alternatively, a decrease in temperature imposes a selective pressure that reduces microbial diversity, as we observed in both resistant and sensitive fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lokmer and Mathias Wegner, 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, our findings show host control of microbiome composition and response to temperature differences. Under warm conditions, we found compositional microbiome differences between the two host groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>), highlighting the importance of host genetic background for microbiome composition. Nonetheless, in the transition to cold temperature, these differences in the microbiome responses in sensitive and resistant fish were manifested at the taxonomic and functional levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D,E</xref>), through enrichment of taxa with potential ecological fitness traits for cold adaptation or by affecting the cold sensitivity of the core microbial communities to temperature, and thus illustrating that the pre-exposure potential of the gut microbiome is due to host selection.</p><p>Cold exposure greatly affects metabolic and physiological processes in fish, which undergo several acclimation processes to maintain their fitness. The transcriptomic or physiological responses may include changes in enzymatic activity and efficiency, membrane permeability, and metabolic rate through mitochondrial energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battersby and Moyes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoi et al., 2003</xref>), and may vary with the life history or genetic background of the organism. Transcriptomic responses in the blue tilapia liver were in line with the microbiome response to temperature, both in the size of the effect in resistant and sensitive fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>) and in its nature, manifested as changes in functions related to metabolism and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Resistant fish seemed to be under lower levels of physiological stress than sensitive fish, and therefore had lower temperature-related metabolic demands. These results could potentially be connected to lower energetic demands for maintaining homeostasis. In fact, it was previously shown that these resistant fish have lower mitochondrial gene expression than their sensitive counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>). Agreement between host transcriptomic and microbiome response, showing higher stability in the resistant animals compared to the sensitive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), supports our hypothesis of host–microbe associations that potentially modulate the acclimation process.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our insight into the microbial dynamics of the blue tilapia gut microbiome in response to environmental conditions shows that temperature, host genetic background and tolerance to thermal stress are major determinants of community structure and dynamics. Microbial community diversity and richness severely decreased during cold exposure; but microbial response was related to host thermal tolerance, which affected microbiome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicate that host cold tolerance shapes not only gut microbiome composition but also the sensitivity of core microbial communities to temperature, and that host cold tolerance modulates the thermal acclimation of the gut microbiome. These finding are consistent with the hologenome concept, which proposes that associations exist between the microbes and their hosts, suggesting that together they consist a unit of natural selection. Thus, taking this concept into account, we highlight potential connections between host acclimation and its microbiome response to environmental stress.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Host cold-tolerant phenotype selection is accompanied by a cold-tolerant gut microbiome.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36398-fig5-v2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design and sampling</title><p>Three sensitive and three resistant families of blue tilapia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitzan et al., 2016</xref>), selected for different survival rates during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), were raised at the Dor Aquaculture Research Station, Israel, and transferred to a climate-controlled room in the Institute of Animal Science, Agricultural Research Organization (Rishon LeZion, Israel).

The total fraction of OTU variance accounting for each component by the transcriptomic analysis (expression) variables, through all canonical variates, was calculated. For that, the first four principal components (PCs) from the OTU table were extracted (R <italic>prcomp</italic>). In addition, the first four expression matrix PCs were extracted using R <italic>prcomp</italic>. The actual value of the total variance was then compared to that of 1000 random permutations, in which the order of the host line PCs was shuffled.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the editors and the reviewers for their valuable comments that helped to improve our manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Kokou et al. proposes that Tilapia fish and its microbiome evolve as a unit of selection, based on measured correlations between host genetic makeup and microbiome responses to temperature. The consensus opinion is that, at best, the results claimed by the authors show a relationship (i.e. correlation) between host resistance and microbiome &quot;resilience&quot;. This is very interesting, but far from showing support for the hologenome theory. Therefore, the paper needs to be completely rewritten to focus on the experiments actually done and omit the tie-in to the hologenome theory, or transgenerational experiments need to be performed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors have measured a microbiome response to temperature within one generation rather than transgenerational changes in the microbiome that would more directly support the hologenome concept of evolution. More generally, it is important to note that the hologenome concept of evolution is an eco-evolutionary hypothesis, while the terms holobiont are hologenome are structural definitions used to define the host-microbiome ecosystem and their genomes.</p><p>Although multilevel selection is an interesting concept that could apply to host-microbiome associations, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, and this paper falls short of providing such evidence. In particular, the study shows no data on evolution, only ecological changes in microbiome composition correlated to host genetics. Multi-level selection or coevolution would require transgenerational experiments to establish, not possible in the two month revision window. Given that this paper is not about multilevel selection, presenting that as the main point of this study appears misleading. This is why the paper should be rewritten to say that it is &quot;consistent with the hologenome theory&quot;, with this being either a minor component or omitted entirely, or new data supporting evolutionary adaptation effects need to be provided through new experiments.</p><p>Focusing on the main data of the paper, which describes the correlation between host resistance to stress and microbiome composition and response, the main result is expressed in this sentence:</p><p>&quot;Interestingly, when fish from both groups were kept under their optimal temperature conditions of 24°C, the sensitive fish exhibited higher microbial diversity (Shannon H') than the resistant ones (Supplementary Figure 2; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), suggesting that host adaptive capacity is involved in shaping microbiome composition.&quot;</p><p>What this shows is that the host genetics and physiology (not its adaptive capacity) conditions the composition of the microbiome, at least in this broad statistical sense. This is a strong result which the authors would expand more to provide some insight into processes and or mechanisms.</p><p>Other claims, however, are only weakly supported if at all. Part of the problem is the use of statistical descriptors that do not capture the multiple dimensions of the data. The authors choose to do the analysis of microbiome composition and susceptibility to temperature at the level of non-informative summary statistics, like diversity indexes. These numbers hide a lot of information about what is going on in the data, and the authors derive conclusions from simple statistical comparisons of diversity distributions that are not well supported.</p><p>For instance, Figure 2A shows that there are many individuals with similar diversity at 24 and 12°C, but that the 24°C control has a tail of high diversity microbiomes that drives the statistically significant difference between treatment and control. What would happen if we stratify the data by diversity in order to compare individuals with similar diversity indexes in the two families? Would all low-diversity microbiomes behave the same regardless of family? In other words, is the effect we see simply a <italic>population</italic> average driven by a few more variable individuals, or can it be pinned down to features of the individual microbiome composition? This is an example of how the analysis presented by the authors hides a lot of important information that prevents the reader from getting away with more than a few headlines and no insight into the actual processes.</p><p>One of the main points of the paper is that the microbiome of resistant individuals is more &quot;resilient&quot; to changes in temperature. However, if diversity is already low in the resistant family and if temperature stress decreases diversity, it stands to reason that diversity will drop less in the resistant family compared to the sensitive one, whose microbiomes still have more microbial taxa &quot;to spare&quot;. In other words, drops in diversity may saturate, either because there is a biological lower bound to it or because the index has a non-linear behavior. To assess &quot;resilience&quot; it would be better to work with the set of taxa that are present in all microbiomes (the core), renormalize the data and study fold changes. Again, the problem described in this paragraph stems from the attempt to study changes in high dimensional species composition profiles with single numbers like richness or Shannon diversity.</p><p>Unfortunately, the taxonomic analysis, which could deal with part of the problem, is done only at the level of shallow clades. For instance, most organisms in Figure 2B are proteobacteria. As the authors must know, this is an incredibly diverse set of microbes. Which proteobacteria? The authors should describe fold-changes in taxa at various taxonomic levels, starting with exact sequence variants.</p><p>Finally, the functional analysis is strongly biased by taxonomic changes. For example, the statement that the &quot;host selects for taxa with a specific functional landscape that is better suited to cold exposure&quot; is a bold claim lacking supporting evidence, What is shown is simply an enrichment of functions that are more frequently found in proteobacteria. The type of functional categories found have no relationship to anything related to adaptation to low temperatures. Incorporation of David Sloan Wilson's concepts of &quot;selection for&quot; vs. &quot;selection of&quot; traits might be helpful here.</p><p>In sum, the finding that the microbiome composition is related to the genetic makeup of the host is interesting, but the authors should dig deeper into processes and, if possible, mechanisms. A better statistical analysis that goes beyond simple summary statistics like average richness and diversity and focuses on specific sequence variants and their relationship to the resistance/sensitivity of individual hosts could make the paper much better. The authors should refrain from making grandiose claims about multilevel selection, microbiome resilience, etc., and simply focus on providing a more in-depth analysis of their data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36398.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors have measured a microbiome response to temperature within one generation rather than transgenerational changes in the microbiome that would more directly support the hologenome concept of evolution.

According to your suggestion, we further analysed our data to highlight how host genetics/cold tolerance and physiology condition the microbiome. We first performed a similarity test to compare the overall microbiome composition between the cold-resistant and cold-sensitive hosts using Bray-Curtis metric (non-parametric t-test with 1000 Monte Carlo permutations) at the control conditions (24<sup>o</sup>C) to see potential differences stemming from the genetic selection. We found that the microbiome response within the resistant individuals was more similar compared to the sensitive (Figure 2Ci). We further aimed to get a better insight into the microbiome composition of these host groups, thus we compared the microbiome composition between the cold-resistant and cold-sensitive hosts under any temperature condition; more specifically, we asked whether microbiomes of similar (Shannon H’) diversity were also sharing the same microbiome compositions. To this end, we stratified our data and examined individuals from each host group with similar diversity (see in the next comments for more details). This analysis showed that the microbiomes clustered significantly according to host group/tolerance under any temperature conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 6), thus suggesting that host genetic background (genetic selection for cold tolerance) has a strong effect on shaping the microbiome composition. We next explored microbial taxa associated to genetic background effects and applied the indicator species analysis (this measure identifies habitat-associated species based on their fidelity and relative abundance in different environments; see Materials and methods). We found different microbes to be associated with the cold-resistant and cold-sensitive fish (Figure 2D), namely <italic>Cetobacterium somerae</italic> species were mostly enriched in the resistant, while a higher diversity of taxa such as <italic>Streptococcus luteciae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella sp., Clostridiaceae</italic> and <italic>Succinivibrionaceae</italic> species were enriched in the sensitive (Table S5 in Supplementary file 1). Interestingly, in the cold conditions we found an enrichment of <italic>Vibrionales</italic> species in the resistant fish, which have been shown to include several psychrophilic taxa or taxa with adaptations for cold tolerance, thus indicating that cold acclimation of the host may be selecting for specific microbes, with some of them potentially carrying fitness traits for cold tolerance (see below for more information).</p><p>These results and insights were obtained after we re-analysed all our data using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) as suggested by the reviewers (see below and in the Materials and methods section). Our overall results and figures, generated using the new data at the exact sequence variant level (ESV) originating from DADA2, show the same patterns and conclusions (Figures 2, 3, 4; See also supplementary figures).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other claims, however, are only weakly supported if at all.

We thank you for this comment as it allowed us to better present our results and understand our observations.</p><p>Following this suggestion, we stratified our data by diversity to compare individuals with similar diversity indices. We selected the 10 most extreme values from both temperatures (lowest and highest Shannon H’ diversity; Table S2 in Supplementary file 1) and we performed multivariate and clustering analysis (Two-way Permanova, Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary file 1; Principal Coordinate Analysis, Figure 2—figure supplement 6). Our results show that, even when we select individuals with similar diversity indices, either high or low, their posterior gut microbiomes cluster significantly according to temperature and host genetics (tolerance) group (Two-way Permanova in Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary file 1; Figure 2—figure supplement 6).</p><p>In addition, in our attempt to identify specific features that contribute to these changes, we performed the Dufrene-Legendre Indicator Species Analysis (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997; function <italic>indval</italic> with 1000 permutations, package &quot;<italic>labdsv</italic>&quot; in R), as described now in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Comparison of gut communities”). This analysis calculates the indicator value of a species in clusters or types, given by the following formula:</p><p>IndVal<italic>ij</italic> = Specificity<italic>ij</italic> × Fidelity<italic>ij</italic> × 100</p><p>where IndVal<italic>i j</italic> is the Indicator Value of an '<italic>i</italic>' species in relation to a '<italic>j</italic>' type of site; Specificity <italic>ij</italic> is the proportion of sites of type '<italic>j</italic>' with species '<italic>i</italic>', and Fidelity <italic>ij</italic> is the proportion of the number of individuals (abundance) of species '<italic>i</italic>' that are in a '<italic>j</italic>' type of site.</p><p>This analysis showed several ESV features to be host genetics (tolerance)-associated in the low and high diversity microbiomes, as shown in Table S5 in Supplementary file 1. The resistant fish with low diversity microbiomes were more enriched with species of the <italic>Vibrionales</italic> order, which include taxa that are cold-resistant (Raymond-Bouchard, Whyte, 2017; Townsley et al., 2016), while in the warm temperature, we saw in the high diversity microbiomes an enrichment of <italic>Cetobacterium somerae,</italic> which has been previously reported in the tilapia gut environment (Tsuchiya et al., 2008; Giatsis et al., 2015; Haygood, Jha, 2016). In the high diversity microbiome of the sensitive group, we observed enrichment of microbes within the <italic>Succinivibrionaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic> family (unknown species), with the latter being previously reported in several warm water fish species including tilapia, along with <italic>Streptococcus luteciae, Bacteroides fragilis</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> species.</p><p>Looking at host genetics-associated posterior gut microbiome at different taxonomic levels (Figure 2D; Figure 2—figure supplement 8; Table S6 in Supplementary file 1), similarly we found significant enrichment of the <italic>Vibrionales</italic> order in the cold-resistant fish, while, as mentioned above, a higher microbial order diversity such as <italic>Clostridiales, Methanobacteriales</italic> and <italic>Actinomycetales</italic> in the sensitive fish. Altogether, our results suggest that host genetic background shapes the microbiome composition, with some members that potentially carry fitness traits for cold tolerance (i.e. species from the <italic>Vibrionales</italic> order).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the main points of the paper is that the microbiome of resistant individuals is more &quot;resilient&quot; to changes in temperature.

Again, the problem described in this paragraph stems from the attempt to study changes in high dimensional species composition profiles with single numbers like richness or Shannon diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Following your suggestion, we assessed the resilience of microbiomes that were present in &gt;50% of the individuals in both temperatures (the core microbiome). We renormalized the data (re-calculated their relative abundance within the core microbiome) and examined the fold changes between the two temperatures within each tolerant group (Figure 2E). Overall, we observed that the fold change of these core microbes was significantly less affected by the temperature change in the resistant fish compared to the sensitive ones (Figure 2Eii). In addition, we designed specific primers in order to measure the absolute numbers for the most abundant and prevalent core taxa (&gt;95% of the individuals; <italic>Pseudomonas veronii</italic> and <italic>Janthinobacterium lividum</italic>) and quantified their counts within the samples using quantitative PCR (See in the Materials and methodssubsection “Comparison of gut communities”). Our results agree with the sequencing data, showing a significantly less pronounced effect on the absolute abundances of the core microbes in the gut of resistant fish. These results, from both re-normalization of the core microbes’ abundance and the absolute numbers of some of these core taxa using real-time PCR, support our findings by showing that the changes in the microbiome composition are significantly less pronounced in the resistant fish compared to the sensitive ones (Figure 2E; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), thus supporting our hypothesis that host thermal tolerance modulates microbiome response to temperature changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, the taxonomic analysis, which could deal with part of the problem, is done only at the level of shallow clades. For instance, most organisms in Figure 2B are proteobacteria. As the authors must know, this is an incredibly diverse set of microbes. Which proteobacteria? The authors should describe fold-changes in taxa at various taxonomic levels, starting with exact sequence variants.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we presented the taxonomic analysis of the microbiome at each taxonomic level (Figure 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 4), as well as calculated the fold change from control to cold conditions for each group presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 5. In addition, as described above, we performed indicator species analysis for each of the taxonomic levels that showed several host-associated taxonomic groups.</p><p>As suggested we re-analysed all our data using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) in order to correct any potential sequencing errors and presented our data at the Exact Sequence Variant (ESV) level (100% sequence identity dataset). In addition to using this tool, we took even more stringent approach in which we eliminated sequences present in less than two samples (doubletons) from the 100% sequence ID data sets. This overall analysis is described in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Sequencing of gut microbiome”). Essentially, our overall results and figures, generated using the new ESV data originating from DADA2, show the same patterns and conclusions (Figures 2, 3, 4; See also supplementary figures).</p><p>As presented in Figure 2A and B, the sensitive animals had a higher diversity of microbial orders compared to the resistant ones, such as species from the families <italic>Clostridiaceae, Succinivibrionaceae</italic> and from the genera <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 7-8). These species consistently existed in most of the individuals and show significant association for the sensitive (genetic) group as it emerges from the <italic>indval</italic> analysis (Figure 2D; 6 in Supplementary file 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 8). Similarly, we found significant association to the resistant hosts of taxa originating mostly from the <italic>Vibrionales</italic> order (Figure 2D; Table S6 in Supplementary file 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 8). Interestingly, taxa from this order has been reported as resistant to low temperatures or isolated from deep sea waters (Bouchard and Whyte, 2017). More specifically, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, a naturally occurring species in the freshwater fish gut (Haygood and Jha, 2018), which we found enriched in the resistant fish gut after cold exposure (Figure 2—figure supplement 5F), has been reported to be resistant to low temperatures through adaptation in its physiology (Townsley et al., 2016). Such results support our claims, that host genetic background, but also cold acclimation phenotype is associated with specific microbiome composition, with some of them potentially carrying fitness traits for cold tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the functional analysis is strongly biased by taxonomic changes.

We additionally discuss and cite David Sloan Wilson's concepts considering our results in the discussion. The taxonomic groups that we found to be enriched in the gut are associated with the hosts and the environmental changes; this also results in the enrichment of functions associated with these taxa, with this not necessarily being connected to cold tolerance. Moreover, to investigate whether there are shared responses between the host and the microbiome after cold exposure that could suggest cold acclimation or cold stress response, we compared the significantly affected KEGG orthologs within the microbiome (Figure 3A) to that of the host transcriptome. Interestingly, we found several functions that were not only shared, but also similarly affected (Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) between the host and the microbiome. Some of the functions affected were previously reported as key cell metabolism cold-induced adaptations in mice (i.e. down-regulation of PPAR signalling, cytochome 450; Shore et al., 2013) and thus suggesting a potential conserved response to low temperatures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, the finding that the microbiome composition is related to the genetic makeup of the host is interesting, but the authors should dig deeper into processes and, if possible, mechanisms.

As mentioned above, we now re-analysed our data obtaining a more in-depth taxonomic information at the Exact Sequence Variant level using DADA2. Nonetheless, we further developed our insights on the microbial composition changes due to the host genetic makeup and thermal tolerance.</p><p>We have shown that when fish from both groups were kept under their optimal temperature conditions of 24<sup>o</sup>C, the sensitive fish exhibited higher microbial diversity (Shannon H’) than the resistant ones (Figure 2Aii), as well as a higher individual variability. Indeed, when we compared the microbial community structure (β-diversity) of the two groups at these optimal conditions, we found that cold-resistant fish had a higher within-group microbiome similarity compared to the sensitive fish (Figure 2Ci), potentially due to the selection process that resistant fish have been subjected to regarding the cold resistant trait and thus showing a host control on the microbiome composition.</p><p>We further aimed to get a better insight into the microbiome composition of these host groups. To do so, we first compared the microbiome composition between the cold-resistant and cold sensitive hosts under any temperature condition; more specifically, we asked whether microbiomes of similar (Shannon H’) diversity are also sharing the same microbiome compositions. We stratified our data and examined individuals from each host group with similar Shannon H’ diversity (individuals from each group with the 10 highest or 10 lowest Shannon H’ Diversity values; Table S2 in Supplementary file 1). We found that the individuals from both high- and low-diversity microbiomes (Principal Coordinate Analysis; Figure 2—figure supplement 6) clustered significantly according to the host group (Permanova analysis, Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary file 1), suggesting that host genetic background (genetic selection for cold tolerance) has a strong effect on shaping the microbiome composition.</p><p>Our next step was to explore microbial taxa associated to genetic background effects and applied the indicator species analysis (this measure identifies habitat-associated species based on their fidelity and relative abundance in different environments; see above and Materials and methods). This analysis revealed several microbial taxa to be significantly associated with host genetic background, previously described as naturally occurring strains in the tilapia gut (Giatsis et al., 2015; Haygood and Jha, 2018) (Tables S5 and S6 in Supplementary file 1; Figure 2—figure supplement 7-8). Namely, microbial species such as <italic>Cetobacterium somerae</italic> (Tsuchiya et al., 2008) and species from the <italic>Vibrionales</italic> order (i.e. <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>; Figure 2—figure supplement 5F), described also as psychrophiles or cold-resistant microbes surviving in different environments (Raymond-Bouchard, Whyte, 2017; Townsley et al., 2016) were enriched in the resistant fish gut, while a higher diversity of taxa was enriched in the sensitive fish gut including <italic>Prevotella sp., Streptococcus luteciae</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> species, as well as species from the <italic>Christensenellaceae, Succinivibrionaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic> families. Overall, the gut of the sensitive fish was more diverse in microbial taxa and more variable between individuals during the warm conditions compared to the resistant fish, which could potentially stem from the fact that the resistant fish have been subjected to a selection process towards the cold resistant trait, while sensitive ones still contain higher genetic variability, however this still remains to be evaluated in future experiments. Altogether, our results suggest that host genetic background shapes the microbiome composition by selecting for specific microbes, with some of them potentially carrying fitness traits for cold tolerance.</p><p>Finally, as host fish were specifically selected according to their thermal tolerance, and our findings indicated that temperature and host genetic background affect the fish gut microbiome, we further asked whether the microbiome's response to temperature stress is also affected by its host's tolerance. When exposed to the cold temperature of 12<sup>o</sup>C, both resistant and sensitive hosts exhibited a decrease in their microbiome diversity and richness (Figure 2A; Figure 2—figure supplement 3), as well as changes in its composition (Figure 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 4-5). However, when we compared the β-diversity within each of these host groups in relation to temperature change, we found that after exposure to the stressful low-temperature conditions, the microbiomes of cold-resistant families were less affected than those of sensitive ones (Figure 2Cii). More specifically, when we compared the similarity of the microbial compositions between 24<sup>o</sup>C and 12<sup>o</sup>C, we found it to be significantly higher in the resistant families than in the sensitive ones, showing a stronger effect of temperature change in the sensitive fish (Figure 2Cii). We next asked whether this differential response to temperature of the microbiome in the two host groups also applies to microbes that are shared between the two host groups. To this end, we assessed the microbiome resilience in 11 selected taxa that were present in &gt;50% of the individuals from each temperature (core microbiome). After renormalizing the core microbes abundance (expressed as percentage within the core microbiome community; Figure 2E), we evaluated the fold changes in their abundance from 24<sup>o</sup>C to 12<sup>o</sup>C in the cold-resistant and cold-sensitive fish. Similar to the overall microbiome response (Figure 2Cii), the fold changes in the relative abundance of the core microbiome in the resistant fish was significantly lower that the sensitive ones (Figure 2Eii). In addition, we further designed specific primers in order to measure the absolute copy numbers for the two most abundant and prevalent core taxa within both host groups and quantified their abundance using quantitative PCR (see Materials and methods). Our results were in agreement with the sequencing data (Figure 2Ei, ii), showing a significantly less pronounced effect of the temperature on the abundance of the core microbes in the gut of the resistant fish compared to the sensitive ones (Figure 2Eiii). This means that the sensitivity of the shared-core microbes to cold temperatures was higher in the sensitive fish and thus supporting our hypothesis that host thermal tolerance modulates its microbiome response to temperature changes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
