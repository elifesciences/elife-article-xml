tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, devotes a considerable amount of coding capacity to produce, sense, and degrade cAMP. Despite this fact, our understanding of how cAMP regulates Mtb physiology remains limited. Here, we took a genetic approach to investigate the function of the sole essential adenylate cyclase in Mtb H37Rv, Rv3645. We found that a lack of <italic>rv3645</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to numerous antibiotics by a mechanism independent of substantial increases in envelope permeability. We made the unexpected observation that <italic>rv3645</italic> is conditionally essential for Mtb growth only in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, a host-relevant carbon source. A suppressor screen further identified mutations in the atypical cAMP phosphodiesterase <italic>rv1339</italic> that suppress both fatty acid and drug sensitivity phenotypes in strains lacking <italic>rv3645</italic>. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Rv3645 is the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory growth conditions, that cAMP production is the essential function of Rv3645 in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, and that reduced cAMP levels result in increased long-chain fatty acid uptake and metabolism and increased antibiotic susceptibility. Our work defines <italic>rv3645</italic> and cAMP as central mediators of intrinsic multidrug resistance and fatty acid metabolism in Mtb and highlights the potential utility of small molecule modulators of cAMP signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INV-004709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Kyu Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI143575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnappinger</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name><name><surname>Ehrt</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01130018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanderVen</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH Tuberculosis Research Units Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AI162584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Kyu Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR192421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rock</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Robertson Therapeutic Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rock</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NIAID New Innovator Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2AI144850-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rock</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ubiquitous second messenger cyclic AMP, produced by Rv3645/MacE, controls long-chain fatty acid metabolism and intrinsic multidrug resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) has evolved complex signaling and regulatory networks to sense and adapt to the diverse niches through which it transits during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and McDonough, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parish, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richard-Greenblatt and Av-Gay, 2017</xref>). The physiology that enables Mtb to adapt to and persist in the host can also decrease the effectiveness of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellerose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrouy-Maumus et al., 2016</xref>). For example, hypoxia reduces Mtb respiratory capacity and activates the DosRST two-component system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2003</xref>). DosR induces a 48 gene regulon which ultimately slows growth, promoting survival under hypoxic conditions and tolerance to antibiotics that are more active against rapidly replicating bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galagan et al., 2013</xref>). In a second example, nutrient starvation results in the dephosphorylation of CwlM, a substrate of the eukaryotic-like protein serine/threonine kinase PknB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boutte et al., 2016</xref>). Dephosphorylation reduces CwlM interaction with and activation of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme MurA, thereby reducing cell wall metabolism and promoting tolerance to starvation and antibiotics. Thus, the signaling and regulatory networks that facilitate Mtb survival under diverse physiologic conditions can also secondarily reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics. While several examples have been described, it is clear that numerous poorly understood signaling mechanisms exist that promote Mtb survival while reducing the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellerose et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to two-component systems and serine/threonine kinases, one of the most ubiquitous signal transduction modalities in Mtb is the adenylate cyclases. Adenylate cyclases sense extracellular or intracellular signals, either directly or indirectly, and transduce this signal into a cellular response by converting ATP into the small molecule second messenger 3â,5â-cyclic-AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and McDonough, 2018</xref>). cAMP then binds to and alters the function of effector proteins like the transcription factor CRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stapleton et al., 2010</xref>), the protein lysine acetyltransferase Mt-Pat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>), and numerous other potential cAMP-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and McDonough, 2018</xref>) to modify Mtb gene expression or gene product activity. Whereas the model bacteria <italic>E. coli</italic> encodes only one adenylate cyclase, the adenylate cyclase gene family has undergone a remarkable expansion in mycobacteria. <italic>M. avium</italic>, <italic>M. marinum</italic>, and Mtb encode 12, 31, and at least 15 predicted adenylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shenoy and Visweswariah, 2006</xref>), respectively. The existence of so many adenylate cyclases in the Mtb genome presumably allows Mtb to integrate diverse signals with downstream cellular responses by using cAMP as a second messenger. Mtb adenylate cyclases can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tews et al., 2005</xref>), bicarbonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cann et al., 2003</xref>), and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel Motaal et al., 2006</xref>), with the resulting increase in cAMP levels modulating both bacterial and host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2009</xref>). This expansion of the adenylate cyclase gene family is mirrored by an expansion of predicted cAMP phosphodiesterases, effectors, and binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) â nearly 1% of the Mtb genome is predicted to produce, degrade, or interact with cAMP. However, despite the clear importance of cAMP signaling in mycobacteria, our knowledge of how adenylate cyclases and cAMP regulate Mtb physiology remains largely undefined.</p><p>To address this gap, we undertook a genetic study of the sole in vitro essential adenylate cyclase in Mtb H37Rv, <italic>rv3645</italic>. We found that a lack of <italic>rv3645</italic> resulted in increased sensitivity to numerous antibiotics by a mechanism independent of substantial increases in envelope permeability. We further found that <italic>rv3645</italic> was conditionally essential for Mtb growth in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, a host-relevant carbon source, and identified mutations in the atypical cAMP phosphodiesterase <italic>rv1339</italic> that suppress this fatty-acid-dependent essentiality. Quantifying cAMP levels revealed that Rv3645 is the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory growth conditions. Bacterial cAMP levels were not altered by the presence of long-chain fatty acids nor the presence of some antibiotics to which <italic>rv3645</italic> mutants were more sensitive, suggesting that Rv3645 does not sense the presence of long-chain fatty acids or antibiotics. Rather, cAMP produced by Rv3645, presumably in response to an alternative signal, puts the bacilli in a physiologic state capable of surviving the stresses of long-chain fatty acids and antibiotics. Together, our work defines Rv3645 and the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP as central mediators of intrinsic multidrug resistance and fatty acid metabolism in Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The essential adenylate cyclase Rv3645 contributes to intrinsic drug resistance in Mtb H37Rv</title><p>To identify genes and pathways that influence drug efficacy in Mtb, we previously screened a genome-wide CRISPRi library in Mtb strain H37Rv against a panel of diverse antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). This approach identified hundreds of Mtb genes whose inhibition altered bacterial fitness in the presence of partially inhibitory drug concentrations, including genes encoding the direct drug target and non-target hit genes. Amongst the non-target hit genes, we found that depletion of the predicted essential adenylate cyclase, <italic>rv3645</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), sensitized Mtb to numerous antibiotics with unrelated mechanisms of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we used a fluorescent, BODIPY-conjugated analog of vancomycin (BODIPY-VAN) to monitor drug uptake. Vancomycin is a large, polar antibiotic for which disruption of the Mtb envelope is known to increase drug uptake and increase drug sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the dramatic sensitization of <italic>rv3645</italic> knockdown strains to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), <italic>rv3645</italic> knockdown strains showed only a modest increase in BODIPY-VAN uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as compared to the positive control gene <italic>mtrA</italic>, encoding a two-component response regulator important for proper envelope biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). To ensure the discrepancy between <italic>rv3645</italic> MIC assays and drug uptake measurements was not due to the presence of the BODIPY conjugate (~274 Daltons), we first confirmed that BODIPY-VAN retained similar antimicrobial activity to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To ensure that the BODIPY-VAN uptake assay was not confounded by differential cell death and lysis (cells which presumably would not stain with BODIPY-VAN), we confirmed that no loss in colony forming units (CFU) occurred when treating this panel of Mtb strains with vancomycin for the same time scale as the uptake assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Reduction in cAMP levels in Î<italic>rv3645</italic> and <italic>rv1339</italic> overexpressing strains did not alter levels of ATP nor pyrophosphate, involved in cAMP biosynthesis, indicating that the observed phenotypes are not caused by alterations in these metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the role of cAMP in regulating long-chain fatty acid metabolism and drug sensitivity, overexpression of <italic>rv1339</italic> resulted in elevated oleic acid uptake and metabolism and increased vancomycin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâH</xref>). Elevated oleic acid uptake and metabolism were not mediated by changes in Mce1 protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). To conclusively demonstrate that modulating cAMP levels is sufficient to regulate Mtb H37Rv antibiotic sensitivity, we treated Î<italic>rv3645</italic> strains with V-59, a small molecule agonist of the adenylate cyclase Rv1625c that results in constitutive cAMP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilburn et al., 2022</xref>). Addition of V-59 rescued the vancomycin sensitivity of Î<italic>rv3645</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These results demonstrate the crucial role of cAMP in regulating long-chain fatty acid metabolism and multidrug intrinsic resistance in Mtb.</p><p>Rv3645 is the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To test whether Rv3645 is necessary to elevate cAMP levels in response to long-chain fatty acids or antibiotics, we quantified cAMP levels in Î<italic>rv3645</italic> and <italic>rv1339</italic> overexpressing strains exposed to long-chain fatty acids and/or antibiotics. The addition of oleic acid did not alter cAMP levels as compared to fatty-acid-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5A</xref>). While the presence of antibiotics variably increased cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5B</xref>), there was no correlation between the drugs that result in elevated cAMP levels and those drugs that <italic>rv3645</italic>-KD is sensitized to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Rv3645 is not a detector of long-chain fatty acids or antibiotics, but rather that cAMP produced by Rv3645 puts the bacilli in a physiologic state capable of surviving these stresses.</p><p>Lastly, to determine whether Rv3645 plays a similar role in regulating fatty acid metabolism and multidrug intrinsic resistance beyond the reference Mtb strain H37Rv, we investigated <italic>rv3645</italic> in the lineage 2 strain HN878. Unlike H37Rv, <italic>rv3645</italic> was not essential for in vitro growth in standard lab culture conditions, consistent with prior screening results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carey et al., 2018</xref>). Despite this difference in essentiality, the reduction of cAMP levels sensitized HN878 to both vancomycin and palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with a critical role for cAMP in regulating fatty acid metabolism and intrinsic drug resistance in Mtb.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work defines <italic>rv3645</italic> and cAMP as central mediators of intrinsic multidrug resistance and fatty acid metabolism in Mtb H37Rv. <italic>rv3645</italic> knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity to antibiotics with diverse targets by a mechanism largely independent of increases in cell envelope permeability. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>rv3645</italic> was only essential in H37Rv in the presence of long-chain fatty acids. Suppression of long-chain fatty acid sensitivity was conferred by loss of the Mce1 transporter, presumably reflecting reduced fatty acid uptake, or inactivation of the atypical cAMP phosphodiesterase Rv1339. Consistent with these genetic results, using mass spectrometry we found that Rv3645 is the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory conditions in H37Rv, despite this strain encoding 14 additional adenylate cyclases in its genome. We propose naming Rv3645 âMacEâ for the <underline>m</underline>ajor <underline>a</underline>denylate <underline>c</underline>yclase <underline>e</underline>nzyme. Using gain- and loss-of-function alleles and small molecule-regulated cAMP production, we show that reduced cAMP levels are associated with elevated oleic acid uptake and metabolism, long-chain fatty acid toxicity, and increased drug sensitivity.</p><p>MacE is predicted to be composed of six transmembrane helices and cytosolic HAMP and cyclase homology domains. The presence of a HAMP domain, which typically transmits conformational changes from a periplasmic or transmembrane ligand binding domain to a cytoplasmic signaling domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hulko et al., 2006</xref>), suggests that MacE senses a ligand and transduces this signal into cytoplasmic cAMP production. The nature of this signal remains to be determined, but it is unlikely to be long-chain fatty acids or antibiotics. Rather, our data suggest that MacE is active in the presence or absence of long-chain fatty acids and antibiotics, and that cAMP produced by MacE puts the bacilli in a physiologic state capable of surviving these stresses.</p><p>Why does a lack of <italic>macE</italic> and lowered cAMP levels make Mtb more sensitive to long-chain fatty acids and drugs? Prior work established a link between cAMP and fatty acid catabolism through the cAMP-activated lysine acetyltransferase Mt-Pat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>). Activated Mt-Pat acetylates/propionylates multiple enzymes involved in fatty acid catabolism, including ten FadD paralogs and acetyl-CoA synthetase, thereby inhibiting AMP-ligase activity and oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA. Inactivation of Mt-Pat, like <italic>macE</italic>, makes Mtb more sensitive to fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rittershaus et al., 2018</xref>), although the fatty acid sensitivity phenotype is more severe for loss of <italic>macE</italic> as evidenced by the non-essentiality of Mt-Pat under standard laboratory culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>). Further linking cAMP and fatty acid metabolism, VanderVen and colleagues showed that transposon mutants in <italic>rv1339</italic> showed reduced uptake of BODIPY-palmitate in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, growing evidence suggests that reduced cAMP levels lead to overactive fatty acid catabolism.</p><p>In a series of related findings, Sassetti and colleagues screened Mtb transposon mutant libraries and identified Mt-Pat mutants as strongly attenuated under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rittershaus et al., 2018</xref>). In the absence of Mt-Pat, it was hypothesized that Mtb fails to downregulate fatty acid catabolism under hypoxic conditions, leading to a continual flux of acetyl-CoA through oxidative TCA metabolism. Consistent with this interpretation, the same screen identified that transposon mutants in the Mce1 transporter promoted fitness in hypoxia. Under hypoxia, the TCA cycle is thought to preferentially work in the reductive direction to regenerate NAD and prevent the accumulation of NADH in the absence of a terminal electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eoh and Rhee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). As both the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle and fatty acid Î²-oxidation produce NADH, Î<italic>mt-pat</italic> under hypoxic conditions becomes redox imbalanced and depletes NAD. Also potentially consistent with this interpretation, re-analysis of the hypoxia TnSeq data identifies <italic>rv1339</italic> as the top resistance-promoting hit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rittershaus et al., 2018</xref>). Elevated cAMP levels in <italic>rv1339</italic> transposon mutants could augment Mt-Pat activity and reduce fatty acid uptake and catabolism and drive expression of malate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazdik and McDonough, 2005</xref>), an enzyme critical for the reductive TCA cycle under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rittershaus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, recent observations suggest a link between cAMP and the electron transport chain. Isolation of spontaneous resistant mutants to a series of novel inhibitors of the QcrB subunit of the cytochrome <italic>bc<sub>1</sub>-aa<sub>3</sub></italic> oxidase repeatedly identifies mutations in <italic>rv1339</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandrasekera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">OâMalley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shelton et al., 2021</xref>). How loss of <italic>rv1339</italic> and elevated cAMP promotes resistance to QcrB inhibitors remains to be defined, but in principle could be achieved by elevated cAMP levels increasing electron transport chain activity, for example by increasing expression of the alternative terminal oxidase cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko and Oh, 2020</xref>). Indeed, Î<italic>macE</italic> shows hypersensitivity to the QcrB inhibitor Q203 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7</xref>), potentially suggesting a cytochrome <italic>bd</italic> defect in this strain.</p><p>Collectively, ours and published results lead to the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Loss of <italic>macE</italic> reduces cAMP levels which reduces the activity of multiple cAMP effectors, including Mt-Pat. That no single annotated or predicted cAMP effector individually recapitulates the phenotypes observed with <italic>macE</italic> indicates that the physiological effects of reduced cAMP levels in Î<italic>macE</italic> are the consequence of the altered activity of multiple effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Potential downstream cAMP effector proteins include transcription factors like CRP, transporters, phospholipases, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and McDonough, 2018</xref>), highlighting the potential pleiotropic consequences of modulating cAMP levels. Reduced activity of cAMP-responsive proteins, including Mt-Pat, may increase fatty acid uptake and catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>) and oxidative TCA metabolism while simultaneously reducing electron transport chain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko and Oh, 2020</xref>). This derangement may ultimately lead to redox imbalance, perturbed membrane potential, reduced growth, and increased sensitivity to antibiotics through yet-to-be-defined mechanisms.</p><p>Much work remains to be done to test the predictions generated by this model. The lack of changes in Mce1 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>) despite increased fatty acid uptake in low cAMP strains may indicate complex regulation of fatty acid uptake, including post-translational modifications or activity-modulating accessory proteins of the Mce1 transporter. Moreover, it is known that host-associated signals like low pH can activate Mtb adenylate cyclases and that macrophage infection results in a burst of bacterial cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tews et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is likely that some of the up to 14â15 additional adenylate cyclases encoded in the Mtb genome are active in the diverse niches encountered by Mtb during infection. Whether cAMP produced under these diverse host-associated conditions also coordinates fatty acid metabolism and intrinsic multidrug resistance remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note that both <italic>macE</italic> and <italic>rv1339</italic> were recently found to be under positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), raising the possibility that alterations in cAMP levels are being positively selected in Mtb clinical isolates.</p><p>Notably, the canonical cAMP phosphodiesterase <italic>rv0805</italic> was not identified as a suppressor of palmitic acid toxicity in the Î<italic>macE</italic> suppressor screen nor in the hypoxia TnSeq screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rittershaus et al., 2018</xref>). Rv0805 is 150 times more active against 2â,3â-cAMP, a cAMP species associated with RNA degradation, than 3â,5â-cAMP, the product of adenylate cyclases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keppetipola and Shuman, 2008</xref>). Consistent with these data, overexpression of Rv0805 showed only a modest (~40%) reduction in 3â,5â-cAMP in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2009</xref>). Lastly, <italic>rv0805</italic> has a limited phylogenetic distribution and is not found in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, which also encodes numerous adenylate cyclases. Thus, it appears that <italic>rv1339</italic> and not <italic>rv0805</italic> is the major 3â,5â-cAMP phosphodiesterase in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomson et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We show here that the sole in vitro essential adenylate cyclase in H37Rv, MacE, links fatty acid metabolism and intrinsic multidrug resistance through the production of cAMP. The adenylate cyclase Rv1625c has recently been shown to be important for cholesterol catabolism, although interestingly this phenotype was independent of the Rv1625c cyclase homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilburn et al., 2022</xref>). In a screen for compounds that disrupt cholesterol catabolism, VanderVen and colleagues discovered V-59, an Rv1625c agonist analogous to the eukaryotic adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilburn et al., 2022</xref>). V-59 results in constitutive activation of Rv1625c and cAMP production and, for reasons yet unknown, blocks cholesterol catabolism. Thus, it would appear proper metabolic function of Mtb grown on fatty acids and cholesterol requires âjust the right amountâ of cAMP: too little and Mtb cannot grow in the presence of fatty acids, too much and Mtb cannot catabolize cholesterol. Moreover, our results and those investigating combination drug treatment with V-59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilburn et al., 2022</xref>) suggest that deficient or elevated cAMP production may potentiate combination drug therapy.</p><p>Interestingly, whereas cAMP promotes intrinsic multidrug resistance in Mtb, this relationship may not be conserved or in some cases may even be reversed in other bacteria. Large-scale chemical genomic screening of cAMP-deficient Î<italic>cya E. coli</italic> did not identify any significant differences in antibiotic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nichols et al., 2011</xref>), although earlier studies found that Î<italic>cya</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> promotes fosfomycin resistance by reducing expression of the GlpT and UhpT uptake systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silver, 2017</xref>).

Î<italic>cya</italic> upregulated the oxidative stress response and SOS-dependent DNA damage repair and promoted survival to beta-lactam antibiotics. Thus, it will be interesting to examine the relationship between cAMP and drug efficacy across diverse bacterial species.</p><p>cAMP is a ubiquitous but poorly understood second messenger in Mtb. Mtb devotes a considerable amount of coding capacity to produce, sense, and degrade cAMP. Here, we reveal the adenylate cyclase MacE as the dominant source of cAMP under standard laboratory growth conditions. cAMP levels are coordinately regulated by MacE and the atypical phosphodiesterase Rv1339. cAMP produced by MacE is critical for Mtb growth on long-chain fatty acids, a host-relevant carbon source, and for intrinsic multidrug resistance, highlighting the potential utility of small molecule modulators of this second messenger to control Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilburn et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>Mtb strains are derivatives of H37Rv, unless indicated as HN878. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains are derivatives of DH5alpha (NEB). <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strains are derivatives of mc<sup>2</sup>155 <italic>groEL1</italic>Î<italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noens et al., 2011</xref>).

Values were expressed as %CO<sub>2</sub> release relative to the radioactive counts for the wild type.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Spreadsheet of plasmids, sgRNAs, and primers used in this work.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-81177-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81177-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>RNA-seq data of Mtb H37Rv are deposited in NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA930437.

many species, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, use cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a secondary messenger to sense and respond to specific stimuli. What distinguishes <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, is that its genome encodes at least 15 adenylate cyclases, enzymes that synthesize cAMP from ATP. Using state-of-the-art methods in this important study, the authors characterized one specific adenylate cyclase, Rv3645, and convincingly demonstrate that it is the most significant contributor to cAMP levels, in addition to mediating fatty acid metabolism and antibiotic resistance. This manuscript will be of broad interest to readers in the field of tuberculosis drug discovery and bacterial metabolism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81177.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03rp50x72</institution-id><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution></institution-wrap><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05cf8a891</institution-id><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.07.499113">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.07.499113v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The major objective of this study is to investigate the role of cAMP levels in LCFA metabolism. Thus, experiments monitoring the cAMP levels of ÎRv3645, ÎRv3645-Rv1339 KD, and WT-Rv1339 OE in media with/without LCFA with/without antibiotics are necessary to support the conclusions. Also, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1, only Rv3645 showed functional essentiality in resisting antibiotics.

The reduction of cAMP levels is proposed as the primary mechanistic basis underlying ÎRv3645 hypersensitivity to multiple antibiotics. cAMP is synthesized by hydrolyzing ATP and releasing PPi. Thus, reduced biosynthesis of cAMP in Îrv3645 may be associated with the accumulation of ATP and depletion of PPi. As these metabolites are usually tightly regulated, increased drug sensitivity may be directly or indirectly associated with a dysregulation in ATP and PPi abundance, in addition to cAMP depletion.

To this end, this study used the genome-wide CRISPRi library screening data (a previously published work) to pinpoint the rv3645 gene as a key candidate for the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> intrinsic drug tolerance. Using CRISPRi KD and genetic KO techniques targeting rv3645 and a Îrv3645 suppressor screen technique, authors observed that Rv3645 is the main functional adenylate cyclase enzyme used to biosynthesize cAMP for an effective LCFA metabolism and antibiotic effect evasion. This study is well-designed and experimentally solid to prove a new function of Rv3645. However, there are a couple of ways to improve the mechanistic bases, as noted below.</p><p>1. The major objective of this study is to propose the role of cAMP level in LCFA metabolism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> intrinsic drug tolerance. Thus, this reviewer recommends the experiments monitoring the cAMP levels of Îrv3645, Îrv3645-rv1339 KD, and WT-rv1339 OE in media with/without LCFA with/without antibiotics.

Authors propose that reduction of cAMP levels is a main mechanistic basis underlying Îrv3645 hypersensitivity to multiple antibiotics. As already known, cAMP is synthesized by hydrolyzing ATP and releasing PPi. Thus, reduced biosynthesis of cAMP in Îrv3645 may be associated with the accumulation of ATP and depletion of PPi. As ATP and PPi concentrations are tightly regulated in gaining drug tolerance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, Îrv3645 drug sensitivity may be directly or indirectly associated with a dysregulation in ATP and PPi abundance in addition to cAMP depletion. Thus, to prove that Îrv3645 hypersensitivity to antibiotic effects is mainly due to cAMP depletion, this reviewer recommends including ATP and PPi concentrations of Îrv3645 and Îrv3645-rv1339 OE.</p><p>3.

The authors have speculated on the likely link between fatty acid metabolism and antibiotic sensitivity through activation of Mt-Pat and redox imbalance.

To further address how cAMP may regulate LCFA catabolism in Mtb, we collaborated with the VanderVen lab to quantify [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-oleic acid uptake and metabolism in the following Mtb strains: WT, â<italic>rv3645</italic>+EV, â<italic>rv3645+rv3645,</italic> WT+<italic>rv1339</italic> OE and WT+<italic>rv1339</italic>(<italic>D180A</italic>) OE<italic>.</italic> As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> and Figure 5âfigure supplement 3, reduced cAMP levels correlate with elevated oleic acid uptake and metabolism. Alterations in oleic acid uptake and metabolism were not mediated by altered levels of Mce1A, Mce1D, Mce1E, nor MceG levels. Our observation of elevated oleic acid uptake at low cAMP levels is consistent with prior results from the VanderVen lab that observed reduced oleic acid uptake in <italic>rv1339::Tn</italic> Mtb mutants in infected macrophages (PMID: 30735132).

All drugs were tested above their MIC90. cAMP was measured by ELISA. Whereas vancomycin did not alter cAMP levels, both rifampicin and linezolid led to large increases in cAMP in a manner partially dependent on <italic>rv3645</italic>. As shown in Figure 1D-G of the manuscript, <italic>rv3645</italic> KD are more sensitive to vancomycin and rifampicin but not linezolid.

We note that the â<italic>rv3645</italic>+<italic>rv1339</italic> KD strain shows only a modest increase in cAMP following LZD treatment in this particular experiment, but replicate experiments showed stronger cAMP induction in this strain, comparable to that observed in the WT strain. Taken together, these results suggest that cAMP produced by Rv3645 is necessary for H37Rv Mtb to maintain homeostasis, both with respect to LCFA uptake and catabolism and intrinsic drug resistance. While H37Rv Mtb can respond to alterations in cellular physiology, e.g. inhibition of transcription and/or translation, by altering cAMP levels in a manner largely dependent on Rv3645, it does not appear that an inducible cAMP stress response is critical to modulate LCFA uptake and catabolism nor intrinsic drug resistance.</p><p>To address the reviewersâ comment regarding the functional essentiality of Rv3645 in resisting antibiotics, we further validated the screen results by showing that knockdown of the alternative adenylate cyclases <italic>rv2212</italic>, <italic>rv1264</italic>, or <italic>rv1625c</italic> does not alter sensitivity to vancomycin.</p><p>These data are now included as Figure 3E-F, Figure 5F-G, and Figure 5 â figure supplements 3 and 5 in the revised manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81177-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Lines 182 â 184, sensitivity was not observed towards the odd chain fatty acids propionic acid and valeric acid, nor to cholesterol, ruling out propionate-derived toxicity as the source of the fatty acid sensitive growth phenotype. LCFA metabolism also can be toxic to M. tuberculosis if ICL aldehyde end products and ketoacidosis metabolites are accumulated, as reported in PMID: 28265055. In this context, quantification of ICL aldehyde end products and acetyl-CoA-derived ketoacidosis metabolites in ÎRv3645 and Rv3645KD is important.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and a hypothesis that we entertained early in this project. As the reviewer points out, LCFA can be toxic if isocitrate lyase (ICL) aldehyde end products accumulate. As reported in PMID: 28265055, ICL aldehyde end products accumulate when Mtb is deficient in malate synthase, encoded by the <italic>glcB</italic> gene. We reasoned that if ICL aldehyde end product accumulation was a source of LCFA toxicity and drug sensitivity in â<italic>rv3645</italic>, then â<italic>glcB</italic> and â<italic>rv3645</italic> Mtb strains should share similar phenotypes.

Whereas â<italic>rv3645</italic> is only susceptible to LCFA including palmitic acid, oleic acid, and arachidonic acid (Figure 3B-D, Figure 3 â figure supplement 1B-G), â<italic>glcB</italic> is sensitive to short, medium, and long-chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and cholesterol (PMID: 28265055). Moreover, whereas chemical inactivation of Icl1 rescued growth of â<italic>glcB</italic> in the presence of LCFA (PMID: 28265055), we did not observe that knockdown of <italic>icl1</italic> rescued the palmitic acid toxicity in â<italic>rv3645</italic> in the suppressor screen (Figure 4A-B).</p><p>Intrinsic drug resistance: the chemical-genetic interactions observed for <italic>rv3645</italic> KD and <italic>glcB</italic> KD in our published CRISPRi screens are distinct (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>, PMID: 35637331).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81177-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, to directly test if ICL aldehyde end product accumulation was a source of toxicity in â<italic>rv3645</italic> strains, we quantified the abundance of glyoxylate, butyryl-coenzyme A (butyryl-CoA), acetoacetate, and Î²-hydroxybutyrate by mass spectrometry in the following Mtb strains grown in 7H9-OADC: WT, <italic>rv3645</italic> KD + <italic>rv3645</italic><sup>CS</sup>, <italic>rv3645</italic> KD + <italic>rv3645</italic><sup>CR</sup>, and â<italic>rv3645</italic>.

The Mtb strains used in this manuscript have undergone several passages to sequentially clone CRISPRi and complementation/expression plasmids, or to engineer gene deletions, and thus we would not be surprised if our strains are PDIMâ. On-going efforts in the lab to engineer uniformly PDIM+ genetic mutants in Mtb H37Rv have been unsuccessful.

We do not believe this should produce artifactual results because the BODIPY-vancomycin binding assays were performed over a short time period: 30 minutes or ~2% of the total time of a single Mtb cell cycle. We first confirmed that BODIPY-vancomycin showed similar potency to vancomycin.

Although Rv0805 is a cAMP phosphodiesterase, it is 150 times more active against 2â,3â-cAMP (a cAMP species associated with RNA degradation) than 3â,5â-cAMP (the product of adenylate cyclase) (PMID: 18757371). Consistent with this poor activity towards 3â,5â-cAMP, overexpression of Rv0805 resulted in only modest (~40%) reduction in 3â,5â-cAMP in Mtb (PMID: 19516256).

Did the authors perform similar experiments on other strains of TB?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Bill for this astute observation. In this work we focused solely on the reference Mtb strain H37Rv. Prior CRISPRi screening results suggest that <italic>rv3645</italic> may be a differentially essential gene between different Mtb strains (PMID: 34297925). To test the importance of cAMP in other strains of Mtb, we cloned the <italic>rv3645</italic> KD and <italic>rv1339</italic> OE plasmids into the lineage 2 strain HN878, in which <italic>rv3645</italic> appears non-essential (PMID: 34297925), and tested the resulting strains in dose-response MIC assays and agar plate-based fatty acid sensitivity spotting assays. We find that knockdown of <italic>rv3645</italic> or overexpression of <italic>rv1339</italic> in HN878 results in an intermediate sensitization to vancomycin compared to H37Rv. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>rv1339</italic> sensitized HN878 to palmitic acid. These results suggest a role for cAMP in mediating intrinsic drug resistance and fatty acid metabolism in Mtb beyond the reference strain H37Rv.</p><p>These data have been included as Figure 5 âfigure supplement 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â Figure 1 legend, Please describe FDR.</p><p>â Figure 2. It is not clear from the Figure or methods, what the concentration of BODIPY-Vancomycin used (2 ug/ml) corresponds to in terms of MIC. If the rv3645 KD strain is hypersensitive to Vancomycin, there is a possibility that the drug uptake measurements are biased towards cells that are still intact and have not yet been lysed, which might be similar to wild-type MTB. Maybe the rv3645 KD cells that hyper-accumulate Vancomycin are all lysed rapidly. Have the authors measured the kill-kinetics of Vancomycin over time?</p><p>â Figure 4. Rv1339 was identified in the suppressor screen and validated in subsequent experiments. What about Rv0805, the other main PDE? Did this come up in the screen? Also looking at the data in supplementary Figure 1a, interestingly the phenotype of rv0805 is opposite to that of rv1339 and mirrors that of rv3645. How can these observations be reconciled? Maybe the authors can discuss this.</p><p>â Figure 5H. The authors have speculated on the likely link between fatty acid metabolism and antibiotic sensitivity through activation of Mt-Pat and redox imbalance. These are easily testable hypotheses through expression analysis or metabolite analysis. This would greatly strengthen and fully validate their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree that further analysis of phenotypes regulated by cAMP would strengthen our hypotheses. To this end, we have begun to interrogate the connection of cAMP with fatty acid metabolism. Please see our response to Essential Revision 1, demonstrating strains with <italic>rv3645</italic> deleted or overexpressing <italic>rv1339</italic> show increased uptake and catabolism of <sup>14</sup>C-oleic acid.</p></body></sub-article></article>
