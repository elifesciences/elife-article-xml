Although electrical synapses can entrain activity within neuronal assemblies, their role in feed-forward circuits is less well explored. By combining whole-cell patch-clamp and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy of basket cells (BCs), we found that classical excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are followed by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-independent outward currents, reflecting the hyperpolarization component of spikelets (a synapse-evoked action potential passively propagating from electrically coupled neighbors). FF recruitment of the spikelet-mediated inhibition curtails the integration time window of concomitant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and dampens their temporal integration. In contrast with GABAergic-mediated feed-forward inhibition, the depolarizing component of spikelets transiently increases the peak amplitude of EPSPs, and thus postsynaptic spiking probability. Therefore, spikelet transmission can propagate within the BC network to generate synchronous inhibition of Purkinje cells, which can entrain cerebellar output for driving temporally precise behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electrical synapses</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd><kwd>feed-forward circuit</kwd><kwd>synchrony</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoehne</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>McFadden</surname><given-names>Maureen H</given-names></name><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-2010-BLANC-1411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV4-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE16-0019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE16-0026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE16-0018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiGregorio</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient recruitment of electrical synapses mediates precisely timed excitation and inhibition to enhance synchronized control of cerebellar cortical output.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GABAergic interneurons play important but diverse roles in gating, routing and modulating excitatory information flow within neural circuits through inhibitory chemical synapses.

However, how FF inhibitory motifs can be used to regulate interneuron firing is less well studied.</p><p>Interneurons communicate with each other through both chemical and electrical synapses. While chemical synapses can regulate interneuron firing in the same way as for principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>), the presence of gap junctions that couple neurons directly as resistive elements are thought to generate emergent properties such as oscillations and synchronized firing within neuronal assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beierlein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draguhn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maex and De Schutter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostojic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Welie et al., 2016</xref>). Electrical synapses between molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) within the cerebellum have been shown to mediate synchronized firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>) and sequence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcami, 2018</xref>), while those between Golgi cells have been shown to either synchronize or desynchronize cerebellar cortical network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Welie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vervaeke et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the presence of electrical synapses has been shown to modulate passive properties in interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amsalem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hjorth et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite theoretical studies showing the influence of electrical synapses in information processing within FF circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pham and Haas, 2019</xref>), experimental evidence that electrical synapses modify temporally coded information within FF neural circuits has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Owing to the low-pass filtering properties of the cell membrane, presynaptic APs are heavily filtered and consequently detected as ‘spikelets’ in electrically coupled postsynaptic cells. The relative contribution of the depolarizing component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu and Agmon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>) or the after-hyperpolarization component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vervaeke et al., 2010</xref>) of the presynaptic AP to the spikelet waveform can vary across cell types and determines if electrical synapses mediate net excitation or inhibition. Alterations in the spikelet waveform can arise from alterations in presynaptic AP shape, which can be modulated by variations in the membrane potential of unperturbed neurons when they are not spiking (resting membrane potential) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russo et al., 2013</xref>). Theoretical studies show that net depolarizing spikelets will drive synchronization within neuronal networks, while hyperpolarizing spikelets will generate bistable networks which either oscillate synchronously or remain in asynchronous states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostojic et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the contribution of electrical synapses to network computations depends on the precise polarity of the spikelet.</p><p>In the cerebellar cortex, MLIs are known to mediate feed-forward inhibition (FFI) onto each other and Purkinje cells (PCs) by the means of GABAergic synapses. Coherent firing of MLIs is required for encoding precise movement kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>). Specifically, basket cells (BCs) have been shown to precisely control the timing of PC activity with millisecond precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlt and Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blot et al., 2016</xref>). MLIs in young animals have also been shown to be electrically coupled via the gap junction protein Cx36, likely located in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcami and Marty, 2013</xref>). It has been shown that there is an increasing spatial gradient of occurrence and strength of electrical connectivity between MLIs from increasing depths in molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>). Since MLIs located in the deepest (inner) third of the molecular layer are likely to be BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sultan and Bower, 1998</xref>), we investigated if electrical transmission could be recruited in a feed-forward (FF) manner in the BC population, and how it modulates EPSP-spike coupling.</p><p>We found that electrical stimulation of parallel fiber (PF) excitatory inputs reliably elicited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), followed rapidly by an outward current that was sensitive to gap junction antagonists and Cx36 knockdown, consistent with suprathreshold, PF-mediated recruitment of an electrically coupled neuron delivering a spikelet to its neighbor. Paired whole-cell recordings from electrically coupled BCs showed that the spikelets were predominantly inhibitory due to the depolarized presynaptic resting potential. Consequently, the synaptic recruitment of an electrically coupled MLI neighbor displays some of the characteristic features of FFI: temporal shortening of single EPSPs and dampening of temporal summation. Unlike chemical FFI, however, we demonstrate that EPSP-evoked spikelets can amplify synchronous compound synaptic responses, and consequently increase the probability of AP firing over a brief time window. Thus, synapse-evoked spikelet recruitment in a FF motif can act as a mechanism for temporal contrast enhancement of information flow within neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PF-triggered outward currents are mediated by electrical synapses in cerebellar BCs</title><p>MLIs found in the inner third of the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex are more likely to be BCs, defined by their basket-like axonal projections targeting PC somata and axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sultan and Bower, 1998</xref>). Because MLIs from the inner-third of the molecular layer have been shown to more frequently form electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>), we examined whether electrical synapses could be recruited in a FF manner between electrically coupled BCs. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) of whole-cell patch-clamped inner MLIs revealed that more than 95% of cells with basket-like axon collaterals also presented a dendritic tree that traversed nearly the entire molecular layer (174 ± 4.9 µm, n = 30 cells - see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for a representative example).

Despite blocking inhibition, we often observed a fast EPSC component and a gabazine-insensitive outward component when stimulating PF axons contacting BC dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This outward current was detected in approximately 60% of stimulation locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, red bar) across 26 cells, twenty-one of which displayed significant outward currents in at least one stimulation site (see Materials and methods). Outward currents were also detected all along the dendritic tree, with an amplitude independent of the distance from stimulation site to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Bath application of 10 µM of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist, NBQX, eliminated both the EPSC and the subsequent outward current to below detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, n = 5/5 experiments). In the absence of NBQX, increasing the stimulation voltage increased the amplitude of both the inward and outward currents, but single-sweep analysis within each stimulus condition did not reveal any correlation between their peak amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), despite quantal variability in the peak EPSC. This finding is not consistent with voltage-dependent potassium conductance recruitment by unclamped synaptic currents in dendrites for larger synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016</xref>). To test this more directly, we replaced potassium by cesium in the patch pipette solution to block potassium conductances. We observed no difference in the frequency or amplitude of outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>). We next reasoned that PF stimulation could trigger an AP in electrically-connected neurons, generating a spikelet with a predominant hyperpolarizing (outward) current component following the initial EPSC. Consistent with this hypothesis, 20 µM of mefloquine, a potent blocker of gap junctions (~70% block at 20 µM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruikshank et al., 2004</xref>]) reduced the frequency of observing an outward current to 14.9 ± 4.4%, with those detected currents being 3-fold smaller (8.7 ± 0.5 vs. 2.9 ± 0.3 pA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In conditions where only 0.1% DMSO was added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), neither the frequency nor the amplitude of the outward current differed from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, pink group).</p><p>We also examined the frequency of observing PF-mediated outward currents in the absence of Cx36 expression (n = 4 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In brain slices prepared from mature Cx36 KO mice, we observed a 45% reduction in the frequency of outward currents, and the amplitude of the remaining events was 3-fold smaller than age-matched recordings (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 12.7 ± 1.8 pA). The remaining electrical coupling could be due to a late-onset (3–5 months) partial compensatory mechanism, in contrast to previous reports that showed complete block at P10-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcami and Marty, 2013</xref>). We also assessed electrical coupling in BC-BC paired whole-cell recordings in Cx36 KO mice, and found that one out of five recordings exhibited bidirectional spikelets and a coupling coefficient (CC) greater than 2% (see below for criteria). This is less than the nearly 60% of BC-BC pairs showing detectable electrical coupling (see below, Figure 6). These alterations in electrical coupling, either using acute block of gap junctions or via Cx36 knockdown, point to gap junctions as the mechanism for generating synapse-evoked outward currents.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Outward currents are reduced in Cx36KO mice and stellate cells (SCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of PF-mediated synaptic responses recorded in three different conditions (WT P90-150 BCs, P90-150 BCs in Cx36KO mice, and WT P90-150 SCs).

Since spikelet transmission across gap junctions is symmetrical (bidirectional), we counted maximally one electrical connection per paired BC recording. For a chemical connection, however, there could be zero, one, or two connections per paired recording, and thus we estimated the number of chemical synapses per connections tested. We found that bidirectional spikelet transmission was significantly more likely to be observed than unidirectional GABAergic connections, (58 ± 6%, n = 35/60 paired recordings, and 41 ± 5%, n = 35/85 connections, respectively; p=0.04, unpaired t-test). If we analyzed the gabazine experiments only, we found that in 15 of 28 unidirectional connections from BC-BC pairs, the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist did not alter the outward current amplitude, consistent with a larger fraction of electrical than chemical connections. In the remaining connections the fractional block by 10 μM gabazine was ~50% on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that, when both chemical and electrical synapses were present, the outward current under our recording conditions was similar. We cannot rule out the possibility that GABAergic transmission is more sensitive to rundown and might bias the estimate of the relative contribution of electrical and chemical synapses.

Because mefloquine is known to alter input resistance by blocking electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vervaeke et al., 2012</xref>) and has been shown to alter membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>), we designed a specific experiment to examine the influence of spikelets on EPSPs without the need for gap junction antagonists. Taking advantage of the fact that some stimulation locations along the dendrite did not recruit a spikelet when stimulating 5–10 V above threshold to elicit an EPSC (low stimulation, LS; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we examined EPSP shape under low and high extracellular stimulation intensities (+15 V; HS), which in some cases recruited AP firing of a neighboring interneuron and thus a spikelet in the recorded BC. Recordings were pooled into two different groups: (1) one in which no electrical neighbor was recruited in either stimulation regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and (2) another in which increasing stimulation intensity was sufficient to recruit an electrical neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

But we cannot rule out that a small spikelet may accelerate some EPSPs without eliciting a detectable outward current.

The challenge was to generate EPSPs and spikelets independently, and without altering the EPSP amplitude (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), in order to examine the influence of spikelets on synaptic integration and EPSP-spike coupling. We, therefore, recorded EPSPs in single BCs following stimulation of two independent PF pathways: one electrode was positioned above the BC dendritic tree (on-beam) to recruit only direct EPSPs; and another was positioned adjacent to the projected plane of the dendritic tree to stimulate off-beam, so as to only recruit spikelets in the recorded cell (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Stimulation intensity was adjusted independently for each location to achieve on- and off-beam stimulation. Stimulation pipette positions were always displaced by at least 100 µm, to ensure the recruitment of two different PF beams. BCs were initially held between −75 and −70 mV in order to examine the amplitude of the compound subthreshold synaptic response with respect to the time delay between the two stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

We then examined AP firing probability versus time delay between on- and off-beam stimulation.

GABAergic chemical synapses provide self-inhibition between MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>), and have been suggested to mediate disinhibition of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blot et al., 2016</xref>). Whether or not electrical connectivity could be recruited in a similar manner and influence EPSP-spike coupling, however, had not yet been examined. Here, we identify and describe the functional implication of FF recruitment of spikelet signaling in cerebellar BCs, an MLI subtype that exhibits a high probability of electrical synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcami and Marty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>). Our results indicate that extracellular electrical stimulation of small PF beams leads to the recruitment of APs in electrically coupled MLIs that generate spikelets in the postsynaptic BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), but more rarely and less prominently in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Because of the low frequency (13%) of BC-SC electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>), we propose that eFFI is mostly provided by other BCs. We show that the polarity of spikelet responses is net inhibitory and can be influenced by the presynaptic neuron’s resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This type of connection is more frequent than those of chemical inhibition (58% vs. 41%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, the brief depolarizing component of the spikelet provides a distinct advantage over cFFI because the postsynaptic output firing can be briefly enhanced, providing a temporal contrast enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Such a mechanism generates strong synchronized inhibition from BCs that could temporally entrain PCs that in turn drive deep cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Raman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Özcan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cellular mechanism of spikelet transmission</title><p>Extracellular stimulation of PFs in parasagittal slices in the presence of gabazine produced outward currents on average of 10 pA in BCs and less than 3 pA in SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We performed several experiments whose results were consistent with spikelet transmission through gap junctions as the origin of GABAergic-independent outward currents: (1) subsaturating concentrations (20 µM) of the gap junction blocker mefloquine blocked the outward current by 70%, as expected for a current entirely mediated by gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruikshank et al., 2004</xref>). (2) We observed a 3-fold reduction in peak amplitude of the outward current in Cx36 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The incomplete knockdown could be due to genetic compensation by Cx45, which is known to also be expressed in MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Der Giessen et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, we only observed 20% of BC-BC pairs in Cx36 KO mice that showed bidirectional spikelets and a CC greater than 2% (the average CC correlated with the observation of a spikelet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as opposed to the nearly 60% of BC-BC pairs in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). (3) To confirm that the outward currents were mediated by spikelets, we showed that stimulation of PFs outside the dendritic field of the recorded cell and direct stimulation of MLIs in NBQX both evoked currents with a rapid inward component and an outward component similar to that following EPSCs. (4) Moreover, these extracellular stimulation-evoked spikelets were very similar to those evoked by single APs propagating between electrically coupled BC pairs. And finally, (5) the strength of electrical coupling between two BCs, estimated from 400 ms step depolarizations, was positively correlated with spikelet amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that spikelets were mediated by gap junctions.</p><p>Electrical coupling between neurons has also been demonstrated in the absence of gap junctions or chemical synapses and is referred to as ephaptic coupling. We cannot directly rule out that the remaining spikelet currents in mefloquine or Cx36 KOs could result from transmission of an AP between closely juxtaposed dendrites or axons. BC-PC ephaptic transmission is thought to occur between the axon terminal of BCs (pinceau) and the axon initial segment of PCs. Both the capacitive and K-currents generate a local field that sufficiently hyperpolarizes the AIS membrane potential and reduces the probability of PC spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blot and Barbour, 2014</xref>). In that study, simulations suggest that the ephaptic-mediated hyperpolarization is ~1 µV at the somata, and thus unlikely to account for the large mV changes we observe between two BCs. In contrast, ephaptic currents in PC-PC pairs are 10's of pA, due to a regenerative activation of local AIS sodium conductances in postjunctional PCs that is eliminated by postjunctional PC hyperpolarization to −70 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2018</xref>). We showed that the synapse-evoked outward current was insensitive to 1 mM of the sodium channel blocker QX-314 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see Materials and methods); and, in BC-BC paired recordings, the amplitude of the spikelet is insensitive to postsynaptic manipulation of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings are inconsistent with a sodium-dependent ephaptic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Electrical synapse-mediated spikelets dynamically modulate BC EPSP-spike coupling</title><p>Spikelet waveforms have been shown to depend on a variety of physiological parameters across different cell types, including resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2013</xref>) and active conductances in the presynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curti and Pereda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pereda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russo et al., 2013</xref>) or the postsynaptic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>). By systematically varying the pre- and postsynaptic holding membrane potentials, we found that the latter had no detectable influence on the spikelet waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the presynaptic membrane potential is critical in shaping the triggered AP, and therefore the shape of the corresponding spikelet. A hyperpolarized resting potential leads to a net excitatory spikelet, while a depolarized resting potential reveals a prominent AHP, causing the corresponding spikelets to transmit net inhibition. Comparison of spikelets evoked in an unperturbed, electrically coupled neighbor to those evoked in paired recordings with presynaptic membrane potential manipulations is consistent with a depolarized BC resting membrane potential (&gt; −60 mV; assuming voltage-dependence of AP shape is equal between unperturbed and dialyzed recordings). We postulate that previous recordings showing mostly depolarizing spikelets in cerebellar MLIs were due to either hyperpolarized holding potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcami, 2018</xref>) or an intrinsic difference in the amplitude of the AHP recorded from brain slices prepared from P11-13 rats.</p><p>Consistent with a net inhibitory action, we showed that FF recruitment of spikelets narrows the half-width of concomitant EPSPs and dampens their temporal summation. However, because the spikelets comprised a significant depolarizing component, perhaps due to the strong average CC (9.5 ± 1%; n = 41 pairs with CC &gt;2.3%), we also examined their ability to enhance EPSP depolarization. When stimulating PFs within the dendritic tree of BCs, inward current components of spikelets were not reliably detectable. Nevertheless, we found that the transient excitatory drive of spikelets significantly increased the peak amplitude of the compound synaptic potential when both signals were coincident (within a 4–6 ms window). Thus, unlike cFFI, electrical feed-forward modulation (eFFM) shortens the temporal window for EPSP-spike coupling, thus improving spike precision, while simultaneously enhancing spike probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The degree of such temporal contrast enhancement could be enhanced by cFFI or regulated by factors that adjust presynaptic spike shape, in particular the relative size of the AHP, and thus regulate the temporal balance of excitation and inhibition. We observed that despite the net inhibitory drive of BC spikelets, they also show a prominent brief inward (depolarizing) current component. This depolarizing component of the spikelet effectively provides FF excitation and is thus capable of synchronizing electrically coupled interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>), whereas the hyperpolarization component could generate low-frequency resonance in a resting state of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>) and/or desynchronize network activity upon synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vervaeke et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here we did not examine the combined contribution of cFFI and eFFI, as its true contribution requires an accurate estimate of the GABAR reversal potential, which has not been performed in mature MLIs. Moreover, differential recruitment of cFFI and eFFI in MLIs under physiological spatio-temporal PF activation will require future experiments in awake animals. Nevertheless, we found that BCs are more likely to transmit spikelets than chemical inhibition to their neighbors (58 versus 41%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which could account for the narrowed excitatory responses of BCs versus SCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2012</xref>).

This robust recruitment can be accounted for by three factors: (1) overlap of MLI dendritic trees in order to more likely receive common synaptic input (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), (2) a resting membrane potential close to threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), and (3) a strong enough CC, sufficient to transmit detectable spikelets (&gt;2.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mean CC was 9.5%, similar to the 12% found in Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This high degree of electrical connectivity can provide a global network mechanism spanning &gt;100 µm in the sagittal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>) for generating a FF modulation of PC spiking patterns through synchronous inhibition (<italic>i.e.</italic>, excitation of MLIs) followed by a rapid disinhibition (<italic>i.e.</italic>, MLI self-inhibition). In support of the sagittal propagation of spikelets, we find no correlation in CC over intersomatic distances up to 60 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, in vitro experiments revealed that electrical connectivity in the MLI population increases convergence from MLIs to PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the lateral spread of PF EPSPs through electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as previously observed in Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vervaeke et al., 2012</xref>), along with spikelet transmission, would also contribute to increasing the effective convergence between MLI and PC.</p><p>In one of the few studies examining the activity of BCs and PCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blot et al., 2016</xref>), a biphasic correlogram suggested an initial excitation of PCs followed by a brief (8 ms) inhibition of PC firing. Recent double-patch recordings in vivo show that even a single deep MLI (likely BC) can drive detectable inhibition of PC firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlt and Häusser, 2020</xref>). This very narrow and powerful inhibition could indeed be the result of precisely synchronized BC activity followed by self-inhibition, both mediated by eFFM. Such a network-wide synchronization would be less efficient via chemical inhibition, which has no depolarizing component and would be more variable from trial to trial due to the quantal properties of chemical transmission. Interestingly, voltage-clamp recordings in vivo showed that BC EPSCs are much faster than either SC or PC EPSCs in response to air puffs to the whisker pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with the presence of electrical synapses, and perhaps explaining the predominant inhibition of PC firing in response to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, eFFM could ensure an enhanced and brief BC network recruitment necessary for precise refinement of PC firing patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications of eFFM in fine-tuning cerebellar-dependent motor behaviors</title><p>Whisker movement kinematics can be both encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and driven by precise PC firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>). This has been hypothesized to be due to millisecond synchrony of PC firing, which could be sculpted by inhibition from synchronously active BCs. Indeed, coherent MLI spiking is necessary to generate well-timed licking behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>). Synchronized PC activity can then precisely gate deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Özcan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>) to drive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Raman, 2018</xref>). Electrical synapses between BCs could provide a network-amplified, highly synchronous inhibition onto PCs along the parasagittal plane, despite complex spatio-temporal activation patterns of PFs. In turn, millisecond inhibition of PC firing by sensory stimuli can disinhibit cerebellar nuclei, which in turn drive motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Raman, 2018</xref>). Finally, in vivo evidence that BCs are involved in refining PC firing on the millisecond scale supports their important role in timing cerebellar cortical output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlt and Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blot et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore propose that eFFM could be an important mechanism to achieve robust, globally synchronous and precisely timed control of PC firing that in turn can efficiently drive cerebellar output from the deep nuclei.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> – male and female)</td><td>CB6F1</td><td>Mouse Genome Informatics</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5649749">MGI:5649749</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> – male and female)</td><td>CX36 KO, <break/>129 brown mice (129S1/SvImJ)</td><td>David Paul, Harvard University</td><td>Deans et al.

Peak amplitudes of synaptic responses recorded in voltage clamp or current clamp were measured as the difference between a baseline amplitude, estimated from 10 ms immediately preceding the stimulation artifact, and the mean amplitude over a 200 µs time window centered around the peak of the mean response. Due to the long-lasting nature of the after-hyperpolarization component of spikelets, the baseline subtracted peak amplitude of the inhibitory component was averaged over a time window of 3 ms, centered around the peak amplitude of the mean response. For the experiments in which we performed direct stimulation of neighboring MLIs, the lack of a synaptic delay required subtraction of the stimulus artifact, which we performed using a function in Neuromatic. In brief, the decaying inward component of the artifact was subtracted by first fitting an extrapolated double exponential function between the time of the peak of the averaged inward component of the artifact to just before the spikelet. The fitted function was then subtracted from all the traces. The remaining mean artifact, comprising the outward component and rising inward component of the mean artifact, were subtracted directly from all traces.</p><p>All traces displayed are averages of 20 to 30 sweeps unless otherwise noted.

Unidirectional CCs were calculated by dividing the average hyperpolarization in the non-injected cell (100 ms average) by the hyperpolarization value (100 ms average) recorded in the injected cell. Bidirectional CCs for a given BC-BC pair were calculated from the average of the two unidirectional CCs. Spikelet transmission was assessed by detecting postsynaptic inward currents in response to presynaptic AP firing since outward currents could arise from either spikelets and/or GABAergic currents. Inward current amplitudes were estimated from each sweep, following the baseline procedure described above, by averaging data points over a 200 µs window and occurring within a 2 ms window starting just after the time of the peak of the presynaptic AP. Inward current amplitudes were considered detectable if the amplitude distribution of peak inward currents was larger than a prestimulus amplitude distribution (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, p&lt;0.05), measured from a reflected time window identical to that used for peak amplitudes. If inward currents were not detected, then outward currents in the postsynaptic responses were used to infer the presence of a GABAergic synapse. However, when an electrical synapse was detected, the outward current in postsynaptic responses could be caused by a mix of electrical and chemical inputs. In that case, peak amplitudes of postsynaptic outward currents were compared at different holding membrane potentials of the postsynaptic cell (to change the electromotive force for GABAergic inputs), and/or before and after application of gabazine. The presence of a GABAergic synapse was inferred when the peak amplitude distributions of outward currents in these different conditions were significantly different from each other. When an electrical connection was present, bias current in the presynaptic cell was manually adjusted, to compensate for passive flow of different holding currents from the postsynaptic cell.</p><p>To calculate the error in our estimate of the frequency of observing electrical and chemical synapses in paired recordings, we first computed the observed frequencies from our data set (electrical: f<sub>e</sub> = n<sub>e</sub>/n<sub>pairs</sub> and for chemical: f<sub>c</sub> = n<sub>c</sub>/n<sub>unidirectional</sub>; where n<sub>e</sub> and n<sub>c</sub> are the number of bidirectional electrical and unidirectional chemical synapses, respectively). We assumed the frequency distributions could be described by binomial statistics, and therefore calculated a standard deviation (SD = f*(1-f)) and a standard error (SEM = SD/√n).

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors describe a mechanism in the cerebellar cortex by which electrical coupling of inhibitory interneurons produces a specialized feedforward motif that enhances temporal summation at very short time intervals while shortening the window of integration by inhibiting temporal summation outside this brief window. The important conclusion of this work is that the well-known rapid feedforward inhibition of Purkinje cells driven by parallel fiber activation has both a chemical component, and, via the BC network, an electrical component.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Feed-forward recruitment of electrical synapses enhances synchronous spiking in the mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please note the changes in our revision policy in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that some additional experiments would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below primarily address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were interested in the topic and the proposed mechanism. However, we noted several issues in our discussion that need to be more carefully addressed in the text because the data in our opinion was not definitive. As noted above, <italic>eLife</italic> policy at this time is not to ask for additional experiments if the manuscript can be revised to state only those conclusions that are well supported by the existing data. We focused our discussion on the 5 issues below that we intend as a guide to your revision. Please also address other points of discussion or clarification raised in the original reviews that are included below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Weak effects of KO/mefloquine. These effects were rather modest given that they are central to the proposed mechanism. The authors should discuss the possibility that ephaptic coupling could account for some component of the phenomenon, and the KO data need to be better integrated into the main text.</p><p>2) Comparison of GJs vs GABA in inhibiting the network.

Together, these combined mechanisms are proposed to support a globalize and temporally precise inhibition of Purkinje neurons that could enhance synchrony thought to be important for information transmission downstream. The manuscript presents a progression of experiments describing the phenomenology and mechanism of the electrical coupling of basket cells, including evidence that outward currents observed in BCs are mediated in part by gap junctions; the spatial relationship of stimulation and the observation of electrical spikelet mediated outward currents; analog effects on electrical transmission; relative prevalence of electrical and chemical inhibition; and finally, the effect of electrical coupling on temporal summation of EPSPs. The data are thought provoking and of high quality and contribute to an active literature on MLI organization and physiology.</p><p>That said, the study has some shortcomings, which should be addressable with mainly text clarifications or additional analyses. I recognize the impossibility of collecting new data in the short term, thus where new data suggested below are not obtainable, interpretations should be tempered and narrowed.</p><p>1) The primary takeaway is that for independent PF beams, BC networks can detect coincident excitation that will generate a global precise inhibition of downstream Purkinje neurons. For this to be true, the temporal windowing contrast enhancement effect shown in Figure 6 needs to be robust to the presence of chemical inhibition. To my read, gabazine was present, leaving this uncertainty unresolved. Superimposed chemical and electrical inhibition could have predictable or unpredictable effects on the network level phenomenon reported here, raising the importance of empirical data in this light. For instance, Figure 3 shows that membrane potential of the presynaptic partner in an electrical pair affects electrical transmission. If effective GABAergic inhibition caused hyperpolarization of the presynaptic partner the magnitude of electrical inhibition would be expected to be reduced. Of course, this prediction may not pan out, but the main point is that it is difficult to predict how robust the phenomena reported here are to a full suite of intact circuit mechanisms.</p><p>2) The identification of gap junctions as mediating the outward currents measured is surprisingly weak. In Figure 1 they show that the outward current is unlikely mediated by unclamped K currents from direct stimulation, since it is robust to Cs internal and moreover the gap junctional antagonist mefloquine reduces the magnitude and frequency of observing these currents. However, a very important dataset is relegated to a supplementary figure that is in turn poorly integrated into the findings, specifically, experiments performed in Cx-36 knockouts shown in Figure 2. Although the title of the figure (S3) is 'Outward currents are smaller in SCs than BCs' the main text refers to the figure in the context of testing for the presence of outward currents in Cx-36 knockouts. The data are a bit of a mess with different age ranges used, precluding a clean interpretation. The data show that the amplitude of the outward currents recorded in Cx-36KO mice at P90-150 are about the amplitude as those recorded in wildtypes at P30-60 (the range used in the rest of the paper). There is a clear decrement in the amplitude of the putative electrical inhibition between wildtype and knockouts at a given age range, however, supporting the conclusion that this is gap-junction mediated. Given the extensive literature on ephaptic signaling in this part of the molecular layer, some caution is warranted in interpreting these as a purely jap-junctional mediated mechanism. Together, the mixing of experimental conditions and the persistence of the outward current in the knockouts seems to undermine one of the main takeaways of the study, sowing confusion and doubt. The authors should make some effort at better explaining and integrating this dataset into the main part of the study.</p><p>3) I have no reason to doubt the authors on the description of the inward and outward currents shown in Figure 1, or their sensitivity and insensitivity to blockade by receptor blockers, but the results as presented are very qualitative. Please report analyses in the text. For example, &quot;Bath application of 10 μm .… NBQX eliminated both the EPSC and subsequent outward current (n = 6/6 experiments) should provide amplitude info +/- drug, as should the gabazine experiment before that.</p><p>4) Figure 3 data presents an interesting experiment testing how RMP of one or the other MLI in a coupled pair influences the spikelet polarity. They identify CC with paired recordings and see that the membrane potential of the presynaptic cell has a strong effect on the spikelet waveform but not vice versa. Some confusion in the exposition: The example in B shows bidirectional coupling but they then focus in unidirectional coupling. It is unclear if the cells used in D-F are unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled or whether the holding potential manipulations of the 'pre and post' synaptic cells are filtered into the other. This overall raises the question of whether the correlations they show in H are based solely on the membrane potential of the presynaptic cell or on the differential membrane potentials between the two coupled cells. This could be clarified with edits.</p><p>5) For data shown in Figure 4, please report the number of cases where chemical inhibition was distinguished with pharmacology vs driving force. Also, I am missing how the probability distributions of chemical and electrical connections are compared and quantified. The results report that the probability of bidirectional transmission of spikelets was 0.52 +/- 0.06 (31/60 pairs). What does the error here represent? Similar with the GABAergic synapse: 0.40 +/- 0.05% (34/86 pairs). Finally, these probability distributions are compared with an unpaired t-test and shown to be not significantly different, but I am having difficulty following the mechanics of this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study from the DiGrigorio lab, electrical synapses within the basket cell (BC) network were examined for their capacity to drive precisely timed activity, and thus inhibition of Purkinje cells. The most interesting conclusions are contained in Figure 5, which shows that narrow band synaptic activation of BCs can drive excitation of neighboring BCs with a temporal precision exceeding that of conventional EPSPs. The basis for this precision is that the excitation comes by way of spikelets and each spikelet is curtailed by the potent electrotonic spread of spike afterhyperpolarizations. An important conclusion then is that the well-known rapid feedforward inhibition of Purkinje cells driven by parallel fiber activation has both a chemical component, and, via the BC network, an electrical component. Thus, the authors coin the acronym eFFM, electrical feedforward modulation. This is good quality electrophysiology from a top lab, so I no major technical concerns. I do feel that apart from the above, the majority of the work is demonstrating rather incremental or expected things. For example, the generation of postsynaptic inhibition through the spikelet waveform is well described elsewhere. Also, I am not so convinced by the RMP estimate.</p><p>The use of the ratio of inward to outward current to guesstimate prejunctional resting membrane potential seems not very strong. This ratio is affected by other things besides RMP, for example: during the whole cell recording there can be washout of currents that underlie AHPs, there may be alterations in junctional conductance (which will filter the fast inward current more than the slow outward current). Indeed for the direct stim experiments, the slope of the graph in 5H is nearly twice that of the -60 mV graph. Do you really think the RMP is nearly -50 mV? If the prejunctional cell population is firing chronically, how would that impact this estimate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this report, Hoehne et al., examine a novel type of feedforward inhibition mediated by an electrically coupled interneuron network in the cerebellum. They find that basket cells, a type of molecular layer interneuron, show curtailed synaptic excitation due to the offsetting effect of an after-hyperpolarization of a shared spikelet, generated in a neighboring electrically coupled basket cell. Interestingly, the depolarizing phase of the spikelet can cause increased firing in the postsynaptic cell. The combination of these opposing effects producing a type of contrast enhancement. Overall, this is an elegant, well-executed study. It is important for two reasons. First, the uniqueness of the underlying mechanism of electrical feedforward inhibition (FFI) whose influence differs from that mediated by chemical connections. Second, molecular layer inhibition is an important feature for organizing the output of the cerebellum, thus, contrast enhancement as described in this report could have a substantial effect on information coding in the cerebellum's circuits. The authors should consider revising their manuscript in several places to improve clarity and increase the impact of their work. These criticisms do not take away from overall enthusiasm.</p><p>1) The authors argue that electrical coupling is mediated by gap junctions but the effects of Cx36 knockout are very limited (e.g., 25% reduction in the frequency of observing the after-hyperpolarization of the coupled spikelet). The Marty group showed that MLI electrical coupling was absent in Cx36 KO mice so this is a very important caveat to the interpretation of their results. Did the authors consider the effects of Cx36 KO on temporal summation or on contrast enhancement? The authors should elaborate on the possibility of developmental compensation or alternative mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon in the Discussion section (ephaptic coupling?). Lastly, the presentation of the Cx36 data seems out of place in the Results section. Perhaps this was due to the lack of explanation in their methodology (e.g., 'coupled pairs' aren't well explained at first; only later in the manuscript was this described as recording from two basket cells at once).</p><p>2) The authors attempt to compare the prevalence of electrical vs chemical FFI is confusing. Why not simply state the rate of identifying electrically and chemically connected pairs? Then report the rate of spikelet coupling (which seems to be higher than the rate identified by long, hyperpolarizing pulses). Again, could spikelet coupling reflect a different mechanism? Last, is the prevalence of electrical vs chemical FFI best described by the rate of electrically and chemically connected pairs of basket cells?</p><p>3) Can the authors always be sure the presynaptic coupled neuron is a basket cell? It looks like the stimulating pipette is place throughout the molecular layer where stellate cells (and their neurites) also reside.</p><p>4) Could temperature-dependent effects on spike width and after-hyperpolarization duration contribute to differences with results from the Marty group (i.e., the prominent depolarization noted in their report)? This may also be true for the resting membrane potential in the presynaptic cell which the authors clearly show affects the polarity of influence.</p><p>5) EPSP half-widths in 5B and 5D seem to be different (responses appear much more prolonged in 5B). Does this mean that many responses in 5D in the LS condition have coupled spikelets (perhaps too small to resolve as outward currents but still large enough to effect EPSP duration)? How does this affect the interpretation of their results?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57344.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Weak effects of KO/mefloquine.

In brief, the large amplitude of BC spikelet currents is not compatible with the direct ephaptic currents generated between BC terminals and PC axon initial segments (Blot et al., 2016). Nor are they compatible with the sodium channel current evoked by ephaptic coupling between PC axons, since our spikelets are insensitive to internal QX314 and alterations in postsynaptic membrane potentials (Han and Regehr, 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comparison of GJs vs GABA in inhibiting the network.

We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion section to highlight the limitations of our ability to assign a specific physiological role.

In the first submission there was an error in our spreadsheet, and upon correction, the higher frequency of electrical synapses is actually statistically significant.

Indeed, a proper exploration of this would require experiments to be performed in a fully intact circuit (in vivo), where physiological GC activity might differentially recruit electrical FFI or chemical FFI. We have now pointed out these shortcomings of our study and indicate that future experiments would be required to dissect the true relative contribution. Even in vitro, the precise dissection is challenging due to the uncertainty in reversal potential for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p><p>In subsection “Electrical synapse-mediated spikelets dynamically modulate BC EPSP-spike coupling”, we added the following text:</p><p>“Here we did not examine the combined contribution of cFFI and eFFI, as its true contribution requires an accurate estimate of the GABAR reversal potential, which has not been performed in mature MLIs. Moreover, differential recruitment of cFFI and eFFI in MLIs under physiological spatial temporal PF activation will require future experiments in awake animals. Nevertheless, we found that BCs are more likely to transmit spikelets than chemical inhibition to their neighbors (58 versus 40 %, Figure 6), which could account for the narrowed excitatory responses of BCs versus SCs in vivo (Chu et al., 2012). Recent in vivo findings show that BC spikes have a stronger influence on PC spiking than SCs (Arlt and Häusser, 2020), implying that the specific timing of BCs will strongly influence PC output.”</p><p>We also highlighted the important difference between chemical inhibition and electrical synapses: namely the depolarizing – synchronizing component, and the electrical propagation within the BC network, which are likely to entrain a greater fraction of BCs than chemical inhibition alone.</p><p>In subsection “Electrical synapse-mediated spikelets dynamically modulate BC EPSP-spike coupling”, we added the following text:</p><p>“Nevertheless, we found that the transient excitatory drive of spikelets significantly increased the peak amplitude of the compound synaptic potential when both signals were coincident (within a 4-6 ms window). Thus, unlike cFFI, electrical feed-forward modulation (eFFM) can shorten the temporal window for EPSP-spike coupling, thus improving spike precision, while simultaneously enhancing spike probability (Figure 8).”</p><p>In subsection “Electrical connectivity in the cerebellar cortex is tuned for rapid output synchrony”, we added the following text:</p><p>“This high degree of electrical connectivity can provide a global network mechanism spanning &gt; 100 µm in the sagittal plane (Rieubland et al., 2014) for generating a FF modulation of PC spiking patterns through synchronous inhibition (i.e., excitation of MLIs) followed by a rapid disinhibition (i.e., MLI self-inhibition). It should be noted that chemical inhibition alone does not propagate within the network, but spikelet-mediated inhibition does.”</p><p>We also would like to point out to the reviewer that it seems likely that the concurrence of both chemical inhibition and action potentials within the presynaptic cell would simply amplify the presynaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn is transmitted as inhibition to the electrically coupled receiving cell. Alternatively, if chemical inhibition is transmitted to both the pre and postsynaptic cell, then indeed the hyperpolarizing component of the transmitted spikelet would be occluded, but the receiving cell would still experience inhibition. Nevertheless, the most important difference of electrical (spikelet) and chemical inhibition, is that the spikelet inhibition will be coupled to a depolarizing component, which will be increased under hyperpolarized conditions of the presynaptic cell (new Figure 5), and will be very rapidly transmitted, indeed faster than the synaptic delay for inhibition. Thus, in all cases, the depolarizing component will be transmitted to the postsynaptic cell. In this light, the temporal contrast enhancement figure provides important and physiologically relevant intuition as to how brief BC synchrony can be generated, with or without additional chemical inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of gap junctions as mediating the outward currents measured is surprisingly weak.

To correct this, we moved the Cx36 KO data from a supplementary figure to a main figure (now Figure 2), and now only show age-matched comparisons, which highlight the 3-fold reduction in outward current in Cx36 mice. We previously misstated the Cx36 reduction as only two-fold, rather than three-fold.</p><p>3) We also now describe the strong correlation between coupling coefficient and spikelet amplitude in a main figure (new Figure 4). This result shows that the larger the coupling coefficient, the larger the spikelets. They also further support a gap junction origin of the spikelet transmission between BCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a clear decrement in the amplitude of the putative electrical inhibition between wildtype and knockouts at a given age range, however, supporting the conclusion that this is gap-junction mediated.

Ephaptic transmission has been shown to involve different mechanisms.</p><p>In Blot et al., 2014, BC-PC ephaptic transmission is thought to occur between the axon terminal structures, pinceau, and the axon initial segment of PCs. Both the capacitive and K-currents generate a local field that sufficiently hyperpolarizes the AIS membrane potential and reduces the probability of PC spiking. Their simulations suggest that the ephaptic-mediated hyperpolarization is likely around ~ 1 µV at the somata, and thus undetectable. Thus, the large mV changes we observe between two BCs seem incompatible with such a coupling, as it would likely have to be between two axon terminals or crossings between BC dendrites.</p><p>In contrast, Han et al., 2018 measure ephaptic currents in PC-PC pairs that are 10's of pA, but are due to regenerative activation of local AIS sodium conductances in the post-PC, as they are blocked by intracellular perfusion of QX314 (sodium channel antagonist), and eliminated by postPC hyperpolarization to -70 mV (Figure 4). In the new Figure 5 we show that the amplitude of the spikelet is insensitive to postsynaptic manipulation in paired recordings of BC-BC pairs. Moreover, all the outward current experiments in Figure 1 were performed in the presence of QX-314. Kim et al. also nicely showed that the extracellular field was only generated within 20 µm of the high conductance density region of the AIS (Figure 5G), and not the soma or axon. Thus, the spikelets that we report, or even the 30% remaining unblocked current (in the presence of mefloquine or Cx36 KO), are unlikely mediated by this sodium current-dependent ephaptic mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Together, the mixing of experimental conditions and the persistence of the outward current in the knockouts seems to undermine one of the main takeaways of the study, sowing confusion and doubt.

In addition to changes in the Results section and figures (see above), we also modified the discussion to clearly state the reasons for our conclusion, and the possibility of other interpretations (ephaptic). See Discussion section:</p><p>“Extracellular stimulation of PFs in parasagittal slices in the presence of gabazine produced outward currents of 10 pA in BCs and less than 3 pA in SCs (Figure 1 and Figure 2). We performed several experiments whose results were consistent with spikelet transmission through gap junctions as the origin of GABAergic-independent outward currents: (1) sub-saturating concentrations (20 µM) of the gap junction blocker mefloquine blocked the outward current by 70 %, as expected for a current entirely mediated by gap junctions (Cruikshank et al., 2004). (2) We observed a 3-fold reduction in peak amplitude of the outward current in Cx36 KO mice (Figure 2). The incomplete knockdown could be due to genetic compensation by Cx45, which is known to also be expressed in MLIs (Van Der Giessen et al., 2006). Nevertheless, we only observed one of five BC-BC pairs in Cx36 KO mice that showed bidirectional spikelets and a CC greater than 2 % (the average CC correlated with the observation of a spikelet, Figure 2A), as opposed to the nearly 60 % BC-BC pairs (Figure 6C). (3) To confirm that the outward currents were mediated by spikelets, we showed that stimulation of PFs outside the dendritic field of the recorded cell and direct stimulation of MLIs in NBQX both evoked currents with a rapid inward component and an outward component similar to that following EPSCs. (4) These extracellularly-evoked spikelets were very similar to those evoked by single APs propagating between electrically coupled BC pairs. And finally, (5) the strength of electrical coupling between two BCs, estimated from 400 ms step depolarizations, was positively correlated with spikelet amplitude (Figure 4), confirming that spikelets were mediated by gap junctions.</p><p>Electrical coupling between neurons has also been shown to be mediated without a gap junction or chemical synapse, and is referred to as ephaptic coupling. We cannot directly rule out that the remaining spikelet currents in mefloquine or in Cx36 KOs could result from transmission of an AP between closely juxtaposed dendrites or axons. BC-PC ephaptic transmission is thought to occur between the axon terminal of BCs (pinceau) and the axon initial segment of PCs. Both the capacitive and K-currents generate a local field that sufficiently hyperpolarizes the AIS membrane potential and reduces the probability of PC spiking (Blot and Barbour, 2014). In this study, simulations suggest that the ephaptic-mediated hyperpolarization is likely around ~ 1 µV at the somata, and thus unlikely to account for the large mV changes we observe between two BCs. In contrast, ephaptic currents in PC-PC pairs are 10's of pA, but are due to regenerative activation of local AIS sodium conductances in the post-PC, which is eliminated by post-PC hyperpolarization to -70 mV (Han et al., 2018). We showed that the synapse-evoked outward current was insensitive to 1 mM of the sodium channel blocker QX-314 (Figure 1, see Materials and methods section); and, in BC-BC paired recordings, the amplitude of the spikelet is insensitive to postsynaptic manipulation of membrane potential (Figure 5). Both results are inconsistent with a sodium dependent ephaptic mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I have no reason to doubt the authors on the description of the inward and outward currents shown in Figure 1, or their sensitivity and insensitivity to blockade by receptor blockers, but the results as presented are very qualitative.

They identify CC with paired recordings and see that the membrane potential of the presynaptic cell has a strong effect on the spikelet waveform but not vice versa. Some confusion in the exposition: The example in B shows bidirectional coupling but they then focus in unidirectional coupling. It is unclear if the cells used in D-F are unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled or whether the holding potential manipulations of the 'pre and post' synaptic cells are filtered into the other. This overall raises the question of whether the correlations they show in H are based solely on the membrane potential of the presynaptic cell or on the differential membrane potentials between the two coupled cells. This could be clarified with edits.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the text and in the methods that bidirectional coupling coefficients (CCs) are values that represent the average of the two unidirectional CCs. Unidirectional CCs are calculated from the ratio of the membrane potential in the receiving cell over the hyperpolarization amplitude of the cell in which the current injection was delivered.</p><p>Because current injections were made to maintain resting potentials in current clamp, and the voltage clamp circuit ensured a constant membrane potential, the resting membrane potentials were essentially decoupled, allowing for an accurate determination of the membrane potential dependence on the spikelet shape, without influencing the membrane potential of the electrically connected cell. In Figure 5E and F the receiving cell is held at -70mV, which might certainly influence the resting membrane potential of electrically-coupled neighbors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For data shown in Figure 4, please report the number of cases where chemical inhibition was distinguished with pharmacology vs driving force.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We have now added a supplementary table indicating the number of unidirectional connections tested for each method (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I am missing how the probability distributions of chemical and electrical connections are compared and quantified. The results report that the probability of bidirectional transmission of spikelets was 0.52 +/- 0.06 (31/60 pairs). What does the error here represent? Similar with the GABAergic synapse: 0.40 +/- 0.05% (34/86 pairs). Finally, these probability distributions are compared with an unpaired t-test and shown to be not significantly different, but I am having difficulty following the mechanics of this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps this was not well explained. The standard error we show is calculated from the standard deviation of a binomial distribution centered on the observed frequency of each connection type. Once having the SEM, we could perform a simple unpaired two-tailed t-test. This was originally briefly described in the figure legend, but now also described in the Materials and methods section: “To calculate the error in our estimate of the frequency of observing electrical and chemical synapses in paired recordings, we first computed the observed frequencies from our data set (electrical: f<sub>e</sub> = n<sub>e</sub>/n<sub>pairs</sub> and for chemical: f<sub>c</sub> = n<sub>c</sub>/n<sub>unidirectional connections</sub>). We assumed the frequency distributions could be described by binomial statistics, and therefore calculated a standard deviation (SD = f*(1-f)) and a standard error (SEM = SD/&lt;inline-graphic mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; mimetype=&quot;image&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image1.png&quot; /&gt;n). We performed similar error calculations for all observation frequencies (e.g. Figure 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The use of the ratio of inward to outward current to guesstimate prejunctional resting membrane potential seems not very strong. This ratio is affected by other things besides RMP, for example: during the whole cell recording there can be washout of currents that underlie AHPs, there may be alterations in junctional conductance (which will filter the fast inward current more than the slow outward current).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is possible that washout might alter the voltage-dependence of the AHP, and thus shift our calibration. The most likely candidate would be washout of calcium buffers that affect calciumdependent potassium conductances. However, we have included 1 mM EGTA in the pipette which approximates the concentration of the slow on-rate calcium binding protein parvalbumin. Nevertheless, the spikelets initiated from unperturbed cells have a large outward component consistent with a large presynaptic AHP, which is associated with APs initiated from resting membrane potentials much more depolarized than potassium current reversal potentials. Moreover, the fact that we reliably stimulate synapse-evoked spikes also suggests a depolarized resting membrane potential.</p><p>We now refer to the caveats of our membrane potential estimation in the discussion, and emphasize the bipolarity of the spikelets rather than the absolute value membrane potential, subsection “Electrical synapse-mediated spikelets dynamically modulate BC EPSP-spike coupling”:</p><p>“Comparison of spikelets evoked in an unperturbed, electrically coupled neighbor to those evoked in paired recordings with presynaptic membrane potential manipulations is consistent with a depolarized BC resting membrane potential (&gt; -60 mV; assuming voltage-dependence of AP shape is equal between unperturbed and dialyzed recordings).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed for the direct stim experiments, the slope of the graph in 5H is nearly twice that of the -60 mV graph. Do you really think the RMP is nearly -50 mV?</p></disp-quote><p>We also find this result to be striking. We now state that our data are consistent with a resting membrane potential more depolarized than -60 mV, provided that the voltage dependence of the spikelet shape is similar for whole-cell dialyzed and unperturbed cells, although previous studies also estimated resting membrane potentials to be more depolarized than -60 mV (Chavas and Marty, 2003).</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the Results section:</p><p>“Provided that the voltage-dependence of the shape of the presynaptic AP is similar in patchdialyzed and unperturbed cells, these data indicate that unpatched MLIs have a depolarized resting membrane potential of at least -60 mV (i.e. BCs could be more depolarized).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the prejunctional cell population is firing chronically, how would that impact this estimate?</p></disp-quote><p>Because we could perform stimulus aligned averages, the background spikelet activity did not generally affect our experiments. Indeed, there were one or two cells out of the over 100 recorded cells that were not analyzed due to high background spikelet activity. We have added this criterion to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The authors argue that electrical coupling is mediated by gap junctions but the effects of Cx36 knockout are very limited (e.g., 25% reduction in the frequency of observing the after-hyperpolarization of the coupled spikelet). The Marty group showed that MLI electrical coupling was absent in Cx36 KO mice so this is a very important caveat to the interpretation of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we were disappointed that the Cx36 KO mice did not completely eliminate spikelet transmission, although we did observe a 3-fold reduction of currents in age-matched controls. This was incorrectly described in the first manuscript as 2-fold. We also made several changes to figures and text to justify our conclusion despite the remaining currents. Please see response to comment number #2 of reviewer 1. In short, it is possible that because our animals are 3-4 months old, perhaps the remaining currents are mediated by another gap junction protein Cx45, also shown to be expressed in SCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors consider the effects of Cx36 KO on temporal summation or on contrast enhancement?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an ideal experiment. But because Cx36 did not eliminate electrical coupling, instead we compared temporal summation at sites with and without eFFM. We felt that under the circumstances this would be a cleaner approach. Moreover, we could select dendritic locations in which PF stimulation evoked EPSPs that did not evoke a spikelet, thus allowing us to precisely probe the effect of spikelets evoked at different times within the EPSP, which itself does</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should elaborate on the possibility of developmental compensation or alternative mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon in the Discussion (ephaptic coupling?).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Cx45 is expressed in MLIs and might underlie residual or compensatory spikelet transmission. Please see response to comment 2, reviewer 1 for full description of how we address this issue now in the manuscript, including the possibility of ephaptic coupling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the presentation of the Cx36 data seems out of place in the Results. Perhaps this was due to the lack of explanation in their methodology (e.g., 'coupled pairs' aren't well explained at first; only later in the manuscript was this described as recording from two basket cells at once).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion, we now show the Cx36 data in the main Figure 2 and more clearly introduce BC-BC paired recordings in the Results section:</p><p>“In order to confirm that extracellular stimulation indeed evoked a presynaptic AP which could then propagate across electrical synapses formed by gap junctions to produce a spikelet in the postsynaptic cell, we performed paired BC-BC recordings. Hyperpolarizing current pulses were used to confirm the presence and the strength of coupling coefficients (CCs; see Materials and methods section).”</p><p>We also changed “coupled pairs” to “electrically coupled cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors attempt to compare the prevalence of electrical vs chemical FFI is confusing. Why not simply state the rate of identifying electrically and chemically connected pairs?</p></disp-quote><p>We felt the use of “prevalence” was accurate, since it is often used to refer to the percentage of a population that is affected by a disease, and inherently also a frequency. But instead we replaced it with the words “more often” or “frequency” to avoid any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then report the rate of spikelet coupling (which seems to be higher than the rate identified by long, hyperpolarizing pulses).</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps our text was confusing, but the frequency of observing spikelets in BC-BC pairs is less than the detection of electrical coupling. We think this is for two reasons: (1) transient spikelet propagation through gap junctions are filtered more than the steady-state current components of long step depolarizations, and (2) some BC-BC pairs may not be directly connected, but connected through a third MLI. Nevertheless, we have added new panels to the new Figure 4 (D-F), which show a positive correlation between spikelet amplitude and coupling strength, as would be expected from being mediated by gap junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, could spikelet coupling reflect a different mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to reviewer 1 for a thorough discussion of this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, is the prevalence of electrical vs chemical FFI best described by the rate of electrically and chemically connected pairs of basket cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer use the word “prevalence,” but either use “more often” or “frequency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors always be sure the presynaptic coupled neuron is a basket cell? It looks like the stimulating pipette is place throughout the molecular layer where stellate cells (and their neurites) also reside.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the presynaptic cell could be a SC or a BC, but Rieubland show that electrical coupling of putative BC-SC paired recordings occurs at a much lower frequency (13% versus 61% putative BC-BC pairs) and have lower CC. We therefore refer to extracellularly evoked spikelets as coming from MLIs more generally rather than BCs. However, we do mention that more often than not, the spikelets are mediated by neighboring basket cells, based on the prominent electrical coupling and low probability of coupling between BCs and SCs (Rieubland et al., 2015).</p><p>In the Discussion section we updated the text:</p><p>“Our results indicate that low stimulation intensity of small PF beams leads to the recruitment of APs in electrically coupled MLIs that generate spikelets in the postsynaptic BCs (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), but more rarely and less prominently in SCs (Figure 2). Because of the low frequency (13 %) of BC-SC electrical coupling (Rieubland et al., 2014), we propose that eFFI is mostly provided by other BCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could temperature-dependent effects on spike width and after-hyperpolarization duration contribute to differences with results from the Marty group (i.e., the prominent depolarization noted in their report)? This may also be true for the resting membrane potential in the presynaptic cell which the authors clearly show affects the polarity of influence.</p></disp-quote><p>Alcami, 2018 show that there were no differences in spikelet shape if experiments are performed at 21 or 34 °C, so a temperature-dependence seems unlikely to account for the difference. However, as suggested by the reviewer, the most likely difference is due to the hyperpolarized holding potential (-70 mV in some cases), which we predict should have a small AHP. Interestingly, when they recorded a spikelet, the prominent outward current was reminiscent of our recordings (Alcami et al. 2013). Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that in P11-13 rats, the AHP is less prominent. We have added the following text to the Discussion section.</p><p>“Comparison of spikelets evoked in an unperturbed, electrically coupled neighbor to those evoked in paired recordings with presynaptic membrane potential manipulations is consistent with a depolarized BC resting membrane potential (&gt; -60 mV; assuming voltage-dependence of AP shape is equal between unperturbed and dialyzed recordings). We postulate that previous recordings showing mostly depolarizing spikelets in cerebellar MLIs were due to either hyperpolarized holding potentials (Alcami, 2018) or an intrinsic difference in the amplitude of the AHP recorded from brain</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) EPSP half-widths in 5B and 5D seem to be different (responses appear much more prolonged in 5B). Does this mean that many responses in 5D in the LS condition have coupled spikelets (perhaps too small to resolve as outward currents but still large enough to effect EPSP duration)? How does this affect the interpretation of their results?</p></disp-quote><p>The large distribution in EPSP decays is perhaps due to cable filtering when performing synaptic stimulation in different parts of the dendrite, similar to what we previously showed for stellate cells (Abrahamson et al., 2012.) However, it is also possible that BCs have different numbers of electrically coupled neighbors, which could decrease their input resistance (Alcami et al., 2013) and thus accelerate the decay of the EPSPs.</p><p>It seems unlikely that EPSCs without outward currents could have significantly altered half-widths, but we cannot strictly rule it out.</p><p>We have added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“The variability in the EPSC decay in response to low stimulation could be due to the variability in cable filtering when eliciting synapse stimulation in different locations within the dendrite, or the variability in the number of electrically coupled cells, which have been shown to decrease input resistance (Alcami and Marty, 2013). But we cannot rule out that a small spikelet may accelerate some EPSPs without showing an outward current. Nevertheless, recruiting an additional spikelet, on average, accelerated EPSP decays”</p></body></sub-article></article>
