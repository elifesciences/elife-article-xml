junctions. The nucleus also regulates endothelial cell behaviors, but it is unclear how the nucleus contributes to endothelial cell activities at the cell periphery. Here, we show that the nuclear-localized <underline>li</underline>nker of the <underline>n</underline>ucleoskeleton and <underline>c</underline>ytoskeleton (LINC) complex protein SUN1 regulates vascular sprouting and endothelial cell-cell junction morphology and function. Loss of murine endothelial <italic>Sun1</italic> impaired blood vessel formation and destabilized junctions, angiogenic sprouts formed but retracted in SUN1-depleted sprouts, and zebrafish vessels lacking Sun1b had aberrant junctions and defective cell-cell connections. At the cellular level, SUN1 stabilized endothelial cell-cell junctions, promoted junction function, and regulated contractility. Mechanistically, SUN1 depletion altered cell behaviors via the cytoskeleton without changing transcriptional profiles. Reduced peripheral microtubule density, fewer junction contacts, and increased catastrophes accompanied SUN1 loss, and microtubule depolymerization phenocopied effects on junctions. Depletion of GEF-H1, a microtubule-regulated Rho activator, or the LINC complex protein nesprin-1 rescued defective junctions of SUN1-depleted endothelial cells. Thus, endothelial SUN1 regulates peripheral cell-cell junctions from the nucleus via LINC complex-based microtubule interactions that affect peripheral microtubule dynamics and Rho-regulated contractility, and this long-range regulation is important for proper blood vessel sprouting and junction integrity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>nuclear LINC complex</kwd><kwd>SUN1</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>adherens junctions</kwd><kwd>blood vessels</kwd><kwd>GEF-H1</kwd><kwd>Nesprin-1</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Rho</kwd><kwd>contractility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Endothelial cell</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL139950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bautch</surname><given-names>Victoria L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL069768-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buglak</surname><given-names>Danielle B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19PRE34380887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buglak</surname><given-names>Danielle B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nuclear membrane protein SUN1 stabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions far from the nucleus via regulation of microtubule dynamics and Rho GEF-H1 signaling, revealing long-range cellular communication important for vascular development and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessels form and expand via sprouting angiogenesis, a dynamic process whereby endothelial cells migrate from pre-existing vessels to form new conduits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wacker and Gerhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kushner and Bautch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bautch and Caron, 2015</xref>). During angiogenesis, endothelial cell-cell junctions destabilize and rearrange to allow for repolarization and migration toward pro-angiogenic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Esser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dejana, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blum et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, the endothelial cell adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is required for vascular sprouting and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carmeliet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Montero-Balaguer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sauteur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szymborska and Gerhardt, 2018</xref>). As vessels mature, endothelial cell junctions stabilize and form a functional barrier that regulates egress of fluid and oxygen; barrier dysfunction leads to increased permeability and severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Claesson-Welsh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, regulation of endothelial cell junction stability is important developmentally and for vascular homeostasis.</p><p>Adherens junctions are key to integrating and regulating both external and internal cellular inputs from multiple sources, including the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ligon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dejana and Vestweber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu Taha and Schnittler, 2014</xref>). For example, increased actomyosin contractility destabilizes endothelial cell adherens junctions, and disorganized junctional actin accompanies VE-cadherin loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Huveneers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sauteur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2018</xref>). VE-cadherin loss also changes microtubule dynamics, and disruption of microtubule dynamics destabilizes junctions and barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Komarova et al., 2012</xref>). Coordination of inputs from the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons regulates endothelial cell barrier integrity and sprouting dynamics via small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birukova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mavria et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sehrawat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sehrawat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szymborska and Gerhardt, 2018</xref>). In particular, RhoA signaling is regulated by microtubules via GEF-H1, a RhoGEF that is inactive while bound to microtubules and activated upon release, leading to RhoA activation, increased actomyosin contractility, and changes to endothelial cell barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krendel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birukova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birkenfeld et al., 2008</xref>). However, how the endothelial cell nucleus affects these processes is poorly understood.</p><p>The nucleus is usually found far from the cell periphery and junctions, yet it is important for functions critical to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, such as polarity, migration, and mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tkachenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guilluy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Graham et al., 2018</xref>), and perturbations of some nuclear membrane proteins affect transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">May and Carroll, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carley et al., 2021</xref>). The <underline>li</underline>nker of the <underline>n</underline>ucleoskeleton and <underline>c</underline>ytoskeleton (LINC) complex is comprised of both SUN (<underline>S</underline>ad1p, <underline>UN</underline>C-84) and KASH (<underline>K</underline>larsicht, <underline>A</underline>NC-1, <underline>S</underline>yne/Nesprin <underline>H</underline>omology) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>) that function as a bridge between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, and also link through subnuclear lamin filaments to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Haque et al., 2006</xref>). SUN proteins localize to the inner nuclear membrane and bind KASH proteins, or nesprins, from their C-terminus and lamins at their N-terminus, thus providing a structural link from the nuclear cortex to the cellular cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Haque et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>). Nesprins are long spectrin-rich proteins localized to the outer nuclear envelope that bind SUN proteins via their C-terminus while N-terminally interacting indirectly with microtubules (via various motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin) and intermediate filaments (via plectins), and directly with actin via calponin homology domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ketema et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Meyerzon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fridolfsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>). Two mammalian SUN proteins are ubiquitously expressed, and based on functional consequences of SUN manipulations it has been posited that SUN1 regulates microtubule-based functions while SUN2 coordinates actin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). However, in vitro binding studies do not reveal a SUN-nesprin specificity to account for this bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostlund et al., 2009</xref>), so how complexes are assembled and sorted in cells is unclear. It is well established that the LINC complex integrates external inputs sensed by focal adhesions, such as substrate stiffness, to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carley et al., 2022</xref>), but how the LINC complex relays signals from the nucleus to the cell periphery is less understood.</p><p>The LINC complex functions in cultured endothelial cells, as knockdown (KD) of nesprin-3 leads to impaired endothelial polarity under flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>), while nesprin-2 and lamin A regulate proliferation and apoptosis in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Depletion of nesprin-1 alters nuclear tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chancellor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anno et al., 2012</xref>) and force application to isolated nuclei via nesprin-1 alters stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guilluy et al., 2014</xref>), while KD of nesprin-1 or nesprin-2 leads to reduced collective endothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chancellor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">King et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work showed compromised matrix adhesion and barrier function of cultured endothelial cells using a dominant negative KASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Denis et al., 2021</xref>). However, less is understood about the roles of the SUN proteins in endothelial cell function or how the LINC complex functions in vessels in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Salvador and Iruela-Arispe, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The LINC complex is required for viability in vivo.

A role for the LINC complex in mechanotransduction in vivo is suggested by findings that perturbations in mechanically active skeletal and cardiac muscle affect function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">van Ingen and Kirby, 2021</xref>). However, while global deletion of multiple LINC components that disrupt the entire complex highlight its importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carley et al., 2021</xref>), these studies do not reveal functions of individual LINC components in specific tissues. Whether the SUN proteins cell autonomously regulate the vascular endothelium, which is also mechanically active due to outward pressure and shear stress from blood flow, has not been explored.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> (lamin A/C) cause a premature aging syndrome linked to cardiovascular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capell and Collins, 2006</xref>).

We found that <italic>Sun1</italic> cell autonomously regulates blood vessel sprouting and junction properties in vivo, consistent with SUN1 regulating endothelial cell functions via adherens junction activity. In primary endothelial cells, nuclear SUN1 coordinates peripheral microtubule dynamics that in turn regulate peripheral RhoGEF activation and junction stability. Thus, nuclear SUN1 that resides far from cell junctions regulates cell-cell communication and blood vessel sprouting via a novel microtubule-based integration pathway from the nucleus to the cell periphery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The nuclear LINC protein SUN1 regulates vascular development</title><p>The LINC complex is important for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chancellor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">King et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Denis et al., 2021</xref>), and blood vessel formation involves extensive endothelial cell migration; thus, we hypothesized that the LINC complex regulates angiogenic sprouting.

To determine how SUN1 functionally regulates endothelial junctions, adherens junctions were disassembled via Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation, then reformed upon chelator removal. Junctions were measured using line scans of VE-cadherin intensity along the cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), such that junctions with a linear VE-cadherin signal (stable) had a higher value than those with more serrated patterns (destabilized). No significant difference between SUN1 KD and control junctions was seen at early times post-washout, indicating that SUN1 depletion does not affect adherens junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). However, later times post-washout revealed a significant increase in serrated junctions and gaps between endothelial cells in SUN1 KD monolayers relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Consistent with these findings, SUN1 KD endothelial cells also had increased VE-cadherin internalization at steady state, consistent with actively remodeling junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

RhoA signaling and barrier function in endothelial cells is regulated by the microtubule-associated RhoGEF, GEF-H1, which is inactive while bound to microtubules and peaks in activation following microtubule depolymerization and release into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krendel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birukova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birkenfeld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azoitei et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that the impaired microtubule dynamics and Rho-dependent hypercontractility observed following SUN1 depletion were linked via GEF-H1. We first examined Rho activation via pulldowns and found increased activated Rho with SUN1 silencing that was abrogated when GEF-H1 was also depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that GEF-H1 signaling is upstream of elevated RhoA activation in SUN1-depleted cells. Consistent with this idea, GEF-H1 strongly localized to peripheral microtubules in control cells but was significantly less localized and more diffuse in the cytosol in SUN1-depleted endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>), suggesting its release from microtubules. Furthermore, depletion of GEF-H1 in endothelial cells that were also depleted for SUN1 rescued the destabilized cell-cell junctions and loss of junction integrity observed with SUN1 KD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>), showing that GEF-H1 is required to transmit the effects of SUN1 depletion to endothelial cell junctions. Interestingly, depletion of GEF-H1 was not sufficient to rescue the loss of microtubule density at the periphery in SUN1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>), indicating that GEF-H1 acts downstream of changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton in SUN1-depleted cells.

Here, we show for the first time that the nuclear LINC complex protein SUN1 regulates angiogenic sprouting and endothelial cell-cell junction integrity via long-distance regulation in vivo, and that these effects go through the microtubule cytoskeleton to regulate microtubule dynamics and actomyosin contractility. Our data is consistent with a model in which SUN1 stabilizes peripheral microtubules that coordinate activity of the microtubule-associated Rho exchange factor GEF-H1. GEF-H1 becomes activated to stimulate Rho signaling upon release from microtubules, and we posit that peripheral microtubules normally regulate local GEF-H1 activity to maintain appropriate microtubule-junction interactions and actomyosin contractility in endothelial cells, leading to cell-cell junctions that remodel to support angiogenic sprouting and maintain vessel barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Loss of SUN1 reduces peripheral microtubules, resulting in GEF-H1 over-activation, elevated RhoA signaling, and increased contractility, leading to destabilized endothelial cell adherens junctions that impair blood vessel formation and function in fish and mice. The LINC complex is further implicated in endothelial junction regulation by our finding that the KASH protein nesprin-1 is required for the effects of SUN1 loss on microtubules, GEF-H1, and junction integrity. Thus, we describe a specific role for SUN1 as a critical mediator of communication between the endothelial cell nucleus and the cell periphery via microtubule regulation of GEF-H1. We investigated the role of SUN1 in endothelial cell and vascular function; however, the molecular machinery whereby SUN1 regulates cell junctions is not specific to endothelial cells. Thus, SUN1 likely influences cell-cell junctions via similar mechanisms in other cell and tissue types.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed role of SUN1 in angiogenic sprouting and endothelial cell junction stabilization.</title><p>Model describing proposed role of SUN1 in angiogenic sprouting and endothelial cell junction stabilization.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83652-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We show that the LINC complex protein SUN1 is required for endothelial adherens junction stabilization and proper blood vessel formation and function in vivo.

This may be due to partial redundancy with SUN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) preventing more profound vascular effects. However, the significant vascular defects in vessels lacking <italic>Sun1</italic> reveal non-redundant functions for SUN1 in vascular development. We show that depletion of SUN1 leads to impaired junction morphology and integrity as measured by increased biotin matrix labeling and decreased impedance in cultured cells and increased dextran leak in the postnatal retina. Because junction morphology and integrity are integral to maintenance of the endothelial barrier, these findings suggest that SUN1 depletion leads to impaired barrier function.

Live image analysis of active vessel sprouting showed that SUN1 regulates filopodia dynamics and anastomosis in zebrafish and sprout dynamics in mammalian endothelial cell sprouts, and these vessels also had abnormal junctions in the absence of SUN1. Altered sprout dynamics are found in other scenarios where VE-cadherin is absent or abnormal such as Wnt inhibition, loss of VE-cadherin, PI3-kinase inhibition, and excess centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sauteur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sauteur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kushner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hübner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buglak et al., 2020</xref>).

The importance of the LINC complex in transducing signals from the cell periphery and outside the cell to the nucleus to affect nuclear envelope properties and gene transcription is well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carley et al., 2022</xref>), but how information goes from the nucleus to the cell periphery is less well understood. The LINC complex is important in nucleus-to-cytoplasm communication, but most published studies assess manipulations that affect the LINC complex globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Denis et al., 2021</xref>), and how individual components contribute is not well understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ueda et al., 2022</xref>, found that SUN1 regulates focal adhesion maturation in non-endothelial cells in vitro via effects on the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ueda et al., 2022</xref>), and we found that SUN1 regulates endothelial cell-cell junctions through microtubules, indicating that SUN1 is important for signaling from the nucleus to the cell periphery by regulating cytoskeletal organization at several levels. Since LINC complex manipulations are reported to affect focal adhesions and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">King et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Denis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ueda et al., 2022</xref>), it is likely that vessel dysfunction following SUN1 manipulation is complex. However, SUN1 is thought to be important in microtubule-associated LINC complex functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), and disruption of microtubules or their dynamics destabilizes adherens junctions in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Komarova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vasileva and Citi, 2018</xref>). Our data show that SUN1 depletion impairs both microtubule dynamics and microtubule localization. Specifically, elevated rates of microtubule catastrophe and shrinkage absent changes in growth rate likely account for reduced peripheral microtubule density and microtubule-junction contacts. Endothelial junction destabilization was phenocopied by microtubule depolymerization, consistent with our model that the influence of SUN1 on microtubule dynamics and localization is important for the stabilization of cell junctions.</p><p>Here, we show that SUN1 regulates cell junctions via the microtubule-regulated Rho activator GEF-H1. GEF-H1 specifically modulates RhoA signaling at endothelial cell adherens junctions to influence VE-cadherin internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Juettner et al., 2019</xref>). Microtubule depolymerization releases GEF-H1 to activate RhoA signaling and elevate actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krendel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birkenfeld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azoitei et al., 2019</xref>) in non-endothelial cells, while direct manipulation of GEF-H1 via depletion or blockade attenuates agonist-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birukova et al., 2006</xref>). Our work revealed that peripheral GEF-H1 localization was more diffuse following endothelial SUN1 silencing, suggesting its activation with SUN1 loss, and Rho-kinase inhibition or GEF-H1 depletion rescued SUN1 depletion-induced RhoA activation and destabilization of endothelial cell junctions. These findings support that altered microtubule dynamics downstream of SUN1 depletion promote the release and activation of peripheral GEF-H1, and this activation destabilizes cell junctions and likely affects vascular barrier function.</p><p>Thus, SUN1 regulation of microtubule dynamics is linked to its regulation of junction stability, although exactly how SUN1 influences microtubule dynamics and function is unclear. SUN1 resides in the nuclear envelope and alters gene transcription in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">May and Carroll, 2018</xref>). Our transcriptional analysis of endothelial cells under flow did not reveal significant transcriptome changes with SUN1 depletion, indicating that SUN1 regulation of endothelial junctions occurs via its role in LINC complex interactions with the cytoskeleton. Nesprin-1, a KASH protein that functions in LINC complex-cytoskeletal interactions, is shown here to mediate the effects of SUN1 loss on endothelial cell junctions, including junction morphology and function and peripheral microtubule density, suggesting that SUN1 normally sequesters nesprin-1 to prevent formation of ectopic complexes. SUN1 may normally prevent abnormal or unstable nesprin-1 LINC complexes that promote microtubule depolymerization, and SUN1 loss allows these complexes to form. SUN1 may compete for nesprin-1 binding with other nuclear envelope proteins that interact with nesprin-1, such as SUN2 or nesprin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Taranum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). This idea is consistent with the finding that SUN1 antagonizes SUN2-based LINC complexes that promote RhoA activity in HeLa cells, although microtubule localization changes were not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thakar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that SUN1 regulates endothelial cell junction integrity and blood vessel sprouting has implications for diseases associated with aging, as vascular defects underlie most cardiovascular disease.

Endothelial cells also accumulate SUN1 in HGPS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2019</xref>), and loss of <italic>Sun1</italic> partially rescues progeria phenotypes in mouse models and patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, nuclear membrane perturbations affecting SUN1 cause disease, and here we find that nuclear SUN1 regulates microtubules to affect both the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. These effects are transmitted to endothelial cell-cell junctions far from the site of SUN1 localization to influence endothelial cell behaviors, blood vessel sprouting, and barrier function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all imaging was performed as follows: confocal images were acquired with an Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope and camera (Fluoview FV3000, IX83) using 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm lasers and a UPlanSApo 40× silicone-immersion objective (NA 1.25), UPlanSApo 60× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40), or UPlanSApo 100× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40).

Vascular density was measured by imaging a 350 µm × 350 µm ROI at the vascular edge. Fiji was used to threshold images, and the vessel area was normalized to the area of the ROI (n=4 ROI/retina, chosen at 2 arteries and 2 veins). Junctions were measured by taking the ratio of the mean intensity of the junction and the mean intensity of the area immediately adjacent to the junction. Mean intensity was measured via line scans in Fiji. Sixteen junctions/retina were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Retina blood vessel permeability</title><p>Tamoxifen-injected mice were anesthetized at P7 in isoflurane for 5 min.

We advise you to consider these points seriously.</p><p>I believe the authors can revise the manuscript successfully given their expertise, but please provide the reasons for not implementing the suggested changes if necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Buglak et al. describe a role for the nuclear envelope protein Sun1 in endothelial mechanotransduction and vascular development. The study provides a full mechanistic investigation of how Sun1 is achieving its function, which supports the concept that nuclear anchoring is important for proper mechanosensing and junctional organization. The experiments have been well designed and were quantified based on independent experiments. The experiments are convincing and of high quality and include Sun1 depletion in endothelial cell cultures, zebrafish, and in endothelial-specific inducible knockouts in mice.</p><p>There are a few comments that the authors need to address:</p><p>– Figure 1E. The endothelial-specific depletion of Sun1 is affecting the endothelial junctions. In the provided image it seems as if the total intensity of VE-cadherin staining is increased. Is this a result that is recapitulated in other samples too?</p><p>– Figure 3I shows that there is an abnormal junction in the developing ISVs of Sun1 MO fish. Given the notion that the ISVs develop differently, this is perhaps not so unexpected. Perhaps the ISVS of the WT fish are already perfused and the MO not yet since they are lacking behind. Are there any differences in junctional interactions in ISVS that are comparable in length?</p><p>– Regarding the VE-cadherin internalization assay. There is often a large variety of internalization in endothelial cultures. Can the authors provide a larger field of view for readers to indicate in what proportion of cells the increasing internalization levels are observed?</p><p>– It remains difficult to conclude whether the observed changes upon Sun1 depletion on vascular development are dependent on its effect on junctions, or whether they may involve other microtubule-associating cellular structures as well. For instance the focal adhesions, or organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton itself. Is there another reason perhaps that strengthens the conclusion that Sun1 mediates its effect mostly via the junctions? Or do the authors think that other cellular structures contribute as well?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Endothelial cells mediate the growth of the vascular system but they also need to prevent vascular leakage, which involves interactions with neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) through junctional protein complexes. Buglak et al. report that the EC nucleus controls the function of cell-cell junctions through the nuclear envelope-associated proteins SUN1 and Nesprin-1. They argue that SUN1 controls microtubule dynamics and junctional stability through the RhoA activator GEF-H1.</p><p>In my view, this study is interesting and addresses an important but very little-studied question, namely the link between the EC nucleus and cell junctions in the periphery. The study has also made use of different model systems, i.e. genetically modified mice, zebrafish, and cultured endothelial cells, which confirms certain findings and utilizes the specific advantages of each model system. A weakness is that some important controls are missing. In addition, the evidence for the proposed molecular mechanism should be strengthened.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Data showing the efficiency of Sun1 inactivation in the murine endothelial cells is lacking. It would be best to see what is happening on the protein level, but it would already help a great deal if the authors could show a reduction of the transcript in sorted ECs. The excision of a DNA fragment shown in the lung (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) is not quantitative at all. In addition, the gel has been run way too short so it is impossible to even estimate the size of the DNA fragment.</p><p>2) The authors show an increase in vessel density in the periphery of the growing Sun1 mutant retinal vasculature. It would be important to add staining with a marker labelling EC nuclei (e.g. Erg) because higher vessel density might reflect changes in cell size/shape or number, which has also implications for the appearance of cell-cell junctions. More ECs crowded within a small area are likely to have more complicated junctions.</p><p>Furthermore, it would be useful and straightforward to assess EC proliferation, which is mentioned later in the experiments with cultured ECs but has not been addressed in the in vivo part.</p><p>3) It appears that the loss of Sun1/sun1b in mice and zebrafish is compatible with major aspects of vascular growth and leads to changes in filopodia dynamics and vascular permeability (during development) without severe and lasting disruption of the EC network. It would be helpful to know whether the loss-of-function mutants can ultimately form a normal vascular network in the retina and trunk, respectively. It might be sufficient to mention this in the text.</p><p>4) The only readout after the rescue of the SUN1 knockdown by GEF-H1 depletion is the appearance of VE-cadherin+ junctions (Figure 6G and H). This is insufficient evidence for a relatively strong conclusion. The authors should at least look at microtubules. They might also want to consider the activation status of RhoA as a good biochemical readout. It is argued that RhoA activity goes up (see Figure 7C) but there is no data supporting this conclusion. It is also not clear whether &quot;diffuse&quot; GEF-H1 localization translates into increased Rho A activity, as is suggested by the Rho kinase inhibition experiment. GEF-H1 levels in the Western blot in (Figure 6- supplement 2C) have not been quantitated.</p><p>5) The criticism raised for the GEF-H1 rescue also applies to the co-depletion of SUN1 and Nesprin-1. This mechanistic aspect is currently somewhat weak and should be strengthened. Again, Rho A activity might be a useful and quantitative biochemical readout.</p><p>6) Likewise, I have seen no data measuring VE-cadherin internalization and therefore the statement in line 309 should be modified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here, Buglak and coauthors describe the effect of Sun1 deficiency on endothelial junctions. Sun1 is a component of the LINC complex, connecting the inner nuclear membrane with the cytoskeleton. The authors show that in the absence of Sun1, the morphology of the endothelial adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is altered, indicative of increased internalization of VE-cadherin. The change in VE-cadherin dynamics correlates with decreased angiogenic sprouting as shown using in vivo and in vitro models. The study would benefit from a stricter presentation of the data and needs additional controls in certain analyses.</p><p>1. The authors implicate the changes in VE-cadherin morphology to be of consequence for &quot;barrier function&quot; and mention barrier function frequently throughout the text, for example in the heading on page 12: &quot;SUN1 stabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions and regulates barrier function&quot;. The concept of &quot;barrier&quot; implies the ability of endothelial cells to restrict the passage of molecules and cells across the vessel wall. This is tested only marginally (Suppl Figure 1F) and these data are not quantified. Increased leakage of 10kDa dextran in a P6-7 Sun1-deficient retina as shown here probably reflects the increased immaturity of the Sun1-deficient retinal vasculature. From these data, the authors cannot state that Sun1 regulates the barrier or barrier function (unclear what exactly the authors refer to when they make a distinction between the barrier as such on the one hand and barrier function on the other). The authors can, if they do more experiments, state that loss of Sun1 leads to increased leakage in the early postnatal stages in the retina. However, if they wish to characterize the vascular barrier, there is a wide range of other tissue that should be tested, in the presence and absence of disease. Moreover, a regulatory role for Sun1 would imply that Sun1 normally, possibly through changes in its expression levels, would modulate the barrier properties to allow more or less leakage in different circumstances. However, no such data are shown. The authors would need to go through their paper and remove statements regarding the regulation of the barrier and barrier function since these are conclusions that lack foundation.</p><p>2. In Figure 6g, the authors show that &quot;depletion of GEF-H1 in endothelial cells that were also depleted for SUN1 rescued the destabilized cell-cell junctions observed with SUN1 KD alone&quot;. However, it is quite clear that Sun1 depletion also affects cell shape and cell alignment and this is not rescued by GEF-H1 depletion (Figure 6g). This should be described and commented on. Moreover please show the effects of GEF-H1 alone.</p><p>3. In Figure 6a, the authors show rescue of junction morphology in Sun1-depleted cells by deletion of Nesprin1. The effect of Nesprin1 KD alone is missing.</p><p>Buglak et al., describe the effect of deleting Sun1 from endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. They observe changes in VE-cadherin morphology and note effects on VE-cadherin internalization, which they suggest explains the reduced angiogenic sprouting capacity in the absence of Sun1. The authors present evidence that reducing GEF-H1 or Nesprin1, can partially rescue the loss of the Sun1 phenotype. There is a precedence of data in the literature showing regulation of cytoskeleton (both microtubule and actin) by the LINC complex, in which both Sun1 and Nesprin1 are part, in a range of cell types. However, the consequence of Sun1 deficiency on endothelial adherens junctions has not been described before. Unfortunately, the authors present their data in a rather indistinctive manner, using inaccurate expressions and there is also a tendency for overinterpretation of the data. Moreover, by focusing on endothelial cells and their unique barrier to blood components, specificity is implied which is not true in well-known biology.</p><p>4. The penetration of streptavidin between cells in the siRNA-treated HUVECs and the impedance changes with Sun1-deletion is in agreement with Sun1 being a structural component in a mechanosensitive microtubule- and actin-dependent cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion. See Mol Biol Cell. 2021 Aug 19;32(18):1654-1663. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E20-11-0698. This paper should be cited. Please also check the paper by Ueda et al., in Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 May 18;10:885859. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.885859, which describes Sun1 as part of the mechanosensing machinery, which is most likely the underlying mechanism explaining the effects recorded by Buglak et al. in the various analyses. This paper by Ueda is in the reference list but strangely not in the text as far as I have been able to see.</p><p>5. The authors have chosen the morphology of VE-cadherin as a readout for the effect of Sun1-deficiency on endothelial cells. They describe the effect of Sun1 depletion as &quot;junction activation&quot; and even describe &quot;over-activated&quot; junctions (line 241). This wording implies the involvement of enzymatic activity and the impression may be that the authors suggest that VE-cadherin is an enzyme. This is not correct. Junctions can be more or less stable as a consequence of the interruption of VE-cadherin homophilic bonds and internalization, for which the authors present data. The authors would do better to use less ambiguous language.</p><p>6. Throughout the paper please change the &quot;control&quot; designation for the non-floxed mouse strain to the actual genotype. As the authors are aware, Cre-toxicity can cause very similar effects on the retina vasculature as shown for the Sun1 iECKO. This is also apparent from Supplemental Figure 1. Therefore, it is important to indicate that Cre+ wildtype mice have been used as controls rather than a Cre- wildtype.</p><p>7.

The reviewers agreed that our work investigating the LINC complex protein Sun1 in junction organization and function and angiogenic sprouting is novel and interesting, and they also asked for revisions, including some additional controls and more support for some conclusions. The editor asked us to specifically focus on points raised in the public review of Reviewer 2 (particularly points 4 and 5, as well as requests for controls raised in points 1 and 2) and the three points raised in the public review of Reviewer 3. The reviewers also made various detailed suggestions on the writing.</p><p>We have seriously considered these points and present a revised manuscript with new data that addresses reviewer concerns and substantially strengthens the conclusions. Specific new data (new panels: Figure 1-figure supplement 1F-G; Figure 6I-J; Figure 6-figure supplement 3B-C; Figure 7B-C, E-F; Figure 7-figure supplement 1B-G) now extends our analysis of the rescue of SUN1-depleted endothelial junctions upon co-depletion of GEFH1 or NESP1 to microtubule parameters and a functional readout of junction integrity. We also provide direct evidence of RhoA over-activation with SUN1 depletion and rescue by GEFH1 co-depletion via Rho activity pulldowns (Figure 6-figure supplement 2D). We’ve also modified several panels in response to reviewer comments (Figure 1B, 1E; Figure 3J; Figure 4-figure supplement 1B, 1F; Figure 6-figure supplement 3A).

To test the efficiency of our excision protocol, we bred <italic>Cdh5CreERT2</italic> mice with the <italic>ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> excision reporter (cells express tdTomato absent Cre activity and express GFP upon Cre-mediated excision; Muzumdar et al., 2007). Utilizing the same excision protocol as used for the <italic>Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup></italic> mice, we see a significantly high level of excision in retinal vessels only in the presence of <italic>Cdh5CreERT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cdh5CreERT2</italic> efficiently excises in endothelial cells of the mouse postnatal retina.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of P7 mouse retinas with the indicated genotypes, stained for ERG (white, nucleus). tdTomato (magenta) is expressed in cells that have not undergone Cre-mediated excision, while GFP (green) is expressed in excised cells.

It would be important to add staining with a marker labelling EC nuclei (e.g. Erg) because higher vessel density might reflect changes in cell size/shape or number, which has also implications for the appearance of cell-cell junctions. More ECs crowded within a small area are likely to have more complicated junctions.</p><p>Furthermore, it would be useful and straightforward to assess EC proliferation, which is mentioned later in the experiments with cultured ECs but has not been addressed in the in vivo part.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur that ERG staining is important to show any changes in nuclear shape or cell density in the post-natal retina. We now include this data in Figure1—figure supplement 1F-G. We do not see obvious changes in nuclear shape or number, though we do observe some crowding in <italic>Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup></italic> retinas, consistent with increased density. However, when normalized to total vessel area, we do not observe a significant difference in the nuclear signal density in <italic>Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup></italic> mutant retinas relative to controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It appears that the loss of Sun1/sun1b in mice and zebrafish is compatible with major aspects of vascular growth and leads to changes in filopodia dynamics and vascular permeability (during development) without severe and lasting disruption of the EC network. It would be helpful to know whether the loss-of-function mutants can ultimately form a normal vascular network in the retina and trunk, respectively. It might be sufficient to mention this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. It is true that developmental defects in the vasculature resulting from various genetic mutations are often resolved over time.</p><p>We’ve made text changes to discuss viability of Sun1 global KO mice and lack of perduring effects in sun1 morphant fish, perhaps resulting from compensation by SUN2, which is partially functionally redundant with SUN1 in vivo (Lei et al., 2009; Zhang, et al., 2009) (p. 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The only readout after the rescue of the SUN1 knockdown by GEF-H1 depletion is the appearance of VE-cadherin+ junctions (Figure 6G and H). This is insufficient evidence for a relatively strong conclusion. The authors should at least look at microtubules. They might also want to consider the activation status of RhoA as a good biochemical readout. It is argued that RhoA activity goes up (see Figure 7C) but there is no data supporting this conclusion. It is also not clear whether &quot;diffuse&quot; GEF-H1 localization translates into increased Rho A activity, as is suggested by the Rho kinase inhibition experiment. GEF-H1 levels in the Western blot in (Figure 6- supplement 2C) have not been quantitated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that analysis of RhoA activity and additional analysis of rescued junctions strengthens our conclusions, so we performed these experiments. New data (Figure 6IJ) shows that co-depletion of SUN1 and GEF-H1 rescues junction integrity as measured by biotin-matrix labeling. Interestingly, co-depletion of SUN1 and GEF-H1 does not rescue reduced microtubule density at the periphery (Figure 6—figure supplement 3BC), placing GEF-H1 downstream of aberrant microtubule dynamics in SUN1 depleted cells. This is consistent with our model (Figure 8) describing how loss of SUN1 leads to increased microtubule depolymerization, resulting in release and activation of GEF-H1 that goes on to affect actomyosin contractility and junction integrity. In addition, we include images of the junctions in GEF-H1 single KD (Figure 6—figure supplement 3BC) and quantify the western blot in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A.</p><p>We performed RhoA activity assays and new data shows that SUN1 depletion results in increased RhoA activation, while co-depletion of SUN1 and GEF-H1 ameliorates this increase (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D). This is consistent with our model in which loss of SUN1 leads to increased RhoA activity via release of GEF-H1 from microtubules. In addition, we now cite a recent study describing that GEF-H1 is activated when unbound to microtubules, with this activation resulting in increased RhoA activity (Azoitei et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The criticism raised for the GEF-H1 rescue also applies to the co-depletion of SUN1 and Nesprin-1. This mechanistic aspect is currently somewhat weak and should be strengthened. Again, Rho A activity might be a useful and quantitative biochemical readout.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully point out that we showed that co-depletion of nesprin-1 and SUN1 rescues SUN1 knockdown effects via several readouts, including rescue of junction morphology, biotin labeling, microtubule localization at the periphery, and GEFH1/microtubule localization. We’ve moved this data to the main figure (Figure 7B-C, E-F) to better highlight these mechanistic findings. These results are consistent with our model that nesprin-1 effects are upstream of GEF-H1 localization. We also added results showing that nesprin-1 knockdown alone does not affect junction integrity, microtubule density, or GEF-H1/microtubule localization (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Likewise, I have seen no data measuring VE-cadherin internalization and therefore the statement in line 309 should be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully direct the reviewer to Figure 4—figure supplement 1F-G showing increased VE-cadherin internalization in SUN1-depleted endothelial cells. We updated this panel to include a larger field of view to show a more representative cell sampling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here, Buglak and coauthors describe the effect of Sun1 deficiency on endothelial junctions. Sun1 is a component of the LINC complex, connecting the inner nuclear membrane with the cytoskeleton. The authors show that in the absence of Sun1, the morphology of the endothelial adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is altered, indicative of increased internalization of VE-cadherin. The change in VE-cadherin dynamics correlates with decreased angiogenic sprouting as shown using in vivo and in vitro models. The study would benefit from a stricter presentation of the data and needs additional controls in certain analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments, and in response we have performed the revisions described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors implicate the changes in VE-cadherin morphology to be of consequence for &quot;barrier function&quot; and mention barrier function frequently throughout the text, for example in the heading on page 12: &quot;SUN1 stabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions and regulates barrier function&quot;. The concept of &quot;barrier&quot; implies the ability of endothelial cells to restrict the passage of molecules and cells across the vessel wall. This is tested only marginally (Suppl Figure 1F) and these data are not quantified. Increased leakage of 10kDa dextran in a P6-7 Sun1-deficient retina as shown here probably reflects the increased immaturity of the Sun1-deficient retinal vasculature. From these data, the authors cannot state that Sun1 regulates the barrier or barrier function (unclear what exactly the authors refer to when they make a distinction between the barrier as such on the one hand and barrier function on the other). The authors can, if they do more experiments, state that loss of Sun1 leads to increased leakage in the early postnatal stages in the retina. However, if they wish to characterize the vascular barrier, there is a wide range of other tissue that should be tested, in the presence and absence of disease. Moreover, a regulatory role for Sun1 would imply that Sun1 normally, possibly through changes in its expression levels, would modulate the barrier properties to allow more or less leakage in different circumstances. However, no such data are shown. The authors would need to go through their paper and remove statements regarding the regulation of the barrier and barrier function since these are conclusions that lack foundation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the language used regarding the function and integrity of the junctions is confusing, although we suggest that the endothelial cell properties measured by our assays are typically equated with “barrier function” in the literature. However, we have edited our language to precisely describe our results as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 6g, the authors show that &quot;depletion of GEF-H1 in endothelial cells that were also depleted for SUN1 rescued the destabilized cell-cell junctions observed with SUN1 KD alone&quot;. However, it is quite clear that Sun1 depletion also affects cell shape and cell alignment and this is not rescued by GEF-H1 depletion (Figure 6g). This should be described and commented on. Moreover please show the effects of GEF-H1 alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the effects on cell shape. SUN1 depletion typically leads to shape changes consistent with elevated contractility, but this is considered to be downstream of the effects quantified here. We updated the panel in Figure 6G to a more representative image showing cell shape rescue by co-depletion of SUN1 and GEF-H1. We present new data panels showing that GEF-H1 depletion alone does not affect junction integrity (Figure 6I-J). We also present new data showing that co-depletion of GEF-H1 and SUN1 does not rescue microtubule density at the periphery (Figure 6—figure supplement 3B-C), consistent with our model that GEF-H1 activation is downstream of microtubule perturbations induced by SUN1 loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 6a, the authors show rescue of junction morphology in Sun1-depleted cells by deletion of Nesprin1. The effect of Nesprin1 KD alone is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we now include new panels (Figure 7figure supplement 1B-G) demonstrating that Nesprin-1 depletion does not affect biotin-matrix labeling, peripheral microtubule density, or GEF-H1/microtubule localization absent co-depletion with SUN1. These findings are consistent with our model that Nesprin-1 loss does not affect cell junctions on its own because it is held in a non-functional complex with SUN1 that is not available in the absence of SUN1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Buglak et al., describe the effect of deleting Sun1 from endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. They observe changes in VE-cadherin morphology and note effects on VE-cadherin internalization, which they suggest explains the reduced angiogenic sprouting capacity in the absence of Sun1. The authors present evidence that reducing GEF-H1 or Nesprin1, can partially rescue the loss of the Sun1 phenotype. There is a precedence of data in the literature showing regulation of cytoskeleton (both microtubule and actin) by the LINC complex, in which both Sun1 and Nesprin1 are part, in a range of cell types. However, the consequence of Sun1 deficiency on endothelial adherens junctions has not been described before. Unfortunately, the authors present their data in a rather indistinctive manner, using inaccurate expressions and there is also a tendency for overinterpretation of the data. Moreover, by focusing on endothelial cells and their unique barrier to blood components, specificity is implied which is not true in well-known biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insight. While we agree that cytoskeleton regulation by the LINC complex has been studied, we contend that most published studies disrupt the LINC complex as a whole (via dominant negative constructs or double knockdowns to disrupt multiple LINC components). Thus, relatively little is known regarding functions of individual LINC components, or how different combinations of SUN and KASH proteins may beget different cellular functions. Thus, our goal was to examine the specific role of SUN1 in the regulation of cell junctions and cytoskeleton in the vasculature. We agree that the interactions and mechanisms that we uncovered are likely not specific to endothelial cells, and we now discuss that our findings may be applicable to other cell and tissue types (p. 19-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The penetration of streptavidin between cells in the siRNA-treated HUVECs and the impedance changes with Sun1-deletion is in agreement with Sun1 being a structural component in a mechanosensitive microtubule- and actin-dependent cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion. See Mol Biol Cell. 2021 Aug 19;32(18):1654-1663. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E20-11-0698. This paper should be cited. Please also check the paper by Ueda et al., in Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 May 18;10:885859. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.885859, which describes Sun1 as part of the mechanosensing machinery, which is most likely the underlying mechanism explaining the effects recorded by Buglak et al. in the various analyses. This paper by Ueda is in the reference list but strangely not in the text as far as I have been able to see.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully submit that we did discuss the paper by Ueda et al. and the paper by Denis et al. (p. 6, 9, 21). We’ve now expanded this discussion to better highlight those studies, and we now comment that additional cellular processes may be affected by SUN1 (p. 13, 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors have chosen the morphology of VE-cadherin as a readout for the effect of Sun1-deficiency on endothelial cells. They describe the effect of Sun1 depletion as &quot;junction activation&quot; and even describe &quot;over-activated&quot; junctions (line 241). This wording implies the involvement of enzymatic activity and the impression may be that the authors suggest that VE-cadherin is an enzyme. This is not correct. Junctions can be more or less stable as a consequence of the interruption of VE-cadherin homophilic bonds and internalization, for which the authors present data. The authors would do better to use less ambiguous language.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the wording was confusing, and we have updated the text to describe “destabilized” rather than “activated” junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Throughout the paper please change the &quot;control&quot; designation for the non-floxed mouse strain to the actual genotype. As the authors are aware, Cre-toxicity can cause very similar effects on the retina vasculature as shown for the Sun1 iECKO. This is also apparent from Supplemental Figure 1. Therefore, it is important to indicate that Cre+ wildtype mice have been used as controls rather than a Cre- wildtype.</p></disp-quote><p>Our “control” designation represents a combination of genotypes from littermate controls as described in Materials and methods and includes WT, Cdh5CreERT2/+, Sun1<sup>fl/+</sup>, and Sun1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Genotypes were combined for quantification of controls due to small litter sizes. We agree that Cre-toxicity can cause similar effects on the retina. It is for this reason that we separated out retinas by genotype in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. We include that graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> with additional statistical comparisons showing that there is no significant difference between Cdh5CreERT2/+ retinas and WT retinas, but a significant difference between Cdh5CreERT2/+ retinas and Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup> retinas. We agree with the reviewer that it is important to show the phenotype for the Cre+ mice, so we have updated Figure 1B and Figure 1E to pair Cdh5CreERT2/+ retinas with Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup> retinas. We find that Cdh5CreERT2/+ retinas have normal radial expansion and density and do not display disorganized VE-cadherin staining like Sun1<sup>iECKO</sup> retinas.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cdh5CreERT2 does not affect radial expansion.</title><p>Reproduced graph from Figure 1—figure supplement 1D with additional statistical comparisons.

Our focus was on endothelial cell junction function and not migration; however, since LINC complex manipulations via KASH dominant negative or nesprin-1 or nesprin-2 KD lead to reduced endothelial cell migration (Denis et al., 2021; King et al., 2014), and we document a sprout retraction phenotype, we now discuss possible effects of SUN1 loss on migration in the text (p. 21).</p><p>References</p><p>Azoitei, M.
