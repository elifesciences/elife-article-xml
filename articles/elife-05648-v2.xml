Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) induced non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Indeed, LTβR costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-κB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-κB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LTβR signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by <italic>Nfkb2</italic>, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-κB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, <italic>Nfkb2</italic> connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-κB response to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection, while <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects.

Innate immune cells are found in every tissue type, poised to respond immediately to damaged, stressed, or infected host cells. When innate immune cells recognize any injury or infection, one of the first things they do is trigger the inflammatory response. Fluid and other immune cells then move from the blood into the injured tissues. This movement can cause redness and swelling. But the response helps to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection, promotes the elimination of both invading microbes and damaged host cells, and encourages the repair of the tissue.</p><p>Inflammation is tightly controlled. If the response is too weak, it could leave an individual prone to serious infection. On the other hand, excessive inflammation can severely damage healthy cells and tissues. Inflammation is regulated differently in different tissue types, and the environment within the tissue itself influences the activity of local innate immune cells and the inflammatory response. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for receiving and interpreting the signals derived from the host tissue remain unknown.</p><p>Now, Banoth et al., have revealed that the integration of inflammation-provoking signals, such as injury or infection and cues from the tissue environment occurs via the so-called ‘NF-κB signaling system’. NF-κB is a protein found in almost all cell types, and when activated it is able to switch on the expression of many different genes. Banoth et al. explain that signal integration via the NF-κB system enables cues from the tissue environment to tune a cell's responses. Further experiments confirmed the importance of this signal integration by showing how a signal coming from intestinal tissue can influence the activity of innate immune cells and inflammation in the gut.</p><p>These findings suggest that a breakdown in the NF-κB signaling system's ability to integrate multiple signals, including those derived from the tissue environment, may be responsible for many inflammatory disorders, and in particular those that involve the gut. Future work is now needed to explore this possibility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05648.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05648.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>lymphotoxin</kwd><kwd><italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic></kwd><kwd>positive feedback</kwd><kwd>RelA:p52/NF-kappaB</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT India Alliance, intermediate fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Soumen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Immunology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Soumen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banoth</surname><given-names>Balaji</given-names></name><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Payel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The integration of signals via the pleiotropic NF-kappaB (NF-κB) system enables microenvironmental cues to tune cellular responses to pathogenic substances.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tight regulation of inflammatory responses is important; uncontrolled inflammation underlies various human ailments, while insufficient responses limit host defense to pathogens. Tissue-resident cells those that participate in inflammatory immune activation also exhibit functional differences by adapting to the repertoire of cell-differentiating cues present in distinct microenvironments. Indeed, macrophages and dendritic cells present in different anatomic niche display heterogeneity in inflammatory signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwasaki and Kelsall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stout and Suttles, 2004</xref>). Likewise, a requirement for CD40, primarily involved in B-cell maturation, in inflammatory gene expressions in endothelial cells was documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pluvinet et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, lymph node inducing lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) was shown to be critical for innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, the cellular circuitry that functions at the intersection of tissue microenvironment derived signals and those impinged upon by pro-inflammatory cytokines or pathogen-derived substances remains obscure.</p><p>The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays an essential role in activating pathogen-responsive gene-expression program in tissue-resident cells. In the canonical NF-κB pathway, inflammatory cues engage NEMO-IKK2 (NEMO-IKKβ) kinase complex to phosphorylate inhibitory IκB proteins, the major isoform being IκBα, bound to the cytoplasmic RelA:p50 NF-κB dimers. Signal-induced phosphorylation leads to proteasomal degradation of IκBs and release of RelA:p50 dimers into the nucleus. The nuclear RelA dimers activate the expressions of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine genes as well as its own inhibitor IκBα, which ensures proper attenuation of inflammatory responses in a negative feedback loop. In contrast to canonical signaling, the non-canonical pathway transduces signals from cell-differentiating cues those engage BAFFR, CD40, or LTβR. Non-canonical signaling involves NIK and IKK1 (NIK-IKKα) mediated phosphorylation of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> encoded precursor p100 bound to RelB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun, 2012</xref>). Subsequent proteasomal processing removes the C-terminal inhibitory domain of p100 from RelB:p100 complex to generate RelB:p52 NF-κB dimer, which mediates the expressions of organogenic chemokine genes in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonizzi et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Molecular interaction between the non-canonical signal transducer p100 and RelA has also been charted. In its homo-oligomeric form, termed IκBδ, p100 was shown to utilize its inhibitory domain to sequester a subpopulation of the RelA:p50 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Savinova et al., 2009</xref>). LTβR through non-canonical NIK-IKK1 signal inactivates IκBδ to induce a weak yet sustained RelA:p50 activity. Conversely, RelA-induced synthesis of p100 and consequent accumulation of inhibitory IκBδ was shown to exert negative feedback limiting canonical RelA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Wit et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Legarda-Addison and Ting, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shih et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, an alternate RelA:p52 dimer has been reported which is thought to constitute a minor kappaB DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2003</xref>). Crosstalk between apparently distinct cell signaling pathways is known to offer diversity in cellular responses. Despite these connectivities, a plausible role of signal integration via the NF-κB system in regulating inflammatory RelA NF-κB responses has not been investigated.</p><p>In a multidisciplinary study combining biochemistry, genetics, and mathematical modeling, here, we characterized a duration code that determines stimulus-specific crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical signaling in fine-tuning inflammatory RelA NF-κB activity. Through such crosstalk, LTβR sustained TLR4 triggered RelA NF-κB responses by supplementing RelA:p52 NF-κB dimer in a positive feedback loop. Finally, we established the physiological significance of crosstalk control of RelA in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), where, the NF-κB system integrates gut microenvironment derived lymphotoxin signals through <italic>Nfkb2</italic> to calibrate innate immune responses to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling</title><p>Given the interconnectedness of the canonical and non-canonical arms (see Introduction and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we asked if signal integration via the NF-κB system would allow cell-differentiating cues to modulate inflammatory RelA NF-κB responses. Mathematical reconstruction of dynamic networks illuminates emergent properties, such as crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2012</xref>). To explore crosstalk control, we developed a mathematical model, which we termed the NF-κB Systems Model <italic>v</italic>1.0 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix-1</xref>), basing on previously published single NF-κB dimer model versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref>). In our mathematical model, however, we depicted nuclear activation of both the major RelA:p50 dimer and RelA:p52 dimer, which is thought to constitute a minor RelA NF-κB activity. As described in the preceding single dimer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref>), signal-responsive degradation and resynthesis of IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, and inhibitory p100/IκBδ dynamically controlled RelA activity. The model was parameterized based on literature, our own measurements (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix-1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9 fig10 fig11 fig12">Appendix figures 1–5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data SD4-data SD5-data">Supplementary files 1–3</xref>), and fitting procedures. Simulating individual TNFR or LTβR regime, we could recapitulate experimentally observed strong, but temporally controlled, activation of RelA NF-κB complexes during canonical IKK2 signaling or the weak induction of RelA dimers during non-canonical NIK-IKK1 signaling, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05648.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational simulations predicting a duration code underlying crosstalk control.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A current model for RelA NF-κB activation via the canonical (IKK2) or the non-canonical (NIK-IKK1) pathways, respectively.

To this end, we generated a theoretical library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shih et al., 2009</xref>) of 356 kinase activity profiles, where each member possesses distinct peak onset time, peak amplitude, and duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To screen for permissive crosstalk conditions, we fed this library into the model through IKK2 or NIK-IKK1 or both the arms and iteratively simulated respective RelA activities. Then, we computed RelA responses in the co-treatment regime relative to individual cell stimulations to assign crosstalk indexes to different IKK2 and NIK-IKK1 combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Plotting the dynamic features of the crosstalk-proficient kinase inputs, we could reveal a critical duration threshold; where IKK2 activities sustained for more than 2 hr were more likely to engage into crosstalk for varied peak amplitudes and inputs with shorter duration were crosstalk inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Illustrating a similar but more elaborate duration control, NIK-IKK1 activities longer than 8 hr selectively participated into crosstalk with the canonical pathway.</p><p>Inflammatory mediators activate canonical IKK2 with disparate temporal controls. Consistent to the prior report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Werner et al., 2008</xref>), our kinase assay (‘Materials and methods’) revealed that IL-1β, an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, only transiently activates IKK2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, bacterial LPS through TLR4-induced IKK2 activity that persisted above the basal level even at 24 hr post-stimulation (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Covert et al., 2005</xref>). Mimicking prolonged signaling during cell-differentiation processes, LTβR engagement using agonistic αLTβR antibody led to sustained activation of the non-canonical NIK-IKK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Using these experimental kinase activities as inputs, our computational simulations revealed insulation of IL-1R signaling from LTβR-mediated crosstalk (left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), but robust crosstalk between TLR4 and LTβR that amplified late RelA response upon costimulation (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Therefore, our mathematical analyses predicted that a duration code selectively engages long lasting canonical kinase activities into crosstalk with LTβR induced NIK signal to impart stimulus specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stimulus-specific crosstalk allows LTβR signal to prolong TLR4 induced RelA NF-κB response</title><p>To experimentally verify stimulus specificity of crosstalk control, we measured nuclear RelA activities induced in MEFs by canonical or non-canonical inducers or co-treatment regime that concomitantly activated both the pathways. IL-1R signal, in parallel to transient IKK2 activation, elicited strong RelA activity at 30 min in EMSA that was largely attenuated within 1 hr, whereas, non-canonical LTβR signal only weakly induced RelA and RelB dimers those persisted even at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, we were unable to detect any significant enhancement of RelA activity, relative to IL-1 induced peak, upon costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In comparison, canonical TLR4 induced a temporally distinct RelA NF-κB activity with an early peak at 1 hr, subsequent descend and a progressively weakened late phase between 8 hr and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Corroborating our mathematical prediction, concomitant LTβR signal sustained NF-κB response triggered by TLR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Our analyses revealed that IL-1 treatment rapidly induces the expressions of TNF, IP-10, and MIP-1α mRNAs within 1 hr with residual expressions at 24 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The levels of IL-1β and RANTES mRNAs were insensitive to IL-1 treatment. Also, weak LTβR signal alone did not significantly induce the expressions of these pro-inflammatory genes in MEFs. Indeed, LTβR costimulation was ineffective in augmenting IL-1 induced early or late expressions of the chemokine and cytokine genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Solitary LPS treatment not only robustly induced the expressions of TNF, IP-10, and MIP-1α mRNAs, but also led to late accumulation of IL-1β and RANTES mRNAs at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent to our hypothesis, LTβR costimulation prolonged TLR4-induced gene expressions with further augmented late, but not early, expressions of IL-1β, IP-10, MIP-1α, and RANTES mRNAs. TNF mRNA levels were insensitive to crosstalk regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we used microarray analyses to compare global gene expressions activated by TLR4 or LTβR or both at 24 hr post-stimulation. Estimating normalized crosstalk scores (bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’), we could reveal a synergistic effect of LTβR on TLR4 stimulated late gene expressions in WT MEFs. Out of 943 LPS induced genes, however, a select set of 114 genes was further upregulated upon costimulation. Strikingly, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’) demonstrated an enrichment of NF-κB targets among genes positively controlled through crosstalk (middle and top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We have also noted downregulation of several LPS-induced genes in the costimulation regime those appeared less likely to be NF-κB targets in GSEA. Taken together, these analyses substantiated an important function of prolonged RelA activity in crosstalk-amplification of TLR4-induced late expressions of NF-κB target genes, particularly those encode pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Non-canonical signal transducer <italic>Nfkb2</italic> supplements RelA:p52 dimer to sustain canonical RelA NF-κB responses</title><p>To determine the mechanism underlying signal integration via the NF-κB system, we individually perturbed 105 model parameters and quantified relative changes in the crosstalk index (‘Materials and methods’).

Concomitant LTβR signal instead utilized TLR4-induced, newly synthesized p100 to potently generate p52, thereby, neutralizing the inhibitory p100 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). p50 levels were not discernibly altered in these stimulation regimes in our experiments. Our immunoprecipitation based analysis demonstrated that NIK-IKK1 signal relieves RelA from p100/IκBδ-mediated inhibition during crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Intriguingly, LTβR costimulation of MEFs for 24 hr also produced ∼fourfold more RelA:p52 NF-κB dimer as compared to solitary LPS treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Limited transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> by weak LTβR signal was correlated with only the modest p52 and RelA:p52 generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). In supershift assay, we could ascertain that RelA:p52 dimer generated upon LTβR costimulation appears as a strong nuclear DNA binding activity at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) to supplement to the TLR4-induced RelA NF-κB responses. An important role of dimerization in stabilizing NF-κB monomers from degradation has been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fusco et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, RelA protein rapidly accumulated in cells upon proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) suggesting a robust constitutive degradation mechanism that offsets basal synthesis of RelA monomers in maintaining the steady-state level. Our study indicated that this enduring flux ensures copious supply of RelA to bind to de novo generated p52, produced from the newly synthesized p100 during crosstalk.</p><p>Next, our genetic analyses revealed that canonical RelA:p50 response to TLR4 signal, primarily controlled through classical IκBs, is largely intact in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> with early induction and diminished late activities comparable to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent to the prediction based on computational modeling studies, a lack of RelA:p52 dimer generation in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells, however, ablated LTβR-mediated enhancement of TLR4-induced late RelA DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) as well as crosstalk amplification of RelA target pro-inflammatory gene expressions (bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). LTβR costimulation not only enhanced TLR4 induced RelA DNA binding but also activated RelB dimers through the non-canonical pathway.

Therefore, our analyses confirmed that the precursor function encoded by <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in generating RelA:p52 NF-κB dimer is critical for integrating lymphotoxin derived signals to the pro-inflammatory RelA NF-κB pathway.

Our supershift analyses further confirmed complete absence of RelB containing NF-κB DNA binding activity in IECs derived from infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Perturbing LTβR signal attenuated RelA NF-κB activation with more obvious defects at day5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Our study suggested that such pleiotropic system enables tuning of cellular response to an instructive signal by microenvironment-derived additional costimulatory signals. However, a duration code selectively integrates costimulatory LTβR signal with the TLR4 pathway, insulating transient cytokine signaling, secondary to microbial infections, from crosstalk amplifications. Recent studies have identified important positive feedback regulations underlying dose threshold control of NF-κB response in B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinohara et al., 2014</xref>) or in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). Our crosstalk study illuminated a role of a positive feedback loop in sustaining NF-κB response; where non-canonical LTβR signal prolonged canonical TLR4 response by targeting RelA induced p100 for the generation of RelA:p52 NF-κB dimer. Indeed, a dominant precursor function of p100 in producing RelA:p52 led to ablated crosstalk in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells. As such, non-canonical signal generates RelB:p52 by removing the C-terminal domain of p100 present in the preexisting RelB:p100 dimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun, 2012</xref>) or liberates RelA:p50 dimer from the p100/IκBδ-inhibited complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref>). Signal generation of the RelA:p52 dimer requires both canonical induction of p100/<italic>Nfkb2</italic> expressions and concomitant processing of the newly synthesized p100 into p52 by non-canonical signal. Previous report demonstrating that p100 could be efficiently processed cotranslationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mordmüller et al., 2003</xref>) explained the requirement of canonical signals in amply synthesizing nascent p100 as a substrate for the abundant production of p52 subunit during crosstalk. More so, mature p52 could readily dimerize with RelA, despite a preference of full-length p100 for RelB binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fusco et al., 2008</xref>). These observations along with our current study, thereby, elaborated a requirement of convergence of canonical and non-canonical signals in synergistically generating and activating RelA:p52 dimer. Nevertheless, consistent to the observed gene-effect of crosstalk in our study, a significant overlap between RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 dimers in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siggers et al., 2012</xref>) and pro-inflammatory gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2003</xref>) was reported earlier. Of note, our results rely on bulk measurements of signaling intermediates and deterministic modeling approaches. Given studies documenting cell-to-cell variations in signal-induced NF-κB responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), it would be interesting to examine the potential implication of signal integration at the single cell level in determining cellular heterogeneity.</p><p>TLR4 activation of epithelial RelA was implicated in the chemokine gene expressions and neutrophil recruitment upon bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khan et al., 2006</xref>).

In our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), we could clarify that LTβR provides a critical costimulatory signal through <italic>Nfkb2</italic> to sustain RelA NF-κB response to pathogens in otherwise hyporesponsive colonic epithelial cells. Such signal integration ameliorated innate immune functions by enhancing pro-inflammatory gene expressions. Interestingly, p100<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which lacked the expression of p100, but aberrantly produced p52, revealed hyperplasia of gastric epithelial cells and elevated expressions of RelA target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishikawa et al., 1997</xref>).

These studies indeed support a possible role of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in mucosal epithelial cells in strengthening RelA activity. LTβR engagement in the dendritic cells within colonic patches was shown to trigger IL-22 production by innate lymphoid cells involving cell–cell communications to potentiate gut immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tumanov et al., 2011</xref>).

In future, tissue-specific knockouts may help to further distinguish between innate immune functions of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in different cell types.</p><p>The underlying mechanism and biological functions of RelB:p52 dimer activated by non-canonical signal is well established. From the perspective of signaling crosstalk, our study offers a significant revision of our understanding of non-canonical signaling in amplifying canonical RelA responses. It extends the intriguing possibility that cell-differentiating cues present in the tissue microenvironment may play a more direct role, separate from merely determining the differentiation states of the resident cells, in calibrating innate immune responses by engaging into cell-autonomous signaling crosstalks. Future studies ought to further examine the signal integration via <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in potentiating immune responses against other microbial pathogens.

Next, LPS response genes in WT MEFs were ranked based on the merit of their normalized crosstalk scores, which is defined below and also described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Crosstalk score = [(Δco-treatment − (ΔLPS + ΔαLTβR))/0h_int], where 0h_int indicates the signal intensity of a given gene in untreated cells and Δtreatment signifies the differences in signal intensities between treated and untreated cells,</p><p>Normalized crosstalk score = Crosstalk Score * [{(ΔL + ΔB))/0h_int/|(ΔL + ΔB))/0h_int|],</p><p>As implied, positive crosstalk scores signify hyperactivation, whereas negative crosstalk scores imply diminished gene expressions in the co-treatment regime as compared to cell treatment with the individual stimuli. The ordered gene set was examined in GSEA v2.0.12 (Broad Institute at MIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). The MIAME version of the microarray data set discussed in this publication are available on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE62301). For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed with Transcriptor cDNA kit and amplified using Sybr Green PCR mix (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in ABI7500 cycler. The relative gene expressions were quantified using ΔΔCT method upon normalizing to β-actin mRNA level. Absolute quantification was done using plasmid DNA constructs encoding respective genes as standards and normalized to express as gene/actin mRNA level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Murine infection model</title><p>Sex matched, 8 to 10 week old mice, fasting for 8 hr, were orally gavaged with 1.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> cfu of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> strain DBS100 (ATCC 51459). In certain instances, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 200 μg of murine LTβR-IgG1 fusion protein or MOPC21 isotype control (Biogen Idec) 1 day prior to infection, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). IECs, isolated following published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greten et al., 2004</xref>), were utilized for biochemical analyses. For histology, dissected colons were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (Pierce, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) for neutrophil recruitment or with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) for tissue pathology evaluation.

In the preceding version, canonical IKK2 signals degraded classical IκBs, while non-canonical NIK-IKK1 targeted IκBδ to liberate the RelA:p50 NF-κB dimers, represented as a singular species, into the nucleus. Although, biochemical analyses defined IκBδ as an oligomer of p100, the previous versions represented IκBδ as a composite species that is produced directly from an NF-κB responsive gene. In the current version, we have elaborated biochemical reactions associated with p100 in the model. We have explicitly described p100 as a species that is generated from the transcripts encoded by NF-κB responsive <italic>Nfkb2</italic>. Monomer p100 was subjected to (i) constitutive degradation or (ii) oligomerization to form IκBδ or (iii) NIK-IKK1-dependent processing that generated RelA:p52 dimer as a composite species. In contrast, RelA:p50 dimer was constitutively produced as a singular species. As described in the preceding single dimer model, the activation dynamics of these two RelA NF-κB dimers was coordinately regulated by signal responsive degradation and resynthesis of IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, and IκBδ during inflammatory signaling. The newly built model consists of 34 species, 138 reactions with 105 parameters; those describe the synthesis and degradation of NF-κB and IκBs, association and dissociation of IκB:NF-κB complexes, nuclear import and export of NF-κB and IκB species as well as processing of p100 (see a detailed wiring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix figure 1</xref>). Constrains generated based on our quantitative biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig10 fig11">Appendix figures 2–4</xref>) was used along with published literature and fitting procedures for parameterizing the model (see the description of the parameters in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data SD4-data">Supplementary files 1, 2</xref>).

The abundance of unbound NF-κB dimers was then scored using EMSA. Incubation with 25 nM IκBα was sufficient to completely inhibit RelA:p50 DNA binding. While, more than 200 nM of IκBα was required to inhibit RelA:p52 and RelA:RelA DNA binding, owing to weaker IκBα binding by these dimers.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a potentially novel synergistic effect of LTβR signaling on signaling from LPS-TLR4 that contributes to enhanced NF-kB activity at later time points after stimulation (∼24 hours). As LPS signaling to NF-kB proceeds through the canonical pathway and leads to p50:RelA and p50:c-Rel complexes, while LTβR signaling proceeds through NIK-IKK1 to promote processing of p100 to p52, which then associates with RelB (or is preassociated with it) to form activating p52:RelB dimers, the demonstration that LTβR-induced p52:RelA enhances the canonical pathway, is interesting. As the activation phase of the canonical NF-kB activity is determined by negative feedback through newly synthesized IκBα and IκBδ (as well as molecules such as A20), the ability of LTβR signaling to somehow overcome the observed reduction of canonical NF-kB activity, is also an interesting observation. Some of the data presented are indeed exciting, as is the progression of analysis from computational models to physiology.</p><p>The shortcomings of this paper pertain to important deficiencies in quantitation and statistical analysis of results, the lack of some key experimental controls, and there are some questions about the model. The following specific points need to be addressed in order to be considered further for publication.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Could the authors base their model more closely on an established model, for example their own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al. 2007</xref>, or the recent Yilmaz et al. 2014 and then identify very explicitly the reaction and parameters that are new (in separate tables) and justify those values within experimentally determined ranges?</p><p>2) Panel 1E is unclear. It seems to indicate that both early and late peaks of NEMO-IKK2 engage in crosstalk, contrary to the claim. This needs clarification.</p><p>3) Whereas 1B distinguishes between RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 the later figures do not seem to distinguish them, though this seems to be an important distinction later. The model should be used to make that distinction.</p><p>4) Panels within this figure (and others) should be arranged in order or presentation.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, experimental data is provided to test the computational predictions. Quantitated line or bar graphs should be shown. As effects are not obvious, statistical significance should be established.</p><p>Also, it is not clear why authors use the <italic>Ifnr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs. They previously stated that prolonged NFκB is dues to autocrine TNF. If they are interested in testing this they should use TNF or TNFR, and then the interferon knockouts may be a useful contrast.</p><p>Is it possible to show quantitation of late RelA induction in the presence of both signals from biological replicates? This should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The error bars between 3 biological replicates look surprisingly small in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. Why is this?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows transcriptomic analysis, but the analysis is not transparent. The presentation focuses on a crosstalk score, and says that NF-κB target genes are over-represented. How about the genes that are not amplified by the crosstalk? The authors only show LPS here, and it would be more complete in line with the biochemistry if the authors also showed IL1. They then show that this amplification is maintained in <italic>Relb</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> but it is not clear that these are the same genes.

Too little information is provided on how the parameterization was achieved and how the error/confidence intervals of experimental data translates to alternative parameter sets, which in turn may affect the results of the sensitivity analysis. Here, given the known regulation by p100 described in the Introduction the authors need no further justification for examining p100 in subsequent panels. Panel B should be quantitated and the three conditions should be run on the same gel, and statistically evaluated. The quantitative analysis could be restricted to the late time point(s). Panels C and D are important, and a quantitation of p50 vs p52 association with RelA should be provided. In B, could the authors add a p50 immunoblot? In C, using both p50 and p52 antibodies should result in ablation of the shift but this control is missing. Basically, we would expect an experimental counterpart for the computational panel F. Panel G is quantitated but a statistical confidence evaluation should be provided. Panel H directly relates to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and presumably these experiments were done in parallel. Have the authors also tried to use microarrays and undertaken the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is not easy to understand. It would be helpful if the following issues were addressed:</p><p>A) Why does panel B show the response to TNF, but everywhere else LPS and IL1 are compared?</p><p>B) Why is the <italic>Nfkb2</italic> mRNA fold induction different in panels A and B?</p><p>It is not clear what delay-null cells are. If they are simply the transgenic <italic>Nfkb2</italic> described in B, it would be more straightforward to use the same terminology. Panels E/F contain critically important information. They need to examine three conditions: LPS alone, LPS and LTβR, and LTβR alone. Also, there are really 4 cell types that are of interest: WT, <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>.</italic> and the two transgenes. Distinction should be drawn between RelAp50 and RelAp52. Panel G mentions a positive feedback loop, but the figure does not show any data related to p52. And strictly speaking no data was presented that RelAp52 produces more RelAp52. Finally, synergistic effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> occur at very early time points, and are therefore difficult to relate to duration synergy that happens at &gt;8h.</p><p>The top diagram seems to be one stimulation condition resulting in the green curve, and the bottom diagram related to the pink curve. Yet the top diagram also contains pink arrows. What makes things difficult to follow is that the canonical and non-canonical arrows come in from different directions, and it is unclear where the curved arrows are pointing.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows exciting data which puts the previous fibroblast studies in physiological context.</p><p>The following control might strengthen results (if possible): distinguish between RelAp50 and RelAp52 for panel E, similar to the analysis in 4D, and quantitate the levels of each.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> suggests that p100 KO's are more susceptible to Citronella infection, but that does not really prove that p52 complexes in LTβR induced synergy are responsible, and instead the p52 complexes might be acting on their own. Also as p100 KO's do not display any general sensitivity to infection, it is unclear whether the Citronella results are unique to these bacteria.</p><p>11) The observed effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> could be 'simply' due to lack of non-canonical NF-κB activation in response to LTβR in the NFκB2<sup>-/-</sup> strain. The crux of the duration model is that extended RelA activity is RelB-independent. The mouse experiments neither address whether RelA function is involved in pathogen clearance nor do they show that the effects are RelB-independent. How might this question be addressed?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Stimulus-selective crosstalk <italic>via</italic> the NF-κB signaling system reinforces innate immune response to alleviate gut infection” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor and one reviewer. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues pertinent to clarity of presentation that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) By calling the model NF-κB system model v. 1 it is not clear that the model is based on (and justified by) previous models. The authors should pick a different name (or is there a need for a name given that a model is generally cited with the paper reference?). Similarly the Table should be more explicit. Many values are described as “adapted from [REF]”. If the values are the same, that should be stated. If they were modified then a justification should be given. For some values the authors state “assumed to be similar to [another]”. They should state if they are the same, or when different a justification should be provided. The diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix figure 1</xref> could be confusing with many different shapes, colors and shadings. Why not adopt the normal conventions for kinetic model diagrams and indicate the species in the diagram itself rather than the legend? It is hard to keep track of the colors, and indeed it seems that the pink/orange shading in the legend became an orange/red shading in the diagram.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> the authors are focused on points that are missing in the range of &lt;2hrs. It is not evident from this figure what curves are missing, and so the figure is difficult to understand. They should find another way to make this point. Why not show the actual crosstalk score in a matrix of IKK2 and IKK1 profiles? That would avoid the inherent problems of applying a threshold (crosstalk proficient) which can also lead to misleading conclusions.</p><p>3) The quantitation added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seems surprising in some cases: for example in 2B LPS, the 3 and 5 h points are very different in the gel, but very similar in the graph with minimal error bars. There are several other points that do not transparently seem to square with the gel data. Because the graph is the result of 3 gels, it will not match precisely but the error bars should indicate the true standard deviation in the data. Some clarification of this point is required.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is still rather obscure. Why not show the genome-wide data in a more direct manner (e.g. heatmap) so that the quality of it can be assessed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> requires a wt control.

We would like to point out that we have already provided a detailed description of the model parameters in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data SD4-data">Supplementary file 1-2</xref>. As evident from these presentations, the majority of the parameter values are derived from the model versions previously published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref> (Cell. 2007 Jan 26;128(2):369-81) and to some extent, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shih et al., 2009</xref> (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Jun16;106(24):9619-2) as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shih et al., 2012</xref> (Nat Immunol. 2012 Dec;13(12):1162-70).</p><p>Following the suggestions by the reviewers, we have now explicitly identified the reactions and parameters that are new in a separate table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and provided justification for each of the parameter values. As presented in Table 3, the parameter values describing the biochemical reactions involving newly described RelA:p52 species was assumed to be similar to that of RelA:p50 dimer. In case of a deviation, such as those involving composite species (<italic>NFκB1</italic>) or RelA:p52 association with IkBs, additional experimental evidence has been provided and also indicated in the table. We hope that our new table will adequately capture the rigor in our model building efforts. Of note, Yilmaz et al. (2014), in their study mostly focused on interdependent p50 and p52 generation and did not model p52 containing DNA binding complexes.</p><p><italic>2) Panel 1E is unclear. It seems to indicate that both early and late peaks of NEMO-IKK2 engage in crosstalk, contrary to the claim. This needs clarification</italic>.</p><p>Consistent to our claim, our analyses indeed indicated that NEMO-IKK2 activities with less than 2h of duration are unlikely to engage into crosstalk. Of note, the library used in our experiment consisted of 46 IKK2 inputs with duration ≤ 2h. Yet, none of these short-duration IKK2 activities engaged into signaling crosstalk as reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (top panel). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>, we have further verified our claim by using representative short-duration NEMO-IKK2 inputs. Although, the duration threshold for NEMO-IKK2 was somewhat less elaborate as compared to NIK-IKK1, which exhibited a duration threshold of ∼ 8h (bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We suspect that this difference may have attributed to the undesired confusion undermining NEMO-IKK2 duration control. Notably, this rather narrow time scale in the NEMO-IKK2 duration threshold was effective in discriminating between IL-1R and TLR4 signaling with respect to crosstalk. In the revised text, we have further restructured the pertinent section to highlight the differences between NEMO-IKK2 and NIK-IKK1 activities in the quantum of the duration threshold (in the subsection headed “A duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling”).</p><p><italic>3) Whereas 1B distinguishes between RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 the later figures do not seem to distinguish them, though this seems to be an important distinction later. The model should be used to make that distinction.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the apparent logical gap in the figure presentation that may have generated distraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Although RelA:p52 dimers accounted for only a minor RelA/NF-κB nuclear activity during canonical or non-canonical signaling, the distinction between RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 dimer was made for merely validating the faithfulness of the model in recapitulating experimental data. In the revised draft, instead we have presented the simulation data for total nuclear RelA/NF-κB activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. We agree that such distinction is largely peripheral for confirming the effectiveness of the mathematical model. As also suggested by the reviewers, such distinction by mathematical model instead provided powerful argument in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in revealing the plausible mechanism underlying crosstalk control. As discussed later (point [7]), we have now used the mathematical modeling data revealing enhanced level of nuclear RelA:p52 in the crosstalk settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> in the earlier version) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> to suggest the involvement of <italic>Nfkb2</italic>-derived RelA:p52 in crosstalk. Accordingly, we have made alterations in the text in the Results section; those did not adversely impact the major conclusions, but offered more streamlined logical progress in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Panels within this figure (and others) should be arranged in order or presentation</italic>.</p><p>While apologizing for the unintended confusion, we have now arranged all the panels in order of presentation in the respective figures in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, experimental data is provided to test the computational predictions. Quantitated line or bar graphs should be shown. As effects are not obvious, statistical significance should be established</italic>.</p><p>Our experimental data demonstrated that late RelA NF-κB response to the co-treatment regime is augmented as compared to solitary LPS treatment. Although, the effect on amplitude may appear less dramatic, LTβR cotreatment led to chronically elevated RelA NF-κB activity between 8 -24h as compared to diminishing RelA NF-κB response in solitary TLR4 regime. We argue that the subtitle for the pertinent subsection “Stimulus specific crosstalk allows LTβR signal to prolong TLR4 induced RelA NF-κB response” aptly reflects this effect of LTβ R cotreatment in prolonging TLR4 induced RelA NF-κ B response. As recommended by the reviewers, we have now included the quantitated bar graphs along with statistical tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the revised manuscript to further strengthen our claim. These bar diagrams were part of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> in the initial submission, and now they have been included in the main text. We have also removed the panel merely showing a longer exposure of the EMSA gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in our revised manuscript to accommodate newer panels in the main figure.</p><p><italic>Also, it is not clear why authors use the</italic> Ifnr1<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>MEFs. They previously stated that prolonged NFκB is dues to autocrine TNF. If they are interested in testing this they should use TNF or TNFR, and then the interferon knockouts may be a useful contrast</italic>.</p><p>Although, the contribution of Trif in prolonging IKK2 activity downstream of TLR4 is well established, whether the autocrine TNF is solely responsible for mediating the effects of Trif remains an active area of research. Indeed, recent studies have established a direct role of Trif in engaging NEMO-IKK2 complex for NF-κ B activation (reviewed in Kawai and Akira, Nature Immunol, 2010). In the revised text, we have now restructured the relevant sentence (in the subsection headed “A duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling”) to omit the section unnecessarily emphasizing on TNF autocrine. Given the lack of clarity on function of TNF autocrine, we choose to use <italic>Trif</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, and not <italic>Tnfr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, MEFs in our biochemical analyses those only transiently induced NEMO-IKK2 activity downstream of TLR4. However, we agree with the reviewers’ perspective that <italic>Ifnr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> does not provide for a powerful contrast with <italic>Trif</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>. As the reviewers have also indicated, we concur that <italic>Ifnr1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> data appears to be superfluous for establishing the duration code and actually could be distracting. Therefore, we have removed the relevant figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> in the earlier version) and restructured the text in the revised manuscript (in the subsection headed “Stimulus specific crosstalk allows LTβR signal to prolong TLR4 induced RelA NF-κB response”).</p><p><italic>Is it possible to show quantitation of late RelA induction in the presence of both signals from biological replicates?

Given the complex biological question, we have normalized the EMSA signals against the respective IL-1 induced (0.5h) or LPS induced (1h) peak values. As one could anticipate, differences in the normalized data intensities were less obvious, in contrast to the variations in the raw signal intensities normally observed (and we also noted) in different experiments. We have now placed the data quantification (previously presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> in main text, respectively, in the revised manuscript.

The presentation focuses on a crosstalk score, and says that NF-κB target genes are over-represented. How about the genes that are not amplified by the crosstalk? The authors only show LPS here, and it would be more complete in line with the biochemistry if the authors also showed IL1. They then show that this amplification is maintained in</italic> Relb<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>but it is not clear that these are the same genes.

We would like to point out that the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a correlation study, which offered global confirmation for a role of NF-κB in the heightened expressions of LPS induced genes in the costimulation regime. We have provided a detailed description of the gene-expression analyses those include methodologies used for estimating crosstalk scores (included in the Materials and methods in the main text in the revised draft), crosstalk scores of the individual genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3–source data 1</xref> in the revised draft) as well as identity of the genes belonging to the NF- κB target gene set used for GSEA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3–source data 2</xref> in the revised draft). As indicated by the reviewers, we have also noted that several genes were actually downregulated in the costimulation regime. But specific enrichment of NF-κB targets among the hyper-induced genes in GSEA conversely validated that these downregulated genes were less likely to be NF-κB targets. TLR4 signaling, however, activates multiple other transcription factors those include members of ATF, IRF as well as STAT family. At this point, it remains unclear to us if the observed downregulation of gene-expressions is attributed by any of these transcription factors. Owing to a lack of bona fide target gene sets validated through experimental analyses, we were unable to further test the possible engagement of other transcription factors in GSEA. Instead restricting the scope of our conclusion, we could narrowly infer that the augmented RelA NF-κB activity observed in the nucleus in the costimulation regime leads to heightened NF-κB dependent gene-expressions. We have also performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirming heightened expressions of several NF-κB target chemokine/cytokine genes in the costimulation regime.</p><p>Concurring to the suggestions by the reviewers, we have now performed additional quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealing that LTβR costimulation did not alter IL-1 induced expressions of known NF-κB target chemokine or cytokine genes. This additional data now has been incorporated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> in the revised manuscript (in the subsection headed “Signal integration via the NF-κB system amplifies the late expressions of TLR4 induced pro-inflammatory genes”).</p><p>Agreeing to the reviewers’ suggestions, we have placed the quantitative RT-PCR data using <italic>Relb</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> in the revised manuscript to contrast with the <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>data (in the subsection headed “Non-canonical signal transducer <italic>Nfkb2</italic> supplements RelA:p52 dimer to sustain canonical RelA NF-κB responses”). Given our quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed an abrogated crosstalk control for several pro-inflammatory, NF-κB target genes, we did not pursue global-scale gene analyses using <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs. Of note, GSEA for NF-κB targets is expected to be largely inconsequential in the absence of heightened expressions of genes in the costimulation regime. As indicated later, to maintain the consistency in the data presentation, we have also excluded the microarray data obtained using <italic>Relb</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> MEFs in the revised manuscript and accordingly limited the scope of our conclusion in the revised text.</p><p>Despite these changes, the major conclusion that “LTβR costimulation led to the hyperactivation of LPS-induced known RelA target chemokine/cytokine genes in a RelB independent, but <italic>Nfkb2</italic> dependent manner” was preserved.

In this context, we have presented the TNF data and referred to the earlier research, which originally articulated the delay function (Basak et al., Cell 2007).

Second, additional studies could convincingly demonstrate that constitutive expression of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> abrogates crosstalk-amplification of TLR4 induced late NF-κB activity by concomitant LTβR signal and that NF-κB inducible expression of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> in the revised draft, additional data). Of note, LTβR response per se was not considerably different in these two cell-lines.</p><p>Furthermore, our supershift analyses revealed that inducible expression of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> transgene augments RelA/NF-κB activation in the crosstalk settings by potentiating RelA:p52 dimer induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> in the revised draft, additional data). Indeed, these additional analyses supported our hypothesis that NF-κB inducible synthesis of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> potentiates RelA:p52 induction to generate crosstalk at the level of RelA/NF-κB activation.

In a suitably sub-titled result section, we have further examined the requirement for inducible synthesis of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in crosstalk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In response to reviewers’ concern, we have now incorporated additional experimental evidence in the revised manuscript demonstrating a role of RelA:p52 in crosstalk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>.</p><p>Several recent studies have strongly suggested that RelA containing heterodimers share DNA binding and gene-expression specificities (Siggers et al., Nature Immunol 2011; Zhao et al., Cell Reports 2014).

Pretreatment of these engineered cells with αLTβR for 8h and subsequent IL -1 treatment effectively converged the non-canonical signal to IL-1 induced <italic>Nfkb2</italic> feedback, thereby, potentiating p52 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>) and prolonging IL-1 induced RelA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1D</xref>). Correlating with the early onset of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> mRNA induction in response to IL-1 treatment, observed crosstalk effects were obvious within 1h of cotreatment in these cells. In the revised manuscript, we have attempted to further clarify this issue (please see the subsection entitled “Inducible synthesis of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> by canonical signal triggers a positive feedback loop during crosstalk”).</p><p><italic>The top diagram seems to be one stimulation condition resulting in the green curve, and the bottom diagram related to the pink curve.

Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have repeated the supershift analyses using nuclear extracts derived from IECs. Our additional experiments revealed considerable nuclear accumulation of RelA:p52 dimer, along with RelA:p50, in the enterocytes at day5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref> in the revised manuscript, see revised text in the subsection headed “<italic>Nfkb2</italic> integrates lymphotoxin signal within intestinal niche to reinforce epithelial NF-κB responses to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>”). As pointed out later, it also seems that our previous supplementary data showing the absence of RelB containing NF-κB dimers in enterocytes was not adequately noticed.

We assume that the reviewers may have enquired about the possible engagement of RelB:p52 complexes, which is generated independent of crosstalk regulations, in pathogen response. Using colon derived MSIE cells, we could show that solitary LTβR stimulation only weakly activates NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). But as a co-stimulus, LTβR signal significantly augmented TLR4 induced RelA activity in these intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, our supershift analyses clearly demonstrated a complete absence of RelB DNA binding complexes in the enterocytes derived from infected WT mice. Given the importance of the question, we have repeated the supershift analyses and incorporated the supershift data in the revised main text in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> revealing that nuclear NF-κB activity is exclusively composed of RelA dimers in IECs. Our additional experiments also revealed considerable nuclear accumulation of RelA:p52 dimer along with RelA:p50 in the enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that the observed defect in the innate immune response to Citrobacter infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>- /-</italic></sup> mice unlikely involve epithelial RelB activity. Notably, our analyses also confirmed a critical requirement of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> in the non-hematopoietic cells in imparting resilience to pathogen infection. Although, we agree that the observed mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) could be, in fact, a consequence of deficiencies in the several other cell compartments and may include crosstalk independent <italic>Nfkb2</italic> functions. As discussed in the Results section (please see the subheading “Stromal expression of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> is required for limiting <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection”) and in the Discussion, we also do not rule out crosstalk-independent engagement of the <italic>Nfkb2</italic> pathway in other cell-types at a later stage of infection, those may contribute to the observed mortality in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, epithelial RelA NF-κB activation defects coupled to aggravated early colon pathology and early onset of mortality in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggested that the stromal requirement of <italic>Nfkb2</italic>, at least in part, lies within the intestinal epithelial cells in the initial events controlling early innate immunity and involves crosstalk regulations. In the revised manuscript, we have subtly altered the text in the relevant Results section discussing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to address the point raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Also as p100 KO's do not display any general sensitivity to infection, it is unclear whether the Citronella results are unique to these bacteria</italic>.</p><p>In an accompanying unpublished study, we are addressing the cell-type specificity of signaling crosstalk between LTβR and TLR4. Our analyses established that such crosstalk regulations are less likely to be important in myelomonocytic cells. A related manuscript articulating the mechanism underlying cell-type specificity of crosstalk control is currently in preparation. While these results offer an explanation for the apparent lack of general sensitivity in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, additional studies will be important to further examine the immune responses in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to other microbial pathogens, particularly those infected through the gut. We have now discussed this issue in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>11) The observed effects in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6G</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>could be 'simply' due to lack of non-canonical NF-κB activation in response to LTβR in the NFκB2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>strain</italic>.</p><p>The point [11] raised by the reviewers is not very different from the point [10] raised earlier. Unlike the mechanistic studies in the cell culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5">Figure 1-5</xref>), directly linking <italic>Nfkb2</italic> dependent RelA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with the mouse phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is somewhat daunting. We could ascertain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that crosstalk amplification of epithelial RelA response by <italic>Nfkb2</italic> potentiates the expressions of neutrophil-attracting chemokine and cytokine genes. We have gladly noted that the reviewers have lauded our experimental approach and agreed with the interpretation of the data [point 9]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> in the revised draft), we have simply concluded that defective epithelial expressions of chemokine and cytokine genes may have led to diminished neutrophil recruitment.</p><p>We would also like to also point out that prior analysis with <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice revealed only mild lymph node phenotype (Lo et al., Blood 2006), unlike a complete lack of lymph nodes in <italic>ltbr</italic><sup><italic>--/-</italic></sup> mice. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that constitutive RelB:p50 activity largely compensates for the absence of LTβR induced RelB:p52 activity in this knockout. These results suggest that the defect in non- canonical RelB:p52 activation in response to LTβR is tolerated in Nfkb2<sup>-/-</sup> system. Although, we do not rule out crosstalk-independent engagement of the <italic>Nfkb2</italic> pathway in other cell-types at a later stage of infection, those may contribute to the observed mortality in <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. In the revised text, we have attempted to further clarify this point and toned down the interpretation of our mortality data (in the subsection headed “Stromal expression of <italic>Nfkb2</italic> is required for limiting <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection”).</p><p><italic>The crux of the duration model is that extended RelA activity is RelB-independent. The mouse experiments neither address whether RelA function is involved in pathogen clearance nor do they show that the effects are RelB-independent. How might this question be addressed?</italic></p><p>In general, a critical role of RelA/NF-κB in the pro-inflammatory gene-expressions is firmly established. Indeed, genetic studies have confirmed a requirement of RelA in the epithelial expressions of chemokine and cytokine genes and consequent neutrophil recruitment in LPS induced pneumonia (Alcamo et al., J. Immunol., 2001). In the revised manuscript, we have now cited this important contribution in the subsection “<italic>Nfkb2</italic> integrates lymphotoxin signal within intestinal niche to reinforce epithelial NF-κB responses to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>”. Furthermore, TLR4 activated RelA was implicated in the chemokine gene expressions and neutrophil recruitment upon bacterial infections (Khan et al., Infect. Immunity., 2006, discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion section). Consistent to these reports, our study revealed a correlation between diminished RelA activity in IECs and the inability of <italic>Nfkb2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice in limiting bacterial infection. Furthermore, our supershift analyses clearly demonstrated a complete absence of RelB DNA binding complexes in the enterocytes derived from infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results strongly suggested that epithelial NF-κ B response to pathogen infection is mediated by RelA in a RelB independent manner. Of note, pre-existing conditions in <italic>Relb</italic> <sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>mice with signatures of multiorgan inflammation and a complete lack of secondary lymph nodes (Weih et al, Cell 1995) deterred us from further analyzing these mice in Citrobacter infection experiments. In light of these constructive criticisms and concerns, however, we have felt the necessity to moderate the interpretation of our <italic>in vivo</italic> data. Accordingly, we have emphasized the correlative nature of our argument in the aforementioned subsection and indicated a possible role of RelB in other cell-types in pathogen response.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) By calling the model NF-κB system model v. 1 it is not clear that the model is based on (and justified by) previous models. The authors should pick a different name (or is there a need for a name given that a model is generally cited with the paper reference?)</italic>.</p><p>We are fully aware of elegant model building efforts of other NF-κB research groups. While apologizing, we certainly did not intend to suppress that the core circuitry as well as the parameter space of our current NF-κB multidimer model was largely based upon previously published single dimer model versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shih et al., 2009</xref>). However, we would like to point out that the scope and the detailed wiring of our current model is significantly different. As such, the NF-κB Systems model <italic>v.</italic>1 describes two different RelA NF-κB heterodimers, but as composite species. In an iterative model building effort, my laboratory has now implemented another advanced NF-κB model (The NF-κB systems model <italic>v</italic>.2), which depicts dimerization of the NF-κB monomers forming various heterodimers. In the future, we hope to expand the scope of the model to arrive at the NF-κB systems model <italic>v</italic>.3, which would address issues pertinent to homodimeric NF-κB species. We feel that it is somewhat important to name these model versions generated in a research program to maintain a catalogue of these incremental advances. Although a detailed description with relevant references has been presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix-1</xref>, we have now also referred to those preceding model versions at the first occurrence of the NF-κB systems Model <italic>v</italic>.1 to avoid further confusion (in the subsection entitled “A duration code controlling crosstalk between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling”).</p><p><italic>Similarly the Table should be more explicit. Many values are described as</italic> “<italic>adapted from [REF]</italic>”<italic>. If the values are the same, that should be stated. If they were modified then a justification should be given. For some values the authors state</italic> “<italic>assumed to be similar to [another]</italic>”<italic>. They should state if they are the same, or when different a justification should be provided</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, the terminology “adapted from” indicates that the parameter values were derived from another model version, but were subjected to minor modifications (fitting) for adapting to the newer wiring in the NF-κB Systems Model version 1.0. Concurring to the suggestion, we have now modified the table presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> to indicate the quantum of modification with proper justification. Also in the modified table presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, we have now explicitly mentioned if the values were identical. In case of a deviation, we have provided justification using our biochemical data. We have now included a summary note in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> to highlight the changes.</p><p>As such, out of the total 105-parameter values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), 34 were identical to those published in earlier model versions. Moreover, 20 were derived from the published literature, but were subjected to a minor &lt; 3 fold modification for adapting to the NF-κB Systems Model version 1.0. Another 4 parameters were modified &lt; 5 fold for fitting. For additional 12 parameters, further experimental evidence was provided to justify the alterations. Furthermore, another 27 parameters related to the newly described RelA:p52 dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were assumed to be identical to those of the RelA:p50 dimer, and the assumption was justified using our own experimental measurements and literature. An exception was being made for the association rates underlying RelA:p52-IkB complex formation (a total of 8 parameters) basing on our experimental analyses.</p><p><italic>The diagram in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Appendix figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>could be confusing with many different shapes, colors and shadings. Why not adopt the normal conventions for kinetic model diagrams and indicate the species in the diagram itself rather than the legend? It is hard to keep track of the colors, and indeed it seems that the pink/orange shading in the legend became an orange/red shading in the diagram.</italic></p><p>Accepting the constructive criticism, we have now presented the diagram adhering to the formalism followed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>. Not only, we have eliminated the color scheme, but also specified the species names in the diagram.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref> <italic>the authors are focused on points that are missing in the range of &lt;2hrs. It is not evident from this figure what curves are missing, and so the figure is difficult to understand. They should find another way to make this point. Why not show the actual crosstalk score in a matrix of IKK2 and IKK1 profiles? That would avoid the inherent problems of applying a threshold (crosstalk proficient) which can also lead to misleading conclusions</italic>.</p><p>For the past few years, we have been discussing the possible mode of presentation of the duration code data with several of our colleagues. As such, for a given duration of IKK2 or IKK1 (a+b), there are multiple kinase activities within the library those differ with respect to peak amplitude (h) and peak onset time (a) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>). For a specific IKK2 activity explicitly defined through peak duration, amplitude and onset time, again all possible IKK1 activities must be considered for evaluating its crosstalk potency. We argue that hierarchical clustering of kinase profiles in a given axis would be even more arbitrary. Therefore, we contest that it is not possible to present crosstalk score in a matrix of IKK2 and IKK1 profiles in a two-dimensional plot as suggested. Unfortunately, even a three-dimensional plot would be insufficient. To remain connected to a broader audience (the manuscript describes bacterial colitis studies), we did not consider other multidimensional plotting modalities. Instead, we have attempted to reduce the complexity of the data by analyzing top 10% crosstalk proficient IKK2 or IKK1 profiles separately for peak duration or amplitude. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>, we have further utilized candidate kinase activity profiles in a case study to confirm fidelity of our interpretation. Moreover, use of experimentally derived long-duration or short-duration kinase activities consistently confirmed the presence of a duration code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). With these arguments, we hope to be able to convince you of our rigor in ensuring that threshold intrinsic issues did not lead to erroneous conclusions in our study.</p><p><italic>3) The quantitation added to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>seems surprising in some cases: for example in 2B LPS, the 3 and 5 h points are very different in the gel, but very similar in the graph with minimal error bars. There are several other points that do not transparently seem to square with the gel data. Because the graph is the result of 3 gels, it will not match precisely but the error bars should indicate the true standard deviation in the data. Some clarification of this point is required</italic>.</p><p>As described in Materials and methods, gel images were acquired using PhosphorImager (GE, Amersham, UK) and quantified in ImageQuant software. We agree that the reduction in NFκB activity at 3h was less obvious in the quantitation panel as compared to the presented gel picture. As suggested by the reviewers, the quantitation panel reflects an average of 3 experiments. Note error bar for the 3h time-point is largest among all LPS time-points that indicate variations in the 3h data point in replicate experiments. As explained earlier in response to reviewers’ comments, we have normalized EMSA signals against respective IL-1 induced (0.5h) or LPS induced (1h) peak values. As one could anticipate, our normalization procedure led to lesser-pronounced error bars, including those for 3h LPS data point. In the revised draft, we have now separately indicated data normalization procedure for LPS regime (see Figure legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As such, 3h LPS time-point is also peripheral to our principal claim that LTβR costimulation augments LPS induced late NFκB activity.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>is still rather obscure. Why not show the genome-wide data in a more direct manner (e.g. heatmap) so that the quality of it can be assessed</italic>.</p><p>We would like to point out that our experimental settings compare three different cell-conditions, viz. LPS stimulated, αLTβR treated and costimulated. We would also like to emphasize that the goal of our genome-wide analyses was to identify a set of genes those are synergistically activated, and not merely hyperinduced, in the costimulation regime. Although suitable for presenting differential gene-expressions for a given stimulation regime, traditional heatmaps, with very small dynamic range, are inept in capturing synergistic gene-activations that require simultaneous and complex comparisons across multiple stimulation regimes. Therefore, we have adapted a previously published methodology (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et. al., 2006</xref>), which enables comparison of multiple stimulation regimes. Indeed, our crosstalk score based analyses identified 114 genes those are not only hyperinduced, but synergistically activated in the costimulation regime as compared to solitary LPS or α LTβR treatments (see bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). More so, heatmap based analyses are not expected to disclose if synergistically activated genes are also likely to be NF-κB targets. Based on the literature survey and our discussions with several experts, we trust that GSEA (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Subramanian et. al., 2005</xref>) offers best possible solution to the complex problem, which we have addressed. Note, we have referred to the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> in the text while concluding synergistic gene-effects (please see “Signal integration via the NF-κB system amplifies the late expressions of TLR4 induced pro-inflammatory genes”). In essence, we submit that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is as such more informative, in conjunction with the detailed methodologies, than a mere heatmap presentation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4H</italic></xref> <italic>requires a wt control.
