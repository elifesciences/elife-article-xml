Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoietic niche</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>slit-robo</kwd><kwd>organogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD083185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Kara A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD111208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Kara A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM138705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenhart</surname><given-names>Kari F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM125123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anllo</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM136270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiNardo</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD111973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiNardo</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new example of niche formation, revealing the mode of niche cell migration, implicates extrinsic sources of positional information, and uncovers the pathway required for stereotypical positioning of the niche.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homeostasis and repair of many organs relies on a resident stem cell population. Stem cell behavior is often coordinated by a niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>)—the specific microenvironment that contains stem cells—and abnormal regulation can severely impact health by leading to tissue atrophy or tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferraro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobielak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walkley et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is essential to understand stem cell-niche interactions. An important step in understanding the behavior of a mature niche is understanding the particular attributes it acquires—such as cellular features and the positioning of its cells with respect to each other and stem cells—and how those attributes are regulated as the niche is built during development. Yet, there are very few studies of niche formation at the cellular level. The few well-studied niches consistently acquire tissue-specific positional and structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anllo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biggs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sumigray et al., 2018</xref>). The reproducibility of these characteristics suggests that acquisition of a particular architecture is essential to niche function and emphasizes the importance of understanding how the architecture of a given niche is established.</p><p>Frequent barriers to studying niche formation include niche complexity and lack of niche cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heitman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>). Studying niche formation in vivo is further hindered by an inability to follow its constituent cells as they form the niche in real-time due to lack of tissue and organism transparency, and the existence of large-scale tissue movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bostock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulais and Frenette, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gregg and Butcher, 2012</xref>). The mammalian hematopoietic stem cell niche is a prime example of a difficult-to-study niche due to its location within opaque bone and its complexity—it is comprised of numerous cellular components and molecular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulais and Frenette, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calvi et al., 2003</xref>). Despite these limitations, some niches, such as the mammalian intestinal epithelium and hair follicle, are beginning to be studied at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anllo and DiNardo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Díaz-Torres et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pentinmikko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sumigray et al., 2018</xref>). However, investigations about establishment of these well-characterized niches still suffer from challenges including limited real-time imaging and lack of tissue-specific manipulations.</p><p>To overcome these limitations and gain insight into the mechanisms that drive niche formation, we have investigated the development of the niche that supports the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic organ: the lymph gland (LG). The cells that constitute this niche, called the posterior signaling center (PSC), and the markers that label it are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the PSC resides under a thin epidermal covering, making it amenable to live-imaging with high spatial resolution, as we show here. The dynamic information afforded by live-imaging can reveal the mechanism of migration and implicate nearby tissues as a source for guiding signals. These advantages, paired with facile <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics, make for a powerful experimental system in which PSC formation can be visualized in vivo and the underlying mechanisms probed.</p><p>Minimal information exists about the formation of the PSC, as most analyses of the lymph gland have focused on the steady-state operations of late larval stages when the gland is mature and most accessible due to its larger size. While the mature LGs are comprised of multiple pairs of lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koranteng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shrestha and Gateff, 1982</xref>), we use ‘lymph gland’ to refer to only one of the pair of thoroughly characterized, bilaterally symmetric ‘primary’ lobes. In late larval stages, the LG contains thousands of cells, organized into multiple zones: the medullary, intermediate, and cortical zones, and the PSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). The PSC regulates the adjacent hematopoietic progenitors of the medullary zone; these progenitors are progressively differentiated from the innermost region of the LG, radially outward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). The mature, terminally differentiated hemocytes reside at the outermost cortex of the gland, in the cortical zone, and between these zones are the cells of the intermediate zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Spratford et al., 2021</xref>). Recent scRNA-seq analyses have identified new types of hemocytes in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Girard et al., 2021</xref>), but the three main types are analogous to vertebrate myeloid cells and include crystal cells, plasmatocytes, and lamellocytes, which are responsible for wound healing and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rizki and Rizki, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The larval PSC facilitates wound repair, immune response, and homeostasis and does so by performing two key functions: maintaining progenitors and inducing progenitor differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>). PSC positioning is such that it contacts both the least differentiated progenitors and mature hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2005</xref>), a seemingly prime location where the PSC is poised to both implement regulation and receive feedback, thereby maintaining homeostasis in the LG. For example, upon immune challenge, the PSC senses and responds to the threat by instructing differentiation of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sinenko et al., 2012</xref>). The PSC engages multiple signaling pathways to execute its roles and relies on cell biological characteristics of its component cells, such as occluding or gap junctions, to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ho et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>PSC functionality is integral for organism health, as PSC loss can cause precocious differentiation of progenitors under homeostatic conditions and inability to produce lamellocytes under immune challenge conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). PSC-regulated homeostatic maintenance of the larval LG is crucial, as the LG will ultimately rupture, releasing its constituents into circulation to contribute to the hematopoietic pool in pupal and adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holz et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, recent publications suggest that the PSC itself adopts new functions upon LG rupture – PSC cells become highly motile and phagocytic and are capable of transdifferentiating into lamellocytes or plasmatocytes upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hirschhäuser et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Though the late larval PSC is comprised of about 30–50 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>), it is initially specified as only about five cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). The expansion of PSC cell number takes place only after the five cells become organized into the PSC at the posterior of the developing LG during late stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). How the PSC becomes consistently positioned after specification is unknown and is our focus here. The LG itself is specified about mid-way through embryogenesis, around stage 12, from cardiogenic mesoderm as three cell clusters located laterally—one in each thoracic segment (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). The PSC is specified from the posterior-most LG cells by expression of Antennapedia and the silencing of Homothorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). A transcription factor, Collier, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of mammalian early B-cell factor, is initially expressed in the entire LG primordium but becomes restricted to the PSC and is necessary for its maintenance and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>). From fixed preparations, its known that the three LG clusters coalesce along the anterior-posterior axis before reaching the dorsal midline. At the end of embryogenesis, the cluster of PSC niche cells resides at the posterior of each bilaterally symmetric lymph gland; each gland flanks the dorsal vessel—the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart—at the dorsal midline (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Apart from this description nothing is known about how the PSC is built, and no live-imaging of the PSC has been conducted during embryogenesis. Despite the probable importance of PSC positioning to later function, the mechanism of migration, the signals guiding migration, and interactions among constituent cells—each integral aspects of organogenesis—are entirely unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live-imaging reveals dynamics of PSC migration and presence of nearby muscles.</title><p>All images are oriented with anterior to the left and posterior to the right.

We find that a prominent, regulated feature of this niche is the migration of its constituent cells as a collective. Live-imaging also revealed neighboring tissues that could feasibly signal to influence PSC migration as well as its positioning in the LG. Using genetic ablation and mutant analyses, we have identified that both the dorsal vessel and visceral mesoderm are required for proper positioning of the PSC. In addition, mutant analyses and tissue-specific challenges revealed an intricate web of Slit-Robo signaling in and between these tissues that is essential to establish positioning of PSC cells as a coalesced, compact collective at the LG posterior. Finally, we use live-imaging to show that Slit signaling is essential to maintain collectivity of PSC cells and properly position these cells during their migration. Taken together, we have uncovered a new example of collective cell migration, revealed some of its mechanistic underpinnings, and implicated a signaling relay required to properly build and position this niche.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Live-imaging reveals dynamics of PSC formation</title><p>While PSC formation is undoubtedly a dynamic process, current knowledge is derived exclusively from static timepoints using fixed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, we sought to visualize the entirety of PSC migration in real time. To identify and track PSC cells live, we first confirmed their location at various time points in fixed embryos using the accepted markers, Antp and Odd, where co-expression demarcates PSC cells. We characterized PSC positioning in stages ranging from migration onset, stage 14, until migration completion, stage 16 (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’–F’</xref>). Prior to migration, the PSC appeared as a compact cluster of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green underline), it appeared more elongated through mid-migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), and ultimately it assumed a compact, clustered organization at the posterior of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). During migration and upon its completion, the PSC flanked Antp + cardioblasts of the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, brackets). Though not explored further here, ECM components, Perlecan and Viking, were expressed around the PSC collective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), including between the PSC and the adjacent cardioblasts (CBs) of the dorsal vessel.</p><p>The prospective cells of the LG and CBs lie just under a sheet of epidermis that itself undergoes dramatic movement in late-stage embryos, concurrent with LG and CB migration. Leading edge (LE) epidermal cells move to the dorsal midline during dorsal closure, which is complete by stage 16. It has previously been shown that CBs migrate independently of LE epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaghi et al., 2023</xref>). To address whether the LG/PSC also migrates independently, we assessed LG positioning in stage 17 mutants in which dorsal closure had stalled. Both heterozygous and homozygous <italic>hlh54f</italic><sup>598</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B, C</xref>, respectively) exhibited defects in closure, evident by epidermal leading edge (LE) cells that stalled at lateral positions (LE indicated by cyan lines). Embryos stained with p-Tyr to label cell membranes and Odd to label the LG were scored for position of the LGs relative to the stalled LE. In over two-thirds of cases the LG had migrated past the stalled LE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), indicating that LG migration is generally uncoupled from this large-scale epidermal movement, similar to the case for CBs.</p><p>To our knowledge, a sufficiently bright, stable marker that labels only PSC cells during migration stages does not exist. Thus, for live-imaging we combined Hand-RFP, which marks lymph gland (including the PSC) and CBs, with a myristoylated GFP driven by Antp-GAL4 (Antp &gt;myrGFP) to mark the PSC but not other lymph gland cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). We performed timelapse imaging on embryos beginning after PSC specification (stage 13) until the PSC completed migration and morphogenesis (stage 17). We observed that the PSC moved as a collective for the entire migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). During migration many PSC cells extended protrusions—some reached far anteriorly, encasing the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’</xref>, bracket) while others were shorter or branched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’’’</xref>, arrowheads). The protrusions exhibited no apparent directional bias but were more common at non-dorsal vessel-adjacent surfaces of the collective. During migration some cells shifted positioning with respect to one another (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). For example, two lateral PSC cells that abut early on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, 0m, arrowhead) become separated by interdigitating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, 8-40m, magenta and green dots). In general, however, most cells remained at relatively fixed positions within the collective—particularly the posterior-most, dorsal vessel-adjacent PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, orange dots and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p>Overall, the features observed during live-imaging lead us to characterize PSC formation as collective cell migration. The intricate, dynamic extensions we observed on PSC cells reflect an active actin-based cytoskeleton—a common theme amongst migrating cell collectives, where these extensions are often used for sensing environmental guidance cues. Most importantly, even as some PSC cells shifted their position relative to one another, the group accomplished directional movement while maintaining coalescence. The persistence of PSC-to-PSC cell contacts despite internal movements suggests coordination within the group to orchestrate remodeling of cell adhesion such that a unified directional movement is achieved. Altogether, these features are consistent with this as an example of collective cell migration, and suggest the importance of collectivity in building the PSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Visceral, cardiac, and alary muscles are near the PSC throughout its migration</title><p>Crucially, live-imaging also uncovered that the PSC was within signaling distance of various muscles for the entirety of its migration. It is well-documented that muscles can supply positional information to nearby tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anllo and DiNardo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scimone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>), and our imaging indicated that visceral muscle (or, visceral mesoderm; Vm) and CBs were each near the PSC.

The PSC remained laterally affixed to Antp +CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J’</xref>, blue) and slightly dorsal to, but not contacting, Antp +Vm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J’</xref>, orange) throughout migration.</p><p>Based on segmental positioning, we suspected the PSC was also near alary muscle (AM)—segmentally repeating muscles that attach internal organs to the body wall.

Indeed, the first AM was immediately lateral to the PSC for the entirety of their synchronized migration to the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, PSCs outlined in green). We confirmed this proximity by fixing <italic>org-1</italic>-HN39::RFP embryos and staining for Antp, which revealed that at late stages, the A1 AM ensheathed the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), with some fibers encasing individual PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, live-imaging provided invaluable insights, advancing our knowledge of PSC formation from that attainable through analysis of fixed preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), by revealing the mode of PSC migration and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PSC relative to nearby tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).

Thus, to test the requirement for Robo signaling, we analyzed single and double <italic>robo1</italic> and <italic>robo2</italic> mutants. For both single mutants, about 50% of embryos had abnormal PSC positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>, arrowheads).

We confirmed that two independent Slit RNAi’s eliminated nearly all Slit accumulation at CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O’ , and Q’</xref>), while Robo overexpression resulted in more pronounced Slit accumulation on CB membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S</xref>) compared to control CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M’</xref>). PSCs were abnormally positioned more frequently under all challenge conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N, P and R</xref>) compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S</xref>).

To block Slit produced by Vm from signaling to PSCs, we sequestered Slit specifically in Vm using bap-GAL4 to overexpress Robo1. This manipulation prevents diffusion of Slit away from the tissue, as evidenced by distinct accumulation of Slit on Vm membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Z</xref>) compared to diffuse Slit puncta in control Vm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3W</xref>). Under this condition, we indeed found that PSCs were mis-positioned significantly more often (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AA</xref>; quantified in 3BB). Taken together, these data suggest that Vm and CB-derived Slit signaling are both required for PSC positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Vm influences dorsal vessel positioning</title><p>While the data thus far supported a simple model wherein Slit secreted from Vm and CBs acts directly on Robo receptors expressed by PSC cells to influence PSC positioning, further investigation revealed a more complex situation. Autocrine Slit-Robo signaling among dorsal vessel cells is important for proper polarity and organization of the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Medioni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santiago-Martínez et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, in experiments where Slit was sequestered in Vm, we noticed defects in the organization of the cardioblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AA</xref>, brackets; compare to control, 3 X brackets). This suggested that signaling from Vm was required for organizing the dorsal vessel—a possibility that had not been previously explored. To test this, we examined the dorsal vessels of <italic>bin</italic> mutants which lack Vm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We identified multiple phenotypes, two of which we termed ‘twisted’ and ‘sunken’; the dorsal vessel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> exhibits both phenotypes. We scored a dorsal vessel as ‘twisted’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bracket) when there was an apparent kink in the vessel such that the left or right side sat directly atop the other; thus, when viewing a single z-slice, a span of contralateral CBs appear to be missing since they are displaced above or below that focal plane. We defined a sunken dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’ and B’’</xref>) as those cases where the whole dorsal vessel, or part of it, was displaced ventrally, deeper into the embryo. Such a case is evident in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> mutant dorsal vessel, which spans 8 µm of depth, compared to the sibling control dorsal vessel, which spans only 4 µm. Both phenotypes were significantly more frequent in <italic>bin</italic> mutants compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together, the dorsal vessel defects observed upon removal of the Vm or from trapping Slit on Vm cells reveal a previously unrecognized role for Vm in dorsal vessel formation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PSC positioning requires Vm-mediated dorsal vessel organization and Robo activation in PSC cells.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Analysis of dorsal vessels with and without Vm; phenotype frequencies quantified in (<bold>C</bold>).

In addition, our live-imaging revealed that some PSC cells are affixed to CBs of the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, it became important to test whether all PSC phenotypes might be ‘passive’, explained by PSC attachment to a malforming dorsal vessel. Alternatively, the PSC defects could reflect a requirement for Robo activation directly in PSC cells. Without a PSC-specific driver to directly test the latter, we re-examined <italic>robo1</italic>,<italic>robo2</italic> double mutants, this time including an additional marker that allowed us to observe PSC and CB defects independently and score for correlation between the two. If defective PSC positioning mostly correlated with defective CB positioning this would suggest a passive effect on PSCs by CBs of the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle schematic). By contrast, if PSC cells were mis-positioned without a similarly mis-positioned CB nearby, this would suggest a requirement for intrinsic activation of Robo in PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, rightmost schematic).</p><p>The CB marker, <italic>svp</italic>-lacZ, labels two CBs in each hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, two hemisegments shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lo and Frasch, 2001</xref>). Normally, the PSC is compact and located adjacent to the compact Antp +CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, PSCs outlined). Svp co-labels the last of the four strongly Antp +CBs, and it labels the immediately posterior Antp- CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, brackets). At the end of migration, Svp-LacZ +CBs, like all CBs, are well-aligned with their bilaterally symmetric counterparts. Thus, including Svp-LacZ in our analysis served as a useful registration marker that afforded the ability to detect bilateral matching, as well as shifting of CBs or the PSC along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>, arrows indicate second set of Svp +CBs).</p><p>In <italic>robo1</italic>,<italic>robo2</italic> double mutants, we found that mis-positioning of CBs and the ipsilateral PSC occurred more frequently compared to double heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We then further analyzed those instances of mis-positioning for whether the position of PSCs correlated with position of CBs. In about two-thirds of cases mis-positioning was correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, green arrowheads, quantified in 4I), suggesting that proper PSC positioning relies in part on proper CB positioning. However, in about one-third of cases PSC mis-positioning appeared independent of CB mis-positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, magenta arrowheads). We also observed PSC mis-positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, magenta arrowhead) when ipsilateral CBs were positioned normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, brackets).

In contrast to the robust collectivity noted throughout the migration of control PSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), this imaging revealed progressive deterioration of PSC integrity during migration. For instance, throughout imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>), one PSC cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, cyan dot) bridged the gap between the Antp +CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, yellow brackets, 0 min) and posteriorly displaced CBs. Ultimately this PSC cell made aberrant contact with a CB from the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, yellow dot, 70 min). This region had a persistent gap, possibly reflecting improper sealing of the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, arrows, 112 min), as well as improper A-P alignment of Antp +CBs with their contralateral counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, offset brackets, 112 min).

We describe the steady-state, coalesced positioning of the cells comprising the PSC, characterize their migration, and reveal the signaling requirements that facilitate their association and recruitment to the lymph gland. Altogether, the evidence we provide culminates in a model in which the PSC migrates to the dorsal midline as a collective of cells—some adhere to the dorsal vessel and the rest adhere to each other. We show that association of PSC cells requires input from Vm and dorsal vessel, and we implicate Slit as a necessary signal. Although we have not ruled out direct Vm-to-PSC signaling, we find at a minimum that Vm affects PSC positioning indirectly by its novel role in forming the dorsal vessel. The intricate regulation described herein ensures that PSC cells achieve a precise steady-state positioning as a coalesced group at the lymph gland posterior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Collective cell migration of the PSC</title><p>Prior knowledge of the embryonic PSC has been focused on PSC cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our live-imaging provides a substantial advancement by revealing PSC dynamics after specification, during migration. PSC formation is an example of collective cell migration, reminiscent of border cell migration in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber and migration of the lateral line primordium in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>. These cell collectives respond to guidance cues, and their constituent cells are highly protrusive and shift position within the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cliffe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalle Nogare et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peercy and Starz-Gaiano, 2020</xref>). PSC migration is no different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)– we observe extension and retraction of protrusions on all surfaces of the collective except those in contact with CBs. This suggests that the migrating PSC explores and responds to its environment. Some cells of the PSC maintain their position adjacent to the dorsal vessel throughout the entirety of migration, while other cells exhibit fluidity within the collective. The positional shifts suggest remodeling of adhesive contacts between cells—albeit in a coordinated manner to achieve unidirectional migration for the entire cohort. Interestingly, circulating hemocytes can be seen interacting with the PSC—hemocytes are known to deposit and remodel ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bunt et al., 2010</xref>), which could serve as a scaffold for adhesion molecules and as a substrate during migration. Indeed, we identified ECM components surrounding the PSC, including its interface with the dorsal vessel. The characteristics noted above could be further explored to improve our understanding not only of how the PSC is built, but more broadly of collective cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PSC heterogeneity</title><p>For improved live-imaging, we sought a PSC-specific marker but found most candidates to be expressed in only subsets of PSC cells (unpublished data); the lack of homogenous expression suggests PSC heterogeneity. The existence of fixed and fluid PSC cell positionings in the collective further hints at heterogeneity—perhaps there are different types and polarities of adhesive molecules. If PSC heterogeneity exists at this early stage, its purpose is unknown. One possibility is that the fixed, dorsal vessel-adjacent PSC cells act as ‘leaders’ while the more fluid PSC cells are ‘followers’, a common phenomenon in collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). The dorsal vessel has recently been shown to serve as a second hematopoietic niche component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Destalminil-Letourneau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tian et al., 2023</xref>), so another possibility is that the fixed, dorsal vessel-adjacent PSC cells have a special function as intermediaries that coordinate communication between the niche components. That said, whether the niche components interact remains unknown. Finally, PSC heterogeneity in this early context could reflect a division of labor later, when the PSC regulates larval hematopoietic progenitors. Gene expression heterogeneity has been noted in the testis niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Bras and Van Doren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that this may be a conserved feature of niches which warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coordinated input of extrinsic signals positions the PSC</title><p>We reveal that positioning the PSC requires input from different extrinsic sources. It is perhaps notable that the few well-studied examples of niche formation all involve extrinsic inputs. The mammalian intestine is organized into protrusive villi and invaginated crypts; Wnt and EphB3 signals emitted from the crypt base recruit niche cells from the crypt-villus interface to their final position in the compact troughs of the crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batlle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holmberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Es et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonadal niche cell relies on adjacent germ cell proliferation for propulsion towards its steady-state position at the apex of the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2022</xref>). A microniche of the mammalian hair follicle, the dermal papilla, originates via extrinsic Fgf20 signaling to dermal fibroblasts. The fibroblasts are recruited into a condensate via directed migration, and then the condensate is segregated deeper into the skin via epidermal invagination driven by reciprocal signaling between dermis and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biggs et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis niche cells require FGF and Slit signals from Vm to migrate through the testis and assemble as a cap that is further compacted via actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anllo and DiNardo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Warder et al., 2024</xref>). Together with our findings on PSC formation, a paradigm for niche formation is emerging that, subsequent to niche cell specification, extrinsic input segregates niche cells from other constituents, and positions the collective toward one end of the tissue. Oftentimes positioning is accompanied by or precedes compaction of the recruited cells into a final niche shape/architecture.</p><p>We show that extrinsic Slit-Robo signaling is integral in establishing PSC position. Removing Slit causes PSC defects at the same frequency as removal of both canonical Robo receptors, indicating that in PSC formation, Slit only signals through Robo, and not through the non-canonical receptor, Dscam1. The PSC positioning phenotype was about 75% penetrant, and the severity of the defects varied. These observations argue that PSC formation relies on an additional cue(s) yet to be discovered. Evidence for an additional PSC coalescence cue exists in later larval stages, as manipulated Insulin Receptor signaling was shown to disrupt PSC coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, most pathways are difficult to test for a role in PSC formation due to lack of an embryonic PSC-specific tool with the necessary temporal control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Haploinsufficiency of Slit and Robo in PSC positioning</title><p>In the nervous system, one copy of the normal (WT) allele of Slit or Robo are typically sufficient for proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rothberg et al., 1988</xref>). In contrast, we find that about half of <italic>robo2,robo1</italic> double heterozygotes or of <italic>slit</italic> heterozygote embryos have abnormal PSCs, suggesting haploinsufficiency in this process. Our observation in embryonic stages is supported by previous findings at later larval stages where both <italic>slit</italic> or <italic>robo2</italic> heterozygotes have dispersed PSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Perhaps haploinsufficiency in the PSC reflects different regulation and function of the Slit-Robo pathway from the nerve cord. Alternatively, because Slit-Robo signaling is required within both CBs and PSC for their proper development, the haploinsufficiency may reflect a combinatorial defect caused by diminished signaling in both tissues. Furthermore, we are surprised that <italic>robo2</italic> and <italic>robo1</italic> single mutants have a similar frequency of abnormal PSCs because in the embryo Robo1 is expressed in all PSC cells, whereas Robo2 appears to be expressed in only one. An intriguing possibility is that the Robo2-expressing PSC cell is the ‘leader’ in PSC migration, and without Robo2 signaling in the leader, the collective fails to migrate appropriately, or the followers fail to remain properly adherent. However, it may be that all PSC cells express Robo2, and our finding reflects limited detection ability with the Robo2-GFP reporter.</p><p>Morin-Poulard et. al. show that all larval PSC cells express Robo2, and it has a more prominent role than Robo1 in maintaining PSC coalescence (termed ‘clustering’ in their work) during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, they found Robo1 knockdown alone was insufficient to disrupt clustering. Taken together with our work, perhaps this indicates that Robo1 is more important for first establishing PSC coalescence and Robo2 is more important for maintaining it. Most manipulations occurred after the PSC had already formed, and therefore the changes reported cannot stem from defects during establishment but rather from dispersion of the cluster after it formed. One experiment without temperature control that could have diminished Robo signaling in PSC and CBs early (Antp &gt;Robo RNAi), at about the time of PSC specification, generated a more dispersed late larval PSC compared to Robo knockdown after PSC formation. One can imagine that aberrant embryonic PSC positioning would become exacerbated and increasingly catastrophic as the PSC and nearby progenitors proliferate throughout larval stages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Function of Slit-Robo in PSC positioning</title><p>Determining how Slit affects a given process is complex because it can act as an attractive or repulsive cue, or even affect cell adhesion, and in some instances the outcome relies on whether Slit is cleaved by Tok (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Englund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kellermeyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kolesnikov and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, elucidating the role of the Slit-Robo pathway in PSC formation is difficult. The existence and relative positioning of two Slit sources, the reliance on one for positioning of the other, and the inconsistent direction of PSC mis-positioning suggest that it is too simplistic to ask whether Slit is acting as a repulsive or attractive cue for PSC cells. Notably, mis-positioned PSC cells adopted aberrant contacts with CBs, LG, and pericardial cells of the dorsal vessel. When reported in the dorsal vessel, this inappropriate mixing of cells was attributed to improper polarity of cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Santiago-Martínez et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, Slit is important for maintaining adhesion amongst larval PSC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together with our data, we reason that during PSC migration Slit must affect the ability of PSC cells to properly adhere to the dorsal vessel and to one another. In this manner, Slit facilitates PSC cell association as a compact cluster.</p><p>The phenotypic variability we observe upon compromising Slit-Robo signaling indicates that downstream regulation is likely complex and dependent on the specific context, in time and space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref> show that the Slit-Robo pathway maintains clustering of larval PSC cells via DE-Cadherin and Cdc42; however, our data indicate different effectors are at play during PSC formation, as we detect no DE-Cad in the embryonic PSC (data not shown). Additionally, whereas constitutively active Cdc42 in the larval PSC caused dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>), our attempt to elicit PSC dispersion with this manipulation in the embryo yielded normally coalesced PSCs (data not shown). Therefore, we reason that different downstream effectors are engaged by the Slit-Robo pathway for initial positioning of the PSC.</p><p>This study was limited by the lack of a truly PSC-specific driver—a tool that would improve live-imaging and allow testing of potential Slit-Robo pathway effectors. We and others observe Fasciclin III, a homotypic cell adhesion molecule, in the PSC (unpublished data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>), however, it is first detectable too late in embryogenesis to function during PSC formation. Thus, the particular adhesion molecules that maintain association of PSC cells as they migrate remain unknown. Elucidating this tool will facilitate interrogation of how Slit-Robo signaling impacts PSC adhesion to the dorsal vessel and amongst itself.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Passive and active roles for Slit-Robo signaling in PSC positioning</title><p>Due to the necessity of autocrine Slit-Robo signaling in dorsal vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Medioni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Santiago-Martínez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santiago-Martínez et al., 2008</xref>), it was challenging to distinguish whether effects on the PSC were secondary to mis-positioned CBs, or primary consequences of diminished Robo activation in PSC cells. Our analysis of <italic>robo2,robo1</italic> double mutants along with the registration marker, svp-lacZ, strongly suggests both passive mis-positioning of PSC cells via attachment to mis-positioned CBs and a requirement for Robo activation directly in PSC cells. A direct requirement for Robo in PSC cells is further suggested in <italic>slit</italic> mutant live-imaging. Here, the lateral-most PSC cells separated from the main cluster even though no CBs were nearby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Perhaps during normal migration these more ‘fluid’, lateral PSC cells possess a stronger requirement for Robo activation and require direct input to achieve that. In this view, those PSC cells that are passively mis-positioned in mutants are the same PSC cells that remain affixed to the dorsal vessel during normal migration. Alternatively, or additionally, passive mis-positioning of CB-adjacent PSC cells might occur due to improper polarization of adhesive molecules, whereas separation of lateral PSC cells from the collective might occur due to a total loss of adhesive molecules. Finally, it is possible that PSC cells do not intrinsically require Robo activation, but rather CB-independent PSC mis-positioning in <italic>sli</italic> or <italic>robo</italic> mutants could be a secondary defect caused by compromised Slit-Robo signaling in some other tissue. A PSC-specific driver to knockdown Robo intrinsically would be needed to test definitively the requirement for Robo in PSC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Connecting niche structure, position, and function</title><p>The coalesced nature and posterior positioning of the PSC are its most prominent features. The consistency of these features suggested that they are under tight regulation, as we report here, and strongly indicates their relevance to function of the PSC. Although we have yet linked the precise architecture of the embryonic PSC to function, the specific architectures of multiple other niches have been shown to be functionally relevant. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonad, a coalesced, compact niche is necessary for proper germline stem cell maintenance signaling, and for orienting stem cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anllo and DiNardo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Warder et al., 2024</xref>). In the mammalian hair follicle, niche position determines stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rompolas et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells are supported by glia, and the precise morphology of this niche is required for homeostasis of the entire nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Spéder and Brand, 2018</xref>). Most pertinently, recent work has shown that the larval PSC communicates amongst itself via a calcium signaling network. The integrity of this network is gap junction-dependent and is required for the PSC to emit proper levels of a progenitor maintenance signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ho et al., 2023</xref>). We find it reasonable to postulate that a dispersed PSC would exhibit defective calcium signaling such that the PSC would lack coordinated maintenance of progenitors, thereby leading to an imbalance in the ratio of progenitors to differentiated hemocytes in the gland. Future experiments will determine how PSC coalescence is functionally relevant to its regulation of hematopoietic progenitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this study, we used FlyBase (releases 2020_06–2024_02; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenkins et al., 2022</xref>) to find information on phenotypes, function, stocks, and gene expression.

Using a combination of genetics and live imaging, the authors show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during a trajectory that positions them at the posterior of the LG.</p><p>This is an important study that identifies Slit-Robo signaling as a regulator of PSC morphogenesis, and highlights the complex relationship of interacting cell types - PSC, visceral mesoderm (VM), and cardioblasts (CBs) - in the coordinated development of these three tissues during organ development. However, one point requiring clarification is the idea that PSC cells exhibit a collective cell migration; it is not clear that the cells are migrating rather than being pushed to a more dorsal position through dorsal closure and/or other similar large-scale embryo movement. This does not detract from the very interesting analysis of PSC morphogenesis as presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Since each referee asked for clarification concerning collective cell migration, we present a combined response further below, placed after the comments from Reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Using the expression of Hid or Grim to ablate associated tissues, they find evidence that the VM and CB of the dorsal vessel affect PSC migration/morphology whereas the alary muscles do not. Slit is expressed by both VM and CBs, and therefore Slit-Robo signaling was investigated as PSCs express Robo.</p><p>(2) Using a combination of approaches, the authors convincingly demonstrate that Slit expression in the CBs and VM acts to support PSC positioning. A strength is the ability to knockdown slit levels in particular tissue types using the Gal4 system and RNAi.</p><p>(3) Although in the analysis of robo mutants, the PSC positioning phenotype is weaker in the individual mutants (robo1 and robo2) with only the double mutant (robo1,robo2) exhibiting a phenotype comparable to the slit RNAi. The authors make a reasonable argument that Slit-Robo signaling has an intrinsic effect, likely acting within PSCs because PSCs show a phenotype even when CBs do not (Figure 4G).</p><p>(4) New insight into dorsal vessel formation by VM is presented in Figure 4A, B, as loss of the VM can affect dorsal vessel morphogenesis. This result additionally points to the VM as important.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors are cautioned to temper the result that Slit-Robo signaling is intrinsic to PSC since the loss of robo may affect other cell types (besides CBs and PSCs) to indirectly affect PSC migration/morphogenesis. In fact, in the robo2, robo1 mutant, the VM appears to be incorrectly positioned (Figure 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>We have reexamined our wording in the relevant Results section and, given that this referee agrees that we, “make a reasonable argument that Slit-Robo signaling has an intrinsic effect, likely acting within PSCs because PSCs show a phenotype even when CBs do not (Figure 4G)”, it was not clear how we might temper our conclusions more. Given that PSC cells express Robo1 and Robo2, and that the Vm does not contact the PSC, our ‘reasonable argument’ appears fair and parsimonious. Since we agree with the referee that a reader should be made as aware as possible of alternatives, we will add a comment to the Discussion, reminding the reader of the possibility of a secondary defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If possible, the authors should use RNAi to knockdown Robo1 and Robo2 levels specifically in the PSCs if a Gal4 is available; might Antp.Gal4 (Fig 1K) be useful? Even if knockdown is achieved in PSCs+CBs, this would be a better/complementary experiment to support the approach outlined in Figure 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that PSC-specific knockdown of Robo1 and Robo2 simultaneously would be ideal, this is not possible. First, the most-effective UAS-RNAi transgenes (that is, those in a Valium 20 backbone) are both integrated at the same chromosomal position; these cannot be simultaneously crossed with a GAL4 transgenic line to attempt double knock down. Additionally, as with all RNAi approaches that must rely on efficient knockdown over the rapid embryonic period, even having facile access to the above does not ensure the RNAi approach will cause as effective depletion as the genetic null condition that we use. Second, as the referee concedes, there is no embryonic PSC-specific GAL4. The proposed use of Antp-GAL4 would cause knockdown in many tissues (PSC, CB, Vm, epidermis and amnioserosa). This would lead to a reservation similar to that caused by our use of the straight genetic double mutant, as regards potential indirect requirement for Robo function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Movies are hard to interpret, as it seems unclear that the PSCs actively migrate rather than being pushed/moved indirectly due to association with VM and CBs/dorsal vessel.</p></disp-quote><p>First, the Vm does not directly contact the PSC, so it cannot be pushing the PSC dorsally. We will re-examine our text to be certain to make this clear. Second, in our analysis of <italic>bin</italic> mutants, which lack Vm, LGs and PSCs are able to reach the dorsal midline region in the absence of Vm. Finally, please see our response to Reviewer #3, point 2, for why we maintain that PSC cells are “migrating” even though some PSC cells are attached to CBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The paper by Nelson KA, et al. explored the collective migration, coalescence, and positioning of the posterior signaling center (PSC) cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. With live imaging, the authors observed the dynamic progress of PSC migration. Throughout this process, visceral mesoderm (VM), alary muscles (Ams), and cardioblasts (CBs) are in proximity to PSC. Genetic ablation of these tissues reveals the requirement for VM and CBs, but not AMs in this process. Genetic manipulations further demonstrated that Slit-Robo signaling was critical during PSC migration and positioning. While the genetic mechanisms of positioning the PSC were explored in much detail, including using live imaging, the functional consequence of mispositioning or (partial) absence of PSC cells has not been addressed, but would much increase the relevance of their findings. A few additional issues need to be addressed as well in this otherwise well-done study.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) The only readout in their experiments is the relative correctness of PSC positioning. Importantly, what is the functional consequence if PSC is not properly positioned? This would be particularly important with robo-sli manipulations, where the PSC is present but some cells are misplaced. What is the consequence? Are the LGs affected, like the specification of their cell types, structure, and function? To address this for at least the robo-slit requirement in the PSC, it may be important to manipulate them directly in the PSC with a split Gal4 system, using Antp and Odd promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the functional consequence of PSC mis-positioning is important and a relevant question to eventually address. However, virtually all markers and reagents used to assess the effect of the PSC on progenitor cells and their differentiated descendants are restricted to analyses carried out on the third larval instar - some three days after the experiments reported here. Most of the manipulated conditions in our work are no longer viable at this phase and, thus, addressing the functional consequences of a malformed PSC will require the field to develop new tools.</p><p>As we noted in the Introduction, the consistency with which the wildtype PSC forms as a coalesced collective at the posterior of the LG strongly suggests importance of its specific positioning and shape, as has now been found for other niches (citations in manuscript). Additionally, in the Discussion we mention the existence of a gap junction-dependent calcium signaling network in the PSC that is important for progenitor maintenance. Without continuity of this network amongst all PSC cells (under conditions of PSC mis-positioning), we strongly anticipate that the balance of progenitors to differentiated hemocytes will be mis-managed, either constitutively, and / or under immune challenge conditions.</p><p>Finally, to our knowledge, the tools do not exist to build a “split Gal4 system using Antp and Odd promoters”. The expression pattern observed using the genomic Antp-GAL4 line must be driven by endogenous enhancers–none of which have been defined by the field, and thus cannot be used in constructing second order drivers. Similarly, for <italic>odd skipped</italic>, in the embryo the extant Odd-GAL4 driver expresses only in the epidermis, with no expression in the embryonic LG. Thus, the cis regulatory element controlling Odd expression in the embryonic LG is unknown. In the future, the discovery of an embryonic PSC-specific driver will aid in addressing the specific functional consequences of PSC mis-positioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The densely, parallel aligned fibers in the part of Figure 1J seemed to be visceral mesoderm, but further up (dorsally) that may be epidermis.

As we show and discuss in the paper, our results revealed that the signaling requirements for proper PSC positioning are complex; this was favorably commented upon by Reviewer #1 (“...highlights the complex relationship of interacting cell types - PSC, visceral mesoderm (VM), and cardioblasts (CBs) - in the coordinated development of these three tissues during organ development.…”). We suspect the phenotypic variability is attributable to any number of biological differences such as heterogeneity of PSC cells and an accompanying difference in the timing of their competence to receive and respond to Slit-Robo signaling, the timing of release of Slit from CBs and Vm, number of cells in a given PSC, which PSC cells in the cluster respond to too little or too much signaling, and/or typical variability between organisms. Furthermore, PSC positioning analyses were conducted by two of the authors, who independently came to the same conclusions. For many of the manipulations double blinding was not possible since the genotype of the embryo was discernible due to the obvious phenotype of the manipulated tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The Discussion is very lengthy and should shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>We will re-examine the prose and emphasize more conciseness, while maintaining clarity for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work is a detailed and thorough analysis of the morphogenesis of the posterior signaling center (PSC), a hematopoietic niche in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva.

Lastly, the Slit/Robo signaling system is clearly implicated in the normal formation of the PSC.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data are clearly presented, well documented, and fully support the conclusions drawn from the different experiments. The manuscript differs in character from the mainstay of &quot;big data&quot; papers (for example, no sets of single-cell RNAseq data of, for instance, PSC cells with more or less Slit input, are offered), but what it lacks in this regard, it makes up in carefully planned and executed visualizations and genetic manipulations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A few suggestions concerning improvement of the way the story is told and contextualized.</p><p>(1) The minute cluster of PSC progenitors (5 or so cells per side) is embedded (as known before and shown nicely in this study) in other &quot;migrating&quot; cell pools, like the cardioblasts, pericardial cells, lymph gland progenitors, alary muscle progenitors. These all appear to move more or less synchronously. What should also be mentioned is another tissue, the dorsal epidermis, which also &quot;moves&quot; (better: stretches?) towards the dorsal midline during dorsal closure. Would it be reasonable to speculate (based on previously published data) that without the force of dorsal closure, operating in the epidermis, at least the lateral&gt;medial component of the &quot;migration&quot; of the PSC (and neighboring tissues) would be missing? If dorsal closure is blocked, do essential components of PSC and lymph gland morphogenesis (except for the coming-together of the left and right halves) still occur? Are there any published data on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Each of the Reviewers is interested in our response to this very relevant question, and, thus, we will address the issue en bloc here. First, we will add a Supplementary Figure showing that LG and CBs are still able to progress medially towards the dorsal midline when dorsal closure stalls. This rules out any major effect for the most prominent “large-scale embryo cell sheet movement” in positioning the PSC. Second, published work by Haack et. al. and Balaghi et. al. shows that CBs and leading edge epidermal cells are independently migratory, and we will add this context to the manuscript for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Along similar lines: the process of PSC formation is characterized as &quot;migration&quot;. To be fair: the authors bring up the possibility that some of the phenotypes they observe could be &quot;passive&quot;/secondary: &quot;Thus, it became important to test whether all PSC phenotypes might be 'passive', explained by PSC attachment to a malforming dorsal vessel. Alternatively, the PSC defects could reflect a requirement for Robo activation directly in PSC cells.&quot; And the issue is resolved satisfactorily. But more generally, &quot;cell migration&quot; implies active displacement (by cytoskeletal forces) of cells relative to a substrate or to their neighbors (like for example migration of hemocytes). This to me doesn't seem really clearly to happen here for the dorsal mesodermal structures. Couldn't one rather characterize the assembly of PSC, lymph gland, pericardial cells, and dorsal vessel in terms of differential adhesion, on top of a more general adhesion of cells to each other and the epidermis, and then dorsal closure as a driving force for cell displacement? The authors should bring in the published literature to provide a background that does (or does not) justify the term &quot;migration&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Before addressing this specifically, we remind readers of our response above that states the rationale ruling out large, embryo-scale movements, such as epidermal dorsal closure, in driving PSC positioning. So, how are PSC cells arriving at their reproducible position? This manuscript reports the first live-imaging of the PSC as it comes to be positioned in the embryo. We interpret these movies to suggest strongly that these cells are a ‘collective’ that migrates. Neither the data, nor we, are asserting that each PSC cell is ‘individually’ migrating to its final position. Rather, our data suggest that the PSC migrates as a collective. The most paradigmatic example of directed, collective cell migration, is of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian border cells. That cell cluster is surrounded at all times by other cells (nurse cells, in that case), and for the collective to traverse through the tissue, the process requires constant remodeling of associations amongst the migrating cells in the collective (the border cells), as well as between cells in the collective and those outside of it (the nurse cells). In fact, the nurse cells are considered the substrate upon which border cells migrate. Note also that in collective border cell migration cells within the collective can switch neighbors, suggesting dynamic changes to cell associations and adhesions.</p><p>In our analysis, the PSC cells exhibit qualities reminiscent of the border cells, and thus we infer that the PSC constitutes a migratory cell collective. We also show in Figure 1H that PSC cells exhibit cellular extensions, and thus have a very active, intrinsic actin-based cytoskeleton. In fact, in Figure 1I, we point out that PSC cells shift position within the collective, which is not only a direct feature of migration, but also occurs within the border cell collective as that collective migrates. Additionally, the fact that the lateral-most PSC cells shift position in the collective while remaining a part of the collective–and they do this while executing net directional movement–makes a strong argument that the PSC is migratory, as no cell types other than PSCs are contacting the surfaces of those shifting PSC cells. Lastly, the Reviewer’s supposition that, rather than migration, dorsal mesoderm structures form via “differential adhesion, on top of a more general adhesion of cells to each other” is, actually, precisely an inherent aspect of collective cell migration as summarized above for the ovarian border collective.</p><p>In our resubmission we will adjust text citing the existing literature to better put into context the reasoning for why PSC formation based on our data is an example of collective cell migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) That brings up the mechanistic centerpiece of this story, the Slit/Robo system. First: I suggest adding more detailed data from the study by Morin-Poulard et al 2016, in the Introduction, since these authors had already implicated Slit-Robo in PSC function and offered a concrete molecular mechanism: &quot;vascular cells produce Slit that activates Robo receptors in the PSC. Robo activation controls proliferation and clustering of PSC cells by regulating Myc, and small GTPase and DE-cadherin activity, respectively&quot;. As stated in the Discussion: the mechanism of Slit/Robo action on the PSC in the embryo is likely different, since DE-cadherin is not expressed in the embryonic PSC; however, it maybe not be THAT different: it could also act on adhesion between PSC cells themselves and their neighbors. What are other adhesion proteins that appear in the late lateral mesodermal structures?</p></disp-quote><p>Could DN-cadherin or Fasciclins be involved?</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that Slit-Robo signaling likely acts in part on the PSC by affecting PSC cell adhesion to each other and/or to CBs (lines 428-435). As stated in the Discussion, we do not observe Fasciclin III expression in the PSC until late stages when the PSC has already been positioned, suggesting that Fasciclin III is not an active player in PSC formation. Assessing whether the PSC expresses any other of the suite of potential cell adhesion molecules such as DN-Cadherin or other Fasciclins, and then study their potential involvement in the Slit-Robo pathway in PSC cells, would be part of a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p><p>The authors are encouraged to address several key issues and provide more explicit clarification when interpreting the behavior of the PSC cells as &quot;migration.&quot; It is recommended that the authors engage with all reviewers' comments and refine the text based on the feedback they find valuable.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) Is it possible to assay robo1 and/or robo1 RNAi in a tissue-specific manner to further explore an intrinsic role in the PSC? Might the VM indirectly affect PSCs in a CB-independent manner? How does this affect the interpretation of results in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our response to Reviewer #1, Public review weaknesses #2.</p><p>Though we agree with the Reviewer that this is the better experiment to test for an intrinsic role for Robo in the PSC, this experiment is not possible at this time. As we noted in the manuscript, we do not yet have an embryonic PSC-specific GAL4, though we have been putting efforts towards identifying/developing such a tool. The Antp-GAL4 driver we used in this study will drive not only in both PSCs and CBs, but also in Vm, epidermis, and amnioserosa, as well as other tissues. The other available embryonic PSC drivers are not specific to the PSC and will drive expression in CBs and Vm, at minimum. This, combined with the reality that RNAi can be ineffective in embryonic tissues, resulted in our use of whole organism mutants to best address this question.</p><p>We acknowledge that it is possible the Vm indirectly effects the PSC in a CB-independent manner in the double Robo mutant, and we added a statement to the Discussion reiterating this point. However, because the PSC expresses Robo1 and Robo2, we maintain that the simplest interpretation of the results in Figure 4 is that PSC cells require intrinsic Robo signaling. And, as we state in the manuscript, it is possible that Slit signals directly from Vm to Robo on the PSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As this is the first study to be presenting PSC formation as involving collective cell migration, can the authors provide experimental evidence and rationale for this categorization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added our rationale to the Results section in the revision.</p><p>See also our response to Reviewer #3, Public review weakness #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The Slit staining presented in Fig 3 W', Z' should be quantified. Furthermore, what is the VM phenotype when Robo1 is overexpressed? Is there a VM-specific phenotype and could this indirect effect cause the PSC to misform/mismigrate?</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t quantify Slit levels in the Vm-specific Robo overexpression condition because there was a visually striking difference compared to controls (increased intensity and specific localization to Vm membranes), and the manipulation resulted in a PSC phenotype. Thus, the evidence we show appears sufficient to strongly suggest that our genetic manipulation resulted in successful trapping of Slit on the Vm.</p><p>As to a Vm phenotype when Robo1 is overexpressed Vm-specifically: we know Vm is present, but we haven’t performed an in-depth phenotypic analysis. In the manuscript we show that this manipulation at least affects organization of PSC-adjacent CBs, which we go on to show is correlated with mis-positioned PSCs. Thus, the PSC phenotype in this condition is not solely due to a Vm-specific phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns/suggestions:</p><p>(1) I might have missed it but where are the Movies referenced in the text?

Doesn't this suggest that what is critical is that the PSCs attach to the VM and/or CBs, and not necessarily that they are an actively migrating cell type? They &quot;move&quot; but might be passively carried.</p></disp-quote><p>See also the response to Reviewer #3, Public reviews weaknesses #2.</p><p>The Reviewer is correct that the PSC cells in Fig. 5 don’t move very much, but we interpret this differently from the Reviewer. After detachment of the cells in question they undergo dramatic shape changes, indicating active cytoskeletal remodeling, so the molecular machinery needed for migration appears to remain intact. Thus, we suggest that this observation actually emphasizes our finding that collectivity is needed for the migration. Given the consistency of PSC coalescence/collectivity and the intricate regulation that controls it, we believe it to be an integral part of PSC identity. When PSC cells become detached, they likely lose an aspect of their identity. In various manipulations we’ve noted instances of severely dispersed PSC cells expressing very low levels of identity markers Antp or Odd. Cells in such cases are likely compromised for their function, and this can include, for example, whether they can properly sense cues for migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) The expression pattern of Antp-Gal4 &gt; myrGFP in the whole embryo should be shown to better demonstrate the overlap with Odd. How does it compare with Antp-Gal4 &gt; CD8::GFP?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand the question posed. We are not suggesting that Antp and Odd overlap in all cells, nor even many cells. It has been demonstrated by the field that co-expression among mesodermal cells, in the position where LG cells are specified, is a marker for the PSC. We have not thoroughly investigated all reporter lines for the GAL4 drivers used by the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Does Tincdelta4-Gal4 not at all express in the PSC? This should be verified.</p></disp-quote><p>This question appears to refer to depletion of Slit by RNAi or cell killing driven by tinCΔ4-GAL4. TinCΔ4-GAL4 is expressed in CBs and in precisely 1 embryonic PSC cell. First, Slit isn’t expressed by any PSC cells to our eye, so any PSC mis-positioning observed upon tinCΔ4&gt;Sli RNAi implicates CB involvement in PSC positioning. In designing tests for CB involvement, we were unable to identify any mutant known to lack CBs (or have fewer CBs) that didn’t also affect specification of the LG/PSC. The cell killing approach seemed best. It is possible that, in this scenario, perhaps ablation of a single, key PSC cell could affect final positioning of the other PSCs, but we think that less likely than a role for CBs. We also retain our original conclusion due to the fact that we often find mis-positioned PSC cells adjacent to mis-positioned CBs, including in the panel representing the CB ablation experiment, Figure 2S.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 212: The data provide evidence that Vm is necessary, but clearly not sufficient, as CBs are also necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We see how this wording was misleading and have adjusted the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The CBs are not visible in Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure what the Reviewer is referring to, as we are certain that the signal between the blue outlines is indeed Slit expression in CBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>One minor mistake (I believe): in line 229 it should say &quot;3C and 3D&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this error.</p></body></sub-article></article>
