Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ovaries are responsible for forming the eggs humans and other mammals need to reproduce. Once mature, the egg cell is released into the fallopian tube where it can be potentially fertilized by a sperm. Despite their crucial role, how eggs are made in the ovary is poorly understood. This is because ovaries are hard to access, making it difficult to conduct experiments on them.</p><p>To overcome this, researchers have built artificial ovaries in the laboratory using stem cells from the embryos of mice which can develop into all cell types in the adult body. By culturing these embryonic stem cells under special conditions, researchers can convert them in to the two main cell types of the developing ovary: germ cells which go on to form eggs, and granulosa cells which help eggs grow and mature. The resulting lab-grown ovary can make eggs that produce live mice when fertilized.</p><p>This approach has also been applied to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult human cells which have been reprogrammed to a stem-like state. While this has produced human germ cells, generating human granulosa cells has been more challenging.

This led to the identification of a small number of factors that caused the human iPSCs to develop features and carry out roles seen in mature granulosa cells; this includes producing an important reproductive hormone and supporting the maturation of germ cells. Pierson Smela, Kramme et al. found that growing these granulosa-like cells together with germ cells (also generated via iPSCs) resulted in structures similar to ovarian follicles which help eggs develop.</p><p>These findings could help researchers build stable systems for studying how granulosa cells behave in human ovaries.

This is in part due to difficulties in obtaining samples of human fetal ovaries, and the lack of a suitable model system to study human ovarian development in vitro. The potential power of such a system is illustrated by a recent study in mice, which differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and ovarian-like cells, and combined these cell types. Reconstituted follicles were capable of producing oocytes and live offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshino et al., 2021</xref>). Using mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells, a similar system was published that allowed the development of human PGCLCs to the oogonia stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>). However, these mixed-species systems are inadequate for fully modeling human ovarian development. Clearly, the construction of fully human ovarian follicles from pluripotent stem cells could enable new advances in the study of female reproduction, epigenetics, and human development.</p><p>Ovarian development requires paracrine and juxtacrine interaction between cells from germline and somatic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Høyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Bouffant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otsuka and Shimasaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). During embryonic development, the first cells committed to the germline appear at roughly 2–3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf), when primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified from the posterior epiblast in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). After specification, PGCs migrate to the developing gonad and undergo further development into oogonia (in female) or spermatogonia (in male) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grimaldi and Raz, 2020</xref>). The expression of the RNA-binding proteins DAZL and DDX4 (also known as VASA) begins in gonadal PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</xref>), with DAZL identified as a key factor induced by the gonadal environment that commits PGCs to the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</xref>), restricting pluripotency and inhibiting differentiation to somatic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, gonadal PGCs from Carnegie stage 23 primate embryos express mature markers such as DAZL and DDX4, and can complete spermatogenesis upon transplantation into a recipient testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2017</xref>), whereas earlier-stage PGCLCs cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have provided efficient protocols for the differentiation of hiPSCs to DAZL-negative premigratory PGCLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitsunaga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sebastiano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kee et al., 2006</xref>). However, the only previously reported method that allows human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to develop to later DAZL-positive stages in vitro is to aggregate them with mouse fetal ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>) or testicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>) cells, which mimic the environment of the early gonad. Another study tested aggregation of hPGCLCs with rat neonatal testis cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mall et al., 2020</xref>), but only showed that the hPGCLCs could survive and did not assess maturation.</p><p>The somatic cells of the developing ovary provide crucial support for oogenesis. These cells originate from the WT1<italic>-</italic>positive intermediate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stévant et al., 2019</xref>), and initially exist in a bipotential state, capable of supporting either male or female development. In humans, sex-specific pathways begin to diverge at around 7 wpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartshorne et al., 2009</xref>). In male mammals, the Y-chromosomal transcription factor (TF) SRY activates a gene regulatory network promoting testis formation and repressing ovary formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koopman et al., 1991</xref>). In the absence of SRY, the TF FOXL2 represses the testis factors, allowing ovarian development to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ottolenghi et al., 2005</xref>). The ovarian somatic cells further differentiate into several lineages, including the granulosa cells which surround and support developing oocytes. Proper oogenesis depends on a complex interplay of paracrine signaling between somatic and germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Bouffant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otsuka and Shimasaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). Granulosa cells additionally participate in endocrine signaling, producing estradiol and progesterone which regulate diverse reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Findlay et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although a few studies have attempted differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to granulosa-like cells through treatment with recombinant signaling proteins, none has resulted in an efficient method, nor has any previous study evaluated their ability to support germ cell development. For example, a study using spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs produced a small fraction of AMHR2-positive granulosa-like cells which expressed some granulosa marker genes and produced estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lipskind et al., 2018</xref>). However, the efficiency of this spontaneous differentiation was low and not numerically reported. A related study used recombinant signaling proteins in a 12-day multistep protocol to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward granulosa-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lan et al., 2013</xref>); again, the yield was low (12–36%), and although the cells upregulated some marker genes, the expression levels were much lower than observed in primary granulosa cells.</p><p>Manipulation of TFs allows reprogramming of cell identity and offers a rapid and efficient way to generate granulosa-like cells. Perhaps the best-known example of cellular reprogramming using TFs is the generation of iPSCs from somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). TF expression can also guide the differentiation of iPSCs into various somatic lineages, including neurons, fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes, and vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ng et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that overexpression of the TFs NR5A1 and GATA4 is sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts into Sertoli-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2019</xref>), the male developmental counterparts of granulosa-like cells. Therefore, we set out to determine a set of TFs that could be used for an efficient, scalable method of generating granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs. Our overall experimental workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental workflow of the study.</title><p>First, barcoded transcription factor (TF) expression vectors were integrated into FOXL2-T2A-tdTomato reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). After induction of TF expression, cells positive for tdTomato and granulosa-related surface markers were sorted, and the barcodes were sequenced. The top TFs based on barcode enrichment were selected for further characterization by combinatorial screening and bulk RNA-seq. Next, monoclonal hiPSC lines were generated that inducibly express the top TFs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>) and generate granulosa-like cells with high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Granulosa-like cells from these lines were further evaluated for estradiol production in response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Finally, they were aggregated with human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to form ovaroids. These ovaroids produced estradiol and progesterone, formed follicle-like structures, and supported hPGCLC maturation as measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and scRNA-seq.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83291-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico prediction of granulosa cell-regulating TFs</title><p>We began by predicting candidate TFs that could direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells.

We measured hormone levels in ovaroid supernatants in the presence or absence of androstenedione and FSH. In addition to estradiol, we also measured progesterone, which granulosa cells produce in vivo after ovulation and formation of the corpus luteum. We observed production of both hormones in five out of six samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

During fetal development, PGCs mature through interactions with gonadal somatic cells, with DAZL playing a key role in downregulation of pluripotency factors and commitment to gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). This process has recently been recreated in vitro using mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>), which allowed the development of hPGCLCs to the oogonia-like stage. We hypothesized that in vitro-derived human granulosa-like cells could perform a similar role, with the potential for eliminating interspecies developmental mismatches. Therefore, we combined our granulosa-like cells with hPGCLCs to form ovarian organoids, which we termed ovaroids.</p><p>To generate ovaroids, we aggregated these two cell types in low-binding U-bottom wells, followed by transfer to air–liquid interface Transwell culture.

The fraction of granulosa cells increased from day 2 through day 8, potentially representing a maturation of the somatic cell population. As expected, neural, immune, smooth muscle, and erythroid cells, which were present in fetal ovaries, were completely absent from our ovaroids. Epithelial, endothelial, and perivascular cells were detected, but at very low frequency (1% or less), possibly representing a low rate of off-target differentiation.</p><p>We additionally examined the overall fraction of germ cells, as well as the fraction of cells expressing the gonadal germ cell markers <italic>DAZL</italic> and <italic>DDX4</italic>, over the course of our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

These granulosa-like cells express granulosa marker genes and have highly similar transcriptomes to the human fetal ovary, both by bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We demonstrate that our system can model several key ovarian phenotypes, including hormonal signaling, germ cell maturation, and follicle formation. Additionally, we characterize the regulatory effects of granulosa-related TFs and determine that co-expression of NR5A1 and RUNX1 or RUNX2 is minimally sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We show that FOXL2 and GATA4 may help to further stabilize the granulosa-like transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and these TFs were also included in some of our top-performing lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Finally, our ovaroids formed from granulosa-like cells and hPGCLCs are notable as the first reported fully human ovarian organoids.</p><p>Our human ovaroids allow the rapid development of hPGCLCs to the gonadal stage as measured by expression of the markers <italic>DAZL</italic> and <italic>DDX4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), which was previously only achieved by extended culture with mouse fetal gonadal somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murase et al., 2020</xref>). As <italic>DAZL</italic> and <italic>DDX4</italic> are not expressed in pre-gonadal germ cells and only become expressed after germ cells colonize the gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>), this implies that our hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells are able to simulate the gonadal niche and allow germ cell maturation. In a direct comparison with the previous method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we show that DAZL expression occurs earlier when hPGCLCs are co-cultured with hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells instead of mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells.</p><p>While our results represent a step forward for the in vitro study of granulosa cells and germ cell development, future research will be necessary to construct a full model of the human ovary. Although we can efficiently generate granulosa-like cells and form ovaroids in combination with germ cells, improved methods will be required for maintaining these ovaroids in culture and preventing the loss of DAZL+ germ cells. Recent optimizations in media and culture methods for re-aggregated human fetal ovarian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizuta et al., 2022</xref>), which were specifically developed to avoid the ‘flattening’ issue with Transwell cultures, may be applicable to our system and allow for more extended development. Our results were also similar to a previous study in which rhesus PGCLCs gained expression of the mature marker DDX4 upon transplantation into an adult testis, but did not complete spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosa et al., 2018</xref>). A better developmental match (using later-stage germ cells or earlier-stage gonadal somatic cells) may provide better results.</p><p>Additionally, the ovary consists of more cell types than merely germ cells and granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and these other cells are also functionally important. For example, our ovaroids produced estradiol only in the presence of androstenedione, which is normally produced by ovarian theca cells. Although our granulosa-like cells were capable of a limited amount of differentiation into NR2F2+ ovarian stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), these were not functional theca cells. Thus, developing a method to generate theca cells (or earlier-stage gonadal cells that differentiate into both granulosa and theca cells) will provide a more complete model of ovarian biology. We anticipate that our overall approach of identifying TFs to drive the differentiation of hiPSCs will be broadly applicable to generate these cell types of interest, as well as many others.</p><p>One further limitation is the random integration of our transposon-based TF expression vectors. This necessitated generating and testing several clonal hiPSC lines before selecting ones that performed well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Additionally, due to the challenge of growing large numbers of hPGCLCs, we only performed our ovaroid experiments using granulosa-like cells from a limited number of lines (six for hormone assays, two for immunofluorescence, and one for scRNA-seq). We selected the lines for these endpoints based on an assessment of their surface marker expression and estradiol production, as well as preliminary aggregation experiments in which they showed follicle-like morphology. In future studies, we hope to better characterize the relative dosage requirements for our TFs and generate hiPSC lines with controlled TF expression from a known integration site in a safe-harbor locus, or from non-integrating episomal vectors. This should provide a more reproducible way to generate high-performing lines.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our system has several advantages in comparison with existing in vitro models of the human ovary. Several studies have used mouse fetal gonad cells to support hPGCLC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>), but this process is much slower (32 vs. 4 days, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the mouse cells may not behave the same as human cells, and mouse fetal gonad cells are difficult to obtain in large quantities. Other studies have used cancer cell lines such as COV434 or KGN to study various aspects of granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Price et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishi et al., 2001</xref>). However, these cancer cells may be phenotypically aberrant. In particular, we show that unlike KGN cells or our iPSC-derived granulosa-like cells, COV434 cells do not express granulosa marker genes and do not respond to FSH. This is in agreement with a recent study reporting that the COV434 cell line was mis-identified and actually originates from small cell carcinoma of the ovary, not a granulosa tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karnezis et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, some previous studies have reported growth-factor-based protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to ovarian granulosa-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lipskind et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonen et al., 2021</xref>). However, the efficiency of such protocols is low (4–12%, or not reported), the protocols require extended culture (multiple weeks vs. 5 days), and those studies did not demonstrate that the cells could support germ cell maturation. Using monoclonal hiPSC lines, our induction efficiency (&gt;70% in top lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) is sufficient to form ovaroids without the need for sorting FOXL2+ cells.</p><p>Overall, our rapid, scalable, and efficient method of producing human granulosa-like cells represents a substantial advance over previous studies. We anticipate that this system will prove useful as a model for the study of ovarian development and function, and that further optimization could allow for human in vitro oogenesis.</p></sec><sec

lines were used in this study: ATCC-BXS0116 female hiPSCs, which we refer to as the F3 line, and the F66 line, an in-house hiPSC line derived from the NIA Aging Cell Repository fibroblast line AG07141 using Epi5 footprint-free episomal reprogramming. The karyotypes of parental lines, as well as engineered reporter lines, were verified by Thermo Fisher Cell ID (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based authentication) + Karyostat, and pluripotency was assessed by Thermo Fisher Pluritest. All lines were identified as normal.</p><p>hiPSCs were cultured in mTESR Plus medium (Stemcell Technologies) on standard polystyrene plates coated with hESC-qualified Matrigel (Corning). Medium was changed daily. Passaging was performed using 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or TRYPLE for experiments requiring single-cell dissociation. hiPSCs were treated with 10 µM Y-27632 (Ambeed) for 24 hr after each passage. COV434 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 1× GlutaMax (Gibco). KGN cells (RIKEN, RCB1154) were cultured in DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1× GlutaMax (Gibco). HGL5 cells (ABM cat. T0650) were cultured in Prigrow IV medium (ABM) with 10% FBS. Passaging was performed with TRYPLE (Gibco). hPGCLCs were cultured in S-CM medium as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>), and passaged with Accutase (Stemcell Technologies). Mycoplasma testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) every 3 months; all cells tested negative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electroporations</title><p>Electroporations were performed using a Lonza Nucleofector with 96-well shuttle, with 200,000 cells in 20 µl of P3 buffer. Pulse setting CA-137 was used for all electroporations. Selection with the appropriate agent was begun 48 hr after electroporation and continued for 5 days. For the agents used in this study, this time was sufficient to give a high-purity final cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reporter construction</title><p>Homology arms for <italic>FOXL2</italic> were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. A targeting plasmid, containing an in-frame C-terminal T2A-tdTomato reporter, as well as a Rox-PGK-PuroTK-Rox selection cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), was constructed by Gibson assembly. The plasmid backbone additionally had an MC1-DTA marker to select against random integration. sgRNA oligos targeting the C-terminal region of <italic>FOXL2</italic> were cloned into pX330 (Addgene #42230). For generation of the reporter lines, 1 µg donor plasmid and 1 µg sgRNA plasmid were co-electroporated into hiPSCs, which were subsequently plated in one well of a 6-well plate. After selection with puromycin (400 ng/ml), colonies were picked manually with a P20 pipette. The hiPSC lines generated were genotyped by PCR for the presence of wild-type and reporter alleles. Homozygous clones were further verified by PCR amplification of the entire <italic>FOXL2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and Sanger sequencing.</p><p>To excise the selection cassette, hiPSCs were electroporated with pCAGGS-Dre (1 µg). Selection was performed with ganciclovir (4 µM) and colonies were picked as described above. The excision of the selection cassette was verified by genotyping.

These were cloned into a barcoded Dox-inducible expression vector (Addgene #175503) using MegaGate cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kramme et al., 2021b</xref>). The final expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing, which also served to determine the barcode sequences for each TF. Two unique barcodes were used per TF during library pooling. Libraries were pooled using an equimolar quantity of each plasmid (measured using QuBit).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TF screening for granulosa differentiation</title><p>A pooled library of barcoded TF plasmids was electroporated into FOXL2-tdTomato reporter hiPSCs, typically at 5 fmol library and 500 ng PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid (Systems Bio). These conditions were chosen to give an average copy number of approximately 5/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Some experiments were also performed at 50 fmol to explore the effects of higher copy numbers. For the screening data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, two libraries were used: library #1, containing 35 TFs, and library #2, containing 18 TFs. Library #1 was used only at 5 fmol, whereas library #2 was used at both 5 and 50 fmol.</p><p>After selection with puromycin (400 ng/ml), hiPSCs were treated with doxycycline (1 µg/ml) in mTESR Plus medium. In additional experiments, hiPSCs were first differentiated to mesoderm following a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morizane and Bonventre, 2017</xref>) before doxycycline treatment. In both sets of experiments, doxycycline treatment continued for 5 days, after which the cells were dissociated with TRYPLE and reporter-positive cells were isolated by FACS. Genomic DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA Micro kit) from reporter-positive and -negative cells, as well as from the initial population before doxycycline treatment.</p><p>Barcodes were amplified by PCR (KAPA polymerase), using 10 ng input gDNA per reaction and typically 22 PCR cycles (95°C 15 s denature, 58°C 20 s anneal/extend). PCR products were purified using ProNex beads, and a second round of PCR (NEB Q5 polymerase, six cycles of 98°C 5 s denature, 61°C 20 s anneal, 72°C 5 s extend, final extension 72°C 2 min) was performed to add Illumina indices (primers are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These amplicons were again purified using ProNex beads. Samples were normalized and pooled, and barcodes were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 10% PhiX spike-in. To call barcodes, reads were aligned to the set of known barcode sequences. Fold changes were calculated by comparing barcode frequencies in the sorted FOXL2+ cells to the frequencies in the starting population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flow cytometry/cell sorting</title><p>Cells were dissociated by treatment with TRYPLE for 5 min, which was quenched with 4 volumes of ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS.

Staining continued on ice in the dark for 30 min. The suspension was diluted with 9 volumes of PBS + 3% FBS. Cells were pelleted (200 g, 5 min) and resuspended in PBS + 3% FBS + 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The suspension was kept on ice in the dark until analysis.

For 24-well plates the medium volume per well was 0.5 ml; for 6-well plates it was 2 ml. 48 hr after plating, the medium was changed to DK10 + doxycycline (1 µg/ml), and the medium was subsequently changed every 24 hr. Cells were harvested on day 5 unless otherwise indicated. In the no-TF control differentiation for RNA-seq, the protocol was the same except the cells did not contain TF expression plasmids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from sorted FOXL2+ granulosa-like cells using the Arcturus PicoPure kit (Thermo Fisher), or from COV434 cells and hiPSCs using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep kit (NEB).

After selection with puromycin, TF expression was induced using doxycycline (1000 ng/ml).</p><p>Two biological replicates were collected for each sample (iPSC, hiPSC+ individual TFs, sorted FOXL2+, no-TF differentiation, KGN, COV434). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional kit following the manufacturer’s protocol, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (2 × 75 bp paired-end reads). The TPM data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were generated using kallisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) to pseudoalign reads to the reference human transcriptome (Ensembl GRCh38 v96). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. PantherDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mi et al., 2021</xref>) was used to calculate gene ontology enrichment for significantly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub>fc &gt;3, p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) and downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>fc &lt;−3, p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) genes for each sample relative to hiPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>TROM analysis</title><p>The TROM method was employed to identify associated genes that capture molecular characteristics of biological samples and subsequently comparing the biological samples by testing the overlap of their associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2017</xref>). TROM scores were calculated as the −log<sub>10</sub>(Bonferroni corrected p value of association) on a scale of 0–300. The TROM magnitude is positively correlated with similarity between two independent samples, with a standard threshold of 12 as a generally accepted indicator of significant similarity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ovaroid formation with hPGCLCs and granulosa-like cells</title><p>F2 female hPGCLCs (see Key Resources table) were maintained in long-term culture as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, hPGCLCs were cultured on Matrigel in STO-conditioned medium (Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium [GMEM] with 13% KSR and 1× non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and GlutaMax, all from Gibco), supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF) (100 ng/ml, Peprotech), ascorbic acid (50 µg/ml, Gibco), and 2-mercaptoethanol (25 µM, Gibco). hPGCLCs were harvested with Accutase. To form ovaroids, granulosa-like cells were harvested with TRYPLE, counted, and mixed with F2 hPGCLCs. For hormone assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we used granulosa-like cells from F3/N.R1 #6, F66/N.R1.G.F #4, F66/N.R1.G #7, F66/N.R2 #1, F66/N.R2 #5, and F66/N.R2.G #3.

human iPS cells. These findings are important to treat female infertility in the future and may prove valuable in the Ob and Gyn clinical practice. The authors provide compelling evidence by developing and validating their model using in vitro ovaroids. This study provides a novel resource for transcriptomic signatures of ovarian somatic cells derived in vitro.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83291.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>T Rajendra</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jc20583</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.04.498717">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498717v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Include a diagram to illustrate the experimental workflow of the study</p><p>2) Improve the quality of images and colors in Figure 3 and 4. In Figure 3, the <italic>Foxl2</italic>+ cells do not seem to be in a position similar to what is typically observed in vivo in ovaries.</p><p>3) Provide a clear rationale for using different endpoints for different cell lines.</p><p>4) The ovaroid data requires an OCT4+ and DAZL+ expression over the total analysis of the study.</p><p>5) The actual transcription factors used in the study need to be clearly described in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I got lost at the beginning of the manuscript trying to understand exactly all the steps that led to the generation of the granulosa-like cells. It would be helpful to include a diagram to illustrate the experimental workflow of the study similar to a graphical abstract.</p><p>In Figure 3, I have several recommendations to facilitate the interpretation of the data</p><p>– The authors mention several times that they observe follicle-like formation in their ovaroid model, but in the IF images the <italic>FOXL2</italic>+ and AMHR2 staining is scattered and looks nothing like the spherical arrangement of squamous (primordial) or cuboidal (growing) cells one would expect to see in the in vivo ovary. In addition, there is no evidence in figures 3 or S5 that DAZL+ hPGCLCs become surrounded by <italic>FOXL2</italic>+ granulosa-like cells. I suggest replacing the images with better-quality IF stains, or the authors should soften the conclusion that follicle-like structures do form in their ovaroid model.</p><p>– The images in panel A Day 2 and Day 4 appear to be on a different scale than the rest, which is confusing.</p><p>– The merged images on the right are not legible, consider removing the DAPI channel from these so that the reader can better appreciate the staining overlap or lack thereof.</p><p>– In figure 4C, I find the integration onto the human cell atlas very helpful. However, it is confusing that the UMAP no longer corresponds to the cluster distribution shown in figure 4A. I would suggest adding an additional visual that shows the projection of the human cell atlas cell ID onto the original clusters of the ovaroid scRNAseq. Also, how do the authors explain that RUNX1 expression is very low in the <italic>FOXL2</italic>+ granulosa-like cluster (Figure 4B)?</p><p>Some of the data is difficult to evaluate in the figures.</p><p>– The bar histograms in figures 2d and e are very compact and difficult to tell apart. Also, the colors are not colorblind-friendly. I recommend changing the colors to more accessible color combinations in these and in figure 4D.</p><p>– The images of the ovaroids lack annotations to guide the readers to what is relevant, and the staining quality is suboptimal, making it difficult to interpret the similarity of these ovariods to in vivo ovaries.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study from Smela et al. describes the production and functional characterisation of granulosa-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells. The key claim is that two transcription factors – NR5A1, and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 – are collectively necessary and sufficient for the production of these cells (abstract line 9, results page 7 line 21, discussion page 16 line 9). While sufficiency for a selected set of characteristics is in part supported by functional and transcriptional analyses, the claim of necessity is not directly tested. If this claim of necessity is to stand, then the authors must clarify their use of this term, or alternatively, describe experiments they have undertaken that would justify this claim. Given the extensive data presented in figure 1b, the threshold used for this justification should also be described in much greater detail.</p><p>Impressively, this paper describes the rapid development of the germline when human-human chimeras are used, and this is a major strength of the study (figure 3). I do however find the use of the term &quot;ovaroid&quot; to be somewhat problematic. An ovary contains many more than two cell types, and a more nuanced term is strongly advised, potentially related to the production of a follicle-like structure.</p><p>While many suitable approaches are performed, the use of COV434 cells is not well-founded. As the authors note, there is some uncertainty regarding the identity of COV434 cells, and as a cancer cell type, are unlikely to reflect embryonic granulosa cells. A more appropriate control might be the starting iPS cells (as presented), or the various sublines developed, from which a more realistic assessment of the TROM value can be drawn. As presented, this transcriptional analysis cannot be used to justify the identity of the TF-induced granulosa-like cells. The authors acknowledge the issues with COV434 cells on page 9 lines 11-14, which further justifies an alternative approach.</p><p>The regulatory logic described in Figure 2c is not clearly described, and a much more rigorous description of the data underlying these findings should be included.</p><p>The section that describing the functional maturation of germline cells (via activation of DAZL and DDX4) is limited in scope, and the manuscript would benefit from orthogonal approaches to demonstrate the engraftment of these cells into follicle-like structures, or transcriptional analyses supporting the claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional Analyses:</p><p>1. Are multiple iPSC lines – biological variables – used to differentiate into granulosa-like cells? It seems this was only tested on lines from ATCC-BXS0116 and not confirmed in another biologically different line. Testing additional lines with the established protocol is necessary to increase robustness.</p><p>2. There are no images of ovaroids treated with androstenedione or FSH for the E2 and P4 experiments.</p><p>3. The ovaroid data was descriptive and requires an OCT4+ and DAZL+ cell over total analysis overtime to support the descriptive claims that these cell types underwent &quot;rapid development&quot; and &quot;declined over time&quot; and to become compare the results from the hPSCs against the murine fetal cells. While the authors do perform an analysis of Dazl-expressing cells in Figure 4D, this is not what is referred to in the paragraphs of results above and there are no comparisons with murine ovaroids here.</p><p>4. Which cells in the ovaroid come from the granulosa-like cell lines versus those that were differentiated into PGCLCs? It will be important to distinguish these populations in &quot;follicle-like&quot; cultures and to confirm that both are still present.</p><p>Editorial or data description suggestions:</p><p>1. &quot;The description of experimentation within the Results section must be more clear.&quot;</p><p>a. The data represented in Figure 2C and SFiles 2 must be presented in a form that demonstrates the relative fold change of expression for each doxy-inducible transcription factor lines in a main figure.</p><p>b. The description of iPSC lines that have one or more TF must be clearly stated. And the results must be clearly described for each line tested. For example, on page 11 &quot;The fourth of our granulosa lines produced high levels of estradiol in all conditions, and this line lacked the RUNX1 expression vector that was present in the others.&quot; Which four lines were used and in which order the authors are referring to them to deduce the &quot;fourth line&quot; was not made clear. Which TFs were in the lines that were picked for &quot;phenotype&quot; on page 12? First described on page 13 – which lines were used as the granulosa-like lines?</p><p>c. Figure 2 – 2 biological replicates for 4 clones? What does G1, G2, G3, G4 mean in Figure 2E? Are these different monoclonal granulosa-like cells from those shown in 2D? If so, why were they chosen?</p><p>2. It is not obvious which iPSC lines were used to generate the hPGCLCs or GLCs in the ovaroid cultures. This should be stated in the results and methods.</p><p>3. Page 13 lines 12-14 compare the expression of SOX17, OCT4, DAZL, and TFAP2C. However, the day in culture chosen for these IF analyses were different.
