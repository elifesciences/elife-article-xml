In particular, genes involved in different functional categories display a distinct codon usage, which was interpreted as evidence that SCU is adaptively constrained to optimize translation efficiency in distinct cellular states. We demonstrate here that SCU is not driven by constraints on tRNA abundance, but by large-scale variation in GC-content, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Expression in meiotic cells is associated with a strong decrease in recombination within genes. Differences in SCU among functional categories reflect differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which is linked to variation in recombination and therefore in gBGC. Overall, the gBGC model explains 70% of the variance in SCU among genes.

Both adaptive and nonadaptive processes, not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain the existence of codon usage biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duret, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamary et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). The main adaptive model, called translational selection, proposes that synonymous codon usage (SCU) and abundance of tRNA are co-adapted to optimize the efficiency of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikemura, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanaya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hershberg and Petrov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009</xref>). The selective pressure on translational efficiency (in terms of both speed and accuracy) is expected to be more pronounced in highly expressed genes because they mobilize a large number of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulmer, 1991</xref>) and are subject to stronger constraints on translational errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</xref>). A first prediction of this model is that preferred codons should correspond to the most abundant tRNAs, particularly in highly expressed genes. A second prediction is that codon usage bias should correlate with gene expression patterns and tRNA contents. Both predictions are verified in some animals, such as flies and nematodes, the genomes of which show clear signatures of translational selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shields et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duret, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castillo-Davis and Hartl, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The situation is different in mammals, and notably humans, where the influence of translational selection is still strongly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duret, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamary et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). It has long been shown that variation in SCU between genes is correlated to large-scale fluctuations of GC-content along chromosomes, the so-called isochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mouchiroud et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mouchiroud et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clay and Bernardi, 2011</xref>). The fact that codon usage correlates with the base composition of non-coding regions demonstrates that SCU is affected by a process that is not linked to translational selection. And indeed, there is strong evidence that isochores are the consequence of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a form of segregation distortion that occurs during meiotic recombination and that favors the transmission of GC alleles over AT alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). This non-adaptive process leads to an increase in GC-content in regions of high recombination rate, which affects both coding and non-coding regions, including synonymous codon positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galtier and Duret, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glémin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In principle, this does not exclude that besides gBGC, codon usage bias might also be affected by translational selection. Interestingly, several studies have reported that human codon usage varies among genes expressed in different tissues or cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vinogradov, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plotkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, strong variations in SCU are observed among sets of human genes associated to different functional categories and notably between sets of genes involved in cellular proliferation or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). The relative abundance of tRNA varies also according to the proliferative or differentiation state of cells, which was logically interpreted in term of translational selection: different cell types express specific sets of genes whose coding sequence is co-adapted with specific pools of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). If true, this has important implications regarding the role of translational regulation in determining cell fate (differentiation versus proliferation).</p><p>However, this interpretation stands in contradiction with two other studies examining tRNA abundance in mammals. First, although expression levels of individual tRNA genes vary substantially between tissue types and developmental stages in mice, the collective expression levels of isoacceptor tRNAs (which recognize the same codon) remain constant. Thus, the pool of available anticodons is stable throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>). Second, in continuation to this work, a recent study specifically contrasted cells undergoing proliferation and those undergoing differentiation, and found no covariation of tRNA pool and codon usage between these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rudolph et al., 2016</xref>). Both results are inconsistent with the differences in SCU between functional classes as being a consequence of translational selection.</p><p>The question of the relative contributions of adaptive and nonadaptive processes to variation in codon usage in mammals therefore remains open: on the one side, patterns of tRNA abundances do not fit with the translational selection model, but on the other side, the reason why codon usage varies among functional categories is not yet understood. Here, we examined the hypothesis that variation in codon usage might result from differences in transcription activity in meiotic cells. Indeed, it has been observed that intragenic recombination rate correlates negatively with expression level in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McVicker and Green, 2010</xref>). It is therefore possible that differences in germline expression levels among functional categories induce differences in gBGC, and hence codon usage biases.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed SCU among different functional categories of human genes, and investigated covariation with GC-content, recombination rate and expression patterns. We first show that the variation in codon usage among functional categories results from differences in GC content. Then, we propose a new test that demonstrates that variation in SCU is not associated with translational selection. Instead, SCU correlates with large-scale variation in genomic GC-content and with differences in intragenic recombination rate. In turn, the difference in intragenic recombination rate between functional categories is explained by their expression level in meiosis. Altogether, GC-content of non-coding regions and meiotic expression explain 70% of the variation in SCU of human genes. In the end, our results are fully consistent with the hypothesis that SCU is driven by gBGC, and not by translational selection. They indicate that the differences observed among functional categories reflect variation in long-term intragenic recombination rates, resulting from differences in meiotic expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Variation in codon usage among functional categories results from differences in GC-content</title><p>To better understand the causes of the differences in codon usage between sets of genes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation (reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>]), we started by investigating the main factors that discriminate codon usage between functional categories in general. For this purpose, we grouped genes per functional category (687 biological processes, associated to more than 40 genes in the Gene Ontology database), and computed codon frequencies for each of these gene sets. We used the classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al. (2014)</xref> to distinguish GO gene sets associated to ‘proliferation’ or ‘differentiation’. Variation in relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU; see Materials and methods) among GO gene sets was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The first principal component of this analysis segregates ‘proliferation’ (red dots) from ‘differentiation’ (blue dots) GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al. (2014)</xref>, synonymous codon usage clearly varies between functional categories in general, and between proliferation and differentiation in particular. Previous studies had shown that synonymous codon usage is correlated to GC content at third position of codons – termed GC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mouchiroud et al., 1988</xref>). And indeed, we observed that the average GC3 of each GO gene set is perfectly correlated to their coordinates on the first PCA axis (R<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hence, variation in SCU between functional categories is fully explained by variation in GC3.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27344.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Variation in synonymous codon usage and in GC3 among functional categories.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Factorial map of the principal-component analysis of synonymous codon usage in GO functional categories in the human genome.

Many genes belong to more than one GO biological-process category, either because they have several functions (pleiotropy) or because these categories are nested from specific to broad functions. Hence, GO-terms are not independent. To avoid this redundancy, for the remainder of this study we switched from analyses at the level of GO gene sets to analyses at the level of individual genes (except when stated otherwise). Each gene was assigned with one of three categories based on their GO annotation: 1008 genes associated with ‘proliferation’, 2833 genes associated with ‘differentiation’, and 12,129 ‘other’ genes unrelated to these key words (see Materials and methods). Genes associated to ‘proliferation’ are on average less GC-rich than genes associated to ‘differentiation’ (mean GC3 0.53 and 0.61 in the two subsets respectively). The two distributions of GC3 differ significantly from each other (t-test, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>), and their peaks coincide with each of the two modes observed for the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Variation in synonymous codon usage is not driven by translational selection</title><p>We first investigated whether the observed variation in synonymous codon usage (i.e. variation in GC3) might be driven by translational selection. This model proposes that the relative usage of synonymous codons should co-vary with the abundance of their cognate tRNAs. A property of the tRNA gene repertoires allows us to test this hypothesis. The human genome contains 506 tRNA genes (decoding the 20 standard amino acids), corresponding to 48 different tRNA isoacceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>). Among the 18 amino acids having two or more synonymous codons, 4 are decoded by a single tRNA isoacceptor (mono-isoacceptor amino acids: Phe, Asp, His and Cys), and the 14 other ones are decoded by several tRNA isoacceptors (multi-isoacceptors amino acids).</p><p>For multi-isoacceptors amino acids, the relative abundance of the different tRNA isoacceptors can vary among different cell types, and hence might covary with the relative synonymous codon usage of genes preferentially expressed in these cell types. For instance, let us consider Gln, which has two synonymous codons (CAG, CAA) that are decoded by two tRNA isoacceptors (respectively anticodons CTG and TTG). Let us consider a theoretical example of two cell types (say A and B) that differ in their relative tRNA abundance (CTG-tRNA being more abundant in A cells, and TTG-tRNA in B cells). According to the translational selection model, sets of genes that are over-expressed in A cells, should preferentially use the CAG codon, whereas genes that are over-expressed in B cells, should preferentially use the CAA codon. However, mono-isoacceptor amino acids are, by definition, decoded by a single tRNA isoacceptor and the relative tRNA abundance cannot vary across cell types. Hence, according to the translational selection model, the relative synonymous codon usage for mono-isoacceptor amino acids is not expected to vary among cell-specific gene sets. In other words, for mono-isoacceptor amino acids, variation in synonymous codon usage among GO gene sets cannot be explained by co-adaptation with the tRNA pool.</p><p>To test whether variation in synonymous codon usage was driven by translational selection, we computed synonymous codon usage (GC3) in GO gene sets, separately for codons corresponding to mono-isoacceptor amino acids and for codons corresponding to multi-isoacceptor amino acids. We observed that the range of variation in GC3 is very similar for mono- and multi-isoacceptor amino acids. Importantly, the two parameters are strongly correlated (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This implies that GC3 variation is driven by a process that affects both mono-isoacceptor and multi-isoacceptor amino acids, and hence that this process is not related to variation in tRNA abundance. This observation holds true for all functional categories, including those associated to differentiation or proliferation (red and blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Impact of large-scale variation in genomic GC-content on synonymous codon usage</title><p>We observed that the GC3 of genes correlates with the GC-content of their flanking regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.48, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>).

Thus, variation in SCU between genes is to a large extent attributable to the GC-content of the genomic region in which they are located (the isochore effect). However, when the regional GC-content is controlled for, there remains a difference in GC3 between gene categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): for a given regional GC-content, the GC3 of proliferation-associated genes is lower than that of differentiation or other genes. This difference is highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>).

In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McVicker and Green (2010)</xref>, we observed that the negative correlation between expression level and intragenic crossover rate is stronger in germ cells than in somatic samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which indicates that recombination is associated with expression level, specifically in meiotic cells.</p><p>Many ‘proliferation’ genes are involved in basic cellular functions, and hence, tend to be expressed at relatively high levels in many tissues and at all developmental stages. In particular, most of these genes are highly expressed in meiotic cells: 65% of ‘proliferation’ genes are among the top 33% of genes with highest expression level (whereas only 11% are in the first tercile; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conversely, only 26% of ‘differentiation’ genes are highly expressed in meiotic cells, while 42% of are in the first tercile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This large proportion of ‘proliferation’ genes with high meiotic expression levels can therefore explain why they tend to have relatively low intragenic crossover rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and hence, given the gBGC process, why they tend to have a lower GC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further test whether these differences in expression patterns could account for the difference in GC3 between ‘proliferation’, ‘differentiation’ and ‘other genes’, we binned genes into three classes of increasing meiotic expression level. The distribution of GC3 is clearly shifted toward lower values for genes highly expressed at meiosis (top 33%), compared to genes weakly expressed (bottom 33%): the average GC3 is 0.51 in the ‘high’ category compared to 0.65 in the ‘low’ category (p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, there is no significant difference in the distribution of GC3 between ‘proliferation’ and ‘differentiation’ within bins of low or high expression (p-value=0.68 and 0.15 respectively). For the mid-expression bin, there is still a significant difference of GC3 between ‘proliferation’ and ‘differentiation’ (p-value=3.2.10<italic><sup>−8</sup></italic>), potentially explained by differences in expression between categories within this bin. Thus, most of the difference in synonymous codon usage between functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) disappears once level of expression during meiosis is controlled for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Thus, differences in synonymous codon usage among gene categories in human can be explained through the following causative chain: (i) The set of ‘proliferation’ genes is enriched in genes highly expressed in meiosis. (ii) Because high expression at meiosis is associated with a decreased rate of recombination, intragenic recombination rates are lower in the ‘proliferation’ set. (iii) In turn, reduced intragenic recombination diminishes the effect of gBGC on exon base composition, and hence GC3 is lower in the set ‘proliferation’ compared to ‘differentiation’.</p><p>To check whether this cascade of effects fully recapitulates the difference in synonymous codon usage between ‘proliferation’ and ‘differentiation’, we investigated whether differences in SCU between functional categories are driven by expression level in cells undergoing meiosis, rather than by expression level in another cell type or tissue. We examined the relationship between GC3 and expression levels in a broad panel of cell and tissue conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As predicted by our model, expression levels in germ cells, either from single-cell samples or from testis (which contains germ cells) are better predictors of GC3 than expression in all other somatic tissues. Strikingly, the levels of expression in primary germ cells is, on average, twice as informative than expression in somatic cells taken at comparable stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Among all individual samples, the strongest correlation between GC3 and expression level was found in male meiotic cells (pachytene spermatocytes, R<sup>2</sup> = 6.3%, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>). Female meiotic cells (primordial germ cells, PGC 17 W) showed a similar correlation level (R<sup>2</sup> = 4.0%, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>). As expected, the correlation is even stronger with sex-averaged meiotic expression level (R<sup>2</sup> = 8.6%, p-value&lt;2.10<italic><sup>−16</sup></italic>). Hence, these results confirm that the cell type for which gene expression level is the best predictor of GC3 (and therefore SCU) corresponds to meiotic cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27344.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Correlation between expression level and GC3 in a panel of tissues and cell types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bulk adult tissues data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>) and (<bold>B</bold>) early embryo single-cell data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, the expression pattern is expected to affect gBGC intensity (and hence the GC-content) both in exons and in introns.

We build a linear model to quantify the relative contribution of the different parameters that covary with the GC3 of human genes (GCi, GC-flank, intragenic crossover rate, meiotic expression level, and ‘proliferation’ or ‘differentiation’ functional category).

Initially this pattern has been interpreted as evidence that the translation program was under tight control, notably to ensure a precise regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation or proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>). According to this model, selection should optimize the match between the SCU of genes and tRNA abundances in the cells where they are expressed. However, the comparison of synonymous codon usage for amino acids with single or multiple tRNA isoacceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) shows that the difference in SCU between functional categories does not result from constraints linked to tRNA abundance. In fact, variation in synonymous codon usage among functional categories is explained by one single dominant factor: the GC-content at third codon position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The GC3 of human genes is strongly correlated to the GC-content of their introns and flanking regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This implies that variation in SCU results from a process that affects both coding and non-coding regions (including non-transcribed intergenic regions), and hence that it is not related to the process of translation. In fact, this observation invalidates all the models that assume that SCU is driven by a selective pressure acting on RNAs (not only translational selection, but also selection on mRNA processing, structure or stability).</p><p>Many lines of evidence indicate that large-scale variation in GC-content along chromosomes (isochores) is driven by the gBGC process, both in mammals and birds. First, there is direct evidence that recombination favors the transmission of GC-alleles over AT-alleles during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeithuber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smeds et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the analysis of polymorphism and divergence at different physical scales (from kb to Mb) showed that recombination induces a fixation bias in favor of GC alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duret and Arndt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clément and Arndt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pratto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glémin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>). Third, the gBGC model predicts that the GC-content of a given genomic segment should reflect its average long-term recombination rate over tens of million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duret and Arndt, 2008</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, analyses of ancestral genetic maps in the primate lineage revealed a very strong correlation between long-term recombination rates (in 1 Mb long windows) and stationary GC-content – R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munch et al., 2014</xref>). The strong correlation between GC3 and GC-flank therefore implies that variation in synonymous codon usage is primarily driven by large-scale variation in long-term recombination rate.</p><p>Besides these regional fluctuations, recombination rates also vary at finer scale. In particular, recombination rates tend to be reduced within human genes compared to their flanking regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2005</xref>), and this decrease depends on the level of expression of genes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McVicker and Green, 2010</xref>) – see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Hence, the gBGC model predicts that the GC3 of a gene should depend not only of the long-term recombination rate of the region where it is located, but also on its specific pattern of expression. And indeed, we observed that the difference in synonymous codon usage between ‘proliferation’ and ‘differentiation’ genes is not due to their preferential location in different classes of isochores, but to the fact that ‘proliferation’ genes tend to be expressed a high level in meiotic cells, and therefore to have a reduced intragenic recombination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27344.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Relationships between GC-content, intragenic crossover rates and meiotic expression levels (sex-averaged) among functional gene categories.</title><p>Average values of these parameters were computed for each GO gene set.

As predicted by the gBGC model, we observed a strong correlation between GC3 and the average intragenic crossover rate of GO gene sets (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The variance in intragenic crossover rate, in turn, is very well explained by differences in meiotic expression levels among functional classes (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As mentioned previously, these correlations measured on gene concatenates should be interpreted with caution because the different points are not independent (a same gene can belong to different GO categories). However, this analysis clearly shows that a large fraction of the variance in SCU observed among GO gene sets can be explained by variation in gBGC intensity, caused by variation in intragenic crossover rates, linked to differences expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In agreement with the gBGC model, the intragenic crossover rate correlates with the base composition of the entire gene, including introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This observation clearly invalidates the hypothesis that the observed differences in SCU among functional categories might be driven by selection on codon usage.</p><p>In summary, the SCU of individual genes depends primarily on the isochore in which they are located (i.e. large-scale long-term variation in recombination rate), and secondarily on their meiotic expression level (which affects locally the intragenic recombination rate) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In gene set analyses, the variance in SCU explained by expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) appears much stronger than in individual genes analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This is due to the fact that in gene set analyses, SCU is averaged over a large number of genes, located in different isochores, which leads to decrease the isochore effect among functional categories (and hence mechanically increase the fraction of the variance explained by expression). Overall, the different variables linked to the intensity of gBGC explain 70% of the variance in GC3 of individual genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In other words, the gBGC model can account for most of the variation in synonymous codon usage in the human genome.</p><p>It should be noted that co-variation between SCU and expression is generally considered as a typical signature of translational selection and is often used to predict optimal codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duret, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plotkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009</xref>). However, as shown here, such correlations can also emerge as a result of a non-adaptive process. Given that gBGC is widespread in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capra and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pessia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smeds et al., 2016</xref>), it appears essential to take this process into account to interpret variation in synonymous codon usage (and more generally in base composition) among genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between meiotic expression and recombination</title><p>The reason why intragenic recombination rate correlates negatively with meiotic expression level is not known. In human and mice, the location of recombination hotspots is determined by PRDM9, a Zn-Finger DNA-binding protein with histone H3 lysine four trimethylation (H3K4me3) activity. PRDM9 is expressed during early meiosis and marks sites where DSBs are afterwards introduced by Spo11 (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>). These DSBs are then repaired by homologous recombination, forming either crossovers, the reciprocal exchanges of genetic material between parental chromosomes, or noncrossovers. Knockout experiments in mice have demonstrated that PRDM9 targets recombination away from active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brick et al., 2012</xref>). The analyses of male DSB maps suggests that PRDM9 plays the same role in humans: we observed a deficit of DSB hotpots around the transcription start site (TSS), specifically within genes that are highly expressed in meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The decrease in recombination rate within highly expressed genes is however not restricted to the promoter region: in both sexes, there is a strong deficit of crossovers within the entire transcription unit, from the TSS to the polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In species that lack Prdm9 (such as dogs, birds, arabidopsis or yeast), recombination hotspots are strongly enriched in active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>), which indicates that there is no mechanistic incompatibility between recombination and transcription activity in meiotic cells. However there is evidence that in highly expressed genes, H3K36me3 marks trigger DNA methylation in the gene body, and thereby prevent spurious transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neri et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore possible that the peculiar chromatin state of highly expressed genes also interferes with the binding of PRDM9 (or with its histone modification activity), and thereby decrease the rate of DSB formation within the transcription unit. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a deficit in male DSB hotspot density along the transcription unit of highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This difference in DSB rates is, however, much less pronounced than the difference in male crossover rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the profile of DSB hotspot density in highly expressed genes differs from that of crossover rates, with a strong deficit around the TSS and an excess around the polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), whereas the deficit in male crossovers is more uniform along the transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the differences in crossover profiles observed between highly and weakly expressed genes might also reflect differences in the way recombination events are resolved (crossover vs. non-crossovers).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>gBGC precludes selection on translation efficiency in humans</title><p>There is a clear evidence that the usage of synonymous codons is under selective pressure in some metazoan species (such as drosophila or nematode), which implies that it has a significant impact on the fitness of organisms – for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duret, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamary et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). It is <italic>a priori</italic> expected that codon usage should also affect translation efficiency (speed and accuracy) in mammals. However, our results show that selection on codon usage is not strong enough to counteract the impact of gBGC. In principle, this does not exclude the hypothesis that the human genome might be subject to selection for translational efficiency: even if the GC-content of genes is driven by non-adaptive processes, there might be a selective pressure on the expression of tRNA genes to match the demand in synonymous codon usage. However, recent analyses of tRNA isoacceptors pools found no evidence for such variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rudolph et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we argue here that the peculiar base composition landscape induced by gBGC in the genomes of mammals and birds makes it impossible to match the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage. Indeed, large-scale variation in recombination rates along the genome causes very strong variation in GC3 among genes, and this, regardless of their functional category. In particular, ‘proliferative’ genes, which are involved in basic cellular process, and are expressed at high levels in most tissues, show a very strong heterogeneity in GC3 (from 20% to almost 100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This implies that in any given cell, the set of highly expressed genes will show a very heterogeneous usage of synonymous codons. Hence, whatever the pool of tRNA available in that cell, there will be a large fraction of genes with a codon usage that does not match tRNA abundance. In other words, the heterogeneity of synonymous codon usage in mammalian genomes reflects a non-optimal situation, caused the gBGC process, in which it is not possible to adapt the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage of the transcriptome of any cell type.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human protein coding genes</title><p>For each of the human protein coding genes in the Ensembl (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002344">SCR_002344</ext-link>) release 83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates et al., 2016</xref>); assembly GRCh38.p5), we identified a canonical transcript as defined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=346">http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=346</ext-link> (PERL script available in supplementary material).

Recently it was proposed that differences in codon usage bias between different functional categories of genes is evidence for selection for optimal codon usage and translational efficiency (Ginghold et al., 2014). Specifically Gingold et al. found that genes in GO categories related to &quot;proliferation&quot; have a much different codon usage than genes in GO categories related to &quot;differentiation&quot;. In this manuscript by Pouyet et al., the authors test whether differences in codon usage between functional gene categories can be explained by GC-biased biased gene conversion (gBGC) rather than natural selection.</p><p>The authors make several strong arguments that gBGC is a much better explanation for the observed differences in codon usage bias between different genes than natural selection. They find that codon usage bias described by Ginghold et al. (PC1 of a PCA) is almost perfectly correlated with the GC content of 3rd codon positions (GC3). GC3 is in turn very well predicted by a combination of intronic GC content, flanking GC content, recombination rate and meiotic gene expression. After controlling for these variables, the functional gene category explains very little of the variation in GC3.</p><p>Overall the paper is very clearly written and makes a convincing case that differences in synonymous codon usage between different GO categories is driven by gBGC. This result is not especially surprising given previous work showing that GC3 is well-correlated with regional GC content (isochores), but given the recent high-profile argument for selection by Ginghold et al. I feel that it is important to publish this finding. In addition, the paper is novel in that it proposes a mechanistic explanation for differences in GC3 between gene categories-that meiotic gene expression suppresses recombination so that genes with high meiotic gene expression undergo less gBGC and have lower GC content.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The per-gene GC3 variance explained by meiotic expression is modest (R^2=8.3%) compared to that of intronic or flanking GC content (62% and 48%). If meiotic expression and reduction in rec. rate explain GC3 and variation codon usage, why is the correlation with meiotic expression so much weaker than the correlations with GCi and GCflank? It would be useful to include some acknowledgement and discussion of this in the paper. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the correlation with meiotic expression and GC3 is far stronger at the level of gene categories. Is the explanation for the low R^2 for individual genes that individual gene estimates of meiotic expression are noisy? Or could it be that meiotic gene expression of broad gene categories has remained fairly consistent during evolution, even though the expression of individual genes has changed substantially?</p><p>The difference in R^2 between panels A and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is puzzling. Why is the correlation between rec rate and GC3 so much stronger than the correlation between rec. rate and GCi? I would expect estimates of GCi to be more precise than those of GC3, since more sites can be used in the estimate, so differences in noise is not a good explanation. Is the better correlation with GC3 driven by the first exon (does the strength of correlation vary with distance from the promoter)? If so, this might suggest something about mechanism. E.g. gBGC might be highest near the promoter.</p><p>In the Abstract the authors say that meiotic transcription interferes with the formation of crossovers. While this might be true, the mechanism is uncertain and speculative. It would be better to draw a less speculative conclusion like &quot;genes with higher meiotic transcription have lower recombination rates&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (major comments):</italic> </p><p>This article provides strong evidence that gene expression level during meiosis determines which synonymous codons are most likely to appear in human gene sequences. Compared to genes that are not expressed during meiosis, housekeeping genes that are highly expressed during meiosis are less likely to recombine, undergo GC-biased gene conversion, or have high GC content at synonymous sites. This conclusion is well supported by the analyses presented in the paper, which refute a claim by Gingold, et al. that a difference in human synonymous codon usage between &quot;proliferation-related&quot; and &quot;differentiation-related&quot; genes is driven by selection for translation efficiency.</p><p>The main weakness of this paper, in my view, is that it reads more like a response to Gingold, et al. than a standalone piece of work. To avoid the impression that the paper is a niche product that will only interest readers who have some kind of prior stake in the Gingold, et al. results, it would be helpful for the authors to convey a better sense of how Gingold, et al. sits in the broader landscape of selectionist explanations for codon bias, and what these new results mean for that work in general. In showing that selection on translation efficiency does not drive the contrast between codon bias in proliferation genes versus differentiation genes, are the authors only refuting the hypothesis of one particular paper, or of a broader set of papers claiming that selection for translation efficiency drives codon bias in the human genome?</p><p>Along the same lines, the title statement that &quot;biased gene conversion drives codon usage&quot; strikes me as underselling the results a bit. It doesn't give any hints about the intriguing and surprising observation that intron GC content and meiotic gene expression explain codon distribution so much better than isochore structure does. Once these results start being discussed in detail, the paper starts seeming less like a contradictory results response paper and more like a very interesting standalone paper, but this transition happens quite late in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27344.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As you will see from the specific comments below, both reviewers agree that the analysis is convincing and ultimately worth publishing in</italic> eLife<italic>.

In general, there are a number of papers on the determinants of recombination in human meiosis that may be relevant to this discussion (e.g., Pratto et al., 2014, as well as work by Bernard de Massy and Scott Keeney). We would therefore ask that you revise the text (and Abstract) accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We added a section in the Discussion to present in more details the current knowledge about the determinants of the location of recombination events (and notably PRDM9) and to discuss the possible links with transcription (subsection “Relationship between meiotic expression and recombination”). Furthermore, we reevaluated the relationship between intragenic recombination and expression using DSB maps (Pratto et al., 2014) and a new high resolution genetic map that has just been published (Bhérer et al., 2017) (Results subsection “The difference in intragenic recombination rate between functional categories is explained by their expression level in meiosis”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). We have modified the text, the figures and their legends to specify which datasets were used to estimate recombination (intragenic crossover rates, or DSB hotspots). We updated the supplementary information (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.835063) to include these new data and analyses.</p><p>These new data show that the relationship between crossover rate and meiotic gene expression is even stronger than initially reported: we observed that the crossover rate is 3.5 (males) to 5.4 (females) times lower in highly expressed genes (top 10%) compared to weakly expressed genes (bottom 10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). This decrease affects the entire transcription unit, from the TSS to the polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The reduction in crossover rate is due, at least in part, to a lower density of meiotic DSB hotspots within highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). One possible explanation for this pattern, is that high transcription levels might interfere with the binding of PRDM9 (or with its histone H3K4 trimethylation activity), and thereby decrease the rate of DSB formation within the transcription unit (these results are discussed in more details in subsection “Relationship between meiotic expression and recombination”). We agree that these observations are not sufficient to demonstrate a causal link between meiotic expression and recombination rate. We corrected all sentences (Abstract, main text) that were suggesting a direct impact of transcription on recombination).</p><p>Reviewer #1 (major comments):</p><p><italic>[…] The per-gene GC3 variance explained by meiotic expression is modest (R^2=8.3%) compared to that of intronic or flanking GC content (62% and 48%). If meiotic expression and reduction in rec. rate explain GC3 and variation codon usage, why is the correlation with meiotic expression so much weaker than the correlations with GCi and GCflank?

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the correlation with meiotic expression and GC3 is far stronger at the level of gene categories. Is the explanation for the low R^2 for individual genes that individual gene estimates of meiotic expression are noisy? Or could it be that meiotic gene expression of broad gene categories has remained fairly consistent during evolution, even though the expression of individual genes has changed substantially?</italic> </p><p>The referee is correct: the SCU of individual genes depends primarily on the isochore in which they are located (i.e. large-scale long-term variation in recombination rate), and only secondarily on their meiotic expression level (which affects locally the intragenic recombination rate) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). At the level of gene categories, meiotic expression explains a high fraction of variation in SCU. This is due to the fact that in gene set analyses, SCU is averaged over a large number of genes, located in different isochores, which leads to decrease the isochore effect among functional categories (and hence mechanically increase the fraction of the variance explained by expression).</p><p>We have added a paragraph in Discussion (subsection “Biased gene conversion drives codon usage in human” paragraph five) to clarify this point.</p><p>That said, the correlation with meiotic expression levels is probably blurred by the variance caused by measurement errors and temporal fluctuations, as suggested by the reviewer. In the main text, we have been using the average of 4 samples for male meiotic expression (from Lesh et al., 2016). We verified that the correlation between GC3 and meiotic expression level is always lower (by 5%-25%) when expression level is measured using a single sample. Hence, measurement errors influence the level of the correlations. We also verified that expression level at male meiosis is well correlated between mouse and human (R²=0.73, N=14,768 genes with 1:1 orthologs in mouse and humans; data from Lesh et al., 2016). Hence, expression levels measured in humans are good predictors of human/mouse average meiotic expression level, and thereby carry information on long-term intragenic recombination. Yet expression levels have changed for many genes between human and mouse. We measured the correlation between GC3 and expression level on a set 9185 genes for which expression level is roughly comparable in human and mouse (assessed by the fact that they rank in the same quartile in both species). The correlation measured on this set of genes is increased by 20% as compared to the correlation measured on the total set of genes. Hence, the strength of the correlation between GC3 and meiotic expression level reported in the paper is probably a lower bound because of these two sources of variability. In any case, the local effect of meiotic expression is much weaker than the large-scale isochore effect.</p><p><italic>The difference in R^2 between panels A and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is puzzling. Why is the correlation between rec rate and GC3 so much stronger than the correlation between rec. rate and GCi? I would expect estimates of GCi to be more precise than those of GC3, since more sites can be used in the estimate, so differences in noise is not a good explanation.</italic> </p><p>At neutral sites, the base composition of sequences is expected to depend on the pattern of base substitution (i.e. on the pattern of base-replacement mutations and on the intensity of gBGC), and on the pattern of deletions and insertions. The difference between GCi and GC3 can be explained by the fact that while the base composition of exons is almost exclusively driven by base substitutions, introns are also affected by deletions and insertions. Thus the base composition of introns depends not only on the long-term intensity of gBGC, but also on the pattern of indels (notably of transposable elements) (Duret and Hurst 2001 Mol. Biol. Evol. 18:757–62). Moreover, there is evidence that recombination rates differ between exons and introns (Kong et al., 2010 Nature 467:1099–103).</p><p><italic>Is the better correlation with GC3 driven by the first exon (does the strength of correlation vary with distance from the promoter)? If so, this might suggest something about mechanism. E.g. gBGC might be highest near the promoter.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, Bhérer et al., 2017 showed that there is an elevation of recombination rate around the TSS, and hence gBGC is expected to be stronger near the promoter. However, the variation in intragenic recombination rate according to meiotic expression affects the entire transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Hence, the variation in recombination rate (and hence SCU) among functional categories is not expected to be restricted to the 5’ end of genes.</p><p>To verify this point, we computed the correlation between recombination rate and GC3 separately for the first or the last parts of the genes. For simplicity, we extracted 50 codons at the beginning and at the end of each gene (50 codons is the average length of human coding exons (Lander et al., 2001)), and we computed the average GC3 per GO category. The correlation between GC3 and recombination rate is lower for the beginning (R2=0.28; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) than for the end of the coding sequences (R2=0.37). Thus, the correlation between recombination rates and GC3 is not driven by the codons proximal to the promoter.</p><p>The new results about variation in recombination rates along genes according to their expression level are now presented in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We therefore think that the supplementary analysis presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) is not necessary.

In showing that selection on translation efficiency does not drive the contrast between codon bias in proliferation genes versus differentiation genes, are the authors only refuting the hypothesis of one particular paper, or of a broader set of papers claiming that selection for translation efficiency drives codon bias in the human genome?</italic> </p><p><italic>Along the same lines, the title statement that &quot;biased gene conversion drives codon usage&quot; strikes me as underselling the results a bit. It doesn't give any hints about the intriguing and surprising observation that intron GC content and meiotic gene expression explain codon distribution so much better than isochore structure does. Once these results start being discussed in detail, the paper starts seeming less like a contradictory results response paper and more like a very interesting standalone paper, but this transition happens quite late in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We rewrote the Introduction and modified the title and the Abstract to present the study in the broader context of the ongoing debate on the role of selection in shaping codon usage in mammals.</p></body></sub-article></article>
