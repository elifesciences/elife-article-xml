While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14837.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14837.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14837.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many biological features of animals, including body temperature and hormone levels, follow daily rhythms that repeat every 24 hours. These so-called circadian rhythms are driven by an internal body clock and are essential for the organism to adapt to the daily cycle of light and dark. Circadian rhythms also take place inside individual cells – for example, the amount of a given protein in a cell often rises and falls over each 24-hour period.</p><p>To generate these daily fluctuations, the processes used to make proteins based on the instructions encoded within a gene must be carefully controlled. Genes are first copied or ‘transcribed' into intermediate molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These mRNA molecules must then travel out of the cell’s nucleus before they can be de-coded to produce proteins. This means that daily fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels could occur because the rate at which the DNA is transcribed fluctuates or because controlling the steps that occur after transcription. However it is not clear how much these post-transcriptional steps contribute to circadian rhythms inside cells.</p><p>Recently, structures called paraspeckles were seen inside the nucleus. These structures are made from a long RNA molecule that does not code for a protein, and a number of proteins that can bind mRNA molecules. Paraspeckles are thought to prevent certain mRNAs from leaving the nucleus and therefore stop them from being decoded to make proteins. Torres et al. have now investigated whether paraspeckles may play a role in circadian rhythms.</p><p>Torres et al. looked at the long non-coding RNA and several proteins that are known to be components of paraspeckles in cells taken from the pituitary glands of rats using a variety of techniques. These cells were chosen because they were known to have a working circadian clock. The analysis showed that the levels of these components, as well as the number of paraspeckles within the nucleus, changed over the course of a daily cycle.</p><p>Torres et al. then confirmed that mRNAs containing a sequence that is known to recruit mRNAs to paraspeckes (the IRAlu sequence) could be also retained in the nucleus or released with a circadian rhythm. This pattern was lost when the paraspeckles were disrupted.</p><p>These findings suggest that daily fluctuations in protein levels can be post-transcriptionally controlled by paraspeckles rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus. Future studies could explore whether it may be possible to control circadian rhythms by targeting the paraspeckles, which could help to improve conditions where the internal body clock goes wrong.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14837.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14837.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pituitary cells</kwd><kwd>paraspeckle</kwd><kwd>circadian oscillators</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>nuclear RNA retention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFE award - Research price 2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>François-Bellan</surname><given-names>Anne-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circadian gene expression can be driven by a post-transcriptional mechanism involving circadian mRNA nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian clock orchestrates daily rhythms in metabolism, physiology and behavior that allow organisms to anticipate regular changes in their environment, increasing their adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>). Circadian rhythms are underpinned by daily rhythms of gene expression. The transcriptional component of these rhythms is well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang and Kay, 2010</xref>). The circadian variation in abundance of the positive (Clock and Bmal1) and the negative (Per1, Per2 and Cry1, Cry2) components of these loops drive the circadian transcription of both direct targets genome-wide and a cascade of circadian output transcription factors, which together mediate the circadian transcriptional profile of a cell type or tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher and Schibler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rey et al., 2011</xref>). Though the core circadian system has concentrated on transcriptional control, it has been apparent that substantial regulation is achieved after transcription so that post-transcriptional controls are emerging as crucial modulators of circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim and Allada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>). While in eukaryotes, approximately 1%-10% genes are subjected to circadian control directly or indirectly only ~1/5 of the mRNAs that display rhythmic expression are directly driven by transcription, which suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic export and RNAs nuclear retention are essential layers for generation of gene expression rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Partch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Paraspeckles are recently identified nuclear bodies that have been shown to retain RNAs in the nucleus. Paraspeckles contain proteins PSPC1, RBM14, NONO, and SFPQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasanth et al., 2005</xref>) and are usually detected as a variable number of discrete dots found in close proximity to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond and Fox, 2009</xref>). One long noncoding RNA, nuclear-enriched abundant transcript one (Neat1), exclusively localized to paraspeckles serves as a structural component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Carmichael, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki and Hirose, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sunwoo et al., 2009</xref>). The locus generates short and long transcripts from the same promoter, which have previously been identified as MENε (Neat1-1) and MENβ (Neat1-2), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guru et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki and Hirose, 2009</xref>). Because specific depletion of Neat1-2 leads to disruption of paraspeckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki and Hirose, 2009</xref>) Neat1-1 alone cannot induce paraspeckle formation.</p><p>Paraspeckles have been shown to retain in the nucleus RNAs containing duplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Carmichael, 2008</xref>). This is the case for the mouse cationic amino acid transporter 2 (Cat2) transcribed nuclear RNA, Ctn-RNA, an alternatively spliced form of the Cat2 mRNA, which contains a dsRNA structure resulting from inverted short inter-spersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in its 3’-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasanth et al., 2005</xref>). In human cells, hundreds of genes contain inverted repeated SINEs (mainly Alu elements) in their 3’-UTRs. Alu elements are unique to primates and account for almost all of the human SINEs and &gt;10% of the genome. Their abundance leads to the frequent occurrence of inverted repeat structures (inverted repeated Alu elements [IRAlus]) in gene regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). It has been reported previously that mRNAs containing IRAlus in their 3’-UTRs like Nicolin 1 (NICN1) or Lin 28 are retained in the nucleus in paraspeckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Carmichael, 2008</xref>). Therefore, this nuclear retention pathway of IRAlus in 3’-UTRs of genes provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus.</p><p>We recently reported that two protein components of paraspeckles, namely NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in primary cultures of pituitary cells as well as in a rat pituitary cell line, the GH4C1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becquet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guillaumond et al., 2011</xref>). We used this cell line to determine whether one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms allowing circadian gene expression in pituitary cells could involve the circadian nuclear mRNA retention by paraspeckle bodies. To this end, we first characterized the presence of paraspeckles and we showed that these nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat GH4C1 pituitary cell line. We then made a series of EGFP-fused IRAlu or Alu constructs and transfected them into GH4C1 cells to investigate the EGFP expression and the fates of the egfp-IRAlu or egfp-Alu RNA. We showed that an IRAlu element in the 3’-UTR of the egfp mRNA strongly repressed EGFP expression. Further, this reduction was accompanied by significant nuclear retention of the mRNAs, likely by paraspeckle bodies. We showed also that insertion of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of EGFP reporter gene allowed rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention and rhythmic EGFP protein expression. Finally, this rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention as well as the rhythmic nuclear retention of some known cycling transcripts that were shown here associated with paraspeckles was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of paraspeckle nuclear bodies in pituitary GH4C1 cells</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Visualization of paraspeckle protein components by immunofluorescence and biochemical evidence for their association with the long noncoding RNA Neat1</title><p>The presence of paraspeckles in GH4C1 cells was anatomically evidenced by confocal microscopy on the basis of the overlap of their protein components using antibodies directed against SFPQ, NONO, PSPC1 and RBM14.

The protein components of paraspeckles were further shown to be associated with the long noncoding RNA Neat1lncRNA Neat1, using RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments with antibodies directed against NONO, SFPQ, RBM14 or PSPC1. Primers used in RT-qPCR detected both long (Neat1-2) and short (Neat1-1) isoforms of Neat1 RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). A 20- to 80-fold enrichment in Neat1 RNA was obtained with these antibodies as compared to an irrelevant non-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Under confocal laser scanning microscope, Neat1 RNA FISH staining appeared as regular punctates within the boundaries of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Number of foci was low and variable from one cell to the other. To gain resolution in the intranuclear spatial arrangement of Neat1 RNA, we combined RNA FISH with Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM). Under conventional fluorescence microscopy, resolution of paraspeckle bodies was very low as can be seen in the left part and in upper panel of the right part (red staining) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The increase in resolution from conventional to super-resolution microscopy was apparent in the upper panel of the right part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in which the high-resolution image obtained after STORM analysis (white staining) was superimposed to the conventional fluorescence image (red staining). Due to the poor resolution, the size of the paraspeckles was imprecise and could not be measured under conventional fluorescence microscope (red staining). By contrast, dimensions could be precisely measured under STORM (bottom panel of the right part in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition to the precision in the real size of paraspeckle bodies, super-resolution analysis allowed also to show that Neat1 labeling of paraspeckle bodies was not round in shape, being merely elliptical. Indeed using an imaging software (NIS-Elements, Nikon France S.A, Champigny sur Marne, France) we showed that the averaged ratio of Height to Width (n=10) was &gt;1 (1.53 ± 0.1) and the mean surface area was 24,960 ± 4831 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rhythmic expression of paraspeckle components in GH4C1 cells</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Rhythmic expression of protein components</title><p>To determine whether paraspeckle nuclear bodies displayed a circadian expression pattern we looked for rhythmic expression of their protein components as determined by Western blot analysis in nuclear protein extracts.

Four RNA-binding proteins, including three members of the Drosophila melanogaster behavior human splicing (DBHS) family proteins (NONO, PSPC1 and SFPQ) and RNA-binding motif protein 14 (RBM14) are classified as 'classical' paraspeckle protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond and Fox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prasanth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakagawa and Hirose, 2012</xref>). Both endogenous and tagged forms of these proteins are found localized within the nucleoplasm as well as paraspeckles in mammalian cells. With a confocal fluorescent study, we report in a rat pituitary cell line that all four paraspeckle protein components are distributed both in the nucleoplasm and in subnuclear foci. Among these later, we identify paraspeckle nuclear bodies by overlapping side-by-side the staining of two paraspeckle protein components. This allows not only to provide evidence for the existence of paraspeckles in rat pituitary cell nuclei but also to show that as already reported in other cell types, paraspeckles are small, irregularly sized and unevenly distributed subnuclear bodies. Using RIP experiments, we further show that all four paraspeckle protein components are associated with the specific paraspeckle localized lncRNA Neat1. This later is further detected by RNA FISH. Confirming previous reports in other cell types, when identified by a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and confocal microscopy, paraspeckles appear as round foci in rat pituitary cells. The diameter of such round foci is in the range of that estimated in previous studies (around 360 nm). However after use of a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and STORM analysis, paraspeckles appear more likely as oblong structures with smaller dimensions reminiscent of the interchromatin granule-associated zone (IGAZ) that had been observed under electron microscope and had been reported to correspond to paraspeckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardinale et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond and Fox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Souquere et al., 2010</xref>). Width and height measurements obtained after STORM analysis of Neat1 RNA FISH staining are smaller than the dimensions of IGAZ nuclear bodies established by an electron microscopy analysis in human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Souquere et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that either IGAZ/paraspeckle nuclear bodies are smaller in rat than in mouse cells or alternatively and more likely, Neat1 RNA staining does not fill in all the nuclear bodies as already proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Souquere et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, we reported that two paraspeckle proteins, namely NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in rat pituitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guillaumond et al., 2011</xref>) and we find here that it is also the case for the two other 'classical' paraspeckle proteins, PSPC1 and RBM14. Furthermore, all four proteins bind rhythmically to Neat1, suggesting that the pools of proteins involved in paraspeckle composition vary with time. In addition, the lncRNA Neat1 itself displays a circadian expression pattern and we further found using a pair of primers allowing the specific detection of the long form of Neat1 RNA, Neat1-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) that the expression of this form known to be sufficient for the formation of paraspeckle displays a circadian pattern (data not shown). The circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA is not the privilege of 'in vitro' pituitary cells since it is also found 'ex vivo' in several mouse tissues including the pituitary gland but also numerous other peripheral oscillators such as the spleen or the adrenal gland. This holds also true for the central clock, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Finally, in GH4C1 cells, the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown here to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells. It may then be assumed that the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA described here in a number of mouse tissue also reflects variations in paraspeckle number although it cannot be excluded that paraspeckle size could also oscillate over the circadian period both in pituitary cells and in other oscillators.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Association of IRAlu elements with paraspeckles</title><p>As previously reported by Chen and Carmichael (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), we found that a pair of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of egfp can strongly silence EGFP expression in GH4C1 pituitary cell line and after fractionating cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs from our two cell lines, we observed that IRAlus-containing egfp mRNA appear to be preferentially retained in the nucleus in comparison with those having a single Alu element. It then appeared that silencing EGFP expression mechanism relied on egfp mRNA nuclear retention.</p><p>To obtain evidence that nuclear retained IRAlus are associated with paraspeckle bodies, we immunoprecipitated RNA complexes containing paraspeckle protein PSPC1 and characterized the associated egfp mRNA. We found IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA to be associated with PSPC1 whereas Alu-containing egfp mRNA was not. While PSPC1 as well as NONO and SFPQ accumulate in paraspeckles, these proteins are also found elsewhere throughout the nucleoplasm and thus may have functions apart from paraspeckle retention. In contrast to paraspeckle-associated proteins that are multifunctional, NEAT1 may have only one function. We then developed a technique to characterize nuclear mRNA Neat1 targets using a Neat1 RNA pull-down approach that allowed us to show the association of IRAlu egfp mRNA with Neat1 providing a much more convincing evidence for a nuclear retention of IRAlu egfp mRNA by paraspeckles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>IRAlu element-induced circadian expression of reporter gene</title><p>Given their presumed functions in gene expression through corresponding mRNA nuclear retention and since they display a circadian expression pattern, it may be assumed that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. In keeping with this view, we showed that IRAlu elements inserted in 3’-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression. However, it may be noticed that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3’-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line. These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression. Since antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs can be the target of several RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zarnack et al., 2013</xref>) it may be speculated that some of these RNA-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression pattern accounting for the weak EGFP circadian expression observed in Alu-egfp cell line. Among the identified RNA-binding proteins that target antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs, HNRNPC was shown to display a circadian expression pattern in several tissues including the mouse pituitary (see CIRCA: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/">http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/</ext-link>). This is not the case for HNRNPU and STAUFEN 1 (STAU1)-mediated messenger RNA decay we did not find to display a circadian expression pattern in GH4C1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guillaumond et al., 2011</xref>) and (data not shown) and are then unlikely involved in circadian EGFP expression in Alu-egfp cell line. The mechanism involved in the circadian nuclear retention of Alu-containing egfp mRNA remains anyway to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Contribution of paraspeckle nuclear retention to circadian gene expression</title><p>Nuclear retention of egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cells is no more cycling when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that the nuclear retention of the reporter gene by paraspeckles contributes to cycling. To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale, we characterized in our pituitary cells the list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes and we analyzed in publicly available datasets the known cycling transcripts that are included in this Neat1 RNA target list. Whereas it is well known that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific and that it is unfavorable to compare datasets obtained in two different species we found a robust overlap of our gene list with circadian genes in the mouse pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>) and a closer overlap with post-transcriptional circadian genes in the mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menet et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both, we showed a loss of rhythmic pattern when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. It is now widely admitted that post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level. In agreement with this view, the new mechanism described here suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line culture and preparation of stably transfected cell lines</title><p>GH4C1 cells, a rat pituitary somatolactotroph line, were obtained in 2012 from ATCC (CCL-82.2, lot number: 58945448, Molsheim, France) with certificate analysis and were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma (MycoAlert, Lonza, Levallois-Perret, France).

To prepare lysates, nuclear pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS added with a protease inhibitor cocktail and RNAse-Out), and sonicated using BioruptorPlus (Diagenode, Seraing , Belgium) by 2 pulses of 30 s allowing complete lysate solubilization. RNA was in the size range of 400 to 2000 nucleotides. Nuclear lysates were diluted V/V in hybridization buffer (750 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 15% formamide). The two specific or the non-specific probes (100 pmol) were added to 1.2 ml of diluted lysate, which was mixed by end-to-end rotation at room temperature 4 to 6 hr. Streptavidin-magnetic C1 beads (Dynabeads My OneStreptavidin C1– Invitrogen Life Technologies) were added to hybridization reaction (50 μl per 100 pmol of probes) and the whole reaction was mixed overnight at room temperature. Beads–biotin-probes–RNA adducts were captured by magnets (Invitrogen) and washed five times with a wash buffer (2×SSC, 0.5% SDS). After the last wash, buffer was removed carefully. For RNA elution, beads were suspended in 100 μl RNA proteinase K buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and 100 μg proteinase K (Ambion). After incubation at 45°C for 45 min, RNA was isolated using NucleoSpinRNA XS (Macherey-Nagel). Eluted RNA was subject to RNA-sequencing or RT–qPCR for the detection of enriched transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>The construction of Illumina DNA libraries from RNA pools obtained with each of the two specific oligonucleotides and the sequencing were performed by Helixio (Clermont-Ferrand, France). Libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit. Sequencing was done on Illumina NextSeq 500 (60 million reads per sample on average).</p><p>Analyses were performed on a local instance of Galaxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afgan et al., 2016</xref>). Paired-end reads (75bp) were aligned to the Rat reference genome (Rnor_6.0.80, Ensembl) using TopHat2 v2.209 with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). We further used Cuffflinks v2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) to quantify mRNA level and fragment per kilobase per million of mapped reads (FPKM) were calculated. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagaraj et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 2013</xref>), the log2 (FPKM) distribution shows a primary peak of high expression genes, with a long left shoulder of low-expression transcripts. Therefore, only transcripts with FPKM values higher than 1 were taken into account. In order to assess the specificity of the NEAT1 RNA pull-down we crossed the results obtain with the two oligonucleotides (see Neat1 RNA pull-down) to generate the list of transcripts associated to the paraspeckles.</p><p>All the RNA sequencing data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession no.

Nuclei of the cells were counterstained by Hoechst solution (5 ng/ml).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Confocal microscopy analysis</title><p>The confocal image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with a 63X 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective. Dyes used in either immunocytochemistry (ICC) or RNA-Fish were imaged using the appropriate wavelength for optimal dye excitation, i.e. 405 nm for Hoechst, 561 nm for Cy3 and Quasar 570, and 633 nm for both Cy5 and Quasar 670. The spectral detection of emitted fluorescence were set as follows: 420–480 nm for Hoechst, 560–670 nm for Cy3 or Quasar 570 and 640–750 nm for Cy5 or Quasar 670. Three dimensional z-stacks were collected automatically as frame by frame sequential image series. To enhance resolution, the ICC images were deconvolved based on a theoretical point spread function (PSF) using AutoQuantX (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>STORM microscopy</title><p>Prior to observation, samples were mounted in imaging buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxydase, 40 µg/ml catalase, 10% w/v glucose, 10 mM mercaptoethylamine). Imaging was performed with a Nikon Storm System (N-Storm, Nikon France S.A, Champigny sur Marne, France) equipped with a 100X 1.49 N.A. oil immersion objective. A reference conventional fluorescence image of the cell of interest was acquired before recording storm sequence of images. For super resolution image acquisition, the sample stained with Quasar 670 dye was excited by a 647 nm imaging laser. Illumination with 405 nm light was gradually increased along recording to reactivate Quasar 670 blinking. The fluorescence emission was separated from the excitation light by adapted dichroic mirror (660 nm) and filters (692/4 nm) and collected on an IXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK). Typically, dSTORM images were reconstructed from 40000 frames using NIS-software (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Real-time monitoring of Egfp fluorescence by video-microscopy and mathematical analysis</title><p>For real-time monitoring of intracellular fluorescence circadian oscillations, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> Alu-egfp or IRAlu-egfp GH4C1 cells were seeded on glass-bottom 24 well plates (coated with poly- ornithine). The next day, the medium was changed with a growth medium containing 100 nM forskolin to synchronize the cellular circadian oscillators. 20 min later, the medium was changed again with a DMEM without phenol red medium containing 100 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 100 mM pyruvate. The next day, plates were transferred to an inverted microscope (Axiovert-200, Zeiss) equipped with an environmental chamber, the temperature of which was set to 37°C and CO<sub>2</sub> regulated to 5%. Egfp was excited through a 475/40 band-pass filter. An EMCCD camera (Rolera EM-C2, Q-Imaging) was used to collect emitted fluorescence at 530/50 nm. Time-lapse recordings of multiple regions in each well were realized over 96 hr with 1 picture every 30 min (Metamorph, Roper Scientific), using a 40X objective. The data were processed for tracking and measuring fluorescence fluctuations of individual cells with the CGE (Circadian Gene Expression) Plugging of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sage et al., 2010</xref>).

They measure the cycling proteins associated with the paraspeckles including Neat1, a long non-coding RNA.

It has been shown by others cited in their references that parapeckles have been implicated in this process, but this work appears to make a more mechanistic connection.

First, the paper illustrates that paraspeckles are found in pituitary GH4C1 cells and that they contain known protein components as well the long non-coding RNA Neat1. All of these components are rhythmically expressed. The authors use Neat1 FISH combined with STORM to obtain a clear view of a paraspeckle body and estimate its size. Previous studies indicated that transcripts with a IRAlu element in their 3'-UTRs are retained in paraspeckles (Chen et al. 2008). The same results were obtained here. Adding an IRAlu element to the 3'-UTR of a GFP reporter led to its retention in paraspeckles. Finally, and most importantly, retention of the GFP reporter in paraspeckles led to the oscillation of EGFP protein expression.</p><p>The experiments in this manuscript are well executed and presented. Much of the paper confirms previous results and establishes the role of paraspeckles in rat pituitary cells. The striking results of the paper are the last two figures showing that the levels of the GFP signal from the IRAlu-containing GFP reporter oscillate. This is an important experiment because it directly tests whether the retention of mRNAs in paraspeckles can drive oscillating protein expression. Additional experiments need to be done before this manuscript is acceptable for publication (see comments below).</p><p>Comments:</p><p>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> present the key data for this paper, but they also raise several questions or concerns.</p><p>1) What drives the circadian accumulation of IRAlu-egfp in the nucleus? The authors note that paraspeckle numbers increase during the day. It also seems possible that paraspeckles size could oscillate? If technically possible, the authors should distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> would be more convincing if the peak timepoints were assayed twice instead of once. Or average the data and provide error bars?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, only 20% of the IRAlu-GFP cells show rhythmic fluorescence. This assay was performed on those cells that showed fluorescence 10% higher than background. What was the overall% of cells showing cycling eGFP? Why is it so low?</p><p>4) A loss of function experiment is necessary to show that the IRAlu-GFP reporter does not cycle when paraspeckles are disrupted.</p><p>B) If paraspeckles can play a role in the post-transcriptional circadian gene regulation, it is important to understand the biological significance of this phenomenon. Does retention in paraspeckles drive the oscillations of known cycling transcripts? Menet et al. 2012 includes a list of putative post-transcriptional cycling transcripts. A genome wide approach should be used to determine whether known cycling transcripts are associated with paraspeckles by deep sequencing the RNA brought down in RIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or Neat1 RNA pull down using anti-sense oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If cycling mRNAs are found associated with paraspeckles, then a loss of function experiment could determine whether this retention contributes to cycling. These types of experiments would clearly show that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Nuclear paraspeckles are ribonucleoprotein complexes constituted principally of the 4 proteins PSPC1, RBM14, NONO, and SFPQ and the lncRNA Neat1, and which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by sequestering mRNAs in the nucleus and consequently preventing translation. Leveraging on the several recent papers showing that post-transcriptional events significantly contribute to rhythmic gene expression, this paper submitted by the research team of Anne-Marie François-Bellan examines the role of paraspeckles in the regulation of circadian gene expression using mostly GH4C1 cells in vitro (a rat pituitary-derived cell line). The authors first show that the expression of the 4 major paraspeckles proteins and Neat1, as well as their interactions, are rhythmic in entrained GH4C1 cells. Based on published results showing that mRNAs containing inverted repeated Alu elements (IRAlus) are retained in paraspeckles, the authors then test if mRNAs containing these IRAlus can be subjected to paraspeckles-mediated rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation. To this end, the authors developed a strategy using egfp mRNA fused to IRAlus (or just Alus as controls), and showed that rhythmic paraspeckles expression rhythmically impacts on the nuclear retention and protein expression of egfp when fused to IRAlus.</p><p>Overall, this is a decent paper that investigates a topic that gathered special interest in the recent years in the circadian field, i.e., post-transcriptional regulation of circadian gene expression. The approaches using egfp fused with IRAlus are elegant and bring some relevant and nice mechanistic insights on how paraspeckles can contribute/regulate rhythmic gene expression. There are however quite a lot of problems with this manuscript that cannot be overcome easily, and I thus believe this paper does not meet the requirements for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The post-transcriptional regulation of egfp RNAs fused to IRAlus in vitro in GH4C1 cells provides a nice mechanistic demonstration that paraspeckles impact on rhythmic gene expression. Yet, does this regulation occur in vivo on a much larger scale, or is this an oddity of the system they used? The authors could have easily used some publicly available datasets and for example assessed in the genes &quot;labeled&quot; as post-transcriptional cyclers harbors more IRAlus in their 3'UTR. They could even have more simply test a few of these genes in their in vitro system by comparing RNA levels between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. This is something that, to me, is really lacking and I really think it should have been investigated to give some more breadth to the paper.</p><p>2) I have also quite a few technical comments, which should I think be addressed:a) I am a bit confused with the ICC and FISH experiments. The authors observed many dots for proteins, and only 2 dots for Neat1. Do they have an explanation for this? How was the Neat1 FISH conducted? Are they really observing paraspeckles or are these Neat1 genomic locations?b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: The authors should use more controls for their RIP (e.g., qPCR against some other lncRNA as well as mRNA) to ensure that the antibodies are not just specially sticky to nucleic acids.c) There is a rhythm of Neat1 and its 4 associated proteins. Does this rhythm translate into a rhythm in the number of paraspeckles? In their size?d) The authors mentioned that they stably transfected GH4C1 cells with their egfp plasmids. Should not egfp be expressed in all cells, at least for the Alu-egfp?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Circadian RNA expression elicited by 3'-UTR IRAlu-paraspeckle associated elements&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

They have shown convincingly that the retention of mRNAs in paraspeckles can drive post-transcriptional circadian oscillations both with a reporter as well as several endogenous genes. The paper is much stronger in this revised form and is now appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this revised version, the authors addressed the reviewer's comments and provided additional data aiming at demonstrating that paraspeckles contribute to rhythmic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a pituitary cell line. In particular, the authors now include new results showing that disruption of the paraspeckles in a IRAlu-egfp cell line (using either siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides) decreases the ratio of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic egfp mRNA and impairs the rhythmic nuclear retention of egfp mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) in this cell line. The authors also show similar data for several endogenous genes (Canx, Fkbp4 and Calr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>; 4 other genes in supplementary data). While these data tend to overall support the author's conclusions, they also bring some concerns:</p><p>1) Why do six out of the seven genes exhibit in control conditions a rhythm with a period of about 20 hours?</p><p>2) Why are the effects on expression different between the siRNA and the antisense oligonucleotide?</p><p>3) Why are the phases of the nuclear/cytoplasmic mRNA ratio different between many of the genes (e.g., there is a 8-hr difference between Fkbp4 and Calr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>)? The model proposed by the authors would suggest that the nuclear retention is at its lowest for all genes when the number of paraspeckles is at its minimum, i.e., 15-hrs after medium change.</p><p>There are also some issues with the Neat1 RNA pull-down, which lacks proper controls. Assessing the specificity of the Neat1 RNA pull-down by using two independent oligonucleotide probes is indeed not sufficient/appropriate to characterize the transcripts specifically associated with Neat1. The experiment should have included -at least- a mock pull-down using a non-specific probe (luciferase, lacZ, etc.) to account for the non-specific binding of endogenous transcripts to the beads/resin. I noticed that this control is included in the methods section (&quot;one biotinylated irrelevant probe was used for Neat1 RNA non-specific pull-down&quot;), yet it is absent from the illumina sequencing analysis. This lack of a proper control pull-down thus significantly decreases the value of the experiment.</p><p>In conclusion, while this manuscript may appear improved, it also raises new concerns and I am therefore not sure this manuscript reaches the standard of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14837.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>A loss of function experiment to show that the IRAlu-GFP reporter does not cycle when paraspeckles are disrupted.</italic> </p><p>As suggested we performed new experiments to show that rhythmic nuclear versus cytoplasmic egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cell line depends upon the presence of paraspeckles. Given the unique Neat1 RNA nuclear localization, RNA knockdown is more convenient than paraspeckle protein depletion for investigating paraspeckle function. Furthermore since there is an essentially perfect relationship between loss of paraspeckles and depletion of Neat1 RNA (Clemson et al., 2009), we addressed this issue by using Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 antisens oligonucleotides (ASO). By RT-qPCR we showed that Neat1 RNA levels were reduced in IRAlu-egfp cell line to around 60% after treatment with specific siRNA compared to negative control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reduction we obtained in Neat1 RNA levels using siRNA is modest but comparable to that reported in human Hela cells (Clemson et al., 2009; Gagnon et al., 2014) and since in FISH experiments we do not find evidence for Neat1 RNA in the cytoplasm, this is consistent with other findings that RNA inhibition using siRNA can effectively occur in the nucleus (Langlois et al., 2005; Robb et al., 2005; Valgardsdottir et al., 2005; Clemson et al., 2009; Gagnon et al., 2014). Furthermore, the decrease in Neat1 RNA levels was not amplified when we used Neat1 ASO to disrupt paraspeckles siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In any case, treatment with Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 ASO disrupts the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). More importantly, when IRAlu-egfp cells were transfected either by Neat1 siRNA or Neat1 ASO as compared to negative control, the relative ratio of nuclear versus cytoplasmic egfp mRNA levels was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the circadian egfp nuclear retention was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These loss of function experiments showed that the egfp mRNA nuclear retention in IRAlu-egfp cell line does not cycle when paraspeckles are disrupted.</p><p>The results are reported in the paragraph 3.5 added in the Results section and discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>A genome wide approach should be used to determine whether known cycling transcripts are associated with paraspeckles.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we performed a genome wide approach by deep sequencing the RNA brought down in Neat1 RNA pull-down using anti-sense oligonucleotides. We used the Tophat/Cufflinks pipeline (Trapnell et al., 2012) and only transcripts which exhibited values of fragment per kilobase per million of mapped reads (FPKM) higher than 1 were taken into account. The specificity of Neat 1 RNA pull-down was assessed by crossing the FPKM&gt;1-limited lists obtained with the two specific oligonucleotides. This allowed us to provide a list of genes that were specifically associated to Neat1 RNA (see paragraph 4.1 in Results section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). All the RNA sequencing data have been registered at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession no. GSE81972) and the following link has been created to allow review of record GSE81972 while it remains in private status: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ytwjsuuyppgpzmn&amp;acc=GSE81972">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ytwjsuuyppgpzmn&amp;acc=GSE81972</ext-link></p><p>We then used publicly available datasets and crossed them with our dataset. This allowed us to determine that near 19% of pituitary circadian transcripts (Hughes et al., 2007) and 27% of post-transcriptional circadian genes in the liver (Menet et al., 2012) are found associated with paraspeckles. Taking into account that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific and that it is unfavorable to compare datasets obtained in two different species, the robust overlap we found between our gene list and that of Hughes 2007 and Menet 2012 allows to propose that paraspeckles play a relevant role in circadian gene expression. These results have been described in the paragraph 4.2 of the Results section, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion section entitled “Contribution of paraspeckle nuclear retention to circadian gene expression”.</p><p><italic>Test a few additional genes in the</italic> in vitro <italic>system by comparing RNA levels between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm.</italic></p><p>We took advantage of our crossing analysis described above to select a few genes common to our dataset and the publicly available datasets cited above. We showed that the nuclear versus cytoplasmic mRNA ratio of these genes displayed a circadian expression pattern that is abolished when paraspeckles were disrupted either by Neat1 siRNA or by Neat1 ASO (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). These losses of function experiments clearly show that paraspeckle retention of these few genes contributes to their circadian rhythmicity. These results have been described in the paragraph 4.3 of the Results section, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 6-source data 2</xref>) and discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion section entitled “Contribution of paraspeckle nuclear retention to circadian gene expression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In the discussion following their reviews, the reviewers agree that there are serious concerns about the Neat1 pulldown, which lacks controls.

Addressing them (especially Neat1 pulldown controls) are necessary for publication. This should be feasible without doing any new experiments.</italic> </p><p>As noted by Reviewer #3, a non-specific oligonucleotide was actually included as negative control in our Neat1 RNA pull-down. This was indicated in the Materials and methods section and in the Results section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This control allows to identify artifacts caused by direct, non-specific binding that are common to all affinity purification techniques. However, when performing RNA sequencing analysis, as already mentioned in our article (Results section, “Libraries were generated from the purified RNAs obtained with the two specific oligonucleotides but no library could be obtained with the non-specific oligonucleotide due to the too small quantity of material recovered”), the amount of RNA obtained with non-specific oligonucleotide was too low to generate a library. This attempt to generate a library after non-specific oligonucleotide was tried out three times without success, attesting that in our experimental conditions, direct non-specific binding of endogenous transcripts to the beads is very low.</p><p>One other source of artifacts that is more specific to hybridization capture approach is caused by hybridization events in which the capture-oligonucleotide directly hybridizes to an off-target RNA. As discussed by (Simon, 2015), an alternative method that controls for off-target RNA is to use two independent capture oligonucleotides that bind the target RNA. Specific signals are expected to be found with both oligonucleotides whereas signals that are found with only one oligonucleotide are interpreted as hybridization-induced artifacts. In our paper, we assessed the specificity of Neat 1 RNA pull-down by crossing the FPKM&gt;1-limited lists obtained with two specific oligonucleotides.</p><p>Although the very low amounts of RNA obtained with non-specific oligonucleotide did not allow generation of library and RNA sequencing as explained above, they were still measurable by very sensitive qPCR technology in spite of very high Ct values. Thereby to convincingly show that transcripts from Neat1 RNA pull-down sequencing are specific Neat1 RNA targets, we verified by qPCR the specific association of a few of them with Neat1. To this end, we determined for the seven mRNA already selected in our paper, the enrichment obtained after Neat1 RNA pull-down with the two specific biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides that target Neat1 compared to the biotinylated irrelevant probe. As reported in the Results section and shown in a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the seven selected genes were significantly enriched after Neat1 RNA pull-down by the two specific probes compared to the non-specific probe.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this revised version, the authors addressed the reviewer's comments and provided additional data aiming at demonstrating that paraspeckles contribute to rhythmic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a pituitary cell line.

The model proposed by the authors would suggest that the nuclear retention is at its lowest for all genes when the number of paraspeckles is at its minimum, i.e., 15-hrs after medium change.</italic> </p><p>In the experimental design of our study, measures are performed every 4 hours. The reviewer is right to state that this time interval does not allow determining the precise value of the period and phase of the rhythm, but this was not the aim of the experiment. Our purpose was to test whether or not the seven selected genes exhibited a circadian nuclear retention (by definition with a period comprised between 20h and 28h), and whether the minimum value of this rhythm occurred roughly when the levels of paraspeckle protein components and Neat1 RNA were the lowest. We indeed found for the seven selected genes 1/ that the relative mRNA ratio between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm over the time can be fitted by a sine wave curve with a R squared &gt; 0.55 attesting its circadian nature and 2/ that the rhythms were approximately in phase with paraspeckle component rhythms. Furthermore, while having different effects on expression levels, we also found that both siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides were able to disrupt these rhythms attesting that paraspeckles are involved in the circadian nuclear retention of these mRNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
