Despite the introduction of successful vaccines, the global spread of both non-vaccine serotypes and antibiotic-resistant strains reinforces the development of alternative therapies against this pathogen. One possible route is the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that induce killing of bacteria via the immune system. Here, we investigate whether mAbs can be used to induce killing of pneumococcal serotypes for which the current vaccines show unsuccessful protection. Our study demonstrates that when human mAbs against pneumococcal capsule polysaccharides (CPS) have a poor capacity to induce complement activation, a critical process for immune protection against pneumococci, their activity can be strongly improved by hexamerization-enhancing mutations. Our data indicate that anti-capsular antibodies may have a low capacity to form higher-order oligomers (IgG hexamers) that are needed to recruit complement component C1. Indeed, specific point mutations in the IgG-Fc domain that strengthen hexamerization strongly enhance C1 recruitment and downstream complement activation on encapsulated pneumococci. Specifically, hexamerization-enhancing mutations E430G or E345K in CPS6-IgG strongly potentiate complement activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains that express capsular serotype 6 (CPS6), and the highly invasive serotype 19A strain. Furthermore, these mutations improve complement activation via mAbs recognizing CPS3 and CPS8 strains. Importantly, hexamer-enhancing mutations enable mAbs to induce strong opsonophagocytic killing by human neutrophils. Finally, passive immunization with CPS6-IgG1-E345K protected mice from developing severe pneumonia. Altogether, this work provides an important proof of concept for future optimization of antibody therapies against encapsulated bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd><kwd>complement system</kwd><kwd>hexamer-enhancing mutations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>798032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguinagalde Salazar</surname><given-names>Leire</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Toegepaste en technische wetenschappen-NACTAR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heck</surname><given-names>Albert JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Toegepaste en techniche wetenschappen-NACTAR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rooijakkers</surname><given-names>Suzan HM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101001937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rooijakkers</surname><given-names>Suzan HM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fc engineering of monoclonal antibodies strongly improves immune clearance of pneumococcus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a major cause of bacteremia and meningitis in children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loughran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">OâBrien et al., 2009</xref>). While pneumococcus commonly resides asymptomatically in the nasopharynx, it can cause a wide spectrum of infections in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van der Poll and Opal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koedel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birgitta and Tuomanen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bryce et al., 2005</xref>). Infections by pneumococcus range from non-invasive diseases, such as otitis media and sinusitis to life-threatening bacteremia and meningitis. To reduce its great impact on morbidity and mortality, vaccines have been successfully developed and introduced worldwide. Currently available vaccines target the polysaccharide capsule (CPS), which is considered the most important virulence factor of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Although there are more than 90 different capsular serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bentley et al., 2006</xref>), the current vaccines only include a limited number of serotypes including those most frequently found to be causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Besides the fact that the widespread vaccination has been highly effective in lowering IPD caused by vaccine serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shinefield and Black, 2000</xref>), there still is a large burden of pneumococcal disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes. Furthermore, because some vaccine serotypes induce a weak immune response it remains difficult to control pneumococcal disease, particularly in risk groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pirofski and Casadevall, 1998</xref>). Finally, the emergence of strains with high level of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mclntyre, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguinagalde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greenwood, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Novak et al., 1999</xref>) highlights a strong need to develop new therapeutic strategies against pneumococcal infections.</p><p>In recent years, antibody therapies have emerged as a successful treatment for several autoimmune diseases and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edwards et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, there is now also great interest in the development of antibody-based therapies against bacterial infections. To eliminate bacteria, antibodies should bind to the bacterial surface and induce killing via the immune system. As evidenced by recurrent infections in patients with genetic complement deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ram et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carneiro-Sampaio and Coutinho, 2007</xref>), human immune protection against pneumococci critically depends on the action of the human complement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaufmann and Dorhoi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bardoel et al., 2014</xref>). Complement is a large network of proteins in blood and other body fluids. These proteins circulate as inactive precursors but become rapidly activated upon contact with bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). An activated complement cascade triggers a variety of immune responses, such as the labeling of bacteria with C3-derived opsonins (C3b and iC3b) that potently induce phagocytosis and subsequent intracellular killing of bacteria by professional phagocytes (opsonophagocytic killing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunkelberger and Song, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stuart and Ezekowitz, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Because complement is essential in immune protection against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kadioglu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Standish and Weiser, 2009</xref>), the capacity of antibodies to induce complement activation could be exploited for effective antibacterial therapies. However, it is not known whether monoclonal antibodies effectively induce complement activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This is especially unclear for encapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains because the capsule is believed to block immune activation, for instance, by shielding epitopes and blocking deposition of C3 opsonins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyams et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies showed that target-bound IgGs should organize into higher-order oligomers (IgG hexamers) to provide an optimal docking platform for complement component C1q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diebolder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Because each antibody-binding headpiece of C1q has a low affinity for IgG, physiological binding occurs when the six headpieces simultaneously bind to IgG once hexamerized. Here, we study the potential of several anti-capsular monoclonal antibodies to induce complement activation and opsonophagocytic killing of encapsulated pneumococci. Our data suggest that these anti-capsular antibodies as wild-type IgG have a poor capacity to form IgG hexamers and trigger downstream opsonophagocytic killing via complement. Importantly, this limitation can be overcome by the introduction of a single amino acid mutation that enhances hexamerization of anti-capsular antibodies and strongly potentiates complement-mediated opsonophagocytic killing of pneumococci, both in vitro and in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Promoting Fc-Fc interactions between CPS6-IgG1 enables complement activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Spn) 6B<italic>.</italic></title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of antibody binding to antigen on a target surface.

Using surface-specific staining of C1q and flow cytometry, we first determined the capacity of mAbs to recruit C1q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While the wild-type (WT) CPS6-IgG1 showed little to no reactivity with C1q, we noted that the introduction of hexamer-enhancing mutations E430G or E345K strongly enhanced the ability to interact with C1q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Importantly, we found that introduction of hexamer-enhancing mutations in CPS6-IgG1 allowed activation of the classical complement pathway. Recruitment of C1q to target-bound IgGs induces activation of C1q-attached C1r and C1s proteases that cleave C4 to covalently attach activated C4b molecules onto the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MÃ¼ller-Eberhard et al., 1967</xref>). Furthermore, C1 activates C2 to produce a C3 convertase (C4b2b) that deposits large amounts of C3b, a key component of the complement cascade that labels bacteria for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joiner et al., 1984</xref>). Indeed, by monitoring deposition of C4b and C3b molecules, we observed that Fc-engineered variants of CPS6-IgG1, but not the WT antibody, potently induced deposition of C4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and C3b molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>) onto serotype 6B. Altogether, these data show that hexamer-enhancing mutations can overcome poor complement activation by monoclonal antibodies against capsular serotype 6.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hexamer-enhancing mutations in CPS6-IgG enhance phagocytosis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> serotype 6B</title><p>Next, we investigated whether the enhanced complement activation also impacted phagocytosis of serotype 6B by human neutrophils.

The phagocytic uptake is greatly enhanced by the tagging of bacteria with IgG antibodies that can engage FcÎ³ receptors (FcÎ³Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006</xref>) and/or C3-derived opsonins that can mediate the uptake of bacteria via complement receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stuart and Ezekowitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Lookeren Campagne et al., 2007</xref>). We studied phagocytosis of fluorescent serotype 6B by freshly isolated human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bestebroer et al., 2007</xref>) in the presence of CPS6-IgG1 mAbs and IgG/IgM-depleted human serum as complement source. First, we observed that the CPS6-IgG1-WT antibody poorly induced phagocytosis of serotype 6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). In contrast, hexamer-enhanced variants of CPS6-IgG1 induced very potent phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). For both E430G and E345K mutated variants, we found that 0.3 Î¼g/ml of mAb induced maximum phagocytosis in the presence of 2.5% IgG/M-depleted serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). When serum was heat-treated to inactivate complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berends et al., 2015</xref>), we found that phagocytosis by E430G and E345K antibodies was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The crucial role of complement in this process was also confirmed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To show that the flow cytometry assay really represents bacterial uptake of properly engulfed bacteria, confocal microscopy was performed. Opsonization with both E430G and E345K antibodies in the presence of active complement clearly resulted in bacterial internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

To study this end, we combined native mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leney and Heck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tamara et al., 2022</xref>) with an IgG triple mutant (IgG-RGY, combination of E345R (Glu<sup>345</sup> â Arg), E430G (Glu<sup>430</sup> â Gly), and S440Y (Ser<sup>440</sup> â Tyr) mutations) that has the capacity to form stable hexamers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diebolder et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with prior work, native mass spectra of IgG1-RGY revealed the presence of monomeric and hexameric species, with intermediate states observed at lower abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diebolder et al., 2014</xref>). When IgG1-RGY was incubated with Fc-III, however, the relative abundance of IgG oligomers was diminished. No effect was observed for a scrambled version of the same peptide (Scr) that in contrast to Fc-III does not bind IgG1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The fact that we observed binding of Fc-III to monomeric IgG1, but not to larger oligomeric species, suggests that Fc-III inhibits IgG-mediated complement activation by competitive binding to the Fc-Fc interaction interface of IgG monomers. In line with our hypothesis, we found that Fc-III potently blocked phagocytic uptake of serotype 6B via both E430G and E345K mutants, while Scr showed no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Finally, considering that IgM antibodies already pre-exist as pentameric or hexameric oligomers that are kept together via covalent bonds, we compared the capacity of anti-CPS6-IgM to induce pneumococcal complement-mediated phagocytosis with our hexamerization-enhancing variants. Although IgM does induce complement-dependent phagocytosis of pneumococcal serotype 6B, it was less potent than CPS6-IgG1-E430G and E345K variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>).

To mimic the natural situation more closely, we now performed experiments in normal human serum (NHS) that contains pre-existing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lebon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borges et al., 2016</xref>) instead of using IgG/IgM-depleted serum as a complement source. This is important because 6B and 19A serotypes circulate in the healthy population and naturally occurring antibodies could thus play an additional role in phagocytosis by the mAbs. Previous experiments were repeated in the presence of normal serum as complement source. Indeed, E430G and E345K mutants also exhibited enhanced complement deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a and b</xref>) and improved capacity to induce phagocytosis of serotype 6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and 19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In both cases, the presence of active complement was required as heat inactivation at 56Â°C completely abolished pneumococcal phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). Next, to study whether the increased phagocytosis induced by antibody hexamerization results in effective bacterial killing by human neutrophils we performed opsonophagocytic killing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romero-Steiner et al., 1997</xref>). To this end, bacteria were opsonized with CPS6-IgG1-WT or CPS6-IgG1-E430G/E345K antibody variants in the presence of normal human serum for 20 min. Then, human neutrophils were added for 45 min. Opsonophagocytic killing was measured by counting surviving colonies. Survival of serotypes 6B was strongly decreased in the presence of CPS6-IgG1-E430G or E345K in a dose-dependent manner, even achieving complete bacterial clearance at 3 Î¼g/ml with E345K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>), confirming that the killing of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> by neutrophils after uptake is an efficient process.

To this end, female BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection of CPS6-IgG1-WT, CPS6-IgG1-E345K, or PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Then, 3 hr later, pneumonia was induced by intranasal challenge with pneumococcal serotype 6A (selected due to its higher virulence in mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saeland et al., 2000</xref>). Survival and bacterial loads in the blood were monitored for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of mAbs in the bloodstream was confirmed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). In PBS-treated controls, all mice developed bacteremia within 24 hr as evidenced by the presence of high loads of pneumococci in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1a</xref>).

While 100 Î¼g CPS6-IgG1-E345K could protect 60% of infected mice (12/20) from developing bacteremia, the same concentration of CPS6-IgG1-WT only reduced bacteremia in 27% of mice (4/15 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). A threefold higher concentration of CPS6-IgG1-WT was needed to achieve the same protection as CPS6-IgG1-E345K.

In contrast, 100 Î¼g CPS6-IgG1-E345K could rescue 50% of mice (10/20). Again, we observed that the CPS6-IgG1-E345K mAb was more potent in protecting mice than CPS6-IgG1-WT. Additionally, mice weight regain was very much associated with the protective capacity of each mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). The fact that CPS6-IgG1-WT had a protective capacity to induce bacterial clearance in vivo when it showed a minimal effect in vitro can possibly be explained by the increased capacity of this mAb to induce phagocytosis in the presence of mice sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Antibodies can enhance this process by binding to the bacterial cell surface and stimulating FcÎ³R uptake and/or activate the complement cascade to deposit C3-derived opsonins. Although the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule is known to evade complement activation (by shielding epitopes that are hidden underneath the capsule; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyams et al., 2010</xref>), our results support the idea that antibodies directed against the capsule can overcome capsular immune evasion and deposit complement opsonins on the encapsulated bacterium to stimulate phagocytosis. For the anti-capsular antibodies included in this study, we showed that monoclonal IgGs had a poor capacity to activate complement when expressed with wild-type Fc domains. At present, it is unclear why these WT anti-capsular antibodies showed a poor capacity to induce complement activation on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. We are confident that this is not related to antibody production issues. Previously we have generated and functionally characterized monoclonal IgG1/3 antibodies against <italic>S. aureus</italic> wall teichoic acid (WTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zwarthoff et al., 2021b</xref>). The cloning, expression, and purification procedures of these anti-WTA antibodies were identical to the antibodies used in this article (they even have the same IgG-Fc backbone). In contrast to this study, the wild-type IgG1/IgG3 antibodies targeting WTA were capable of inducing complement activation and downstream phagocytosis in the absence of Fc-enhancing mutations. Therefore, we believe that the anti-capsular antibodies used in this study have a poor ability to establish Fc-Fc contacts needed for hexamer formation. Potentially, the capsule epitope is not an optimal antigen for IgG hexamer formation. For instance, molecular characteristics like antigen density, size, and fluidity could affect hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diebolder et al., 2014</xref>). Also, the affinity of one Fab arm for the epitope could play a role since antibodies should bind with one Fab arm to enable hexamer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diebolder et al., 2014</xref>). Whether the observed low capacity of wild-type CPS-specific mAb to induce IgG clustering can be extended to other anti-CPS or anti-pneumococcal antibodies would need further investigation. Potentially, our data may help to understand why certain capsular serotypes are poorly immunogenic. CPS antigen is poorly immunogenic in many individuals who are at the highest risk for the development of IPD and the use of protein conjugated vaccine has not been found in these patients to be more immunogenic than the purified polysaccharide-based vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). Since complement activation and deposition of C3-derived opsonins are important in driving adaptive immune responses to bacteria, for instance, by enhancing B cell activation and antigen presentation (via complement receptors on B cells, APCs, and follicular dendritic cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>), a poor capacity to induce antibody clustering might also have a negative effect on vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Our findings also indicate that phagocytic uptake of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> via CPS-specific antibodies strongly depends on the presence of complement-induced opsonization since we observed little to no uptake of antibody-labeled bacteria in the absence of complement.

However, complement-dependent killing of <italic>Neisseria</italic> is mediated by the formation of membrane attack complex pores, which cannot act on Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berends et al., 2014</xref>). Our study provides an important proof of concept that hexamerization-enhancing mutations can potentiate opsonophagocytic killing of Gram-positive bacteria. This assumption is also supported by our in vivo bacteremic pneumonia mice model of infection. The presence of CPS-IgG1 mAbs potently prevented/delayed pneumococcal spread from lungs to the systemic circulation, resulting in effective clearing and, therefore, conferring protection against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in female mice. The obtained protection was strongly increased by the use of engineered mAb CPS6-IgG1-E345K for enhanced hexamerization.</p><p>Although this was not the goal of our study, the in vivo experiments also revealed that the monoclonal antibodies provided less protection against pneumococcal bacteremia in male than female mice. Clinical manifestation of the infection and mortality rate was comparable between male and female for the administered infectious dose. Dutch legislation encourages the verification of both genders in animal experiments, both for animal welfare and impact on translation to human diseases. Whether the immune responses to pneumococci and response to antibody therapies are truly different between males and females is beyond the scope of this article but an important consideration for future therapy developments.</p><p>Overall, the presented work provides a proof of concept not only for the capacity of hexamer-enhancing mutations to improve anti-capsule mAb-meditated immune system activation, but also for the potential use of monoclonal antibodies against encapsulated bacteria like <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> when the existing therapies fail. In this study, we demonstrated that the activity of mAbs directed against serogroup 6<italic>,</italic> one of the most prevalent serogroups worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van der Linden et al., 2013</xref>), could be effectively improved to prevent systemic pneumococcal infection. Furthermore, the fact that CPS6 mAbs likely cross-react with the highly invasive 19A strain, for which of invasive infection rates increased following PCV7 use worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar et al., 2010</xref>), suggests the potential broader use of monoclonal antibodies. Similarly, hexamer-enhancing mutations could be used to improve the potency of recently discovered mAbs against other serotypes like CPS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babb et al., 2021</xref>). Because complement is essential in immune protection against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kadioglu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Standish and Weiser, 2009</xref>), the capacity of antibodies to induce complement activation could be exploited for effective antibacterial therapies while simultaneously avoiding the complications of antibiotic resistance. However, the large variety in pneumococcal CPS serotypes hampers the use of serotype-specific mAbs to treat pneumococcal disease. Therefore, the most clinically useful scenario for the use of anti-pneumococcal CPS mAbs is to treat after symptoms onset. A cocktail composed of multiple anti-capsule mAbs would be very expensive unless, for instance, rapid test to identify the causative serotype can be developed to enable monovalent therapy. Monoclonal antibodies that react with highly conserved surface antigens that elicit a potent immune response like histidine triad protein D (PhtD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gingerich et al., 2023</xref>) can be a promising tool for broad treatment against numerous pneumococcal serotypes. From the presented results, we anticipate that this work will stimulate new routes to optimize antibody therapies against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and other encapsulated bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and fluorescent labeling</title><p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> clinical isolates used in this study included strains from serotype 3, 6A, 6B, 6C, 8, 19A, and 19F (kindly provided by Dr. J.

The VH and VL sequences of the antibodies were derived from previously reported antibodies against CPS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saeland et al., 2003</xref>), CPS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tian et al., 2009</xref>), and CPS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yano and Pirofski, 2011</xref>), with some modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For IgM, a plasmid coding for J-chain expression was a kind gift from Theo Rispens. After verification of the correct sequence, the plasmids were used to transfect EXPI293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). EXPI293F cells were grown in EXPI293 medium in culture filter cap Erlenmeyer bottles (Corning) on a rotation platform (125 rotations/min) at 37Â°C, 8% CO<sub>2</sub>. One day before transfection, cells were diluted to 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Transfection of EXPI293F cells was performed using PEI (Polyethylenimine HCl MAX; Polysciences). Therefore, 1 Âµg DNA/ml cells (ratio of heavy and light chain plasmids is 2:3) was added to OPTIMEM (1:10 of total volume; Gibco) and gently mixed. For expressions of IgM containing the J-chain, the J-chain plasmid was used as 20% of total plasmid. After adding PEI (1 Âµg/ml; ratio PEI to DNA is 5:1), the mixture was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 20 min and then added dropwise to the cells while manually rotating the Erlenmeyer culture bottle. After 4â6 days of transfection, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were isolated from cell supernatants using a HiTrap Protein A High Performance column (GE Healthcare), whereas IgG3 antibodies were isolated with a HiTap Protein G High Performance column (GE Healthcare).

The concentration of the antibodies was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm and antibodies were stored at â20Â°C until use. For IgM, after 5 days of expression, the cell supernatant was collected by centrifugation and filtration (0.45 ÂµM) and dialyzed against PBS. After dialysis, extra NaCl was added to the IgM preparation to a final of 500 mM before application to a POROS CaptureSelect IgM Affinity matrix (Thermo Scientific) column.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sylvia Knapp (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The killing assays should be analyzed according to the bacterial numbers ingested by neutrophils before killing starts. This could be done by performing an assay where the first phagocytosis is allowed (e.g. 20-45min), to then assess the CFUs of a sample of lysed neutrophils at baseline and to then check after short periods like every 5min to assess the ability to kill.</p><p>2) in vivo studies should be done showing the effect of administered IgGs on local, lung bacterial loads. This can be either done using the serotype 6B model (if it works), or a model of more progressive lung infection such as the one induced by serotype 3 (for instance ATCC 6303), which is well established and can be titrated to analyze mice after 48h (before any mouse succumbs to the infection).</p><p>3) A major concern is that the WT IgG1 / 3 isotypes do not bind complement. Why is this? Is this a Fab effect (ie because of how the antigen is distributed on the organism or affinity) or reflects how the moab are produced, or some other effect? One way to address this is to examine the glycosylation profiles and the complement-fixing activity of anti-capsule isotypes from normal human sera (even if IgM-depleted).</p><p>4) Related to this, since the WT antibodies have minimal effects on bacterial killing in vitro (except for 19A at the highest concentration) yet after transfer into mice there is some effect on bacterial levels in the blood (a roughly 2-fold difference in the proportion of mice with detectable bacteria in blood between 100ug WT and E), it is important to examine whether this effect is through human antibodies activating mouse complement as one interpretation is that hexamerisation may not be the sole driver in vivo (eg Figures6c and s9a). Does the adoptive transfer of antibodies into C3-deficient mice have a similar effect? Have the authors examined mouse complement activation by human antibodies? Are multiple mechanisms at play? If Ab to capsule induced after vaccination or infection can be protective yet have a minimal capacity to activate complement then how are they functioning in the absence of enhanced hexamerisation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80669.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The killing assays should be analyzed according to the bacterial numbers ingested by neutrophils before killing starts.

While the complement system is known to enhance phagocytosis (by labeling the bacterial cells with opsonic molecules (opsonization)), it does not play a role in intracellular killing. Our intention with the killing assay was not to claim differences between antibodies after the uptake of bacteria by neutrophils. Our opsonophagocytic killing assay measures all steps leading to killing: opsonization, phagocytosis and intracellular killing. When antibodies induce better opsonization (like the hexamer variants used in this study), this will automatically enhance phagocytosis and the subsequent killing.</p><p>For the readerâs understanding, we have corrected this in the manuscript by rephrasing the assay to âopsonophagocytic killing assayâ (instead of âkilling assayâ) and added an extended explanation about the assay in the results section (see lines 242-247).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In vivo studies should be done showing the effect of administered IgGs on local, lung bacterial loads. This can be either done using the serotype 6B model (if it works), or a model of more progressive lung infection such as the one induced by serotype 3 (for instance ATCC 6303), which is well established and can be titrated to analyze mice after 48h (before any mouse succumbs to the infection).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we now include additional new in vivo data to show the effect of administered IgGs on lung bacterial loads. We repeated the mouse experiment following the same immunization and infection procedure. However, now mice were euthanized 24h post-infection to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue to determine local bacterial loads. No differences were found between local bacterial loads in mice treated with the different monoclonal antibodies. This indicates that mAbs do not prevent bacteria from establishing an infection in the lungs, but mainly affect bacterial dissemination to the bloodstream. These valuable new data are now included in the revised manuscript as <italic>Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</italic> and Results section lines 297-304, 565-572.</p><p>Of note to the reviewer, all in vivo experiments (including those in the original manuscript) were carried out with serotype 6A, which is known for being more invasive in mice than serotype 6B (see Results section lines 276-279 and reference 66).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major concern is that the WT IgG1 / 3 isotypes do not bind complement. Why is this? Is this a Fab effect (ie because of how the antigen is distributed on the organism or affinity) or reflects how the moab are produced, or some other effect? One way to address this is to examine the glycosylation profiles and the complement-fixing activity of anti-capsule isotypes from normal human sera (even if IgM-depleted).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important surprise of our study because it was always believed that the binding of an antibody to a target surface alone would be sufficient to trigger Fc-mediated effector functions (like complement activation). Using a well-defined panel of monoclonal antibodies, we here show that wild-type antibodies against encapsulated pneumococci do not automatically trigger complement activation (despite good binding).</p><p>We are confident that this is NOT related to production issues. Previously we have generated and functionally characterized monoclonal IgG1/3 antibodies against <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Zwarthoff <italic>et al.,</italic> PNAS. 2021 Jun 29; 118(26): e210278711). The cloning, expression and purification procedures of these anti-<italic>S. aureus</italic> antibodies were identical to the antibodies used in this paper (they even have the same IgG-Fc backbone). Surprisingly the IgG1/IgG3 WT antibodies against <italic>S. aureus</italic> wall teichoic acid (WTA) are well capable of inducing complement activation and downstream phagocytosis (in the absence of Fc-enhancing mutations). Therefore, we believe that the lack of complement activity is not due to how the antibodies were produced. Instead, our data suggest that these anti-capsule antibodies have a poor ability to establish Fc-Fc contacts needed for hexamer formation. This hypothesis is strengthened by our findings that strengthening Fc-mediated hexamerization can strongly enhance weak antibodies. As suggested by the referee, this could be due to the nature of the antigen (density, surface distribution) and/or Fab affinity.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we elaborate on these points more extensively and clarify the differences with our previous data on <italic>S. aureus</italic> (See Discussion line 338 to 351).</p><p>Finally, while our paper shows that multiple monoclonal antibodies against capsule have poor complement-inducing capacity, we do not claim that this holds true for all anti-capsular antibodies against pneumococci. Analyses of complex, polyclonal antibody mixtures are out of the scope of our study, which focuses on monoclonal antibodies. Also see Discussion lines 353-355.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to this, since the WT antibodies have minimal effects on bacterial killing in vitro (except for 19A at the highest concentration) yet after transfer into mice there is some effect on bacterial levels in the blood (a roughly 2-fold difference in the proportion of mice with detectable bacteria in blood between 100ug WT and E), it is important to examine whether this effect is through human antibodies activating mouse complement as one interpretation is that hexamerisation may not be the sole driver in vivo (eg Figures6c and s9a). Does the adoptive transfer of antibodies into C3-deficient mice have a similar effect? Have the authors examined mouse complement activation by human antibodies? Are multiple mechanisms at play? If Ab to capsule induced after vaccination or infection can be protective yet have a minimal capacity to activate complement then how are they functioning in the absence of enhanced hexamerisation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have performed additional experiments to show that this effect is indeed through antibodies activating mouse complement. Specifically, we now performed phagocytosis assays using mouse serum (BALB/c or CD1 mice) as complement source. First, we observed that human antibodies and mouse complement are a productive combination since human mAbs induced phagocytosis of pneumococci in the presence of mouse complement. Interestingly, we also observed that WT antibodies induce some complement-mediated phagocytosis in mouse serum. This contrasts with the experiments with human sera (figure 2a)<italic>.</italic> We speculate that there are factors in mouse sera that enable some protection by the WT antibody. Most importantly, we found that complement is the driving force for phagocytosis since heat-inactivation (HI) of mouse serum completely abolished antibody-dependent phagocytosis (by WT and hexabody antibodies).</p><p>These new data are now included in the revised manuscript as Figure 6âfigure supplement 2 and Results section lines 289-295.</p></body></sub-article></article>
