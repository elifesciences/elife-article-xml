fast-acting optokinetic responses to track and capture agile prey. Most toothed whales, however, rely on echolocation for hunting and have converged on biosonar clicking rates reaching 500/s during prey pursuits. If echoes are processed on a click-by-click basis, as assumed, neural responses 100× faster than those in vision are required to keep pace with this information flow. Using high-resolution biologging of wild predator-prey interactions, we show that toothed whales adjust clicking rates to track prey movement within 50–200 ms of prey escape responses. Hypothesising that these stereotyped biosonar adjustments are elicited by sudden prey accelerations, we measured echo-kinetic responses from trained harbour porpoises to a moving target and found similar latencies. High biosonar sampling rates are, therefore, not supported by extreme speeds of neural processing and muscular responses. Instead, the neurokinetic response times in echolocation are similar to those of tracking responses in vision, suggesting a common neural underpinning.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the animal world, split-second decisions determine whether a predator eats, or its prey survives. There is a strong evolutionary advantage to fast reacting brains and bodies. For example, the eye muscles of hunting cheetahs must lock on to a gazelle and keep track of it, no matter how quickly or unpredictably it moves. In fact, in monkeys and primates, these muscles can react to sudden movements in as little as 50 milliseconds – faster than the blink of an eye. But what about animals that do not rely on vision to hunt?</p><p>To find food at night or in the deep ocean, whales and porpoises make short ultrasonic sounds, or ‘clicks’, and then listen for returning echoes. As they close in on a prey, they need to click faster to get quicker updates on its location. What is unclear is how fast they react to the echoes. Just before a kill, a harbour porpoise can click over 500 times a second: if they wait for the echo from one click before making the next one, they would need responses 100 times faster than human eyes.</p><p>Exploring this topic is difficult, as it requires tracking predator and prey at the same time. Vance et al. took up the challenge by building sound and movement recorders that attach to whales with suction cups. These were used on two different hunters: deep-diving beaked whales and shallow-hunting harbour porpoises. Both species adapted their click rate depending on how far they were from their prey, but their response times were similar to visual responses in monkeys and humans. This means that whales and porpoises do not act on each echo before clicking again: instead, they respond to groups of tens of clicks at a time. This suggests that their brains may be wired in much the same way as the ones of visual animals.</p><p>In the ocean, increased human activity creates a dangerous noise pollution that disrupts the delicate hunting mechanism of whales and porpoises. Better understanding how these animals find their food may therefore help conservation efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>echolocation</kwd><kwd>biosonar</kwd><kwd>harbour porpoise</kwd><kwd>blainville's beaked whale</kwd><kwd>predator-prey interactions</kwd><kwd>response latency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010415</institution-id><institution>Bundesamt für Naturschutz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z1.2 5330/2010/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>Peter T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>754513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002739</institution-id><institution>Aarhus University Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011958</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6108-00355B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>Peter T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Echolocating toothed whales can detect and react to sudden prey movements during close approaches with speeds similar to ultra-fast tracking responses in human vision.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Response speed critically determines the outcome of interactions between mobile prey and pursuit predators. Prey must react rapidly to survive while predators must counter evasive prey movements quickly to gain sustenance. The fitness implications of these interactions have led to an evolutionary escalation of response times with the fastest-responding individuals being the most likely to survive and reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawkins and Krebs, 1979</xref>). However, sensory and motor requirements are asymmetric for predators and prey. Responding to close-approaching predators, prey may trade accuracy for speed, relying on imprecise ballistic motor actions triggered by strong sensory cues that require little neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domenici and Batty, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turesson et al., 2009</xref>). This has led to extremely fast responses employing short efferent pathways linking sensors directly to muscles, such as the Mauthner-cell-mediated C-start response of teleost fish to fluid motion from oncoming predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eaton and Hackett, 1984</xref>). C-start responses are characterised by sudden accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domenici and Blake, 1997</xref>) and unpredictable trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore and Biewener, 2015</xref>), with response latencies as low as 5–10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eaton et al., 1977</xref>). In contrast, predators must sacrifice speed for accuracy, typically requiring greater sensory resolution and motor-planning capabilities to track and successfully pursue evasive prey. The increased processing needed to locate prey in complex natural scenes, along with the typically larger body size of predators, inevitably results in slower movement responses compared to prey, and these are often partly offset by ingenious capture tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catania, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiley et al., 2011</xref>), cooperative hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domenici et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit-Bird and Au, 2009</xref>), or sensory/cognitive superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>For most macro-predators, binocular vision is the predominant sensory modality for hunting, and prey movements are tracked within complex visual scenes by a combination of smooth and stepped (saccadic) movements of the eye muscles that manipulate gaze direction and depth of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Land, 1999</xref>). This dynamic tracking is achieved by a set of optokinetic responses in humans and other primates with latency of 50–250 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miles et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkelens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirchner and Thorpe, 2006</xref>) that have been described as ultra-fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of echolocation in bats and toothed whales has allowed erstwhile visual predators to occupy foraging niches with low light levels such as deep or murky waters or at night. In contrast with vision, which relies on exogenous continuous light energy, echolocation is a discrete-time active sense in which ultrasonic pulses are used to sample the environment. These intense sounds potentially offer an auditory cue to prey, and many insects targeted by bats have developed ultrasonic hearing provoking an acoustic arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goerlitz et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, very few marine organisms have ultrasonic hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). This allows echolocating toothed whales in dark waters to approach most prey without being detected until close enough that prey can sense them via hydromechanical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>). Such short-range detection necessitates rapid responses from prey which must be countered by fast biosonar-informed locomotory adjustments if toothed whales are to capture agile prey.</p><p>Echolocators control information flow, in the form of returning echoes, by the rate at which sound transients are produced to probe the environment. Both bats and toothed whales appear to avoid ambiguous echo information by adjusting their sampling interval, effectively expanding and contracting the acoustic depth of field, to accommodate changes in the two-way acoustic travel time as they approach targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stidsholt et al., 2021</xref>). Clicks are accordingly produced slowly for long-range echolocation (long sensing range), but more rapidly and with lower intensity (short sensing range) for tracking nearby targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wisniewska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salles et al., 2020</xref>). In a remarkable convergence, toothed whales and bats both use rapidly accelerating series of clicks, known as buzzes, when approaching prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</xref>), thereby obtaining enhanced temporal resolution to track evasive prey at the expense of a short sensing range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>). In analogy with engineered sonars, the working model for animal biosonar assumes that neural echo processing occurs on a click-by-click basis in which the next click is produced after echoes from the current click are detected and processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au, 1993</xref>). During buzzes, bats can click at up to about 160/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elemans et al., 2011</xref>) requiring very short neural latencies to maintain such click-synchronised processing. However, in toothed whales, the click rates attained during buzzes (&gt;500/s in porpoises, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wisniewska et al., 2012</xref>) would require neural and muscular responses two orders of magnitude faster than primate visual reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawano, 1999</xref>) to keep up with the information flow. This raises the question of whether toothed whales have an extreme processing capability for acoustic information or if they instead integrate echo information over successive clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kothari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ladegaard et al., 2019</xref>) giving a processing time more similar to vision. In the latter case, why produce so many clicks during close approaches?</p><p>The modulation of clicking rate in echolocation to control information flow serves a similar function to short-latency eye movements in vision, leading us to hypothesise that echo information must guide two inter-related control loops during hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): a kinematic response loop controls the heading, posture, and locomotor rate so as to intercept prey, while a sensor-motor response loop maintains attention fixed on the moving target by continual adjustment of the clicking rate. On that basis, we predict that sudden prey movements during close approaches should provoke tightly coupled mechanical and sensor-motor responses in echolocating animals similar to those shown by visual predators. However, despite echolocation being the main sensory mode for hunting in one of four species of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</xref>), the sensory feedback that echolocating predators receive from movements of their prey has received little attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref> reported clicking rate dynamics of wild harbour porpoises during buzzes that appeared to be associated with prey movements but offered no analysis. The only reported study of predator responses during echolocation buzzes is for wild bats approaching suspended prey that were moved by hand. Rather than adjust clicking rates, these bats aborted buzzes some 100 ms after strong target movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geberl et al., 2015</xref>), perhaps indicative of a neural processing delay, but the decision to end a buzz may well result from different neural processing than that involved in prey tracking.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual schematic of the hypothesised feedback control mechanisms that act in response to changing target range in echolocation-mediated foraging.</title><p>The dark lines indicate acoustic paths in echolocation. The grey line indicates movement of the predator towards the prey.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68825-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The scant literature on sensory feedback in echolocation owes much to the inherent difficulty of measuring simultaneously the motor responses of predators and movements of prey at high time resolution. This has seldom been achieved outside of instrumented enclosures where movements can be tracked with high-speed cameras, but where ecologically relevant stimuli are hard to emulate. Echolocating toothed whales provide an excellent model system in which to measure the coupled kinetics of free-ranging predators and prey. Sound and movement logging tags (DTAGs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Tyack, 2003</xref>) record the outgoing echolocation clicks of toothed whale species and, for some species, also detect returning echoes from prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>). They simultaneously record the fine-scale movements of the tagged animal, allowing quantification of both the sensory and locomotor responses of predators to movements of their prey. Crucially, these tags sample the sensory scene at exactly the same rate as it is acquired by the animal, that is, the rate at which clicks are produced.</p><p>Here we used high-resolution DTAGs on two species of echolocating toothed whales living in very different habitats to study biosonar responses to prey movements in the wild. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that prey movements trigger neuromotor feedback during buzzes, and that this feedback operates at the extreme speeds needed to keep pace with the high clicking rate in buzzes. We show that both species make stereotyped biosonar adjustments when prey attempt to escape during close approaches, but the apparent latency of these echo-kinetic responses is much longer than the inter-click intervals (ICIs) in buzzes. Given the evolutionary importance of such a feedback system, we further hypothesised that it would be stimulated by any rapidly moving target during a close approach, facilitating controlled studies of biosonar responses. To test this, we trained harbour porpoises to approach a moveable target while wearing a biologging tag, enabling direct measurement of biosonar-mediated sensory and kinematic response latencies as a function of target movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biosonar responses to prey movement in free-ranging animals</title><p>Echograms visualising the acoustic scene during prey capture buzzes in wild harbour porpoises (<italic>Phocoena phocoena</italic>, abbreviated to Pp) and Blainville’s beaked whales (<italic>Mesoplodon densirostris</italic>, abbreviated to Md) frequently show evidence of evasive prey that launch sudden escape attempts as the predator approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Prey that accelerate away from the predator can quickly move beyond the acoustic depth of field (i.e., the buzz ICI times one half of the sound speed) requiring a rapid increase in ICI by the predator to avoid ambiguous target ranging. The ICIs used in buzzes when targeting evasive prey show dynamics that seem to correspond to changes in prey range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), suggesting a tight sensor-motor feedback loop. To verify that these ICI changes are linked to prey escapes, we plotted the proportion of outward depth-of-field adjustments (i.e., increasing ICIs) in time bins synchronised with the first detectable prey movement in buzzes. Echograms with clear echo traces showing sudden prey movements suitable for this timing analysis are sparse. Pooling data from six harbour porpoises, we found 76 buzzes in which the prey escape speed exceeded the predator closing speed by more than 0.25 m/s, leading to clear V-shaped echo traces. These buzzes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) showed strong positive ICI adjustments that differ significantly from control buzzes (i.e., with randomly reassigned target movement times) beginning in the 50–100 ms time bin after the start of prey escapes. Suitable echograms for Blainville’s beaked whales were less common. After relaxing the selection criteria to accept buzzes with any sudden detectable increase in prey speed away from the whale, we pooled 36 examples from seven individuals. The resulting ICI distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) showed strong positive adjustments that differed significantly from control intervals beginning 100–200 ms after initial prey movement. Thus, in both toothed whale species foraging in the wild, evasive movements by prey appear to be consistently matched by biosonar adjustments that maintain the prey within the unambiguous depth of field with a feedback loop latency of ~50–200 ms. ICIs during buzzes decrease to &lt;2.5 ms for harbour porpoises and &lt;3.5 ms for Blainville’s beaked whales, meaning that at least 20 clicks are produced during this latency time.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Echograms from a wild harbour porpoise (<bold>A</bold>) and a Blainville’s beaked whale (<bold>B</bold>) during close prey approaches (buzzes) show prey escape attempts (white arrows) and dynamics in inter-click interval (ICI, yellow arrows) that appear to be causally related.</title><p>These plots show echo strength (colour-coded by signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], in decibels [dB] as a function of distance from the predator [vertical axis] and time with respect to the start of the buzz [horizontal axis]).

Echoes appear in these bars as light blue lines such as the one at 3.9 ms (the corresponding echoes are indicated by arrows in <bold>B</bold>). The target range corresponding to a given echo time delay can be computed by multiplying the time delay by the sound speed and dividing by 2 to account for the out and back travel. Finally, as the rate of clicking varies widely during buzzes, the width of each coloured bar is adjusted to match the time interval between successive clicks. This is done to produce an echogram that is indexed by elapsed time rather than click number. If the inter-click interval (ICI) is less than the interval length, multiple outgoing clicks will appear in each coloured bar (<bold>E</bold>). This results in a repeating pattern in the echogram that appears at multiples of the ICI × sound speed/2.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68825-fig2-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Individual coloured bars, generated following the process outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> are stacked together and rotated by 90° to produce an echogram (left).</title><p>The resulting display has units of time on the horizontal axis and range in metres to potential echoic targets on the vertical axis. The colour of each pixel represents the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal. Echograms require some practice to interpret, and the key features are indicated in the schematic representation on the right. Thin diagonal traces in the echogram (<bold>A, B</bold>) are echoes from small organisms in front of the porpoise. The slope of each echo trace indicates the closing speed (metres per second, a negative slope implies a positive closing speed). These organisms are likely initially moving slowly relative to the porpoise and so the closing speed is largely due to movement of the porpoise towards the targets. The high-intensity outgoing echolocation clicks (<bold>C</bold>) appear at distance 0 throughout the echogram and act as a reminder that the display represents a moving frame of view anchored to the porpoise. Clicks are produced at a rate of 10–50/s during searching and initial approach but a rapid acceleration in the clicking rate, termed a buzz, occurs during close approaches with prey (<bold>D</bold>). As per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wisniewska et al., 2012</xref>, rapid sequences of clicks are identified as foraging buzzes when the inter-click interval drops below 100 ms for beaked whales and 13 ms for harbour porpoise. In the example here, the buzz is followed by a short pause in clicking (<bold>E</bold>) before slower search clicking resumes (<bold>F</bold>). Due to the high speed of clicking during the buzz, outgoing clicks appear multiple times in the echogram (<bold>G, H</bold>) at spacings equal to the inter-click interval multiplied by one half of the sound speed. One of the echo traces from the organisms evident before the buzz (<bold>A</bold>) continues into the buzz and provides information about the movement of the organism (most likely a small fish) as it is targeted by the porpoise. The fish reacts to the porpoise’s approach at a distance of about 0.6 m (<bold>I</bold>) and attempts to escape as evidenced by a sharp change in the slope of the echo trace. Shortly thereafter the porpoise’s clicking rate suddenly begins decreasing (<bold>J</bold>) after a period of monotonic increase. This results in a V-shape in the repetition curves of the outgoing clicks (<bold>G</bold>). Although the prey can outswim the porpoise for a brief interval, leading to an increase in range between the porpoise and prey, it is ultimately overtaken and captured by the porpoise (<bold>K</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68825-fig2-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Energetic prey targeted by harbour porpoises can make multiple escape attempts within a buzz providing an opportunity to examine ICI responses to repeated cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To estimate this latency, we advanced the ICI time series in 5 ms steps until the areas within the loops were minimised. An advance of 90 ms collapsed most of the loops in the delay compensation plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that successive prey movements elicit responses with self-similar latency. In comparison, the magnitude of the ICI responses varied widely. Although ICI changes proportionate with prey escape movements occurred in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), over-compensation was more typical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), leading to depths of field that extended well beyond prey range when prey attempted to escape.

In this discrete-time sensory system, there is an unavoidable trade-off between sensing range and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</xref>): to detect rapid prey movements, echolocators must sample at a high rate. However, under the prevailing click-by-click model for echolocation processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au, 1993</xref>), such fast sampling would require infeasible neural and muscular speeds, leaving uncertain how toothed whales respond to evasive prey. Our results from both wild animals and controlled trials demonstrate that toothed whales make sensor-motor responses to sudden target movements during echolocation buzzes but that the response latencies, although fast compared to other mammalian sensory systems, span multiple clicks. Our sample size (eight Md, and six wild and two captive Pp) is constrained by the difficulty of tagging wild toothed whales and by the availability of suitably trained captive animals. However, the consistent speed and stereotypy of responses in both natural foraging interactions and controlled trials strongly support an acute echo-mediated sensory feedback loop that is responsive to the evasive manoeuvres of prey. We propose the term echo-kinetic for these responses in analogy with the optokinetic responses that control ocular tracking in visual predators.</p><p>Our results show that high-sampling-rate buzzes, which are a defining characteristic of toothed whale echolocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wisniewska et al., 2014</xref>), delimit a reactive sensory mode in which the greatly increased temporal resolution allows detection of fast prey motion while rapid feedback control of click rate maintains unambiguous tracking of escaping prey. The universality of this sensory strategy in toothed whales is supported by the similarity of our results from two toothed whale families that diverged some 21 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGowen et al., 2009</xref>) and occupy very different niches: Blainville’s beaked whales dive to great depths to forage on fish and squid in and below the deep scattering layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arranz et al., 2011</xref>), whereas harbour porpoise forage epipelagically and benthically on small shallow-dwelling fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, similar biosonar responses were consistently elicited from captive porpoises by sudden movements of an artificial target hinting that this reflex-like behaviour is deeply embedded in the neural substrate of toothed whales. This leads us to propose that acute sensor-motor feedback during buzzes is a fundamental feature of toothed whale echolocation that has enabled hunting of nutritionally-valuable muscular but reactive prey.</p><p>The measured response latencies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) show that tight sensor-motor feedback in echolocation buzzes can be achieved without extreme neural processing speeds. Echo-kinetic response latencies of 50–200 ms in our study are comparable to short-latency eye movements in primate vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirchner and Thorpe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkelens, 2006</xref>) and to vocal response latencies to passive acoustic cues in dolphins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ridgway, 2011</xref>) and porpoises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wensveen et al., 2014</xref>). However, these response latencies are more than 20× longer than the 2.5–3.5 ms ICI during buzzes, demonstrating that echolocating whales process and respond to echo information during prey approaches much more slowly than they acquire it. Put another way, the maximum information bandwidth (i.e., 1/(2 × ICI) Hz, by Nyquist theorem) is some 40× greater than the maximum control bandwidth that can be achieved given the response delay, that is, approximately 1/(4× response latency) Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Åström, 1997</xref>). This implies strongly that echo processing and control decisions during buzzes are decoupled from click rate rather than occurring on a click-synchronous basis as widely assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au, 1993</xref>). This conjecture is consistent with the proposed processing mode of click packets produced during long-range echolocation of dolphins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ladegaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finneran, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The dramatic bandwidth mismatch between information gathering and feedback control in echolocation buzzes begs the questions of how these processes are decoupled and what purpose this serves. Unlike bats, which generate calls individually by contractions of super-fast vocal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elemans et al., 2011</xref>), we propose that the extreme click rates in toothed whale buzzes are achieved by a free-running pneumatic oscillator comprising the pressurised pre-narial air space and phonic lips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Au and Suthers, 2014</xref>). This oscillator produces buzz clicks at a rate determined by the air pressure and the tension of the phonic lips, both of which can likely be controlled asynchronously with respect to click production. In this model, control decisions, formed after observing echoes from tens of clicks during buzzing, modulate the rate of clicking with the objective of maximising temporal resolution subject to the constraint that the ICI is consistently greater than the two-way travel time to the target.</p><p>The high clicking rate in buzzes enables rapid detection of prey responses but may provide other benefits, when combined with appropriate feedback mechanisms, such as (i) signal-to-noise ratio improvement of weak echoes by integration over multiple clicks (i.e., using integral control); (ii) speed-based processing of echoic scenes to predict target motion (via differential control); and (iii) detection of modulations in echo level (e.g., due to prey tail-beats, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>) that may be the earliest cues of prey responses, while avoiding aliasing in this discrete-time sensor. The high click rate in buzzes effectively forms a temporal fovea, akin to the spatial fovea in many visual predators, matched to the burst movement rates of the relatively small prey targeted by most toothed whales. This ensures the observability of prey behaviour and enables control tactics that counter unpredictable prey movement.</p><p>Echograms recorded during wild encounters with evasive prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) hint at two control tactics that may be employed. When the change in target range is dominated by predator movements, a gradual upward adjustment of clicking rate is sufficient to track the changing spatial relationship of predator and prey. In comparison, unexpected rapid prey movements often provoke large adjustments in the biosonar rate in which the acoustic depth of field is rapidly expanded at the expense of temporal resolution. This suggests a layered control with smooth tracking during stalking and when prey move predictably, but occasional saccade-like ballistic increases in clicking rate during chases. Such layered control actions may also accommodate the dynamics of schooling prey, which can quickly switch between cohesion when being pursued and dispersion when escaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couzin and Krause, 2003</xref>). Similar to vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkelens, 2006</xref>), the saccadic biosonar adjustments occurred with longer latencies in captive trials, compared to average responses, suggesting that large adjustments may be employed when targets move away sufficiently rapidly for there to be a risk of ambiguous echo ranging, that is, the echo delay exceeding the time between outgoing clicks.</p><p>While information bandwidths in echolocation are likely linked to prey dynamics, the control bandwidths (i.e., the speed with which the system can respond to changes) may be more matched to the size and manoeuvrability of the predator given that size influences both the rotational inertia of the body and the length, and therefore contraction rate, of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domenici, 2001</xref>). We hypothesised the existence of two control loops in echolocation-guided hunting, controlling, respectively, the acoustic depth of field and the swimming kinematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have been able to demonstrate the biosonar feedback loop in both wild and controlled settings, but full-body kinematic responses to prey movement are confounded in wild predator-prey interactions by the predator’s own striking actions. However, our controlled studies demonstrate that porpoises make an accelerative response to target movement with latency roughly comparable to the biosonar response and it seems very likely that wild animals would have similar kinematic responses. Therefore, our finding of longer biosonar response latencies in Blainville’s beaked whales, which are three times the size of harbour porpoises, suggests that control bandwidths may scale inversely with predator size. In effect, selection pressure on higher control bandwidths may be opposed by the increasing energetic cost of fast movements in large animals. An additional constraint on biosonar control bandwidth arises in the largest toothed whale species, sperm whales, due to the separation of the brain and sound source (located at the anterior tip of the nose) which may be more than 3 m apart. Even with highly myelinated nerves, the conduction delay (perhaps 30 ms) of neural signals to the sound source will be comparable to, or exceed, the time between successive clicks in buzzes (e.g., 10–20 ms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fais et al., 2016</xref>). The decoupling between information flow and feedback control proposed here, in concert with a self-running pneumatic oscillator at the sound source, may have been instrumental in permitting such extreme cranial telescoping.</p><p>Thus, despite the overt differences between echolocation and vision, the response bandwidths and layered control inferred here for toothed whale echolocation are remarkably similar to those in primate vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirchner and Thorpe, 2006</xref>), with response times of the order of 0.1 s, likely limited in both auditory and visual senses by higher-order processing and muscle contraction speeds. The apparent universal use of buzzes during capture of moving prey by echolocators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</xref>) suggests that extreme sensory sampling rates, guiding fast echo-kinetic responses, may have been a critical development, parallel to optokinetic responses in visual predators, enabling echolocation to be used to hunt agile prey, as opposed to just navigation and prey search. Our results, therefore, reveal strongly convergent neural sensor-motor feedback loops between vision and echolocation that are key for sensing dynamic spatial relationships with small prey. The non-invasive experimental approach developed here enables measurement of neuro-sensory dynamics while animals solve vital real-world problems, opening the way for a deeper understanding of ecological drivers on sensor performance in the wild.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Echolocation in free-ranging animals</title><p>Sound and movement recording DTAGs were attached with suction cups to the anterio-dorsal surface of wild harbour porpoises (Pp, n = 6) in inner Danish waters between 2012 and 2018, and Blainville’s beaked whales (Md, n = 8) off El Hierro in the Canary Islands between 2004 and 2013.

Tags automatically released from animals after a pre-programmed interval and were recovered by VHF radio tracking.</p><p>Data processing was performed in Matlab 2016a (MathWorks Inc). Spectrograms of the on-animal sound recordings were examined to identify rapid click sequences (buzzes) during foraging. For each buzz, the production times of clicks were determined using a supervised click detector with approximately 50 µs accuracy. Clicks from the tagged animal were distinguished from those of other nearby animals by the consistent angle-of-arrival (on stereo tags) and broader frequency range of the former. Buzzes were defined as intervals in which the ICI was below 0.013 s (Pp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>) or 0.1 s (Md) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>) for at least 0.5 s. Echograms were formed for each buzz by first bandpass filtering the sound (Pp: 100–250 kHz; Md: 25–60 kHz) and then computing the amplitude envelope using the Hilbert transform. Segments of envelope synchronised to each click were extracted and displayed as coloured bars with width equal to the click’s ICI, resulting in an echogram display with axes of time and distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson, 2014</xref>).

Echograms with unclear prey echo traces or with substantial interference (e.g., echoes from the sea surface, seafloor, or other organisms) were rejected. The remaining echograms were examined for indications of prey escape attempts. These appear as sudden changes in the slope of prey echo traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) reflecting a step change in the closing speed between predator and prey as the prey accelerates away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wisniewska et al., 2016</xref>). As prey reactions are typically fast, the onset time of the slope change in the echo trace is usually well-defined. The first such reaction time in each buzz echogram was selected manually with ~10 ms accuracy, and traces with unclear or gradual slope changes were rejected. Potential biosonar adjustments to these prey movements were quantified by the proportion of positive changes in ICI (suggesting an outward adjustment of the depth of field) in 50 ms (Pp) or 100 ms (Md) bins, spanning from 500 ms before to 500 ms after each prey response time. As ICI varies continuously throughout buzzes, these bin sizes were chosen as a compromise between temporal resolution and rejection of noise from routine ICI variations. The wider bin size for Md reflects the longer ICIs produced during buzzes by these larger animals.</p><p>To determine the probability of chance associations between target movement and ICI changes, a bootstrap method was applied for each species. The same biosonar response metric was computed 1000 times for randomly selected pairs of buzzes in which the prey movement time from one buzz was applied to another buzz. Specifically, the time elapsed between the start of the buzz and the onset of the prey response in the first buzz of each pair was added to the start of buzz time in the second buzz to give a mock prey move time from which to reference the analysis time bins.

At the time of the experiments, Sif was 1.6 m in length, 14 years old, and had been housed at Fjord &amp; Bælt since 2004. Freja was 1.58 m in length, 20 years old, and had been held at the facility since 1997.

The target sphere contained an embedded hydrophone (flat [±2 dB] frequency response from 1 to 160 kHz) and two-axis accelerometer (flat [+0/–3 dB] frequency response from 0 to 2 kHz, axes oriented horizontally), and was suspended in the water via a 0.8 mm nylon string to a depth of approximately 1.5 m. A 1.2-mm-diameter screened cable carrying the accelerometer and hydrophone signals from the target was loosely attached to the nylon string and connected out of the water to a three-channel synchronous 16-bit analog-to-digital convertor sampling at 500 kHz (National Instruments, Austin, TX). A second nylon line running horizontally from the sphere to the side of the pool was used to move the target during trials.

This tag contains a single hydrophone sampled at 576 kHz (flat [±2 dB] frequency response from 1 to 150 kHz, clipping level of 175 dB re 1 μPa) together with a tri-axial accelerometer sampled synchronously at 200 Hz and a tri-axial magnetometer and pressure sensor sampled at 50 Hz.</p><p>For each session, one of the two porpoises was introduced into the pool and stationed approximately 8 m from the target until given a cue to perform the target interception task. If the animal intercepted the target by touching it, it was bridged with a whistle and received a fish reward upon returning to station. In randomly selected trials, the target was moved manually approximately 30 cm by pulling vigorously on the horizontal line when the porpoise approached within one body length. The line was held slack prior to this to limit any early anticipatory target movement. Target movement was selected pseudo-randomly for each trial between fast, slow, and no movement, with a maximum run of two equal conditions. Up to 20 trials were performed with each animal per day for a total of 150 trials over 4 days for the two animals.</p><p>Echolocation clicks were detected in the animal-attached DTAG recordings using a supervised detector. The time offset between the tag and the National Instruments recordings was then determined for each trial by matching click sequences between the tag and the target hydrophones (max. timing error due to acoustic propagation of ~1 ms). Echograms were then assembled from the tag data as described above. Sudden changes in the closing speed between the target and the porpoise due to rapid movement of the target generated the same distinctive slope changes in echo traces as observed in wild predator-prey interactions. To maximise timing accuracy, trials were only selected for analysis if the target attained a speed greater than the porpoise’s approach speed (approximately 1 m/s), resulting in a V-shaped echo trace. The apex of the V was then taken as the reference time for calculating response latencies. The target acceleration (as measured by the embedded accelerometer) began ~100 ms before this due to tightening of the line and rotation of the spherical target to align the tie point with the pull direction. Given the thin line and spherical target, neither of these movements generated significant echo signatures and the porpoise was therefore unlikely to detect the target motion until it is underway. We accordingly view the apex of the V in the echogram as a close indicator of the time at which the porpoise was first able to detect the target movement. As the target movement varied in each trial, the root-mean-squared target acceleration was calculated as a proxy for target motion. This was computed from the accelerometer embedded in the target by removing the fixed gravity component from each axis and then summing the squared signals from both axes over the 500 ms following the first acceleration transient.</p><p>Biosonar responses to target movement were quantified as for the wild toothed whales using the proportion of positive ICI changes in 50 ms intervals. Locomotor responses to target movement were assessed from the norm-jerk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ydesen et al., 2014</xref>) calculated from the DTAG accelerometer data sampled at 200 Hz. To assess the probability of chance associations between target movement and ICI changes, the same bootstrap method was applied as for wild harbour porpoise and beaked whales (see above), that is, randomly selecting 1000 pairs of trials and applying the elapsed time between buzz start and target movement from one trial to the buzz of another trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Data curation, Formal analysis, Conceptualization, Investigation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The captive harbour porpoises were cared for by Fjord &amp; Bælt, Denmark, under permits no.

The complete source data for this paper comprises several TB, the great majority of which are not needed to reproduce our findings. We have therefore extracted a subset that is sufficient to re-create echograms of the type seen in Figure 2A–B, Figure 3A, Figure 4, Figure 5A–B, and hence the results summary plots. Included for each trial is the acoustic data together with the timing of the prey/target movement and, for trials with trained animals, the speed of the target movement. Data comprises a single netcdf file for each analysed trial, and covers the 112 captive trials (controls and treatment conditions) as well as each analysed prey capture attempt from the wild data. The netcdf format allows us to attach metadata directly to each trial in a human-readable form. Further we have provided Matlab/Octave scripts to produce echograms from these data. The supplementary material included in the manuscript provides sufficient information to interpret these echograms.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguilar de Soto</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wisniewska</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ladegaard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hooker</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Echolocating toothed whales use ultra-fast echo-kinetic responses to track evasive prey</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.n8pk0p2w1</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The captive harbour porpoises were cared for by Fjord &amp; Bælt, Denmark, under permit nos.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper on echolocation-mediated responses to prey movements will be of interest to a broad audience, including ethologists and neuroscientists as well as those more generally interested in the natural world. Its strengths come from the use of data from both wild and captive animals of different species of toothed whales, as well as trained harbour porpoises, enabling generalization of the findings and conclusions on sensory-motor feedback. The authors show that these animals use their biosonar responses to follow sudden prey movements with speeds that resemble those of visual tracking responses in other species.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Echolocating whales use ultra-fast echo-kinetic responses to track evasive prey&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miriam Spering as a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander J Werth (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Individual reviews below provide a list of issues that should be addressed for clarification purposes. Among them, a few stand out as more essential:</p><p>1. Consider changing the title to &quot;echolocating whales and porpoises&quot;.</p><p>2. Emphasize / discuss sample size as a limitation.</p><p>3. A comment from the reviewing editor (who read this paper with interest, from the perspective of an oculomotor systems researcher): some extra care with regard to eye movement terminology would be appreciated. For example, the term &quot;optokinetic reflex&quot; is sometimes used in this paper to describe short-latency eye movements in general, for example, the papers referenced in l. 48 following are all about express saccades. Could the authors perhaps use the term short-latency eye movement? Other terms that have been used: orienting saccade, reflexive saccade.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Congratulations on a lovely manuscript. I have no major issues with it. I specifically liked the clever analyses presented in Figure 3 B-C for the wild animals. Though beyond the scope of this manuscript, it would be interesting to repeat the experiment with the captive animals tracking a target that moves repeatedly (not isolated trials). In this same line, future studies including physiological methods (ABRs and EMGs to track muscle responses) could provide further insight into the processing times for the pathway proposed by the authors.</p><p>It is my opinion that a more thorough discussion on prey tracking behaviors and the evolutionary arms-race would situate the findings in a broader context and improve the manuscript.</p><p>Some other comments:</p><p>Line 52: why do the authors suggest echolocation enables stealthy approaches? It is well documented that a number of prey can hear echolocating animals approaching. This sentence is confusing as it seems to imply echolocation provides more stealth than vision. Please reword.</p><p>Line 73: I suggest you add the citation Salles Diebold and Moss 2020, which also shows an increase in vocalization rate in bats tracking a moving prey item trajectory.</p><p>Line 83: please correct the sentence to &quot;one in four species of mammals&quot;</p><p>Line 212: please clarify that the acceleration of the target moved by hand was calculated with an accelerometer (as described in methods). As it reads it is unclear how controlled the target movements were.</p><p>Line 252: unit typo should read &quot;m.s-3 &quot; or &quot;m/s3 &quot; as in Line 218; not &quot;ms-3&quot;.</p><p>Figure 7: From the figure it looks like the limit to how fast ICI change can occur after prey movement, ~200 ms for captive animals? While in the wild the authors show evidence for 100-200 ms delay after initial prey movement (line 141). Is there a limit to how fast the target is moved by hand that cannot replicate the shorter latencies seen in the wild?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Some readers might be confused with the word &quot;whales&quot; in the title, given that this study is based on porpoises too. Perhaps consider changing to &quot;echolocating whales and porpoises&quot;? (or cetaceans?)</p><p>2. In line 53, the authors present the entirely logical and reasonable argument that &quot;prey are likely to detect the predator only when it is close,&quot; but because this follows a sentence about vision, it presents the idea-intentionally or unintentionally-that aquatic prey will detect their predators visually. In fact, it seems reasonable that most aquatic prey will use mechanoreception, particularly if a predator approaches from behind swimming prey, and if the prey are fish with sensitive lateral line systems. Even if the beaked whales are preying on squid (which typically rely on visual sensation), this mostly occurs in deep, dark waters where vision is of limited use.</p><p>3. Is it concerning that the two captive porpoises had similar but really non-overlapping response times (&quot;50-100 ms for Freja and 100-150 ms for Sif&quot;; lines 202-203)?</p><p>4.

Two related thoughts: First, I have often heard, informally, that cetacean brains are very large but that, unlike most mammals, cetacean brains are largely devoted to processing auditory information.

Second, I wonder about subconscious vs. conscious neural processing. I realize that this is not entirely pertinent to this study, but you've got me thinking about it. At the standard frame rate of television and movies (24 fps) we cannot (consciously) distinguish a series of discrete, separate still images-we see them, obviously, as a continuous stream of video input (even if we subconsciously detect subliminal cues in individual frames, for example). Might this relate in any way to this study? I like your two-part model of feedback control (Figure 1) of vocal muscles versus locomotor muscles.

This manuscript is really very well written (I commend, and thank, the authors for the fine care they have taken in writing this), but an &quot;Oxford comma&quot; is needed in line 44 before the word &quot;or&quot; (third item in a list) to prevent possible confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68825.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Individual reviews below provide a list of issues that should be addressed for clarification purposes. Among them, a few stand out as more essential:</p><p>1. Consider changing the title to &quot;echolocating whales and porpoises&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that 'echolocating whales' may not connote smaller delphinids to some readers. Our results suggest strongly that echo-kinetic responses are a common feature across the suborder odontoceti. We therefore propose to use the more precise term 'echolocating toothed whales'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Emphasize / discuss sample size as a limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We note in our reply to Reviewer #2 that our sample size of wild porpoises and beaked whales (8 and 6, respectively), is considerably larger than stated by the reviewer (i.e., 2 of each species). However, the captive trials in the study were limited to 2 trained porpoises, and we have added text in the discussion to emphasise and discuss this limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A comment from the reviewing editor (who read this paper with interest, from the perspective of an oculomotor systems researcher): some extra care with regard to eye movement terminology would be appreciated. For example, the term &quot;optokinetic reflex&quot; is sometimes used in this paper to describe short-latency eye movements in general, for example, the papers referenced in l. 48 following are all about express saccades. Could the authors perhaps use the term short-latency eye movement? Other terms that have been used: orienting saccade, reflexive saccade.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We intend with the term 'optokinetic reflex' to refer to both smooth pursuit and saccadic responses that control eye position and orientation in target tracking. The suggested replacement term (short-latency eye movements) does not seem to us to have the same connotation of a feedback process. We have therefore opted to use both terms according to whether it is specifically the movement or the responsivity which is under discussion. We have also replaced one of the references at line 48 to include a citation covering both pursuit and saccadic latencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Congratulations on a lovely manuscript. I have no major issues with it. I specifically liked the clever analyses presented in Figure 3 B-C for the wild animals. Though beyond the scope of this manuscript, it would be interesting to repeat the experiment with the captive animals tracking a target that moves repeatedly (not isolated trials). In this same line, future studies including physiological methods (ABRs and EMGs to track muscle responses) could provide further insight into the processing times for the pathway proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the kind words. Yes, this study has brought to our minds many avenues for future investigation and the reviewer's suggestions are most welcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is my opinion that a more thorough discussion on prey tracking behaviors and the evolutionary arms-race would situate the findings in a broader context and improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting topic, but there is always a tension between offering an extensive introduction versus getting quickly to the point in a manuscript. Some readers will appreciate the former and others the latter. We aimed for a concise introduction because almost nothing is currently known about the evolutionary history of echolocation and its impact on prey co-evolution. Moreover, it has not been clear to what extent results from other sensory systems apply to echolocating animals. We feel therefore that a review of the broader literature around predator-prey arms races may seem out-of-place to some readers. However, we have added a few words and some additional references on this theme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some other comments:</p><p>Line 52: why do the authors suggest echolocation enables stealthy approaches? It is well documented that a number of prey can hear echolocating animals approaching. This sentence is confusing as it seems to imply echolocation provides more stealth than vision. Please reword.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We were thinking specifically about marine echolocators here. While many prey species targeted by bats are able to hear echolocation calls, the same is not true for the prey of marine echolocators. Ultrasonic hearing has thus far only been shown in a few species of shad (subfamily: alosinae) where it may have developed in response to predation by delphinids (Wilson et al., J. Exp. Biol. 2009). The typical prey of porpoises, beaked whales and many other toothed whales, to the best of our knowledge, have no such capability (Wilson et al., 2007). For these predators, therefore, echolocation really does provide a private sensory channel. A few bat species may also achieve this benefit, at the expense of detection distance, by producing much weaker calls (Goerlitz et al., Current Biology 2010). We have added text to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 73: I suggest you add the citation Salles Diebold and Moss 2020, which also shows an increase in vocalization rate in bats tracking a moving prey item trajectory.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added this very relevant reference. This excellent study looks at prey-tracking behaviour in bats during regular clicking (i.e., outside of the high-call-rate buzzes that occur during close-in chases) and so provides a broader context to our topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 83: please correct the sentence to &quot;one in four species of mammals&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 212: please clarify that the acceleration of the target moved by hand was calculated with an accelerometer (as described in methods). As it reads it is unclear how controlled the target movements were.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. Amended as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 252: unit typo should read &quot;m.s-3 &quot; or &quot;m/s3 &quot; as in Line 218; not &quot;ms-3&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We think the reviewer means line 225 here. In our merged pdf of the submission, this unit appeared correctly but we have checked that it remains correct in the revised submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: From the figure it looks like the limit to how fast ICI change can occur after prey movement, ~200 ms for captive animals? While in the wild the authors show evidence for 100-200 ms delay after initial prey movement (line 141). Is there a limit to how fast the target is moved by hand that cannot replicate the shorter latencies seen in the wild?</p></disp-quote><p>This figure shows the latency to large changes in ICI (which may be comparable to saccades in vision) whereas Figures 2 and 6 show the latency to increases in ICI of any size (i.e., for both proportionate and saccade-like responses). In vision, saccades have longer latency than tracking responses (e.g., Erkelens, Vision Research 2006) and the larger latencies in Figure 7 vs Figures 2 and 6 are consistent with this. However, it is also possible that hand-movements of the target do not reach the highest accelerations achievable by small prey in the wild and therefore do not invoke the fastest responses. This is a topic for further research but we have added a clarification in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Some readers might be confused with the word &quot;whales&quot; in the title, given that this study is based on porpoises too. Perhaps consider changing to &quot;echolocating whales and porpoises&quot;? (or cetaceans?)</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the term 'whales' is imprecise. We have changed this to 'toothed whales' to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In line 53, the authors present the entirely logical and reasonable argument that &quot;prey are likely to detect the predator only when it is close,&quot; but because this follows a sentence about vision, it presents the idea-intentionally or unintentionally-that aquatic prey will detect their predators visually. In fact, it seems reasonable that most aquatic prey will use mechanoreception, particularly if a predator approaches from behind swimming prey, and if the prey are fish with sensitive lateral line systems. Even if the beaked whales are preying on squid (which typically rely on visual sensation), this mostly occurs in deep, dark waters where vision is of limited use.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, and thanks for catching this. We have clarified in the manuscript that mechanoreception is likely the primary modality for prey to detect predators in light-limited marine environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is it concerning that the two captive porpoises had similar but really non-overlapping response times (&quot;50-100 ms for Freja and 100-150 ms for Sif&quot;; lines 202-203)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a drawback of captive studies for which few individuals are available. While Freja has shown very consistent echolocation performance over many years of target approach trials, Sif has always been more variable. That both animals showed broadly similar responses over many trials points to the stereotypy of the echo-kinetic response even though the latency varied across the two individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Can you provide some additional data about the two captive harbour porpoises (apart from the fact that both Sif and Freja are female; line 383). Size? Age? Length of time in captivity?</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. This information is now added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The analogy of a temporal fovea similar to the spatial (retinal) fovea is really nice, and quite evocative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Yes, this has inspired us to think of follow-on experiments to explore how reliant echolocators are on dense temporal flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The sources supplied by the authors are good and up to date. In line 238, a source should be supplied for the statement about &quot;the prevailing click-by-click model for echolocation processing&quot;. Who proposed, stated, or described/explained this model? Would it be Au 1993?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, citation added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Two related thoughts: First, I have often heard, informally, that cetacean brains are very large but that, unlike most mammals, cetacean brains are largely devoted to processing auditory information. I am not a brain expert by any means, and although I doubt the veracity of this claim, I wonder if the authors might include here, perhaps in the Introduction of Discussion, a brief mention about cetacean brains and their relation to auditory processing abilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Although toothed whales do indeed have a well-developed auditory cortex, the large brains in some species may have evolved for different reasons Toothed whales with large relative brain sizes are typically very social species such as pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins that must navigate complex social settings. It is also worth noting that bats with very small brains can perform similar biosonar processing as toothed whales. Although this is a very interesting topic, to do it justice would require a lengthy aside in the manuscript which we think would interrupt the flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Second, I wonder about subconscious vs. conscious neural processing. I realize that this is not entirely pertinent to this study, but you've got me thinking about it. At the standard frame rate of television and movies (24 fps) we cannot (consciously) distinguish a series of discrete, separate still images-we see them, obviously, as a continuous stream of video input (even if we subconsciously detect subliminal cues in individual frames, for example).

Could odontocete brains possibly recognize individual clicks, in the same way that we can &quot;see&quot; individual video frames, even if on another level they show responses that are decoupled from the click rate?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an intriguing proposal. Such sub-conscious perception in vision could perhaps be related to differential processing in early neural layers, e.g., to facilitate detection of fleeting predator/prey cues. But there is a big jump from the 24 fps of movies to the 500+ clicks/s of a porpoise and it seems likely that the perception of echo streams from individual clicks would be less valuable to an echolocator than are brief optical cues to a visual predator or prey. Echolocating whales and delphinids are frequently within hearing range of other conspecifics and so must be able to echolocate without being distracted by the clicks of other animals. One important function of the asynchronous processing that we propose in the manuscript may be to improve robustness to such interference, i.e., preventing its perception within the echo processing neural circuitry. However, the presence of conspecifics is also a valuable source of information to an animal (e.g., as in Aguilar de Soto et al., Scientific Reports 2020) pointing to the need for stream segregation in early neural processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
