micronemes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are required for microneme exocytosis; however, the molecular events that regulate trafficking and fusion of micronemes with the plasma membrane remain unresolved. Here, we combine sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics and bio-orthogonal labeling of kinase substrates in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner. In addition to known regulators of secretion, we identify uncharacterized targets with predicted functions across signaling, gene expression, trafficking, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. One of the CDPK1 targets is a putative HOOK activating adaptor. In other eukaryotes, HOOK homologs form the FHF complex with FTS and FHIP to activate dynein-mediated trafficking of endosomes along microtubules. We show the FHF complex is partially conserved in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, consisting of HOOK, an FTS homolog, and two parasite-specific proteins (TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650). CDPK1 kinase activity and HOOK are required for the rapid apical trafficking of micronemes as parasites initiate motility. Moreover, parasites lacking HOOK or FTS display impaired microneme protein secretion, leading to a block in the invasion of host cells. Taken together, our work provides a comprehensive catalog of CDPK1 targets and reveals how vesicular trafficking has been tuned to support a parasitic lifestyle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>host–pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd>vesicular trafficking</kwd><kwd>CDPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI144369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lourido</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI123457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>174530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Alex W</given-names></name><name><surname>Herneisen</surname><given-names>Alice L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 73-2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yifrach</surname><given-names>Eden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Israeli Council for Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yifrach</surname><given-names>Eden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive characterization of kinase-dependent phosphorylation in the human pathogen <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> identifies a trafficking adaptor complex required for virulence factor secretion and infection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. This signaling paradigm regulates an array of processes such as neurotransmitter release in neurons, hormone secretion in endocrine cells, and histamine secretion in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pang and Südhof, 2010</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis is also critical for apicomplexan parasites that are the causative agents of rampant, life-threatening diseases, including malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Havelaar et al., 2015</xref>). Central to their pathogenesis is their ability to transition from intracellular replicative stages to extracellular motile stages, which involves a unique form of cellular movement called gliding, egress from the primary host cell, and invasion into a new host. These processes are driven by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis of apicomplexan-specific membrane-bound organelles called micronemes and rhoptries.</p><p>The sequential exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries is required to promote extracellular motile stages of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>). Micronemes are localized to the parasite apex and their positioning is dependent on cortical microtubules, ultrastable filaments that polymerize down the length of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Exocytosis of microneme cargo enables host cell rupture by releasing perforin-like proteins during egress and translocation of exposed adhesins required for gliding and attachment to new host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Carruthers and Tomley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). Multiple microneme proteins, including the associated cysteine repeat modular proteins (CRMP) complex, are also required to trigger the exocytosis of rhoptries upon host cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sidik et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Singer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sparvoli et al., 2022</xref>). Rhoptry proteins include effectors that modulate host responses and transmembrane proteins that are embedded into the host plasma membrane to enable active invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bradley and Sibley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lamarque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tyler et al., 2011</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is necessary and sufficient to trigger the rapid trafficking and exocytosis of micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carruthers et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Carruthers et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Endo et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). While Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also necessary for rhoptry discharge, discharge relies on additional cellular processes such as microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Segev-Zarko et al., 2022</xref>). While the exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries is known to be critical for parasite motility, the mechanisms linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to their trafficking and fusion to the plasma membrane are still unclear.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in apicomplexans are primarily transduced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Farrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Márquez-Nogueras et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sebastian et al., 2012</xref>). CDPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that are unique to apicomplexans and plants. CDPKs are activated by directly binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) found in animals, which are indirectly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound calmodulin (CaM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wernimont et al., 2010</xref>). CDPKs are crucial for apicomplexan infection—yet are absent from mammals—making them attractive drug targets; however, their mechanisms of action are still not well understood at a cellular and molecular level. In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) is required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis of micronemes, impacting all steps of parasite motility, including egress, gliding, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>). Small-molecule competitive inhibitors of CDPK1 have been identified and have shown some activity against <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Doggett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lourido et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Winzer et al., 2015</xref>). Identifying the signaling pathways regulated by CDPK1 could reveal the pathways controlling microneme and rhoptry exocytosis.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> that activates CDPK1 and other cellular processes is released from intracellular stores following cyclic nucleotide–mediated activation of protein kinase G (PKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bisio and Soldati-Favre, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sidik et al., 2016a</xref>). This process can be artificially induced by treating parasites with cGMP specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors zaprinast or BIPPO that indirectly activate PKG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sidik et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yuasa et al., 2005</xref>). PDE inhibition activates PKG within seconds and triggers the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lipid signaling nodes controlling parasite motility, including the exocytosis of micronemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yuasa et al., 2005</xref>). The identity of the CDPK1 substrates that contribute to the regulation of microneme exocytosis remains unknown. Determining CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation is challenging because the signaling pathways controlling parasite motility are rapid and integrate signals from multiple kinases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identifying CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation with sub-minute resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimulating parasites with zaprinast triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activation of CDPK1, resulting in the secretion of microneme proteins (red) required for motile stages of the parasite.

Samples were labeled with TMTpro, pooled for analysis, and phosphopeptides were enriched using sequential metal-oxide affinity chromatography (SMOAC) prior to LC-MS/MS. Four sets of samples were generated: enriched phosphoproteomes for zaprinast [1] and DMSO [3], and proteomes for zaprinast [2] and DMSO [4].

Our comprehensive analysis of CDPK1 not only identified phosphoregulation of known factors involved in parasite motility, but also revealed new regulators of exocytosis.

To control the expression of CDPK1, we endogenously tagged the kinase with a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron (AID) for rapid conditional knockdown upon treating parasites with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brown et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). CDPK1 was robustly depleted from extracellular parasites following auxin treatment for 3.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We compared vehicle- and auxin-treated parasites at four timepoints in the 5 min following zaprinast stimulation (0, 9, 30, and 300 s) to capture the earliest changes following Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We used TMTpro labeling to multiplex 16 samples enabling analysis of a complete time course comparing vehicle- and auxin-treated parasites in biological duplicate in a single LC-MS/MS experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Samples treated with DMSO instead of zaprinast served as a control. We enriched for phosphopeptides using sequential metal-oxide affinity chromatography (SMOAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). In total, we generated four datasets: an enriched zaprinast phosphoproteome [1], a zaprinast proteome (unenriched) [2], an enriched DMSO phosphoproteome [3], and a DMSO proteome (unenriched) [4]. Of the 4255 parasite proteins quantified in the zaprinast proteome by LC-MS/MS, CDPK1 was the only protein with a greater than two-fold depletion in parasites treated with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The remainder of the proteome was largely stable (median log<sub>2</sub>-fold change = –0.002 ± 0.089 M.A.D).</p><p>We first quantified peptide abundances across time relative to the 0 s vehicle-treated time point to identify CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation, which yielded kinetic profiles of individual phosphopeptides in vehicle and auxin conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The zaprinast phosphoproteome included 2570 phosphorylated proteins, represented by 10,594 unique phosphopeptides quantified across both biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of individual phosphopeptide profiles for vehicle (AUC<sub>vehicle</sub>) and auxin (AUC<sub>auxin</sub>) conditions. To identify the subset of phosphopeptides exhibiting CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation, we calculated the difference between AUC values (AUC<sub>difference</sub>) by comparing the distribution of AUC<sub>difference</sub> values in the zaprinast phosphoproteome to a null distribution derived from the DMSO phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach allowed us to account for the variability among AUCs under conditions that did not exhibit dynamic changes. We identified 74 unique CDPK1-dependent phosphopeptides across both biological replicates (Group A), belonging to 69 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Additionally, we identified peptides that were zaprinast responsive—despite being CDPK1 independent—by comparing the distribution of AUC<sub>vehicle</sub> values in the zaprinast phosphoproteome to a null distribution derived from the DMSO phosphoproteome, resulting in 809 unique phosphopeptides representing 501 proteins. We utilized projection-based clustering to sort kinetic profiles of CDPK1-independent peptides into three groups, in which Groups B and C contained phosphopeptides that increased in abundance and Group D contained phosphopeptides that decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Thrun and Ultsch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Thrun and Ultsch, 2021</xref>). Significant changes at the peptide level are attributed to altering levels of phosphorylation as opposed to protein levels. Of the 543 proteins exhibiting zaprinast-dependent phosphorylation, 484 were quantified at the proteome level. When comparing the 300–0 s time points, zaprinast-dependent proteins displayed no significant changes (median log<sub>2</sub>-fold change = 0 ± 0.074 M.A.D). This was consistent with the rapid time scale of these experiments and the overall stability of the 4255 proteins quantified in the proteome (median log<sub>2</sub>-fold change = 0.01 ± 0.089 M.A.D).</p><p>Gene ontology analysis identified several classes of genes that may be relevant to the regulation of zaprinast responses within the different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). CDPK1-independent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was prevalent amongst proteins regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling (ACβ, GC, UGO, PDE1, PDE2, PDE7, PDE9, PDE10, and PKG), lipid signaling (PI4K, PI4P5K, PI-PLC, DGK1, and PAP1), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (CDPK2A and CDPK3). CDPK1-independent phosphorylation was also observed on downstream proteins regulating microneme exocytosis (APH and DOC2.1), rhoptry exocytosis (ARO, AIP, PL3, and NdP2), gliding motility (AKMT and MyoA), and homeostasis/biogenesis (NHE3, VHA1, NST2, and ERK7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Bullen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lourido and Moreno, 2015</xref>). MyoA phosphorylation was observed at S20 and S21, which was previously shown to be phosphorylated by CDPK3 and required for gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gaji et al., 2015</xref>). SCE1 phosphorylation was observed at S225, which was previously shown to be phosphorylated by CDPK3 and required to relieve inhibition during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">McCoy et al., 2017</xref>).

To investigate the role of myristoylation on CDPK1 function, an inducible knock-down strain (iKD) was generated by introducing a mAID-Myc tag at its C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This suggests a potential association with membranous structures or higher molecular weight complexes. We next used both the cWT and cMut lines to elucidate any myristoylation-dependent changes to CDPK1 localization. While cWT could be found predominantly in the high-speed pellet, loss of myristoylation released cMut into the high-speed supernatant confirming an association with membranous structures or larger protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the role of CDPK1 myristoylation in parasite fitness, we performed plaque assays comparing the various strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In the presence of the endogenous copy of CDPK1, both complemented lines developed normally. However, upon auxin-mediated depletion of endogenous CDPK1, cMut plaque size substantially decreased. This finding demonstrates that one or more steps of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> lytic cycle are negatively affected by the loss of CDPK1 myristoylation. In light of CDPK1’s known function, we explored whether CDPK1 myristoylation might impact the parasite’s ability to egress from host cells. In the absence of auxin, cWT, cMut, and the parental line (iKD) egressed within 2 min of ionophore stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While cWT parasites maintained similar egress kinetics following auxin treatment, cMut parasites showed a significant delay after 2 min of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This egress delay was overcome by 6 min, suggesting that CDPK1 myristoylation is important for rapid ionophore-induced egress, but not essential.</p><p>Finally, we wanted to examine whether myristoylation of CDPK1 affects its interactions with other proteins, which may occur by direct binding to the kinase or by indirect association with a shared membrane structure. We performed immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) on HA-tagged CDPK1 from cWT, cMut, and untagged TIR1 parasites to control for unspecific binding after hypotonic lysis. CDPK1 was the most significantly enriched protein across both cWT and cMut pulldowns when compared to untagged controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Fourteen other proteins were enriched at least twofold over untagged controls with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 in one or both CDPK1 pulldowns. The greatest enrichment was observed for NUP134 (TGGT1_240510), hexokinase (TGGT1_265450), and SRS36D (TGGT1_292280). Comparing the relative abundance of the 15 proteins enriched in either cWT or cMut pulldowns, we found one protein preferentially associated with cWT: the kelch-repeat containing protein TGGT1_229290 that has been linked to the 19S proteasome activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>). Two other proteins preferentially associated with cMut: IMPDH (TGGT1_233110) and a putative subunit of the 11S proteasome activator (TGGT1_224330). While none of the observed associations clearly relate to the function of CDPK1 in parasite motility or microneme discharge, the differential association of cWT and cMut with different proteasome activators suggests myristoylation may affect the choice of degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of direct CDPK1 targets through thiophosphorylation</title><p>Our phosphoproteomic time-course experiment identified proteins exhibiting CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation in live parasites, which includes direct and indirect substrates of the kinase. CDPK1 is unusual among apicomplexan and metazoan kinases in that it contains a glycine at its gatekeeper residue, resulting in an expanded ATP-binding pocket that can accommodate bulky ATP analogues. CDPK1 can use bulky analogues like <italic>N</italic>6-furfuryladenosine (kinetin)–5′-<italic>O</italic>-[3-thiotriphosphate] (KTPγS) to thiophosphorylate its substrates in parasite lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lourido et al., 2013a</xref>). Thiophosphorylated substrates can subsequently be enriched with an iodoacetyl resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blethrow et al., 2008</xref>). Specificity can be assessed by comparison to mutant parasites harboring a G128M gatekeeper mutation in CDPK1 (CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) that retains kinase activity but prevents it from using KTPγS. Previous studies using lysates identified a small set of six putative CDPK1-dependent substrates; however, these studies lost the target specificity conferred by the subcellular context and lacked the accuracy and sensitivity of quantitative proteomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lourido et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>We implemented several modifications to the thiophosphorylation procedure that improved identification of CDPK1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rothenberg et al., 2016</xref>). First, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to directly compare thiophosphorylation in WT (CDPK1<sup>G</sup>) and mutant (CDPK1<sup>M</sup>) parasites. Second, we used parasites semi-permeabilized with the bacterial toxin aerolysin—as opposed to the preparations of detergent-lysed parasites used in prior methods. Aerolysin forms 3 nm pores in the plasma membrane which permit the diffusion of small molecules but not proteins, enabling us to perform labeling reactions without drastically disrupting the concentration or localization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Iacovache et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, we prevented non-specific extracellular substrate labeling due to premature lysis by treating semi-permeabilized parasites with 1B7, a nanobody that allosterically inhibits CDPK1 but does not enter the cytosol of semi-permeabilized parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ingram et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identifying the direct substrates of CDPK1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic describing a strategy to identify direct substrates of CDPK1.

Extracellular parasites were semi-permeabilized with aerolysin, enabling diffusion of small molecules but not proteins. CDPK1 substrate labeling was initiated by treating semi-permeabilized parasites with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, KTPγS, ATP, and 1B7. While CDPK1 in both WT and mutant parasites can utilize ATP to phosphorylate substrates, only WT parasites can use KTPγS to thiophosphorylate substrates.

We assessed thiophosphorylation labeling by immunoblot, identifying an array of proteins specifically labeled in CDPK1<sup>G</sup>, but not CDPK1<sup>M</sup> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). MS analyses quantified the abundance of peptides in CDPK1<sup>G</sup> relative to CDPK1<sup>M</sup> parasites, identifying 734 unique peptides across three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Samples from CDPK1<sup>G</sup> parasites were significantly enriched in phosphorylated peptides, consistent with CDPK1-mediated thiophosphorylation of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In total, 123 peptides across 104 proteins were likely direct substrates of CDPK1. GO enrichment analysis did not reveal any pathways relevant to the function of CDPK1 in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). While our approach largely maintains kinases in their subcellular context, aerolysin treatment disrupts native ion concentrations and may detach the plasma membrane from the inner membrane complex (IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wichroski et al., 2002</xref>). We determined that CDPK1 localization remains unaltered upon aerolysin treatment, indicating that subcellular partitioning of CDPK1 is not affected by permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We proceeded to consider the thiophosphorylated substrates in the context of the time-resolved phosphoproteomics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CDPK1 targets participate in pathways controlling parasite motility</title><p>Considering the thiophosphorylation and time-resolved phosphoproteomics, we arrived at a prioritization scheme to identify 163 proteins phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Proteins were divided into five classes based on the overlap of phosphorylated sites between both approaches. Class I contains five proteins for which the same phosphorylated site was identified in both the time-course and thiophosphorylation experiments and includes TGGT1_227610, TGGT1_221470, TGGT1_235160, TGGT1_273560 (KinesinB), and TGGT1_310060. Class II contains four proteins for which phosphorylated sites identified across both approaches were within 50 amino acid residues of one another and includes TGGT1_289100 (MIC18), TGGT1_309190 (AIP), TGGT1_254870, and TGGT1_259630. Class III contains two proteins that were enriched by thiophosphorylation and were also CDPK1-dependent in the time course, but the identified sites were more than 50 residues apart. Class IV contains 93 proteins that were exclusively enriched by thiophosphorylation. Lastly, class V contains 59 proteins that were CDPK1-dependent exclusively in the time course and are likely indirect targets of the kinase. Proteins within each class were further stratified by fitness scores reported from genome-wide knockout screens, with lower scores representing genes more essential for parasite fitness in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). Of the 163 targets of CDPK1, 72 proteins across all classes also displayed changes in zaprinast-dependent phosphorylation at distinct sites that were independent of CDPK1. This overlap suggests that some proteins modified by CDPK1 are also regulated by additional kinases and phosphatases.</p><p>We hypothesized that regulators of exocytosis would be found among the targets of CDPK1. Of the 163 protein targets, 38 have been previously localized and/or functionally characterized (indicated with asterisks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Of these 38 proteins, 13 have been implicated in regulating motile stages of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the candidates associated with microneme exocytosis, centrin 2 (CEN2) and RNG2 have previously been localized to tubulin-based structures in the apical complex of the parasite, and their knockdown is sufficient to inhibit secretion of microneme proteins and block host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Katris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Leung et al., 2019</xref>). Candidates associated with rhoptry exocytosis include the armadillo repeats only protein (ARO), ARO-interacting protein (AIP), palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC7, and patatin-like phospholipase (PL3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>). ARO and DHHC7 both localize to the cytosolic face of rhoptries, where they influence the recruitment of AIP and ACβ. Knockdown of either DHHC7 or ARO disrupts the localization of mature rhoptries, inhibiting the secretion of rhoptry proteins required for invasion. Another potential CDPK1 target, the apical complex lysine methyltransferase (AKMT), rapidly relocalizes from the apical complex to the parasite body during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated motility, and its knockdown impairs the gliding motility of parasites required for invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Heaslip et al., 2011</xref>). Other putative CDPK1 targets participate in homeostasis and biogenesis of secretory organelles, such as the vacuolar type Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE3), dynamin-related protein B (DrpB), V-ATPase a1 (VHA1), and GDP-fucose transporter (NST2). NHE3-knockout parasites exhibit sensitivity to osmotic shock and dysregulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in reduced secretion of microneme proteins and an inhibition of invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Francia et al., 2011</xref>). DrpB was previously identified as a CDPK1 target, and its depletion results in severe defects in the biogenesis of micronemes and rhoptries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breinich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lourido et al., 2013a</xref>). VHA1 and NST2 participate in the maturation of microneme and rhoptry proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Stasic et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, signaling proteins regulating intracellular cGMP levels, such as the guanylate cyclase (GC) and the unique GC organizer (UGO), were also phosphorylated in a CDPK1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brown et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Brown and Sibley, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). CDPK1 acts downstream of GC-mediated production of cGMP, which may suggest regulatory feedback on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, as has been suggested for CDPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). These data demonstrate that identification of CDPK1 targets can uncover proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis.</p><p>To identify new factors involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated secretion, we prioritized class I and II candidates. Seven candidates in this category lack functional annotation or have been associated with apical structures: TGGT1_227610, TGGT1_221470, TGGT1_235160, TGGT1_254870, KinesinB (TGGT1_273560), a small nuclease (TGGT1_310060), and TGGT1_289100 (MIC18). TGGT1_221470 was previously identified as a CDPK1 substrate after a pulldown from parasite lysates but remained functionally uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lourido et al., 2013a</xref>). KinesinB localizes to cortical microtubules, TGGT1_254870 localizes to the apical complex, and TGGT1_289100 co-localizes with micronemes, each of which are parasite structures relevant to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Long et al., 2017</xref>). Of these candidates, only TGGT1_227610 and TGGT1_289100 appear to be required for parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Long et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>).

HOOK was depleted from parasites following 24–40 hr of auxin treatment, as determined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In contrast to previous observations that localized HOOK to micronemes, we observed only partial co-localization with micronemes with a majority of HOOK localized to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Plaque formation was impaired when AID-HOOK parasites were grown in the presence of auxin, consistent with the strong effect on parasite fitness reported from genome-wide knockout screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). These results indicate that HOOK is required during the acute stages of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Parasite replication was not affected following 24 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

These data suggest HOOK functions during stages associated with parasite motility, such as parasite invasion and egress. Parasites depleted of HOOK displayed reduced invasion efficiency, consistent with that of CDPK1-depleted parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We noted that even in the absence of auxin treatment AID-HOOK parasites required longer incubations to reach comparable levels of invasion to wildtype, suggesting that manipulation of the N terminus partially affects HOOK function.</p><p>HOOK depletion only partially recapitulates the effects of CDPK1 loss. Parasites depleted of CDPK1 were unable to egress—as documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>)—whereas depletion of HOOK had no effect on parasite egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, we also examined whether the stability of CDPK1 affected HOOK expression by tagging the C terminus of HOOK with a 3xHA tag in CDPK1 cKD parasites (HOOK-3xHA). HOOK localization and abundance was unaffected by depleting parasites of CDPK1 for 24 hr as determined by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that HOOK is required for invasion of host cells, but is dispensable for egress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HOOK forms a complex that regulates parasite invasion</title><p>Opisthokont HOOK proteins function in complexes to activate dynein-mediated trafficking of vesicular cargo along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mammals, HOOK proteins form dimers and bind Fused Toes (FTS) and FTS and HOOK-interacting protein (FHIP) via a C-terminal region that interacts with vesicular cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Krämer and Phistry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). To identify analogous binding partners of HOOK in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we performed IP-MS on lysates from HOOK-3xHA parasites and an untagged control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Three proteins showed comparable enrichment to HOOK-3xHA: TGGT1_264050, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920. Like FTS, TGGT1_264050 bears homology to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, but lacks the catalytic cysteine required for enzymatic activity at position 162. Because of these shared features and their homology, we designated TGGT1_264050 as FTS.</p><p>To confirm that FTS forms a complex with HOOK, we investigated its localization and performed reciprocal IPs. We fused a 3xHA tag to the C terminus of FTS and performed IP-MS on the FTS-3xHA parasite lysates and compared protein enrichment to the HOOK-3xHA IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Four proteins were significantly enriched in the reciprocal IP experiments—HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920—confirming the four-member complex. We also observed a similar localization to HOOK by immunofluorescence: primarily cytosolic with partial overlap with micronemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To further confirm the interaction, we fused a 3xHA tag to the C terminus of TGGT1_306920, performed IP-MS and compared protein enrichment to the HOOK-3xHA IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). HOOK, FTS, and TGGT1_306920 were significantly enriched across both IP-MS experiments, whereas TGGT1_316650 is only significantly enriched in HOOK and FTS pulldowns. This suggests the presence of multiple HOOK complexes composed of the core HOOK and FTS proteins that bind with either TGGT1_316650 or TGGT1_306920.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The HOOK complex is required for microneme exocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reciprocal IP-MS of HOOK-3xHA and FTS-3xHA.

As a control, we used parasites expressing a cytosolic mNeonGreen-TurboID that would broadly label cytosolic proteins and identify non-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Of the 14 proteins significantly enriched in FTS-TurboID parasites, members of the HOOK complex (HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_306920, and TGGT1_316650) were the top four most enriched proteins. In humans, proximity labeling studies suggest FTS and FHIP bind at the C terminus of the HOOK dimer to mediate FHIP binding to RAB5 endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>). Our FTS proximity labeling results suggest that TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650 may also bind in this manner. Among the other significantly enriched proteins, PC and ACC1 encode carboxylases known to be covalently modified by biotin and likely represent non-specific enrichment. DHFR enrichment is likely due to its use as a selectable marker when generating the FTS-TurboID strain. TGGT1_294610 and TGGT1_280770 are a putative histone lysine methyltransferase and regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1)-repeat containing protein, respectively, and have no characterized functions. Of the remaining enriched proteins that lack annotations, TGGT1_221180 was previously localized to micronemes by spatial proteomics and contains a transmembrane domain, suggesting a molecular link between the HOOK complex and micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barylyuk et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The HOOK complex promotes invasion by regulating microneme exocytosis</title><p>To determine whether the HOOK complex is required for microneme exocytosis, we directly measured secretion of the microneme protein MIC2. Microneme exocytosis exposes integral membrane proteins like MIC2 that function as adhesins during gliding motility. These adhesins subsequently undergo proteolytic cleavage and are released into the supernatant, which can be analyzed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Carruthers et al., 2000</xref>). Quantification of the proportion of secreted MIC2 was performed by generating a standard curve from unstimulated lysates. Strikingly, parasites depleted of either member of the HOOK complex were severely impaired in their ability to secrete microneme proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Inhibition of the complex led to a similar degree of secretion impairment as CDPK1 depletion. Together, these data suggest that HOOK and FTS form a functional complex that is required for microneme exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Microneme trafficking depends on CDPK1 activity and HOOK</title><p>If the HOOK complex is required for sustained microneme exocytosis, then depletion of HOOK would inhibit trafficking of micronemes during parasite motility. Dynamic relocalization of micronemes can be visualized using live microscopy of parasites expressing the integral microneme protein CLAMP fused to mNeonGreen (CLAMP-mNG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). To trigger microneme exocytosis, parasites are treated with zaprinast to stimulate a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activate CDPK1. Dynamic relocalization of micronemes is defined as the CLAMP-mNG signal that concentrates at the apical end of the parasite over time. To quantify microneme relocalization, mNG signal is measured, over time, along the apical-basal axis of individual parasites within a vacuole. We scored microneme relocalization by calculating the difference in maximum apical intensity comparing the instant of zaprinast addition to the time point just prior to parasite egress of the uninhibited zaprinast-stimulated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CDPK1 activity and HOOK are required for microneme trafficking during parasite motility stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic to analyze microneme trafficking during parasite motile stages.

We fused an mNG reporter to the C terminus of CLAMP in AID-HOOK parasites and TIR1 parasites as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We treated parasites with auxin for 24 hr prior to stimulation with zaprinast. Microneme relocalization was unaffected in TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites treated with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>).

We attributed the lack of relocalization in vehicle-treated parasites to the hypomorphism resulting from N-terminal tagging, which is consistent with the delayed invasion and reduced plaque size documented for this strain. To determine whether vehicle-treated AID-HOOK parasites relocalized micronemes over longer periods, we examined CLAMP-mNG localization in extracellular parasites after egress. While vehicle-treated AID-HOOK parasites were able to relocalize micronemes, parasites depleted of HOOK exhibited micronemes dispersed throughout the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). As expected, TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites maintained the apical relocalization of micronemes regardless of auxin treatment in extracellular parasites. We used an alternative metric for microneme relocalization to account for the disorganized localization of micronemes in parasites depleted of HOOK. We quantified the percent of the total CLAMP-mNG signal localized to the apical end versus the remaining body of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). The apical region cutoffs were experimentally derived from vehicle-treated TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites and defined as the apical 12.5% of the parasite. While a majority of CLAMP-mNG signal was localized to the apical region of TIR1/CLAMP-mNG parasites, most of the CLAMP-mNG signal observed in parasites depleted of HOOK was found in the parasite body. Micronemes rapidly adopt an aberrant localization in the absence of HOOK during parasite motility.

Additionally, quantification and coverage by mass spectrometry were improved through TMTpro multiplexing and ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We also improved on the low coverage observed in previous thiophosphorylation experiments with parasite lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lourido et al., 2013a</xref>) by maintaining a more native signaling environment using aerolysin semi-permeabilization, SILAC-based peptide quantification, and shortened labeling times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rothenberg et al., 2016</xref>). These approaches characterize proteome-wide phosphorylation kinetics in live parasites and reveal direct kinase–substrate relationships for CDPK1.</p><p>We observed that myristoylation of CDPK1 contributes to its function. Contrary to previous reports describing the kinase as cytosolic or nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pomel et al., 2008</xref>), we demonstrate that myristoylated CDPK1 is at least partially associated with structures that can be fractionated from the cytoplasm by differential centrifugation. Loss of myristoylation led to CDPK1 release from the insoluble fraction. The ortholog of CDPK1 in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, <italic>Pb</italic>CDPK4, also displays myristoylation-specific functions during male gametogenesis: myristoylated <italic>Pb</italic>CDPK4 is critical for the first genome replication, whereas the non-myristoylated <italic>Pb</italic>CDPK4 is important for the completion of gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). Myristoylation could impact CDPK1’s ability to access certain targets efficiently. However, such interactions appear to be too weak or transient to be captured by immunoprecipitation. Mutating the myristoylation site of CDPK1 only modestly affected ionophore-induced egress. However, minor effects in these key transitions may be magnified over repeated lytic cycles, which could explain the more substantial impact of losing CDPK1 myristoylation on plaque formation. Alternatively, other kinases may compensate for decreased CDPK1 activity, particularly under hyperactivated conditions like stimulated egress. A plausible candidate for compensation is CDPK2A, which also appears to be myristoylated and was recently shown to display epistatic interactions with CDPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Broncel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>CDPK1 plays a critical role in the transition from the replicative intracellular stages to motile extracellular stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>). During this transition, parasites must execute rapid cellular changes that involve the exocytosis of micronemes and rhoptries, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, gliding motility, and maintenance of ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blader et al., 2016</xref>). CDPK1 has also been suggested to control the actomyosin system and extrusion of the conoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Our detailed target analysis suggests CDPK1 regulates—and possibly helps coordinate—multiple pathways. We revealed over a hundred CDPK1 targets with diverse predicted functions, including many relevant to phenotypes dependent on CDPK1. In addition to the effects on microneme trafficking, our results point to a direct link between CDPK1 and rhoptry exocytosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been implicated in rhoptry discharge, as the rhoptry-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding FER2 is required for rhoptry exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a preponderance of CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation on proteins regulating rhoptry exocytosis, including DHHC7, ARO, and AIP. Phosphorylation on ARO was observed near the N-terminal acylation sites required for rhoptry targeting and may regulate the bundling and positioning of mature rhoptries during motile stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>). However, formally demonstrating the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CDPK1 and rhoptry discharge is complicated by the dependency of the latter on the secretion of certain microneme proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Chaabene et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites have several rhoptries, yet only two are docked for exocytosis at a given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aquilini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mageswaran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Segev-Zarko et al., 2022</xref>). Regulating the activity of ARO during motile stages may influence the ability to mobilize and re-dock rhoptries in preparation for invasion. Considering how different CDPK1 substrates function, we expect the various phenotypes associated with CDPK1 will depend on distinct sets of substrates.</p><p>Although CDPK1 is known to mediate microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>), the precise molecular events controlling this process have remained elusive. In this study, we determined that CDPK1 activity is required for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated trafficking of micronemes to the apical end. This phenotype depends on HOOK, one of the CDPK1 targets uncovered by both global phosphoproteomics and thiophosphorylation studies. Despite prior annotation as a microneme protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Butler et al., 2014</xref>), HOOK likely functions as an activating adaptor in <italic>T. gondii</italic> based on homology to other Hook proteins and the functional characterization we have performed. Phosphorylation has been reported to regulate the function of activating adaptors. In HeLa cells, phosphorylation of BICD2 facilitates recruitment of dynein and dynactin (Gallisà-Suñé et al. 2023). Analogously, phosphorylation of JIP1 mediates the switch between kinesin and dynein motility of autophagosomes in murine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore speculate that phosphorylation of HOOK by CDPK1 may activate the adaptor by promoting its interaction with dynein and dynactin to initiate trafficking of micronemes.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation of HOOK identified three interacting proteins: FTS, TGGT_316650, and TGGT1_306920. In <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Hook proteins complex with FTS and FHIP (the FHF complex), to link cargo to the dynein machinery for trafficking along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). FHF complexes have been shown to recognize early endosomes via FHIP binding to RAB5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Homology to FHIP was lacking in TGGT1_316650 and TGGT1_306920. However, genome-wide knockout screens indicate TGGT1_306920 is critical for parasite fitness, leading us to speculate that it may mediate cargo binding in a manner structurally distinct from known adaptors. Additional work will be needed to elucidate the function of the HOOK complex and to understand how it mediates trafficking of apicomplexan-specific organelles.</p><p>Our results place the HOOK complex downstream of CDPK1, regulating the stimulated relocalization of micronemes to the apical end of parasites. However, the HOOK complex only partially explains CDPK1’s role during egress. Whereas CDPK1 depletion blocks egress entirely, parasites depleted of HOOK or FTS exit host cells, despite subsequent defects in microneme secretion and invasion. Microneme discharge is required for egress, supplying adhesins for gliding motility and the perforin PLP1 to rupture the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kafsack et al., 2009</xref>). It therefore appears that the initial round of microneme discharge during egress depends on CDPK1, and only subsequent rounds require the HOOK complex. Indeed, a fraction of micronemes are already found docked at the apical complex prior to the transition from the replicative to the motile stages, and may constitute the first round of microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mageswaran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). Ferlin 1 (FER1) was recently shown to be involved in microneme positioning and overexpression of FER1 was sufficient to initiate an initial round of microneme exocytosis and induce egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tagoe et al., 2020</xref>). Dynein-mediated trafficking might become important immediately following egress when continuous microneme discharge is necessary, as is the case during gliding motility and invasion. Consistent with this hypothesis, depletion of the dynein light chain 8a (DLC8a) yielded similar phenotypes to HOOK and FTS knockdown: intact egress but dysfunctional microneme protein secretion, gliding motility, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of DLC8a also led to defects in rhoptry positioning, which were not observed in HOOK knockdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>), so other activating adaptors may be involved in rhoptry trafficking. Our results suggest that the HOOK complex has been specifically adapted for microneme trafficking in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>Several aspects of microneme trafficking remain to be determined. The precise nature of the dynein complex is poorly understood. Eukaryotes typically express a single cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, TGGT1_294550 is the top candidate for the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DHC) as it contains the necessary domains, is conserved among apicomplexans, and is required for parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lentini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). Other putative DHCs in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome are likely axonemal dyneins required for flagellar function in sexual-stage parasites. Two putative plus-end motors have been characterized in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. KinesinA localizes to the apical polar ring where cortical microtubules emanate from and is required for ring stability and parasite motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Leung et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, KinesinB localizes to the distal two-thirds of the cortical microtubules but is dispensable for the lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Leung et al., 2017</xref>). Motile parasites depleted of HOOK mislocalized micronemes to the distal two-thirds of the cortical microtubules. We hypothesize that KinesinB, which is also a target of CDPK1, may maintain the association between micronemes and microtubules in the absence of HOOK. It also remains unknown how the HOOK complex binds to micronemes. In <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, RAB5 on vesicles interacts with FHIP in the HOOK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that TGGT1_306920 may serve the role of FHIP within the HOOK complex as it is fitness conferring, whereas TGGT1_316650 appears dispensable but the complex’s binding partner on micronemes remains unknown. RAB5A and RAB5C have been implicated in the biogenesis of micronemes, but their roles during exocytosis have not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kremer et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how micronemes are recognized may elucidate how cargo specificity is achieved and regulated.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been tuned to support apicomplexan-specific cellular processes but identifying and integrating effectors within the pathway has remained a major bottleneck. Signaling effectors conserved amongst eukaryotes are often integrated into apicomplexan cellular pathways in novel or unusual ways. Here, we identified candidate downstream effectors of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated kinase CDPK1 by monitoring proteome-wide protein phosphorylation. In addition to creating a catalog of candidates for future characterization, we identified, characterized, and integrated the HOOK complex downstream of CDPK1 within the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling network controlling microneme exocytosis. Lastly, our results are the first to implicate activating adaptors as critical factors for the pathogenesis of an apicomplexan organism by promoting exocytic trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs, ATCC SRC-1041) maintained in DMEM (GIBCO 11965118) supplemented with 3% inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 µg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), referred to as media.

Label-free quantification of proteins was performed using summed abundances from unique peptides. Abundances were normalized on the total peptide amount. Pairwise ratios were calculated for protein abundances comparing strains and conditions. Significance values were derived from <italic>t</italic>-tests across three replicates and adjusted with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Exported protein abundance files from Proteome Discoverer 2.4 were loaded into R (version 4.1.1). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) with the dataset identifier PXD039434 (10.6019/PXD039434).

Parasites were resuspended at a concentration of 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> parasites/mL in cold DMEM. 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> parasites were aliquoted into round-bottom 96-well plates. An additional aliquot of parasites was lysed in 5× Laemmli sample buffer (see ‘Immunoblotting’ for recipe) to obtain the total parasite lysate used to determine total MIC2 levels. Secretion was stimulated in plates with IFS and ethanol in DMEM (final concentration 3% IFS and 1% ethanol) or a vehicle solution of DMEM. Plates were incubated by floating on a water bath at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 90 min. Plates were spun at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C to separate parasites from secreted proteins. Supernatants were transferred to a new well and spun again. The final supernatant was mixed with a 5× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled at 95°C for 10 min, and stored at –20°C along with total lysates until immunoblot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-2"><title>Immunoblot analysis and quantification</title><p>To quantify MIC2 protein levels, a standard curve derived from the total parasite lysate was generated alongside supernatants containing secreted microneme proteins. The standard curve was derived from threefold serial dilutions of the total parasite lysate (undiluted, 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27) in a 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The serial dilutions and supernatants of auxin- and vehicle-treated parasites of a single strain were loaded onto the same precast 4–15% gel (Bio-Rad). Subsequent immunoblotting steps were performed as described in ‘Immunoblotting.’ Anti-MIC2 was used to detect total and secreted MIC2 proteins. Secreted MIC2 proteins have a lower molecular weight due to parasite-mediated proteolytic cleavage. Anti-CDPK1 was used as a loading control for total parasite lysate and to reveal any parasite lysis or carry over in the supernatant. Immunoblots confirming the depletion of tagged proteins were also collected. Imaging was performed on a LI-COR Odyssey at high resolution for quantification.</p><p>Immunoblot quantification was performed in Fiji on unadjusted inverted images. For a single immunoblot, lane profiles of uniform dimensions were generated for MIC2 signal. Background-subtracted signal intensity was measured as an area using the line and wand tool. A standard curve was derived from the quantified MIC2 signal of the dilution series. Standard curves across all conditions and replicates had <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> values &gt;0.90. Secreted MIC2 signals were within the linear range of the standard curve and were used to calculate the percent of total MIC2 secreted. Results are representative of three independent experiments for each parasite strain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Microneme relocalization</title><p>Parasites expressing the CLAMP-mNG reporter were grown in HFFs in glass-bottomed 35 mm dishes (Ibidi and Mattek) for approximately 20 hr. For 3-MB-PP1 treatment, media was exchanged 30 min prior to live microscopy for 3% IFS in Ringer’s buffer (155 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) containing either 3 µM 3-MB-PP1 or vehicle solution of DMSO. At approximately 1 min after beginning live microscopy, parasites were stimulated with zaprinast (500 µM final concentration) or a vehicle solution of DMSO in corresponding Ringer’s buffer. For TIR1/CLAMP-mNG and AID-HOOK/CLAMP-mNG parasite, media was exchanged 2 hr after infection for 10% IFS media containing either 50 µM auxin or vehicle solution of PBS. Media was exchanged for 3% IFS in Ringer’s buffer just prior to live microscopy. At approximately 30 s after beginning live microscopy, parasites were stimulated with zaprinast (500 µM final concentration) or a vehicle solution of DMSO in corresponding Ringer’s buffer. Images were recorded every 5–7 s until egress or approximately 5 min using a Nikon Ti Eclipse with an enclosure maintained at 37°C.</p><p>Microneme relocalization was quantified using built-in commands from ImageJ (v. 1.53e). To determine the distribution of fluorescent micronemes at a specific time frame, a line was drawn from the parasite’s apical end to its basal end. The ‘plot profile’ command was applied to this line to calculate fluorescence intensity at regularly spaced intervals (0.13 microns) across the parasite on unadjusted images. This process was repeated for each time frame of interest and for each parasite in the analyzed vacuole. Regression analysis was performed on relocalization data from each time frame, resulting in logarithmic regression plots that display how fluorescence intensity correlates with distance from the parasite’s apical end. Microneme relocalization is shown as SuperPlots to simultaneously visualize the median relocalization of an entire vacuole and the relocalization of individual parasites within each vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lord et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Microneme localization in extracellular parasites</title><p>Microneme localization in extracellular parasites was quantified using a custom-built, image analysis pipeline. ImageJ’s built-in commands were used to measure the length of the parasite’s major axis. Based on the patterns of vehicle-treated TIR1/CLAMP-mNG data, 1/8th of the parasite closest to the apical end was deemed the apical region. The remaining region was deemed the body. Using the Interactive Learning and Segmentation Toolkit (ilastik v. 1.3.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>), the apical region and body of parasites were isolated from each other and from the surrounding media. Ilastik’s pixel and object quantification tools were then used to determine the total intensity of fluorescence in each of these regions. Comparing these values to each other yielded the percentage of fluorescent micronemes present in each of these sections in relation to the total fluorescence present in the parasite. This process was repeated for several extracellular parasites in each of the conditions tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM)</title><p>U-ExM of extracellular <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dos Santos Pacheco and Soldati-Favre, 2021</xref>). In short, TIR1 and TIR1/AID-HOOK strains were either treated with 50 µM auxin or a vehicle of 1× PBS for 40 hr. Naturally egressed parasites diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> parasites/mL were let settle for 10 min on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Life Technologies A3890401). Then, a molecular ‘anchor’ was added to cellular proteins by incubating the coverslips in a solution containing 1.4% formaldehyde (Sigma F8775) and 2% acrylamide (Sigma A4058) in 1× PBS for 5 hr at 37°C. Next, samples were infused with a gel (19% Sodium Acrylate [AK Scientific R624], 10% acrylamide [Sigma A4058], 0.1% N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide [BIS, Sigma M1533], 0.5% tetramethylethylenediamine [TEMED, Sigma T9281], and 0.5% ammonium persulfate [A3678 Sigma] in PBS) for 1 hr at 37°C. The gel mesh is crosslinked to the ‘anchors’ from the previous step. To enable proper cell expansion, the samples were denatured for 1.5 hr at 95°C in a denaturation buffer containing 200 mM SDS (Invitrogen AM9820), 200 mM NaCl, and 50 mM TRIS-Base at pH 9. The gels are then expanded in water, shrunk in PBS, incubated with antibodies diluted in 2% BSA in PBS, and then expanded again in water. Primary antibodies were anti-Acetyl Tubulin (Lys40) (1:1000, 3 hr; Sigma ABT24) and anti-MIC2 (1:1000, 3 hr; 6D10). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 (1:750, 2 hr; Invitrogen A11008) and Alexa Fluor 488 (1:750, 2 hr; Invitrogen A11005). Antibodies were incubated with agitation at 37°C. Finally, the gels were put on a 35 mm microscopy dish (MatTek Life Sciences), parasites facing down. Images were acquired by Zeiss SLM 980 microscope using the Airyscan super-resolution mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Image analysis of U-ExM</title><p>Between 14 and 18 microscopy images per condition were analyzed using Imaris software (release 9.9). Images, each containing one cell, were converted to Imaris files using the standalone ImarisFileConverter software. To automatically detect the extruded conoid and tubulin filaments of each cell, the FilamentTracer Wizard was trained on a few images to identify the conoid as ‘Soma’ and tubulin filaments as ‘Dendrites.’ Micronemes were automatically detected using the ‘Spots’ Wizard. To apply the same mask parameters to all images, the Batch Wizard was used. As some images contained cropped parts of neighboring cells, manual adjustments to the mask were applied to include or exclude specific conoid, tubulin, or micronemes that did not belong to the analyzed cell. To export statistics that include the ‘spots shortest distance to surface’ parameter, both the conoid and tubulin masks were converted to regular surfaces (i.e., not ‘soma’ and ‘dendrites’) by creating new channels based on their masks and applying new surface masks on these new channels. Overall, each image contained the following mask objects: micronemes as Spots, tubulin as Surface 1, and the conoid as Surface 2. Then, statistics parameters were exported, including Spots shortest distance from Surface 1, Spots shortest distance from Surface 2, Spots number per cell, and Spots center intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>All mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository.

Using these approaches TgCDPK1 was demonstrated to affect microneme secretion via a direct interaction with a HOOK complex (defined as a HOOK protein TGG1_289100, an FTS TGGT1_264050 and 2 other proteins TGGT1_316650 and 306920).</p><p>This work is carefully controlled and the analysis pathways are logical and provide paradigms for how to approach the question of identifying substrates of kinases using proteomic approaches employing genetic and chemical strategies.</p><p>The authors succeeded in the identification of candidate substrates for TgCDPK1.

Micronemes are apicomplexan-specific organelles localized at the apical end of the parasite and depending on cortical microtubules. Micronemes contain proteins that are exocytosed in a Ca²+-dependent manner and are required for <italic>T. gondii</italic> egress, motility, and host-cell invasion. In Apicomplexa, Ca²+ signaling is dependent on Ca²+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). CDPK1 has been demonstrated to be essential for Ca²+-stimulated micronemes exocytosis allowing parasite egress, gliding motility, and invasion. It is also known that intracellular calcium storages are mobilized following a cyclic nucleotide-mediated activation of protein kinase G. This step, occurs upstream of CDPK1 functions. However, the exact signaling pathway regulated by CDPK1 remains unknown. In this paper, the authors used phosphoproteomic analysis to identify new proteins phosphorylated by CDPK1. They demonstrated that CDPK1 activity is required for calcium-stimulated trafficking of micronemes to the apical end, depending on a complex of proteins that include HOOK and FTS, which are known to link cargo to the dynein machinery for trafficking along microtubules. Overall, the authors identified evidence for a new protein complex involved in microneme trafficking through the exocytosis process for which circumstantial evidence of its functionality is demonstrated here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85654.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Alex W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Broncel</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yifrach</surname><given-names>Eden</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Haseley</surname><given-names>Nicole R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chakladar</surname><given-names>Sundeep</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Andree</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Herneisen</surname><given-names>Alice L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shortt</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Francis Crick Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lourido</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and positive evaluation of our work. Below, we have addressed all of the essential revisions and provide point-by-point responses to all of the reviewer comments. Additionally, we include with this resubmission quantification microneme localization, determined by expansion microscopy, which further validates the central role of HOOK in microneme trafficking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Suggested revisions:</bold></p><p>1. Please confirm the interaction between CDPK1 and ROM4 by reciprocal IP.</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by the reviewers suggestions we examined more closely the pulldowns of WT and myristoylation-deficient CDPK1 (cMut). ROM4 had been identified as differentially enriched in the cMut pulldown; however, upon closer examination we realized that the abundance of ROM4 is actually even greater in the untagged control and therefore likely a variable contaminant in the pulldowns. We have re-analyzed the results of those pulldowns to focus on proteins significantly enriched in association with either WT or cMut CDPK1, relative to untagged controls. Among this set of 16 enriched proteins, only three proteins appeared differentially enriched between WT and cMut. None of the proteins associated with CDPK1 inform pathways related to parasite motility and were therefore not pursued further in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please compare the expression of the tagged and complemented (cWT and cMut) CDPK1 with the endogenous expression of the non-tagged and non-complemented gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared expression levels of CDPK1 using immunoblot with an anti-CDPK1 antibody comparing TIR1, CDPK1-AID, cWT and cMut parasites, which we have included in panel G of Figure 2–figure supplement 1. Endogenous AID tagging of CDPK1 resulted in a decrease in the abundance of CDPK1. cWT and cMut complementation result in similar expression levels to the AID-tagged iKD CDPK1, albeit the cMut complement has marginally higher expression. Since CDPK1 is essential for the lytic cycle, insufficient levels of the cWT expression would have displayed defects in our plaque assays. We have updated our results to reflect this new data:</p><p>“Additionally, we compared endogenous CDPK1 expression to mAID-tagged, cWT, and cMut strain (Figure 2–figure supplement 1). Introduction of a mAID tag to CDPK1 led to a reduction in CDPK1 levels, but these levels were equivalent to complementation products in cWT and cMut parasites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please attempt to confirm that aerolysin treatment does not impact myristoylation-dependent subcellular partitioning of CDPK1.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinase activity in aerolysin-treated parasites was unaffected by the 1B7 inhibitory nanobody, demonstrating that parasites remain impermeable to proteins as small as 15 kDa. Furthermore, we localize CDPK1 by immunofluorescence in aerolysin-treated parasites to show that the localization of CDPK1 is indistinguishable from that of vehicle-treated parasites, suggesting that overall CDPK1 localization is unaffected by aerolysin treatment. We include this data in panel B in Figure 3–figure supplement 1. Nevertheless, in the manuscript we discuss the limitations of the thiophosphorylation experiment:</p><p>“While our approach largely maintains kinases in their subcellular context, aerolysin treatment disrupts native ion concentrations and detaches the plasma membrane from the inner membrane complex (IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wichroski et al., 2002</xref>).”</p><p>Because of these limitations we rely on the overlap of CDPK1-dependent targets between our thiophosphorylation and time course experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please confirm the interaction of TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650 with the HOOK and FTS proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this suggestion, we tagged the C termini of TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650 with 3xHA epitopes. Although immunoprecipitation of TGGT1_316650 was unsuccessful, immunoprecipitation of TGGT1_306920 identified HOOK and FTS as significantly enriched proteins. We include this new data in panel C of Figure 5 and have updated our results:</p><p>“To further confirm the interaction, we fused a 3xHA tag to the C terminus of TGGT1_306920, performed IP-MS and compared protein enrichment to the HOOK-3xHA IP (Figure 5C). HOOK, FTS, and TGGT1_306920 were significantly enriched across both IP-MS experiments, whereas TGGT1_316650 is only significantly enriched in HOOK and FTS pulldowns. This suggests the presence of multiple HOOK complexes composed of the core HOOK and FTS proteins that bind with either TGGT1_316650 or TGGT1_306920.”</p><p>While further interactions with other members of the complex still need to be validated it is not the standard of the field to validate every member of a protein complex by reciprocal IP. Our HOOK and FTS IP-MS results each identified HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_306920, and TGGT1_316650 and our TGGT1_306920 IP-MS identified all members except TGGT1_316650. These interaction partners were found significantly enriched compared to parental controls, which make the observation of the complex robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have only a few minor comments:</p><p>1. In the supplemental data section I would include a document of code ( R script) used for the analysis. If this is too cumbersome then I would instead suggest that like done with proteomic data, the code should be deposited in a database that provides a DOI for access, instead of only being provided on request. This can be done by use of an electronic laboratory notebook or via Github.com or a similar service.</p></disp-quote><p>Zip files containing R code and CSVs have been included for the sub-minute resolution phosphoproteomics (Supplementary File 11) and thiophosphorylation (Supplementary File 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would be useful to expand the discussion of the other 2 proteins identified in the HOOK complex TGGT1_316650 and 306920. Do these have homologs to proteins in other organisms? Based on HOOK in other eukaryotes can you provide a model of the 4 proteins in the complex that you identified? Was any work done on 316650 and 306920 with regards to genetic KO or auxin regulation to see if they also provided a similar phenotype to what was described with HOOK and FTS?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following information in our discussion:</p><p>“It also remains unknown how the HOOK complex binds to micronemes. In H. sapiens and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, RAB5 on vesicles interacts with FHIP in the HOOK complex (Bielska et al., 2014; Gillingham et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2014). We speculate that TGGT1_306920 may serve the role of FHIP within the HOOK complex as it is fitness conferring whereas TGGT1_316650 appears dispensable but the complex's binding partner on micronemes remains unknown. RAB5A and RAB5C have been implicated in the biogenesis of micronemes, but their roles during exocytosis have not been explored (Kremer et al., 2013). Understanding how micronemes are recognized may elucidate how cargo specificity is achieved and regulated.”</p><p>TGGT1_306920 is conserved amongst coccidians and shares similar localization to HOOK and FTS. TGGT1_316650 is conserved amongst apicomplexans and more broadly in subsets of other eukaryotic phyla. Given our IP-MS data, HOOK and FTS form a core complex that is either bound to TGGT1_316650 or TGGT1_306920. Given that TGGT1_306920 appears to be important for parasite fitness, based on genome-wide screening data (Sidik, Huet, et al. 2016), we speculate this could function to mediate the linkage to microneme organelles. At this time, we have no additional data to present on 316650 and 306920. Additional biochemical studies will be needed to characterize the stoichiometry of complexes and their function; however, we propose that HOOK and FTS are interacting as previously described in opisthokonts (Bielska et al., 2014, Guo et al., 2016 and Zhang et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The myristoylation data section ended with &quot;additional studies will be required to understand how myristoylation influences CDPK1 activity&quot;. What studies are required to further this understanding? I assume these studies are difficult and that is why they were not part of this outstanding paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of myristoylation is modest during acute phenotypes like egress (see Figure 2H). Moreover there were no significant differences between cWT and cMut that could explain the impact of CDPK1 on microneme secretion, which was the purpose of this study. Further studies would require a phosphoproteomic workup of the cWT and cMut, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the key resource table, in the first column reagent type I suggest you indicate this as <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH strain to make it clear the background strain (I know it is encoded in additional information but the first column should also be clear).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the key resources table to indicate the <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains used are of RH background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few minor comments that could be addressed by modification of the current version of the manuscript.</p><p>Line 290, where authors classify proteins phosphorylated in CDPK1 dependent manner into five groups, it would be helpful to list at least class 1 (five proteins) and class 2 (four proteins) in the text of the results section. Further since in the same paragraph, the authors are also describing figure 3G, it would be helpful if the groups are identified with roman numerals or as class A, B, C, D, and E. Currently, in fig 3G, the three columns (CDPK1 dependent, CDPK1 independent and fitness scores) are also identified as 1, 2 and 3 and these nomenclatures could be confused with the five different classes of putative substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful suggestion. We have renamed the classes of CDPK1 targets using roman numerals I, II, III, IV, and V. We have also listed out the proteins in Class I and Class II in the results section as follows:</p><p>“Class I contains five proteins for which the same phosphorylated site was identified in both the time course and thiophosphorylation experiments and include: TGGT1_227610, TGGT1_221470, TGGT1_235160, TGGT1_273560 (KinesinB), and TGGT1_310060. Class II contains four proteins for which phosphorylated sites identified across both approaches were within 50 amino acid residues of one another and include: TGGT1_289100 (MIC18), TGGT1_309190 (AIP), TGGT1_254870, and TGGT1_259630.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 398, the expansions of the abbreviations FTS and FHIP should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the expansions of the abbreviations for FTS and FHIP:</p><p>“In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and mammals, HOOK proteins have been shown to form dimers and bind Fused Toes (FTS) and FTS and HOOK-interacting protein (FHIP) via a C-terminal region that interacts with vesicular cargo (Christensen et al., 2021; Krämer and Phistry, 1996; Lee et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The HOOK protein shows CDPK1-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites S167, S177, and S189-191. In the discussion section, it would be helpful if the authors can speculate about the importance of these phosphorylated residues on the functioning of HOOK.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to engaging parasite motility, micronemes are positioned at the apical third of the parasite, but after an increase in intracellular Ca_2+_, micronemes rapidly traffic to the apical tip of the parasite. Our results indicate that both CDPK1 kinase activity and HOOK are required for microneme trafficking. Given the association of micronemes with tubulin-based structures such as the cortical microtubules and conoid, activation of trafficking along such structures must be rapid, on the time scale of seconds. Cell-free reconstitution assays generated from opisthokonts indicate that activating adaptors like HOOK are necessary to activate processive dynein trafficking along microtubules in addition to conferring cargo selectivity. In intracellular non-motile parasites, HOOK is expressed and localized to the apical end and cytosol prior to the activation of rapid microneme trafficking, consistent with regulation of HOOK activity. We have included reference to this type of regulation and our expectation that CDPK1 activates the HOOK complex as part of the Discussion:</p><p>“Phosphorylation has been reported to regulate the function of activating adaptors. In HeLa cells, phosphorylation of BICD2 facilitates recruitment of dynein and dynactin (Gallisà-Suñé et al. 2023). Analogously, phosphorylation of JIP1 mediates the switch between kinesin and dynein motility of autophagosomes in murine neurons (Fu et al. 2014). We therefore speculate that phosphorylation of HOOK by CDPK1 may activate the adaptor by promoting its interaction with dynein and dynactin to initiate trafficking of micronemes.”</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. CDPK1 myristoylation. The loss of myristoylation of CDPK1 appears to increase its interaction with ROM4 which also becomes cytosolic instead of localizing to the plasma membrane. As ROM4 is necessary for microneme discharge after proteolysis it would be interesting to investigate the specific relation between CDPK1 and ROM4 and to confirm the interaction by reciprocal IP.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Suggested Revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. CDPK1 myristoylation, Figure 2D. It would be useful to compare the expression of the tagged and complemented (cWT and cMut) CDPK1 with the endogenous expression of the non-tagged and non-complemented gene.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Suggested Revision #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Thiophosphorylation. The authors used the bacterial toxin aerolysin to semi-permeabilize parasite membranes by forming 3-nm pores. Aerolysin affects the membrane integrity, however, the authors demonstrated that CDPK1 is possibly associated with membrane structures (Figure 2E/F). Could it be possible to transiently destabilize the membrane before to treat with KTPγS or ATP? If not, it would be necessary to confirm that aerolysin treatment does not impact myristoylation-dependent subcellular partitioning of CDPK1 before identifying proteins specifically labelled by CDPK1G and not by CDPK1M (Figure 3C).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential Revision #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. IP-MS on HOOK-3xHA parasites. The authors' results suggest that HOOK and FTS form a functional complex implicated in microneme exocytosis. It would be interesting to know if HOOK knockdown can have an effect on FTS expression or localization and reciprocally.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting question, we focused this paper on the discovery of the complex in relation to CDPK1. Understanding the regulation and interaction of the complex components is the focus of ongoing work and will require generation of new strains and additional mass spectrometry. For those reasons we find these experiments fall beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. FTS-Turbo-ID. (Line 443-444) Authors should confirm the interaction of TGGT1_306920 and TGGT1_316650 with the HOOK and FTS proteins, it will give strength to their conclusion. In fact, without confirmation, everything is based on suggestions that were also formulated but not confirmed in humans. The physical existence of this putative complex should be demonstrated by co-IP experiments. In addition, the missing player is a dynein candidate itself, which leaves the model vulnerable. Short of pursuing this experimentally, it should at least be commented on in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Sugegsted Revision #4. Our IP-MS experiments of HOOK-3xHA and FTS-3xHA indicate interactions with HOOK, FTS, TGGT1_316650, and TGGT1_306920. Our FTS-TurboID experiments also suggest an interaction between FTS, HOOK, TGGT1_316650 and TGGT1_306920. Furthermore, our TGGT1_306920 IP-MS data identifies HOOK and FTS, but not TGGT1_316650, suggesting distinct complexes with HOOK and FTS as core components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. MIC2 secretion (Fig 5J). The rep represented by the grey dot with a white outline seems like an outlier result compared to the other 2 reps. Basically, without this rep there at least is a strong trend that there is a difference in secretion without EtOH stimulation. That is what actually would be expected, for constitutive secretion! Please carefully reconsider these data - e.g. check for outlier statistics and/or add reps.</p></disp-quote><p>We present three independent biological replicates, showing a significant difference in microneme secretion following depletion of CDPK1, HOOK, or FTS. It is expected, based on our prior experience, that microneme secretion will vary day to day. However, the expected trend can be observed in all replicates. We are unclear what the reviewer means by constitutive secretion since some low-level of calcium-dependent microneme discharge is expected even in the absence of stimulation, barring BAPTA-AM treatment. Even in the absence of EtOH stimulation (left graph in Fig. 5J), the trend of diminished basal MIC2 release holds when CDPK1, HOOK, or FTS is knocked down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Apical accumulation of micronemes. A similar observation was made upon manipulation of Ferlin1, which is a manuscript on BioRXivs. Since other BioRXiv manuscripts are cited in the presented work, this is an omission.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission and have updated the manuscript accordingly:</p><p>“It therefore appears that the initial round of microneme discharge during egress depends on CDPK1, and only subsequent rounds require the HOOK complex. Indeed, a fraction of micronemes are already found docked at the apical complex prior to the transition from the replicative to the motile stages, and may constitute the first round of microneme exocytosis (Mageswaran et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). Ferlin 1 (FER1) was recently shown to be involved in microneme positioning and overexpression of FER1 was sufficient to initiate an initial round of microneme exocytosis and induce egress (Tagoe et al. 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Concerning the expression of the HOOK protein in Figures 4B, and C, could the author indicate why they performed the IFA after 24h of auxin treatment and the WB after 40h of treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in timing was for technical reasons. Our immunoblots and additional assays such as microneme secretion require more parasites, such that we harvest at the end of the lytic cycle to increase yields. For the IFAs, we perform these at 24 hrs, which allows for depletion and replication, but captures parasites in small vacuoles that show clear localization patterns. Furthermore, our microneme relocalization studies in Figure 6 were also performed after 24 hrs of auxin treatment, yet exhibit a trafficking defect following 24 hr HOOK depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Fig 4H. The color of CDPK1-AID on the left and the HA on the top (HOOK) do correspond but indicate different proteins. Please label HOOK text in teal, not CDPK1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text color of the strain names on 4H to black to avoid confusion with the IFA channel labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I would like to suggest adding the &quot;Key resources tables&quot; in the supplementary data because it makes the materials &amp; methods harder to read.</p></disp-quote><p>The key resources table was included at the beginning of the Materials and Methods section as indicated in eLife’s instructions to the authors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
