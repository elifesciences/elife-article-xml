proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar. Denervation predicts risk of sudden cardiac death in humans. Blocking CSPG signaling restores sympathetic axon outgrowth into the cardiac scar, decreasing arrhythmia susceptibility. Axon growth inhibition by CSPGs can depend on the sulfation status of the glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) side chains. Tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs at the 4th (4S) and 6th (6S) positions of n-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits outgrowth in several types of central neurons, but we don’t know if sulfation is similarly critical during peripheral nerve regeneration. We asked if CSPG sulfation prevented sympathetic axon outgrowth after MI. Reducing 4S with the 4-sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB) enhanced outgrowth of dissociated rat sympathetic neurons over CSPGs. Likewise, reducing 4S with ARSB restored axon outgrowth from mouse sympathetic ganglia co-cultured with cardiac scar tissue. We quantified enzymes responsible for adding and removing sulfation, and found that CHST15 (4S dependent 6-sulfotransferase) was upregulated, and ARSB was downregulated after MI. This suggests a mechanism for production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar. We decreased 4S,6S CS-GAGs in vivo by transient siRNA knockdown of <italic>Chst15</italic> after MI, and found that reducing 4S,6S restored tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive sympathetic nerve fibers in the cardiac scar. Reinnervation reduced isoproterenol induced arrhythmias. Our results suggest that modulating CSPG-sulfation after MI may be a therapeutic target to promote sympathetic nerve regeneration in the cardiac scar and reduce post-MI cardiac arrhythmias.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan</kwd><kwd>sympathetic nerves</kwd><kwd>nerve regeneration</kwd><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL093056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Habecker</surname><given-names>Beth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HL152490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>Matthew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20PRE35210768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>Matthew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1GM11864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sueda</surname><given-names>Shanice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>4,6-Sulfation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans prevents sympathetic nerve regeneration into the infarct after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, and reducing this sulfation promotes nerve regeneration and decreases arrhythmia susceptibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sympathetic denervation following myocardial infarction (MI) is well documented in both animal models and humans, and highly predictive of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boogers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fallavollita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nishisato et al., 2010</xref>). Following an early period of axon degeneration after MI caused by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), sympathetic nerves grow back through undamaged myocardium but do not enter the scar due to the presence of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner and Habecker, 2013</xref>). This heterogeneity in sympathetic innervation increases risk for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herring et al., 2019</xref>). A therapeutic intervention restoring sympathetic innervation in the cardiac scar by modulating CSPGs may improve health outcomes for patients suffering post-MI arrhythmias.</p><p>CSPGs are a diverse family of extracellular matrix proteins modified by chondroitin sulfate (CS) side chains that inhibit nerve regeneration in numerous injury paradigms including MI, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner and Habecker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKeon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Hsieh-Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). CSPGs are heterogeneous but all are composed of a core protein that is covalently linked to repeating disaccharide side chains known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). While some evidence suggests that the CSPG core protein itself plays a role in regulating axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou and Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ughrin et al., 2003</xref>), the primary effect is thought to occur via the post-translational addition of sulfate to GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mencio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Hsieh-Wilson, 2015</xref>). CS-GAGs in scar tissues bind CSPG receptors like PTPσ (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma) on regenerating axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). CSPG sulfation is attached to specific locations of the CS-GAG by sulfotransferase enzymes, yielding unique structures that differentially affect axon outgrowth. Specifically, 4-sulfation (4S) and 6-sulfation (6S) of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosamine are critical regulators of axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). 4S CS-GAGs are produced by the chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase, CHST11, while 4,6-tandem sulfated GAGs (4S,6S) are produced by a 4S-dependent chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase, CHST15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Hsieh-Wilson, 2015</xref>). 4S CS-GAGs can also be removed by an endogenously expressed 4-sulfatase, arylsulfatase-B (ARSB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pearson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

In an effort to better understand how this process may be coordinated, we examined the expression of a key wound healing regulator, Galectin-3, which has also been connected to CSPG sulfation and ARSB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2015</xref>).

We found that the CSPGs present in the cardiac scar after ischemia-reperfusion were enriched with sulfation at the 4 and 6 positions of CS-GAGs, which is often referred to as chondroitin sulfate E (CS-E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Hsieh-Wilson, 2015</xref>). CS-E inhibits the outgrowth of several types of neurons in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2005</xref>), and our data indicate that it also prevents growth of sympathetic axons, since decreasing either 4S or 6S allowed axon regeneration. Nerve regeneration was confirmed by histology and by expression of the neuronal protein TH in cardiac scar tissue. Reinnervation throughout the left ventricle decreased isoproterenol-induced arrhythmias, consistent with previous studies targeting the neuronal CSPG receptor PTPσ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sepe et al., 2022</xref>). We do not fully understand the mechanisms by which reinnervation decreases arrhythmia susceptibility, but reinnervation of borderzone myocytes may play an important role. In addition, therapeutics targeting PTPσ to restore innervation shift the inflammatory response toward a more reparative phenotype, and in some cases decrease infarct size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sepe et al., 2022</xref>). These new data show that targeting CSPGs in the scar to restore innervation decreases arrhythmia susceptibility without altering infarct size. It remains unknown if modulating CSPG sulfation alters the inflammatory response.</p><p>The core protein NG2 is an important source of CSPGs in the cardiac scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian et al., 2014</xref>), and there is evidence that the NG2 core protein can inhibit sensory neurite extension independent of CS sulfation in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou and Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ughrin et al., 2003</xref>). Modulating the cardiac scar is of interest as a strategy to improve outcomes after MI, but removing matrix proteins presents a challenge since the scar plays an important role in maintaining structural integrity. Given the critical role of CSPG sulfation in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Hsieh-Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pearson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2012</xref>), we postulated that this might present an intervention point. While our data indicate that NG2 expression increases following MI, we found that removing or preventing sulfation of CS-GAG chains was sufficient to allow axon regeneration into the cardiac scar. Thus, NG2 prevents sympathetic axon regeneration in the heart exclusively through 4,6-tandem sulfation of CS side chains.</p><p>Increased 4,6-sulfation of CS-GAGs coincided with increased expression of the 4S-dependent 6-sulfotransferase CHST15, which is the final enzyme in the production of CS-E, and depletion of the sulfatase ARSB which removes 4S. These changes in enzyme expression provide a potential mechanism for the shift to highly sulfated GAG side chains after MI. Regulation of these proteins is also linked in the context of TBI and other diseases with a downregulation of ARSB leading to increased CHST15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2015</xref>). Hypoxia reduces ARSB activity, increasing the abundance of 4-sulfated CS-GAGs which enables Galectin-3 mediation of transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we asked if Galectin-3 expression was altered in the heart after ischemia-reperfusion. To our surprise, we found that Galectin-3 increased before changes were observed expression of sulfation-related enzymes. This suggests that increased Galectin-3 may be an early driver of the accumulating highly sulfated CS-GAGs observed by day 7 post-MI.</p><p>The inhibitory effects of CS-E on axon outgrowth in certain neuronal subtypes led many to hypothesize that reducing CHST15 activity would restore nerve growth across CSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). To that end at least one group has even generated a novel small molecule to inhibit CHST15 and promote nerve growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>). However, since no commercially available inhibitor exists to our knowledge, we sought a different method. Targeting <italic>Chst15</italic> gene expression with siRNA decreased 4,6-tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs and allowed nerve regeneration into the cardiac scar. We were inspired to test <italic>chst15</italic> siRNA by a colitis study in mouse showing that siRNA knockdown of <italic>chst15</italic> reduced CS-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). More importantly, <italic>Chst15</italic> siRNA has been tested in a Phase 1 Clinical trial for Crohn’s disease patients with active mucosal lesions, and a Phase I/IIa trial for patients with pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>), and has a good safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, siRNA knockdown of <italic>Chst15</italic> is potentially translatable to large animals and eventually human studies. We treated mice on days 3, 5, and 7 post-MI with siRNA as we wanted to intervene while the cardiac scar was forming. We assessed nerve regeneration into the scar and CSPG sulfation on day 10, which is 3 days after the final injection of siRNA. Three days after the last siRNA injection, CHST15 levels were similar in non-targeting siRNA and <italic>Chst15</italic> siRNA hearts despite a significant reduction in 6S and reinnervation of the infarct in <italic>Chst15</italic> siRNA-treated animals. These data indicate that a transient decrease in CHST15 protein and depletion of CS-GAG sulfation is sufficient to allow nerve restoration in the cardiac scar where NGF is abundant. A limitation of this method is that it cannot rule out a systemic effect of <italic>Chst1</italic>5 siRNA, so we also attempted to use an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) virus to elevate ARSB expression specifically in the heart after MI. However, we were unable to increase ARSB expression in the heart, although the AAV9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) control generated good expression in myocardium. ARSB is an FDA-approved therapeutic (Naglazyme) to treat mucopolysaccharidosis IV disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harmatz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harmatz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muñoz-Rojas et al., 2010</xref>), which may be of use in the therapeutic context of the post-MI heart. Ultimately this work demonstrates the critical nature of 4,6-sulfation of CS-GAGs in preventing reinnervation of the heart after MI and provides two strategies to promote reinnervation by modulating CSPG sulfation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Age and gender-matched male and female mice 12–18 weeks of age were used for myocardial-ischemia reperfusion surgeries, as described below. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) for experiments with dissociated sympathetic neurons. SCG from male and female neonatal rats (P0-P2) were used to generate primary sympathetic neuron cultures. All rats were kept on a 12 hr:12 hr light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.

Briefly, SCG were dissected from neonatal mice and placed into pre-marked tissue culture wells so that ganglia were approximately 1 mm from left ventricle tissue. LV tissue was taken from unoperated control animals or from hearts collected 10–14 days after I/R. Cardiac tissue from a single animal was split in half and cultured with the left or right ganglion from a single animal, this enabled tissue from the same mice to be treated with either vehicle (5% DMSO) or ARSB to remove 4S-CS GAGs. The ganglia and the cardiac tissue were co-cultured inside a Matrigel bubble surrounded by C2 media supplemented with 2 ng/mL NGF to ensure neuron survival and stimulate a basal level of axon outgrowth in all directions. ARSB was added directly to the media (0.6 µg/mL) at the time of plating and again 24 hr later. At 48 hr the explants were imaged by phase microscopy with a Keyence BZ-X microscope.

C2C12 myoblasts were plated on 12-well plates coated with collagen and were transfected with the various targeting and control siRNAs using the Dharmafect transfection reagent (3 µL of Dharmafect reagent per well with 120 nM siRNA). The next day wells were split using Versene (Gibco), one-third of the cells were collected for a 24 hr time point and the other two-thirds were split into two wells for 48 and 72 hr knockdown time points. Cells were processed using an RNA Mini-kit (Qiagen) to purify RNA. One µg of RNA was loaded into the cDNA reaction with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit.

Slides were placed in 2% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr, and then incubated with rabbit anti-TH (1:1000; Millipore: AB1542) and sheep anti-fibrinogen (1:300; BioRad: 4400-8004) overnight. The following day the slides were incubated with Alexa-Fluor IgG-specific antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:1000) for 1.5 hr and rinsed 3 × 10 min in PBS. Background autofluorescence was reduced further with a 30 min incubation in 10 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> (diluted in 50 mM ammonium acetate). Following this, slides were rinsed 3 × 10 min in PBS before mounting in 1:1 glycerol:PBS and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Threshold image analysis of TH staining has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2015</xref>) but briefly, the threshold function in ImageJ was used to generate black and white images discriminating TH + nerves for six sections spanning 200 µm of the infarct/scar or peri-infarct region from each heart.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Kalyanam Shivkumar as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hanjun Wang (Reviewer #2); Pradeep S Rajendran (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of reviews:</p><p>Intramyocardial sympathetic nerve remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with lethal ventricular arrhythmias and progression to heart failure. After an MI, there is sympathetic denervation of the infarct scar and hyperinnervation of the infarct border zone. This heterogeneity of innervation has been shown to contribute to electrical disorder and arrhythmogenesis. One mechanism for the lack of nerve regeneration in the infarct scar following MI has previously been shown to be the presence of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). In the present manuscript by Blake et al., the investigators show that MI leads to increased sulfation of CSPGs in the cardiac scar. The investigators subsequently demonstrate that reducing sulfation with a sulfatase, arylsulfatase B (ARSB), promotes sympathetic neurite growth in vitro and ex vivo in a co-culture system. Furthermore, molecular studies showed that there was an alteration in the expression of enzymes involved in the sulfation of CSPGs, specifically increased expression of a sulfotransferase, Chst15. Knockdown of the gene for Chst15 with a silencing RNA restored sympathetic innervation of the infarct scar, as shown by immunohistochemistry, and also reduced post-MI arrhythmias induced by isoproterenol in vivo, as shown by ECG.</p><p>Collectively, the reviewers were impressed with the depth and scope of the experiments presented here. Specifically, the manuscript's technical strengths were its logical progression from the authors' previous work on CSPGs in infarct scar, its finding of a novel CSPG sulfation pathway in MI, and its complementary mix of functional, histological and molecular studies to support its conclusions. The main weaknesses brought up by reviewers included a lack of complete rigor in some minor aspects of experimental design and a lack of an electrophysiological mechanism as to how the RNAi treatment led to decreased arrhythmic susceptibility.</p><p>MI with its subsequent ventricular arrhythmias is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and represents an area of great therapeutic need. This work is important in highlighting the role of neural-myocardial interactions after MI and offering a potential pathway to target in preventing post-MI sudden cardiac death.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper needs to be edited for clarity and revised based on the input provided by the reviewers. No new experiments were sought by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Would consider treating scar tissue explants only with ARSB rather than the entire co-culture.</p><p>2. Would consider characterizing surviving myocardium and immune/inflammatory cells within the scar, as CSPG has been shown to be pro-inflammatory after neural injury (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matbio.2018.04.010).</p><p>– If the siRNA treatment causes changes in scar/surviving myocardium structure, inflammatory milieu, or even vascularization of the scar, these would all be more plausible functional pathways for the observed reduction of PVCs than the presence of more nerves within an electrically and mechanically dead zone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential contribution of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) 4, 6 sulfation in the regulation of sympathetic nerve regeneration after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The authors found that I/R-induced myocardial injury led to increased 4, 6 sulfation of CSPGs in mouse cardiac scar, which was associated with upregulated CHST15 (4S dependent 6-sulfotransferase) and downregulated 4-sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB). These molecular data suggest a mechanism for the production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar tissue. Furthermore, the authors attempted to alter tandem sulfated 4s, 6s CS-GAGs in vivo by intravenous injection of Chst15 siRNA at the early recovery time window of I/R (i.e. before scar formation). They found that this treatment restored sympathetic reinnervation in the scar tissue and reduced cardiac arrhythmia induced by isoproterenol. Overall, this study is a logical follow-up to previous work from this group that had demonstrated that sympathetic nerves grow back through undamaged myocardium but do not enter the scar due to the presence of CSPGs. The paper presents a complementary mix of function, histological and molecular studies to provide mechanistic insights into disease progression. Results are well presented, between the primary and supplementary files, and the data support the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1B-D, could IHC be used to support these findings?</p><p>– Figure 3B – since the piece of the myocardium is just at the edge of the image, it should be highlighted with an arrow, or the image enlarge to show more of the myocardium. The outgrowth is also hard to see. Consider using arrows, or fixing/staining to improve visibility. This aspect of the data is not as convincing.</p><p>– Figure 4 – this would be strengthened by the addition of expression data from qPCR.</p><p>– Figure 7 – how can one exclude the potential role of systemic Chst15 targeting by the siRNA?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In the introduction, a comparison is made between β-adrenergic blockade and sympathectomy to restore sympathetic innervation by modulating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. However, the mechanisms through which these approaches reduce arrhythmias are completely different and the comparison is somewhat confusing.</p><p>– While the arrhythmia susceptibility data is compelling, it would be useful to have cardiac electrophysiology data (e.g., optical mapping) in the presence of sympathetic nerve stimulation to show that the regenerated nerves are functional. In addition, cardiac electrophysiology data would help show where the ectopy is being generated from in the non-targeting control vs the siChst15 animals (i.e., scar border zone vs remote area).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78387.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper needs to be edited for clarity and revised based on the input provided by the reviewers.

First, ganglia co-cultured with control heart tissue were treated with ARSB and exhibited no difference in growth compared to ganglia grown with control heart tissue in the absence of ARSB. Second, ARSB did not change the growth of axons extending away from heart tissue explants where they are not in contact with cardiac CSPGs. If ganglionic/glial CSPGs were affecting outgrowth then ARSB should have increased axon growth in those conditions.

We used therapeutics targeting the CSPG receptor PTP σ to restore innervation to the cardiac scar, and observed a shift in the immune response from pro-inflammatory toward reparative phenotypes. Therapeutics that caused a greater change in the immune response also decreased infarct size. This study targets CSPGs in the scar rather than their receptors on neurons, but it might similarly affect the immune response. Vascularization was unaltered by treatments that restored innervation.</p><p>Note: We do not yet have a DOI for the accepted JACC-BTS manuscript, but we expect it will be posted to their preprint server very soon so that we can add the DOI to the reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Figure 1B-D, could IHC be used to support these findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously used the pan-CSPG antibody CS56 to show that CSPGs are selectively enriched in the cardiac scar (Gardner 2013 reference).

In addition, cardiac electrophysiology data would help show where the ectopy is being generated from in the non-targeting control vs the siChst15 animals (i.e., scar border zone vs remote area).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that mapping data would be very interesting and would shed light on the mechanisms of arrhythmia suppression. However, that was not the purpose of this study. We hope to do mapping studies in the future to address the issues you identified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
